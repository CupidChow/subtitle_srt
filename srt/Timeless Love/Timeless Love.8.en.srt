Actually, it's nothing.

I need your opinion.

What do you think?

They only gave you suggestions.

the reason why HA is successful

00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,710
I told you

348
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,520
not to hit on my students.

349
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,870
Why are you still acting like this?

350
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,870
This has nothing to do with Baoling.

351
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
I want to sing.

352
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,880
I like to sing.

353
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,390
And everyone thinks that

354
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,390
I'm a good singer.

355
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,640
Why can't you

356
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,310
support me?

357
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:25,790
Yun,

358
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,630
Lian Ruoshen is talented.

359
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,950
If he works hard,

360
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,270
it's not difficult for him to go big.

361
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,990
You see, you also said if.

362
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,510
There are conditions.

363
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,390
Pei Xiaoyun,

364
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,560
why can't you trust me for once?

365
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,270
Then why can't you

366
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,470
listen to me for once?

367
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,230
Do you know how many

368
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,080
good singers are there

369
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,910
in the music school every year?

370
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,990
How many of them can be popular?

371
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,870
Why do you think you will

372
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,150
win the jackpot?

373
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:53,830
Let me tell you,

374
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,150
stop thinking about

375
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,790
getting everything for nothing.

376
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,670
Keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away.

377
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,720
Let’s go.

378
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:01,510
Go to class with me.

379
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,550
Yun, is your hand okay?

380
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,390
Why are you still standing there? Go after her!

381
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,270
But…

382
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,350
Go!

383
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:35,750
Nemesis. The nemesis of my career.

384
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,510
Why it’s Pei Xiaoyun?

385
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,200
Dr. Xie.

386
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,030
Please sit down.

387
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,870
Have we met before?

388
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,190
No, I don’t think so.

389
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,110
In my case,

390
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,190
how long will it take

391
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,110
to get better?

392
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,310
Are you sure?

393
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,790
If you want to cure it

394
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,910
in a short time,

395
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,270
exposure therapy is the best choice.

396
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,150
But it’s psychologically overwhelming

397
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,510
for the patient.

398
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,030
The risk you face

399
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,150
is correspondingly high.

400
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:16,110
How does it work?

401
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,430
Exposure therapy

402
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,310
requires you to enter

403
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,510
your most fearful situation.

404
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,910
Even if you are scared,

405
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:24,070
I will continue to

406
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,110
stimulate you repeatedly.

407
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,190
If you can get through it,

408
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,750
and realize that your worst fear

409
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,900
doesn’t happen.

410
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,660
Your fear and anxiety

411
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,910
will diminish accordingly.

412
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,150
The stakes are high, of course.

413
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,870
It requires strength.

414
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,430
The safest way

415
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,510
is to undergo systematic

416
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,350
desensitization.

417
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,590
But this approach requires more

418
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,710
time and energy.

419
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:50,070
It may take years

420
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,550
or maybe just a few months.

421
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,990
Let’s employ the systematic

422
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,270
desensitization method.

423
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:55,830
Her safety is more important.

424
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,710
I've wasted a lot of time.

425
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,380
I'd like to try exposure therapy.

426
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,020
Dian.

427
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:04,550
Let me try.

428
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,190
I'll be with you.

429
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,230
Don't be afraid. I'm outside.

430
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,790
Okay.

431
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,180
It’s almost our turn.

432
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:07,700
I... I can't do these moves well.

433
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,580
It's okay. Don't worry.

434
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,990
We still have time.

435
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:11,830
Let's do it again.

436
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:12,540
Okay.

437
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,910
[Mother]

438
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:23,510
Chengcheng.

439
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,180
I think I’m near the theater.

440
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,830
But

441
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,230
I... I seem to...

442
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,140
I can't find the way.

443
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,310
There are no road signs around here.

444
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,790
I don't speak English.

445
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,500
Why don't you pick me up?

446
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,490
[Mother]

447
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,750
Your mother has passed away.

448
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,430
Believe in her.

449
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,070
No treatment is painless.

450
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,540
She must pull through on her own.

451
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,540
Wait a little longer.

452
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,860
Dian.

453
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:27,940
Dian.

454
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,260
Chengcheng.

455
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,100
Dian.

456
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,980
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

457
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,660
Don't be afraid.

458
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,830
Feeling better?

459
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,540
I want to continue.

460
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,140
Doctor.

461
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,580
Is there any other treatment?

462
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,580
Actually...

463
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,590
Desensitization therapy is behavioral therapy.

464
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,220
Cheng Feng's problem is

465
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,380
basically

466
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,740
rooted in the subconscious mind.

467
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,260
To solve the problem,

468
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,580
it is best to employ hypnotherapy.

469
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,300
Before, you refused to talk about it.

470
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,780
Hypnotherapy couldn’t work.

471
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,500
But now

472
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,620
you should reconsider it.

473
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,220
I want to keep trying.

474
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:23,820
It’s okay.

475
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,620
But not today.

476
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,110
Your current state is not stable.

477
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,980
Cheng Feng, try to open your heart.

478
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,300
Accept your imperfections.

479
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:35,820
Look at them.

480
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,260
They are also a part of your life.

481
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:38,820
When you

482
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,700
reconcile with them,

483
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,100
your symptoms will disappear.

484
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,540
Otherwise,

485
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,660
even if you are cured of claustrophobia,

486
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,790
you'll have other symptoms.

487
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,140
It's okay. I'm always here.

488
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,300
I'm here with you.

489
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,020
Have you had enough?

490
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,220
Did you ask me out

491
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,620
to play the game of

492
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,620
changing seats?

493
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,660
I'm still angry.

494
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,740
I'm not in the mood.

495
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,020
Yun.

496
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:37,580
I'm sorry.

497
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,610
It was my fault.

498
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,140
I really didn't mean it.

499
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,940
If you're angry, you can hit me.

500
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,620
Let me hit myself.

501
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,580
What are you doing?

502
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,660
You're not angry anymore, are you?

503
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,620
I'm not mad at you for pushing me.

504
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,410
It's because you signed a contract with Baoling

505
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,420
behind my back..

506
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,100
Lian Ruoshen.

507
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,940
I know you like singing.

508
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,100
Your enthusiasm can’t guarantee anything.

509
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,020
Not all things that you like

510
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,210
can become the career

511
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,220
you pursue.

512
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,460
Especially,

513
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,580
you’re a student now.

514
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,690
Students should study hard.

515
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:16,860
Let's not talk about this today,

516
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,090
okay?

517
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,380
Let me take you to the infirmary

518
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,060
to take care of your injury, okay?

519
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,900
This problem has not been solved.

520
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,980

Can't you just listen to me for once?

523
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,260
Keep your feet on the ground

524
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,420
and not get carried away.

525
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,380
You have to think about it.

If you wish to study,

527
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,500
I’ll help you to

528

achieve a higher score.

529
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:34,700
Enough, Pei Xiaoyun.

530
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,540
Why do you keep talking about

531
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,540
study, study, study?

532
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,650
You are only two years older than me.

533
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,620
I feel like there’s a three-generation gap.

534
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,140
Why can't you just support

535
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,810
my singing career? Is it hard?

536
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,100
Yeah. Have you thought whether you’re

537
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,450
suitable for the entertainment industry?

538
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,140
Think about your rampant personality.

539
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,970
Can you enter the entertainment industry?

540
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,780
The entertainment industry is complicated.

541
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,300
You have to play a double game

542

when you speak to different people.

543
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,570
Can you do that?

544
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,180
You just look down on me.

545
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,180
In your opinion, I'm worthless.

546
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,170
Wait a minute.

547
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,500
Here you are.

548
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,770
I don’t take back things that

549
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,970
I’ve given away.

Don't be nervous on stage.

553
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,180
Do you remember the moves

554

Yes.

556

If I forget the next move,

557
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,290
I’ll just repeat the previous one.

558

Good girl.

559
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,860
What if someone booed you

from the stage?

561
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,740
Plug my ears.

562
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,740

There’ll be many audiences.

What if you had stage fright?

567

I'll think of them as

the sunny dolls you made for me.

00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,380
decide for himself.

586

Who is Yun

587

Lian Ruoshen's own business.

But anyone

597
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,180
can see that

598
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,810
he cares a lot about Yun's opinion.

599
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,820
So, there is nothing wrong with

600
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,260
Yun who expressed her opinion.

601

you really need to talk to Yun.

I would like to talk to her.

605

But she hasn’t given me a chance.

She doesn’t reply.

but to turn to you.

I can nothing about it.

Not to change her opinion.

614
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,180
All you have to do is to ask her out.

615
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,570
And just sit there.

616
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,250
No need to talk.

617

I...

618
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,140
I need to talk some sense into her.

619
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:42,340
Analyze the pros and cons.

620
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,090
Chengcheng, you didn’t see.

so high and mighty with Zhou Yao.

So arrogant.

624
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,810
If it weren't because the talents

625
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,130
were poached,

626
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,250
I wouldn't be in such a hurry to find new ones.

627

I showed you before.

631

Whether I can fight back

632
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,090
is all depends on him.

633
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,530
So, Chengcheng,

634
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,410
please ask Yun out for me.

635
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,210
I can do it for you.

636
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,050
But you have to promise me that

637
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,850
you two don’t argue in front of me.

638

I'm so devoted to him.

00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:31,850
Ungrateful.

642
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,810
So stubborn.

643
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,290
There is no way to convince her.

644
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,530
Pig-headed.

645
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,010
Why does she think I can't sing?

646
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,250
I went on the trending topic.

647
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,690
Went on the trending topic is not becoming popular.

648
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,450
He doesn’t realize that

649
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,450
he is just a background.

650
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,930
Even though I was a background,

651
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:51,090
I’m talented in singing.

652
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,410
Talents may not lead to success.

653
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,210
It’s boring to drink by yourself.

654

Stop singing!

How can you solve it?

673
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,010
She wouldn't give me a question like this.

674
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,290
Dian, you're hurting the single people again.

Do you want to be you

680
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,810
or be someone according to others’ opinions?

681
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:19,730
It depends on you.

I’m not trying to fool him.

00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,370
He likes to sing.

688

And he has talent.

689
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,370
If singing is his dream,

690
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,690
what right do we have

691
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,810
to stop him?

692
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,360
Yes, I have no right.

693
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,410
But as his teacher,

694
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,050
when he can't see the big picture,

695
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,400
when he is making wrong choices,

696
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,250
I’m obliged

697
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,160
to guide him.

698
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,970
It’s not wrong to follow his dream.

699
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,650
What is wrong is ignorance.

700
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:04,200
Yun.

701
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,930
Nowadays,

702
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,450
If he wants to pursue his dream,

703
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,290
every industry is complicated.

704
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,050
Yes, the entertainment industry is more so.

705
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:16,010
But there are infinite possibilities.

706
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,720
Lian Ruoshen is young

707
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:18,840
and talented.

708
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,920
The cost of trial and error is low.

709
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,360
The prime of a singer is only a few years.

710
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,240
If he misses it,

711
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,970
there is no second chance.

712
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:26,370
But do you know that

713
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,520
he’s also in his prime years to learn,

714
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,130
to improve.

715
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,210
Many people were lost in their youth.

716
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,290
They wasted their time

717
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
and regreted it.

718
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,200
And many people made the wrong choice

719
00:36:37,290 --> 00:36:38,170
when they were young.

720
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:39,640
No matter how much time they spend,

721
00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:40,600
there is no second chance.

722
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,040
He has fallen behind.

723
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,000
You want him to take a risk.

724
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,640
When there’s no way out,

725
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,930
when he knows he's wrong,

726
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,690
other people have families and careers.

727
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,130
You can’t ask him

728
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,130
to start all over again.

729
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,210
So,

730
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,520
you don’t believe in my ability.

731
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,320
So,

732
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,890
you're just doing it for yourself.

733
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:03,770
You're trying to buy me off.

734
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,360
I don't want them.

735
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,970
Pei Xiaoyun.

736
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,640
You are a fuddy-duddy.

737
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,730
You don't accept new things.

738
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,490
How dare you talk about me?

739
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,450
Saying it’s for Lian Ruoshen,

740
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,040
you are just doing it for yourself.

741
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:18,880
When Zhou Yao was on a trending topic,

742
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,610
you used Chengcheng to

743
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,250
benefit yourself, didn’t you?

744
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,040
Pei Xiaoyun.

745
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,650
Are you on a little bit of vodka?

746
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Why? Am I onto something?

747
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,440
You don’t dare to admit it.

748
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:31,730
You are a

749
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,250
shrewd person.

750
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,570
An exquisite individualist.

751
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:34,840
You...

752
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,360
You two.

753
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,210
♫ I don't care how you feel ♫

754
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,680
♫ I don't care what you think ♫

755
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,730
♫ I want to express myself ♫

756
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,080
Damn you, you can sing

757
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,440
but don’t grab my leg.

758
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,640
Let go of my leg.

759
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm going to pick up Chengcheng.

760
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,680
Bye.

761
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,370
Hos before bros.

762
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,840
Dian, where are you going?

763
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,560
Let go of me!

764
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,040
Baoling,

765
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,080
I'm sorry.

766
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,400
I won't say that about you again.

767
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,360
Yun, I was wrong.

768
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,640
I shouldn't have called you old-fashioned

769
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,560
and stubborn.

770
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,840
You're the cutest.

771
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,040
It's all my fault.

772
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,160
I shouldn't have given these things to you.

773
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,640
You don't like them.

774
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,280
I'm going to

775
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,040
throw them away.

776
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,570
Don't.

777
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,680
I like them.

778
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,560
Then prove it to me.

779
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,690
Piece of cake.

780
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,640
This color looks good on you.

781
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,100
[Jiang Dian]

782
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,960
When does it end?

783
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,480
Almost.

784
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:01,990
Can I help you?

785
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:03,190
After they finish drinking,

786
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,190
call a taxi to send them home.

787
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,000
Okay, don't worry.

788
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,680
Thank you.

789
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,360
Chengcheng.

790
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,320
Chengcheng.

791
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,790
Let go.

792
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:21,790
Don't be

793
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,480
so distant to me.

794
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,270
Chengcheng, I...

795
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,200
You let go

796
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:33,040
or should I make you?

797
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,280
Bro, this is between Chengcheng and me.

798
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,840
It has nothing to do with you, right?

799
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:37,600
She's my girlfriend.

800
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:38,720
What do you think?
