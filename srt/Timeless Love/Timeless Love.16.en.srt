Why are you doing this to me?

I don't care if you don't love me.

I've found someone who loves me.

Exactly how much do you hate me
to even do this to me?

No matter what you think of me,

I would not compromise on this matter.

173
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,700
-Bye bye.
-Bye bye.

174
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,480
Chengcheng.

175
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,150
Why did you tell DK

176
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,030
of my secret?

177
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,540
Didn't you promise me that

178
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,210
you would never tell anyone?

179
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,930
You've been keeping the secret for me.

180
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,790
Why did you suddenly
tell someone else today?

181
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:23,550
Why?

182
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,540
Didn't I warn you

183
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,430
not to show up in front of me

184
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,840
and bother me again?

185
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:30,980
But look what you did?

186
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,110
You pushed the landlord to set me up.

187
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,640
Zhou Yao.

188
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,540
Do you think I have no temper

189
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,650
because I wasn't hard on you?

190
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,650
I didn't say it before

191
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,100
because I think that

192
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,470
it's shameful to

193
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,490
be betrayed by someone

194
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,220
who I didn't see clearly.

195
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,700
But I'm also glad that

196
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,190
you betrayed me,

197
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,610
because I never loved you.

198
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,380
You don't have to feel wronged either.

199
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,450
After all, you were just

200
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,600
trying to use me.

201
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,150
Chengcheng,

202
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,520
you're lying.

203
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,910
I don't believe you never loved me.

204
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,290
Let go.

205
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,110
That's enough.

206
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,490
You think you can just go
after hitting me?

207
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,530
Guess the punch wasn't enough for you.

208
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,220
Yeah.

209
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,810
I didn't want to fight with you

210
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,180
because I thought you're just a kid.

211
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,010
Do you really think that

212
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,020
I dare not hit you?

213
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,120
If you ever lay your hands on him,

214
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,960
I won't just slap you on the face then.

215
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,870
Oh, no.

216
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,380
This is such a big misunderstanding.

217
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:12,990
How did you get this wound?

218
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,860
I'm asking you something.
What are you thinking about?

219
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,410
Stop it now.

220
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,220
Why did you go to him?

221
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,470
Why did you go looking for him?

222
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,790
Am I not enough for you?

223
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,020
It's useless to

224
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,630
talk with you right now.

225
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,780
Let go of me.

226
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,310
So?

227
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,420
So you're going to him?

228
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,220
Answer me.

229
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,370
Let go of me, Jiang Dian.

230
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,110
No, I won't let go, Cheng.

231
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,390
Why did you let him hug you

232
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,850
but not let me do the same?

233
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:23,650
Cheng.

234
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,980
What am I supposed to do

235
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,650
to make you like me and me only?

236
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,590
I can't live without you.

237
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,950
Cheng.

238
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,420
I'm sorry.

239
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,830
It's all my fault.

240
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,340
I'm too jealous.

241
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,110
I'm not usually like this.

242
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,300
You know, Cheng.

243
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,380
You're feeling jealous.

244
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,710
I can understand that.

245
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,340
But Dian,

246
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,770
it's bad that you handle the feelings

247
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,440
like this.

248
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,170
It's irrational and hurtful.

249
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:53,980
Cheng.

250
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,740
Please don't go.

251
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:57,720
I'm really sorry.

252
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,050
Please forgive me.

253
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:04,410
My mom knows we're together,

254
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,750
and she's trying to push me

255
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,510
to break up with you.

256
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:12,420
If you leave me too,

257
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,839
I really don't have anywhere else to go.

258
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,540
Dian.

259
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,820
Baoling said that

260
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,450
Cheng didn't agree to
choreograph for Zhou Yao.

261
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,990
So this whole thing is

262
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:38,730
[Lian Ruoshen]

263
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:36,220
because that I didn't find out the truth

264
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,360
and told you the wrong information.

265
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,330
I'm sorry.

266
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,350
Why are you washing off your makeup
by yourself?

267
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,290
Bie.

268
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,900
Why hasn't Dian replied my message?

269
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,620
Is he really angry?

270
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,360
How did you get into this situation?

271
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,240
Where's your makeup artist?

272
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,410
He's got a bad taste.

273
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,810
I'm going to stop using him.

274
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:13,840
Do you think that

275
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,820
Dian would forgive me?

276
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,040
I think...

277
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,540
I think no.

278
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:22,370
Do you believe it?

279
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,190
You always do such kind of

280
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,160
brainless things.

281
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,650
Which time did he not forgive you?

282
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,630
You've got a point.

283
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:32,320
Hey, you.

284
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,810
Why did you call me brainless?

285
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,090
Don't do this.

286
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,260
It hurts.

287
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,780
Am I interrupting you?

288
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,690
Why are you smiling?

289
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,140
Trying to disgust me?

290
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:52,650
Nothing.

291
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,320
I just think it's a bit funny.

292
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,560
I'm not trying to disgust you.

293
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,080
I just find you disgusting.

294
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:01,530
You...

295
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,510
-What did you say?
-Lian Ruoshen.

296
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,530
Say it again if you dare.

297
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,230
Take it easy.

298
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,810
-Let go.
-Take it easy.

299
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,180
I have to teach him a lesson today.

300
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,150
I've been annoyed with him for a long time.

301
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,350
Lian Ruoshen.

302
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,870
Although you're some kind of star now,

303
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,890
you shouldn't be so arrogant.

304
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm still your senior,

305
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,500
after all.

306
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,000
Can't we just get along?

307
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,460
You've been managing the official account well recently.

308
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,220
Are all the supplies ready?

309
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,890
It's all ready. Look.

310
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,740
You are a bullshit senior.

311
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,450
I don't want to get along with you.

312
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,460
Lian Ruoshen.

313
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,580
Show a little respect.

314
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,860
You're just a bit more famous recently.

315
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,010
What makes you so arrogant?

316
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,280
When Zhou Yao became famous,

317
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,120
you were just a nobody.

318
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:41,880
You are a big fan of his.

319
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,950
It's none of your business.

320
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,430
You...

321
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:46,370
You don't know what happened,

322
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,640
so don't get involved, OK?

323
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,790
We weren't targeting you just now,

324
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,300
don't be so...

325
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm Okay.

326
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,740
It was just an usual conflict
between colleagues.

327
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,410
Just forget whatever you heard.

328
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,550
You are just too nice.

329
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,280
You're treating them as colleagues,

330
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,850
and don't want to argue with them,

331
00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:07,880
not only do they think of you
as an opponent,

332
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,420
but also target you everywhere.

333
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,660
How did I target him?

334
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,980
Don't play the innocent

335
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,380
and let women stand up for you.

336
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,620
That's weak.

337
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,670
If you have the guts,
you should fight me one-on-one.

338
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,260
How could you call him weak?

339
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,400
Lian Ruoshen.

340
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:19,940
If you bully Dian again,

341
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:21,350
I'll take pictures of you doing this

342
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,270
and post on the Internet.

343
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,900
Do it then. You think I'm afraid of you?

344
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:24,650
OK.

345
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,650
You think you got more people
so you can bully us?

346
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,900
Let me see.

347
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,810
Who is bullying my people?

348
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,660
Who dares to bully your people?

349
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,880
Why did you take my stuff?

350
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,590
Without the consent of the parties,

351
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,350
audio and video recordings are illegal.

352
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,380
It's common sense, girl.

353
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,320
It doesn't matter
if she doesn't understand.

354
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,220
But don't you know that

355
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,420
it's forbidden to take pictures
and video in the company?

356
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,420
Delete the useless
pictures and recordings.

357
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,650
Got it. I'll delete it right away.

358
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,840
That's enough, Dai Baoling.

359
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,730
Don't go too far.

360
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,760
I know you don't like us.

361
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,740
Don't you just want to be the No.1
in this company?

362
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,100
Come and get it.

363
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:19,120
You don't have to bother to
change the subject.

364
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,190
I'm too tired to play with you here.

365
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:22,290
I'm telling you,

366
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,660
if I ever find you

367
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:26,250

368
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,230
I wouldn't go easy on you anymore.

369
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,600
And

370
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,150
I'm not only good with words.

371
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,510
Baoling, I deleted it all.

372
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,490
You look good.

373
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,830
But the person you like

374
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,370
-is not so good.
-You...

375

376
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:51,810
Aren't you afraid I'll tell the boss?

377
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,670

Baoling.

380

You were so cool just now.

381
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,850
I'm so impressed

382
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,210
by you just now,

383
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,660
just like this statue-respect.

384
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,070
Don't say too much.

385
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,230
Why?

386
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,770
It was a great success.

387
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,950
I have to say it.

388
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,490
Right, Baoling?

389
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:18,690
Success?

390
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:20,980
What success?

391
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,800
Are you referring to the fact that
they got a video of you hitting people

392
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:24,720
and was about to get the whole world
against you,

393
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,880
or the possibility that you might get
scolded by the boss?

Lian Ruoshen.

395
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,000
How old are you?

396
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,190
Why are you still acting like a child

397
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,510
and can't control your own emotions?

398
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,230
Do you know what the consequences would be

399
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,460
if I don't show up today?

400
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,570
They picked on me,

401
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,370
how could we endure this?

402
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,910
You know they were doing this on purpose,

403
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,890
and still, you went to help them do it.

404
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,380
Lian Ruoshen.

405
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,610
Do you know

406
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,370
how many years they've been in this industry,

407
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,340
and in how many ways

408
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:52,350
they could ruin your reputation?

409
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,110
I am your agent,

410
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,730
but I can't be on your side every second.

411
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,300
So don't provoke them in the future.

412
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,940
You are now on the rise of your career.

413
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,520
You can't have any rumors standing
in the way.

414
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,370
Otherwise, you will lose.

415
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,010
Where are you going?

416
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,390
I know I was wrong.

417
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,410
To talk to the boss

418
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,170
and clean up your mess.

419
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,080
What's wrong with you and Cheng Feng?

420
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,990
-Being...
-Being what?

421
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,320
It's personal.

422
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,210
Do I need to report everything to you?

423
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:42,860
Zhou Yao.

424
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,060
I'm not qualified

425
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:46,650
and I have no right to ask

426
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,840
about your personal affairs.

427
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,600
But if your personal emotions

428
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,430
affect the work,

429
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,800
then it would be something to do with me.

430
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:55,800
Did I treat you

431
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,940
too kind before

432
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:59,100
and made you think I have no temper?

433
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,970
Don't you forget that

434
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,170
when you came to me

435
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,670
and asked for my help to start your career,

436
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,400
you didn't divide your work with
personal affairs so clearly.

437
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,820
You should know better than anyone else

438
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,060
of how I treat you.

439
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,960
Don't destroy yourself

440
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:21,500
because of irrelevant people.

441
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,040
Cheng Feng, why did you

442
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,140
appear in front of him again?

443
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,540
Hey, let's meet.

444
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,670
Why did you let him hug you

445
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,380
but not let me do the same?

446
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,230
Cheng.

447
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:18,470
What am I supposed to do

448
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,230
to make you like me and me only?

449
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,120
That's enough.

450
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,100
I sent you a message earlier
and you didn't reply.

451
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,760
I thought...

452
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,210
Thought I didn't care about you anymore?

453
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,760
I just want you to care
a little more about me.

454
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:01,810
According to what you said,

455
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,790
there's a good chance that your boyfriend

456
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,550
has paranoid personality disorder.

457
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,800
Sensitive, suspicious, stubborn, jealous,

458
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,120
and insecurity

459
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:11,270
are all common manifestations
of this kind of disease.

460
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,100
Then how could we treat it?

461
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,040
It is not easy to treat.

462
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,250
His situation is not the same as yours.

463
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,190
You just could get over with something.

464
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,590
Once that trouble is solved,
you would become completely fine.

465
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,000
But his problem

466
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,320
is originated from the emotional harm

467
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,600
from his original family.

468
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:29,230
He is lack of love

469
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,280
and sense of security.

470
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,560
So he lost

471
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,880
the fulcrum in the emotional world.

472
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,370
People's emotional needs

473
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,780
are a state of self-balance.

474
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,720
If you lack of one side of it,

475
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,950
you will need the other side

476
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,960
to fill in.

477
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,100
Especially when the loss is from

478
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,780
the ties of kinship in his family.

479
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,270
When this part of the emotion

480
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,420
has not been awakened,

481
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,790
people would not notice the need for it.

482
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,900
But in the process of growing up,

483
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,710
the greater the lack of emotion,

484
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,380
the lower the tolerance of

485
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,610
imperfect for emotion would be.

486
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,590
It would often appear as paranoid.

487
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:31,920
This paranoia

488
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,380
might hurt someone else,

489
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,960
or even himself.

490
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,030
Judging from the current situation,

491
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,610
he is very likely to

492
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:40,150
lose control of his emotions
when he gets irritated.

493
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,600
My suggestion is that

494
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,970
you could try to

495
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:44,330
give him enough security.

496
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,300
Of course,

497
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,100
to be the fulcrum

498
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,860
of someone else's emotional world

499
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,450
is not an easy thing to do.

It's hard for a genius like him

510
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,220
to accept the fact that
he has mental problems.

511
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,630
So

512
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:39,950
before he has enough preparation

513
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,180
to face the fact,

514
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,850
I suggest you to not let him know.

515
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,520
Cheng.

516
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,390
Why do you have my cellphone?

517
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,790
I connected my location

518
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,110
to your cellphone,

519
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:28,260
so that

520
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,190
you can always know where I am.

[Surveillance]

522
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:34,550
I was just curious.

523
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,560
I didn't mean that...

524
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,010
I mean this.

525
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,130
Dian.

526
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,990
You can't lose me in the future.

[Mo Xing's...]

The princess is a cat.

532
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:10,540
Not bad.

533
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,430
This brew-master looks like me.

534
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,190
What's the rush?

535
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:18,730
You scared me to death, boy.

536
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,410
Here's the thing.

537
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,170
Our last experiment

538
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,490
was very successful, right?

539
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,290
So there's a big company that

540
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,750
wants to work with us this time

541
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,430
to solve the problem of streamline
resistance of automobile fuselage.

542
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,100
It's highly paid.

543
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,210
I thought you said you were short of money.

544
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,230
I hope that

545
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,940
you can seize this opportunity.

546
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,610
But...

547
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:41,690
But what?

548
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,070
This project is not difficult,

549
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,920
but the schedule is tight
and the tasks are heavy.

550
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,290
I hope you can put your heart and soul into it.

551
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,220
Your mother

552
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,110
also talked with me last time.

553
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,170
Don't let me stand...

554
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,820
That's enough.

555
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,310
...in your way of going abroad to study.

556
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,140
Nobody can make me do

557
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,290
what I don't want to do.

558
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,900
I got no problem with this cooperation.

559
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:00,570
It's just that I have one condition.

560
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:01,890
Say it.

561
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,260
I need 50% of the payment in advance.

562
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,850
What percent?

563
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,830
Fifty percent.

564
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,630
Why are you in such a hurry?

565
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,620
Fifty percent

566
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,810
is really a little difficult.

567
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,700
But I'll try my best to make it work.

customized this cello abroad

577
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,180
especially for you.

578
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,800
Take a look. See if you like it.

579
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,180
I remember

580
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,150
you once told me that

581
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,690
you like their cello.

00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:06,920
Dad knows that

585
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,200
you're feeling upset

586
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,220
because I was always busy with my work

587
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,580
and had no time to take care of you.

588
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,340
But I didn't have a choice.

589
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,100
I was really too busy.

590
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,000
Do you think I don't miss you?

591
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,670
But what can I do?

Come on.

599
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,240
Have a taste.

600
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,970
There're mango and steak,

00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,980
all your favorite.

602
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,560

00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,710
Just get to the point.

Dian.

606
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,830
Your mother is

607
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:56,420
trying to divorce with me recently.

608
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,180
But I don't want to.

609
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,250
I want to keep our family.

Will you help me persuade her?

00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:06,670
Do you know what you're talking about?

613
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:10,190
Family?

614
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,090
Do you know that

615
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,870
I'm allergic to mango

616
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,270
and I almost died because of this
when I was a kid?

617
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,170
Do you remember that

618
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:20,000
it was you and mom

619
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:21,370
who forced me to stop playing the cello?

620
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,210
You keep saying that you are my father,

621
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,580
and you want to keep this family.

622
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,290
But with what?

623
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,530
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

624
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,930
Dian.

625
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:30,740
I didn't take good care of you,
and I'm sorry.

626
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:32,190
But I promise that

627
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,940
in the future...

628
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,860
There is no future.

629
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,890
Because I got no expectation

630
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,730
for the future anymore.

631
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,760
If that's all

632
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,950
you want to say,

633
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,090
I have nothing to talk about with you.

634
00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:49,610
I know you have

635
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,800
got a new girlfriend

636
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,210
called Cheng Feng.

637
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:57,580
What do you mean?

638
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:58,940
Dian,

639
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,390
I know that

640
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,710
your mother

641
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,340
would never let you be with her.

642
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,230
But if you take my side,

643
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,420
I can help you.

644
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,580
You are the only son I have.

645
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,159
Everything I have right now

646
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,040
would be yours in the future.

647
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,590
Are you sure I'm the only child you have?

648
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:20,370
Dian.

649
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,530
You have grown up.

650
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,949
I want to have a good talk with you.

651
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:26,880
When I started my business,

652
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,290
me and your mother

653
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,699
left you some shares in the company.

654
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,889
Because you were young at that time,

655
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,510
so we put a part of it

656
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:34,050
under your mother's name.

657
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,949
But now that you've grown up,

658
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,409
I

659
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,250
hope that

660
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,650
you could take back those shares.

661
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:41,889
Then keep it under your name.

662
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,730
If you are willing to help me,

663
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,400
I will make sure it's worth it.

664
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,760
I've grown up.

665
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:55,170
I make my own choice.

666
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,340
I don't want to be involved in
you two's problems.

667
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:01,070
And I don't want you to
meddle in my affairs either.

668
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,370
Dian, Dian.

669
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,720
Go ahead.

670
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:21,920
How much do you need?

671
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,560
Are you always so self-righteous?

672
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,880
I heard from Dian that

673
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,280
you locked him up.

674
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,210
If it weren't for you,

675
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,220
how could Dian become like this?

676
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,200
Who do you think you are to
talk to me like that?

677
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,090
He's my boyfriend now,

678
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,370
and my future husband.

679
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,950
How do you think about that?

680
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,840
Although you are his mother,

681
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,690
you don't have any right

682
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,620
to imprison him.

683
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,720
If you try this again,

684
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,040
I'll call the police directly.

685
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,570
Don't you pretend in front of me.

686
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:53,030
You know what you've done

687
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,260
with Zhou Yao abroad

688
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,990
in the last few years.

689
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,510
You got Dian in your left hand,

690
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,180
and while Zhou Yao in your right hand.

691
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,500

693
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,040
Why do you think you are qualified

694
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,930
to talk about Dian's future?

695
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,610
Because he'd rather be with me,

696
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,590
than get along with you.

697

If it weren't for you,

698
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:18,990
he would not threaten me with suicide.

699

Suicide?

700
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,740
Have you ever thought that

701

What kind of tricks
do you want to play again?

703
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:33,860
If you really love him,

704
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,670
then you should leave him.

705
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,260
Don't stand in his way

708

is the future heir of Jiang's Group.

Do you think you deserve him?

710

Neither of us

have the right to decide his future.

712

He can do whatever he wants.

or inherit the family business,

715
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,710
you should stop interfering with him.

716
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,120
He's my son.

717
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,190
I raised him carefully for so many years,

718
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,330
just to make him

719
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,000
become the heir of Jiang's Group.

720
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,770
Anyone who stands in his way

721
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:08,580
would be removed.

It doesn't matter what you think of me.

But you can't decide for Dian.

724

What Dian wants and needs is family.

725
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,420
If you really love Dian,

726
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,090
you should be like a mother.

727

You're home late.

Don't worry about the house.

We will be very happy, won't we?

What's the matter?

Why do you say this all of a sudden?

757
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,790
Because I feel very happy now.
