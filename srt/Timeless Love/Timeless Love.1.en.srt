At a young age,

I fell in love with someone.

7
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,729
She doesn’t like smiling.

8
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,450
But when she smiles,

9
00:01:58,330 --> 00:01:59,430
she is pretty.

10
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,770
She likes to stay motionless.

But when she moves,

12
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,389
she is so charming.

13
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,670
She looks indifferent.

14
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,150
But she is soft and mild in her heart.

15
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,740
She is a woman like cat.

16
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,290
She breaks into my world,

17
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,490
getting rid of my loneliness

18
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,420

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,060
Although you are narcissistic

178
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,770
and such a pain,

179
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:16,510
I do like the fact that

180
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,390
you can drink a lot.

181
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,010
Lian Ruoshen,

182
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:24,650
well,

183
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,540
you are not intelligent,

184
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,350
you have low EQ,

185
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,630
and you are not that handsome.

186
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,980
But your messy hair

187
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:36,570
looks great to me.

188
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:40,930
Lu Biebie.

189
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,930
You’re the first person

190
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,270
to compliment on my hair.

191
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,520
You have to be my sworn brother.

192
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,850
Of course. Sure!

193
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,050
You can’t come?

194
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:01,350
Cheng,

195
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,900
the maintenance guy said he can’t come to fix the lock today.

196
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,310
He promised me yesterday.

197
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:06,450
Yet he just broke his words.

198
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,460
He’s so unreliable.

199
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:08,690
It’s okay.

200
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,230
You can let me try it.

201
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,010
You know how to fix locks?

202
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:14,410
I have done it before.

203
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:18,200
Cheng, how about letting him try?

204
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,960
Or we can’t lock the door today.

205
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,690
It’s up to you.

206
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,570
You don’t need my permission.

207
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,220
From today on,

208
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:36,900
you will be

209
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,980
my sworn brother!

210
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,300
Brother!

211
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,790
Brother!

212
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,580
My big brother!

213
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,680
My younger brother!

214
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,820
Okay.

215
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,820
You are great.

216
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,970
Thank you so much.

217
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,079
Give him the repair fee.

218
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:12,930
It’s okay.

219
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,220
Boss. Boss.

220
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,190
Boss. Boss.

221
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,640
I’ve asked Ms. Yun here

222
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,340
to cheer you up!

223
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,560
What the heck?

224
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,880
Ms. Yun?

225
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,470
Wait for me!

226
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,170
Yun,

227
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:03,930
are you here to read?

228
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:04,940
What a coincidence!

229
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,840
Why are you two blushing like this?

230
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,050
This question is so difficult.

231
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:14,840
I’ve been confused.

232
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:16,770
What about you?

233
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,060
I’m fine.

234
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,170
I’ve been kind of unwell lately.

235
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,870
Lian Ruoshen!

236
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,350
Lu Bie!

237
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,270
How dare you

238
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,550
come here drinking in the day

239
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,520
instead of studying!

240
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:36,790
Do you still regard me

241
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
as your teacher?

242
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,680
Yun.

243
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:47,750
Your bang is cool

244
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:48,810
and messy.

245
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,350
You look like a heroic character.

246
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,030
Do not change the topic!

247
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,170
And I’ve told you many times!

248
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,410
You can’t call me Yun.

249
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,310
Call me Ms. Pei! I’m your teacher.

250
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:00,990
Although I’m just

251
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,000
your teaching assistant now,

252
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:03,460
you should also respect me.

253
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,080
Do not give me any troubles.

254
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,060
Write a report no less than 3,000 characters to reflect on yourself.

255
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,650
No, 4,000 characters.

256
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,070
You are just a postgraduate student

257
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,570
who is one or two years older than me.

258
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:17,800
But you made me to call you teacher.

259
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,960
You are abusing your power

260
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,700
and oppressing us.

261
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,820
You… You are talking nonsense.

262
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,810
No less than 6,000 characters.

263
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,440
Come to my office
and give me the report tomorrow.

264
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,700
Why are you here too, Jiang Dian?

265
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,900
Did Lian Ruoshen bring you here?

266
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,500
No.

267
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,220
I was doing homework with him.

268
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,450
Why did you drink alcohol too?

269
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,770
You should take self-study more seriously.

270
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,280
You can’t spoil him like this again.

271
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,640
His performance is poor.

272
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,270
It took him three years to pass the College Entrance Exam.

273
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,940
He has to graduate successfully.

274
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,020
Okay, Ms. Pei. I got it.

275
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,870
Chengcheng.

276
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,680
Are they gone?

277
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,930
No one

278
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,070
in our class behaves normally.

279
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,650
Especially that Lian Ruoshen.

280
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,020
Without Jiang Dian,

281
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:14,470
it wouldn’t only take three years,

282
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,530
he wouldn’t have been enrolled

283
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,630
even he had been given 30 years.

284
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:18,870
Yet he is not attending to his study.

285
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,060
If he keeps doing like this,

286
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,130
how could he graduate successfully?

287
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:24,060
If there are more people

288
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,690
who are good at study, good-looking

289
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,100
and behave well

290
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,200
like Jiang Dian,

291
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,610
it would be so much better.

292
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,880
Pei Xiaoyun,

293
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,860
you have a bad eyesight.

294
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,180
Let’s talk about something else.

295
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:46,850
We haven’t been together for a long time.

296
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,390
Let’s hang out tonight.

297
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,370
I don’t want to.

298
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:52,840
Chengcheng.

299
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:56,230
You can’t stay here all day.

300
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,850
It’s rare that Baoling is available today.

301
00:20:58,470 --> 00:20:59,660
Let’s hang out.

302
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,630
Alright?

303
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,130
Are you sure that

304
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,100
you found me three guys

305
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,200
instead of three monkeys?

306
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,960
They all look like apes.

307
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,410
I’m not looking for comedy actors.

308
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,420
You still need to work in free time.

309
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,840
You tell me. I’m so busy.

310
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,790
It’s been long since we last came here.

311
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,040
There are some hot waiters.

312
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,900
Chengcheng.

313
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,410
Look at the bartender over there.

314
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,640
His eyes are laying all over on you.

315
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,840
You’re so charming.

316
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,820
Share some charm with me.

317
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,580
There are no guys in my world.

318
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,810
Not even a man.

319
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:58,920
I have no interest in

320
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,330
younger guys.

321
00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:02,580
Then,

322
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,120
those cute younger guys

323
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,130
are going to be heart-broken.

324
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:08,030
Are you sure

325
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,660
they like me

326
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,140
instead of fooling with me?

327
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,070
Whatever it is,

328
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,880
you should grab the chance

329
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,940
when you meet a handsome guy.

330
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,730
Chengcheng, look at you.

331
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,580
You look so beautiful when you dance.

332
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,810
And

333
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,610
you even won so many international awards.

334
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,240
I just don’t understand

335
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,310
why you can’t continue.

336
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,800
I’m confused.

337
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,740
Yun, how much have you had?

338
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,150
Why are you starting to talk nonsense?

339
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:36,850
I didn’t drink anything.

340
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,690
She’s drunk.

341
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,830
I’ll take her back first.

342
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:40,810
What about you?

343
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,830
I will spend some more time here.

344
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,710
Okay, I know you are a good drinker.

345
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,990
But don’t drink too much.

346
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,670
No worry.

347
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,600
Let’s go.

348
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,610
Bye. We’re leaving.

349
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,460
Are you done?

350
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,830
Kid,

351
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,420
it’s impolite to

352
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,180
stare at a woman already drunk

353
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,110
like that.

354
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,800
Let’s drink more.

355
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,600
How much?

356
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,010
You tell me.

357
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:35,340
What are you looking at?

358
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,260
Is she that attractive?

359
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,720
Drink with yourself.

360
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,390
What the heck?

361
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,750
Beauty,

362
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,810
have fun with me.

363
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,600
I’ll take you home.

364
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,210
Let go!

365
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,680
It hurts!

366
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:18,940
Just wait and see.

367
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,370
Are you okay?

368
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:26,250
Thanks.

369
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:33,420
Can you let go of me?

370
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,650
Just leave me here.
