1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,533
<i>The second country we're visiting is...</i>

3
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,700
<i>Iceland.</i>

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:24,200
Goodness!

5
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,467
That's amazing.

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,934
<i>It's the best soup.</i>

7
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,633
<i>Boil with all your heart.</i>

8
00:00:28,734 --> 00:00:30,700
<i>"The customer is king."</i>

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,600
<i>We can prepare it together.</i>

10
00:00:32,934 --> 00:00:34,767
<i>People who worked as servers</i>

11
00:00:34,867 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>can join the kitchen.</i>

12
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,467
<i>And those in the kitchen...</i>

13
00:00:37,767 --> 00:00:38,667
Great.

14
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:40,600
Chef Choi.

15
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,433
One, two, three. Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

16
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:49,834
- Ttukbaegi!
- Let's go.

17
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:52,367
- Let's open the restaurant.
- Okay.

18
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:58,633
Customers? Now?

19
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,266
We can't have them now.

20
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,500
- Six.
- In the room.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,900
Min-si. We're in big trouble.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,433
- What is it?
- It's bad.

23
00:02:27,467 --> 00:02:29,567
Why are they laughing outside?

24
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,567
What did they order?

25
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,000
He's here.

26
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,066
Be careful.

27
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:38,200
What's happening?

28
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:39,967
You okay?

29
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
They're from America.

30
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:43,567
They go to Johns Hopkins.

31
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:50,200
They go to warm places on spring break.

32
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,433
- Come with me.
- Okay.

33
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,133
- You write it down.
- Okay.

34
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,767
- One dish each.
- Yes.

35
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,600
- Green plum tea.
- Yes.

36
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,600
Four menus.

37
00:03:37,266 --> 00:03:38,133
Okay.

38
00:03:38,934 --> 00:03:40,667
- Is it as per their seat?
- What?

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,734
Four green plum teas.

40
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,700
- We have new orders.
- All right.

41
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,233
Make one of each.

42
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,333
Goodness.

43
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,100
Spicy and original beef galbijjim.

44
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,200
Spicy beef galbijjim too?

45
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,867
And kkori-gomtang.

46
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,200
I should start with dolsot-bibimbap.

47
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,133
Kkori-gomtang.

48
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:01,900
Okay.

49
00:04:06,467 --> 00:04:08,567
It's either Woo-shik throws a strike

50
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,900
or a wild-pitch.

51
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,967
This is a lot.

52
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:30,400
Well, this is okay.

53
00:04:41,066 --> 00:04:42,433
Kkori-gomtang, dolsot...

54
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,333
Should I put it on first?

55
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,500
I'll put it on.

56
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:51,100
- Well done.
- Thank you.

57
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,367
You know what?

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
- You have to fry those too.
- Sure.

59
00:05:57,533 --> 00:05:58,900
- Fritters.
- Fritters, yes.

60
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,433
- Hello.
- Hello.

61
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,567
Hello. Are you Korean?

62
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:33,500
Yes.

63
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:35,533
- So you live here?
- Yes.

64
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:37,934
Aren't you cold?

65
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,533
- I'm not.
- You're not?

66
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,066
It's warm at my place.

67
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:42,967
- And...
- Yes?

68
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,734
We have kkori-gomtang?

69
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,200
Kkori-gomtang...

70
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,166
This is done.

71
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,633
We're in trouble.

72
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,333
We're in trouble.

73
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,934
Hold on. What do we do?

74
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:18,367
Can you lower the heat?

75
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:19,300
I'll lower it.

76
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Is this on? I have to turn it on?

77
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,700
There is a thermometer on the right.

78
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,066
What's the temperature now?

79
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:54,333
It's 165 degree Celcius now.

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,433
Good. Fry the fritters again.

81
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,367
Okay.

82
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:06,867
Four pieces.

83
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,934
- You doing okay?
- Yes.

84
00:08:26,834 --> 00:08:28,800
- We have new orders.
- Here you go.

85
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,734
More orders?

86
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,533
Yes. One dolsot-bibimbap.

87
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,734
One beef galbijjim.

88
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
Another bibimbap.

89
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:35,767
Make spicy beef galbijjim first.

90
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:39,133
You should finish the first orders.
Take your time.

91
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,033
Okay.

92
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

93
00:08:46,934 --> 00:08:48,667
Let's serve beef galbijjim first.

94
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,567
Okay.

95
00:08:56,266 --> 00:08:57,734
What about the fritters?

96
00:08:58,567 --> 00:08:59,400
The fritters...

97
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,333
Hold on.

98
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,367
It's burning.

99
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:04,367
No, wait.

100
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,533
- It's burning.
- No, wait.

101
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,900
Get steamed rice.

102
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,967
Work on the fries.

103
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,200
Please get the rice.

104
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:20,734
Am I allowed to be here?

105
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,200
- Fritters are done.
- Okay.

106
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:25,667
And where could...

107
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
The dolsot-bibimbap is almost done.

108
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:32,367
We should serve kimchi too.

109
00:09:32,433 --> 00:09:34,166
Be quiet. It's there.

110
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,266
- Get out.
- Get out?

111
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:37,333
Beef galbijjim is served.

112
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,533
- It's beef galbijjim.
- Get out.

113
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:44,567
Why is the heat so low?

114
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,533
- Be careful.
- Okay.

115
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,333
Dolsot-bibimbap.

116
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,300
Bibimbap is done.

117
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,133
We serve kkakdugi outside.

118
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
One, two, three.

119
00:10:06,834 --> 00:10:08,166
Which table? Table One?

120
00:10:08,266 --> 00:10:09,233
Table One, yes.

121
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,533
Get ready with another one.

122
00:10:16,233 --> 00:10:18,734
- Dried laver.
- Here's the spoon.

123
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,800
- Kkakdugi.
- Right.

124
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,400
Let's go.

125
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,700
Tongs to share the food.

126
00:11:06,467 --> 00:11:07,934
We're very serious.

127
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,734
I have to set up another pot.

128
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:24,467
What do I do now?

129
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:30,133
- Can you mince garlic?
- I don't know.

130
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,533
We have to mince it.

131
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,500
Do I peel them?

132
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,000
We have to mince them all. But later.

133
00:12:34,066 --> 00:12:35,500
Let's finish this first.

134
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:38,066
You are doing great.

135
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,667
You're doing great.

136
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,166
This mushroom and carrot...

137
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:47,700
Does it matter which one goes first?

138
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:48,667
Doesn't matter.

139
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,400
The middle one is orange anyway.

140
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:10,166
Kkori-gomtang doesn't get boiled quickly.

141
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:12,200
- Is the heat too low?
- I think so.

142
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,900
The group of six people...
They seem very hungry.

143
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,934
The table for six people...

144
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,066
Beef galbijjim and kkori-gomtang...

145
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,600
Is spicy beef galbijjim served yet?

146
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,667
Not yet.

147
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:23,967
We can serve it now.

148
00:13:24,033 --> 00:13:25,300
I have to scoop rice?

149
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,000
- Yes.
- Right, scoop rice.

150
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:29,433
Give me kkori-gomtang as well.

151
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,066
Kkori-gomtang isn't boiling.

152
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,567
Wait a minute.

153
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:50,100
Okay, thank you.

154
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,200
We are almost done. All menus are served.

155
00:13:56,934 --> 00:13:58,734
Red chilies and green chilies.
I chopped them.

156
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,200
Okay. Good job.

157
00:14:07,066 --> 00:14:09,266
Red chilies and green chilies.
I chopped them.

158
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,400
You prepared them for this already.

159
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:15,834
Did you scoop the rice?

160
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,734
- Yes, rice is over there.
- Okay.

161
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,567
Is kkori-gomtang boiling?

162
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:41,367
Yes, it's boiling.

163
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,900
- I'll take it out.
- Okay.

164
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:57,433
Customers are rushing in.

165
00:14:57,867 --> 00:14:58,700
What do we do?

166
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,600
We're in trouble. What do I do?

167
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,000
I think we got 8 more.

168
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,934
This place is so cute.

169
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:11,567
Customers are rushing in.

170
00:16:12,033 --> 00:16:13,400
What do we do?

171
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,266
I think we got eight more.

172
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,233
Red chilies and green chilies.
I chopped them.

173
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,133
What?

174
00:16:32,433 --> 00:16:33,600
The rice is served.

175
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:34,800
No rice for kkori-gomtang?

176
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,200
Nobody scooped rice for it.

177
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:37,400
I'll do it.

178
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:39,667
- Give it to me when it's ready.
- Okay.

179
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,500
Here's the rice for kkori-gomtang.

180
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,367
Here you go.

181
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,767
One kkori-gomtang and
one spicy beef galbijjim.

182
00:18:09,867 --> 00:18:12,600
One kkori-gomtang and
one spicy beef galbijjim.

183
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,133
- Guys.
- Yes.

184
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,567
- You're doing great.
- Okay.

185
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,100
It's for the group room.

186
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,867
- One spicy beef galbijjim.
- One kkori-gomtang.

187
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:21,967
Is this a new order?

188
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:24,333
Yes. Table Two, and this for the group.

189
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,734
And there will be seven more.

190
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:18,400
Beautiful tableware.
It's not something we see every day.

191
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,667
Goodness, I know.

192
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,667
Hey, there is a new order.

193
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,033
Goodness.

194
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:29,200
We have new customers.

195
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,533
The restaurant is full.

196
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,400
Oh, my.

197
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,100
We got another beef galbijjim.

198
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:41,467
How much rice have we got?
I'll scoop all the rice first.

199
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,000
- One, two...
- Why is there so little rice?

200
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,567
I made a small amount just in case.

201
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:48,533
- Why did you do that?
- I was going to make more.

202
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,800
I can quickly cook some more.

203
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,667
Gosh, we're in big trouble.

204
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,133
I can make more rice.

205
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,867
It won't take long.

206
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,433
How many minutes more?

207
00:20:43,066 --> 00:20:46,066
A few more minutes. No sizzling sound yet.

208
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,033
It's done.

209
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,000
Next...

210
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,367
- What do we do with rice?
- I just put it in the cooker.

211
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,400
- You did?
- Yes.

212
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,033
What do we do with rice?

213
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,233
I just put it in the cooker.

214
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,133
- You did?
- Yes.

215
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,567
Did you scoop the rice?

216
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:20,533
We must put the fritters on top.
Those here.

217
00:21:20,633 --> 00:21:21,500
All right.

218
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:24,834
Let's see.

219
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,300
Where?

220
00:21:27,367 --> 00:21:28,734
- Table One.
- Table One.

221
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,800
- Table One.
- Okay.

222
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:32,033
- Here's bibimbap.
- I'll take it from here.

223
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,934
- All set.
- Just press this.

224
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:35,934
Press the bell.

225
00:21:36,834 --> 00:21:38,667
Dolsot-bibimbap, beef galbijjim.

226
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:40,867
Kkori-gomtang, spicy beef galbijjim.

227
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,667
Right. Dolsot-bibimbap.

228
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,433
- Dolsot-bibimbap for you?
- Yes.

229
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,700
We will share it.

230
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,734
- You will?
- Sure.

231
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
- Let me put it here.
- Thank you.

232
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:57,667
Thank you. Let's eat.

233
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,767
Gosh.

234
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:08,667
This tastes so good.

235
00:22:08,767 --> 00:22:09,600
It's good.

236
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,667
- Is it?
- Yes.

237
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,000
Oh, nice.

238
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,166
It's good.

239
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:19,867
- This is delicious.
- Yes.

240
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,300
This is so good.

241
00:22:38,467 --> 00:22:39,433
Oh, my gosh.

242
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:45,734
We are so lucky.

243
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,100
Kkori-gomtang.

244
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,300
Kkori-gomtang.

245
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,700
- Kkori-gomtang
- Okay, nice.

246
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:33,633
Do you see the painting at the back?

247
00:23:33,734 --> 00:23:36,100
The horse looks like it's from Iceland.

248
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,066
You're right.

249
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,834
<i>The tigers are wearing Icelandic clothes.</i>

250
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,166
Two cultures are mixed well here.

251
00:24:00,233 --> 00:24:01,300
Right.

252
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,400
They even hung up
a wool sweater with accessories.

253
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:06,633
You're right.

254
00:24:13,033 --> 00:24:16,700
I see shoes made of Icelandic wool.

255
00:24:17,066 --> 00:24:18,567
That's so cute.

256
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,000
It looks like two different worlds
are mixed together.

257
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,900
I like it here. It's beautiful.

258
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:27,166
- We have a similar look again.
- Right.

259
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:07,166
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

260
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,633
- Spicy beef galbijjim...
- Yes?

261
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,266
Make that two.

262
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:14,633
- The group ordered it.
- Okay.

263
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,867
So think of it as two portions.

264
00:25:26,934 --> 00:25:27,900
Should I fry it?

265
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,767
- Please fry them.
- Okay.

266
00:25:29,834 --> 00:25:31,266
Please? Okay.

267
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,367
- How many pieces?
- Two.

268
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,367
No, four.

269
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:37,767
Four pieces, okay.

270
00:25:40,133 --> 00:25:42,400
Kkori-gomtang will be served first.

271
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,433
We have to speed up.

272
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,700
Yes, I'm done.

273
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,734
Will spicy beef galbijjim be done soon?

274
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,867
Yes.

275
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:53,066
- You can serve kkori-gomtang now.
- Yes, two bowls.

276
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,567
- Here.
- I should scoop the rice.

277
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,533
- That comes with rice, yes?
- Yes.

278
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:01,667
But these people
didn't bring back the trays.

279
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,066
Don't call us that.

280
00:26:05,767 --> 00:26:07,533
Can you hold it for a second?

281
00:26:13,133 --> 00:26:14,367
Rice is ready.

282
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:17,400
- This first.
- Kkori-gomtang for Table Two.

283
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,333
Yes. He's working on it right now.

284
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,533
- Give it to me.
- Okay, hold on.

285
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,800
Please put two vegetable fritters here.

286
00:26:34,266 --> 00:26:35,100
Give it to me.

287
00:27:04,033 --> 00:27:04,934
- Guys.
- Yes.

288
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,834
- You're doing great.
- All right.

289
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,166
One kkori-gomtang, one beef galbijjim.

290
00:28:56,934 --> 00:28:58,667
What do we have to make next?

291
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:04,900
One more kkori-gomtang for the group.

292
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,367
One more kkori-gomtang for the group.

293
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,400
It's being boiled right now.

294
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,367
We'll serve kkori-gomtang first.

295
00:29:16,433 --> 00:29:17,967
Kkori-gomtang first, okay.

296
00:29:20,033 --> 00:29:21,834
Here comes kkori-gomtang.

297
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:26,934
The food came fast.

298
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,300
- Is this for Table Three?
- Yes.

299
00:29:59,367 --> 00:30:00,834
It's served with rice, so...

300
00:30:00,934 --> 00:30:01,800
I'm on it.

301
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,033
- Serve both at a time?
- Yes.

302
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,266
And this.

303
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:07,300
We can serve three at a time.

304
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,100
Spicy beef galbijjim
for Table Four is ready.

305
00:30:24,166 --> 00:30:25,467
Another dish is ready.

306
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,033
This is for Table Four.

307
00:30:27,233 --> 00:30:28,300
It's done already?

308
00:30:28,367 --> 00:30:29,934
Yes, he was working on it.

309
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,467
Goodness.

310
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,600
Do I have to mix them all?

311
00:30:59,667 --> 00:31:00,734
- Yes.
- I see.

312
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:13,233
- This is tasty.
- It's very nice.

313
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,900
What is this?

314
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:20,133
I think it's a type of potato. It's fried.

315
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:24,333
This is really good.

316
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,934
I agree. This is so good.

317
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,300
The rice here is so good.

318
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:36,867
Put it in the soup and use the spoon.

319
00:31:36,934 --> 00:31:37,967
All of it?

320
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:40,200
The soup is really good.

321
00:31:49,066 --> 00:31:50,333
This is very good.

322
00:32:00,667 --> 00:32:02,633
I don't really like rice.

323
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,233
But this is so good.

324
00:32:13,967 --> 00:32:15,367
This is good.

325
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,934
Do I eat it separately or with something?

326
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,200
Have it with rice.

327
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:22,467
Do I put the rice?

328
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:23,433
Nice.

329
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:25,133
Really?

330
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,834
It's a bit small.

331
00:32:37,934 --> 00:32:40,200
- Bibimbap is quite spicy.
- Right.

332
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,734
But this goes well with this.

333
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:47,800
I want to try it too.

334
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:50,066
I'm here to try all the foods.

335
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,533
I can feel the sea from here.

336
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,367
Right.

337
00:33:08,033 --> 00:33:10,500
But you tried it at least.

338
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,333
The rice is...

339
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,133
The rice...

340
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,033
No more rice.

341
00:33:27,734 --> 00:33:29,233
We're out of rice.

342
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,867
- No rice?
- We're out of it.

343
00:33:31,533 --> 00:33:32,700
We're in trouble.

344
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:34,567
- What are we out of?
- Rice.

345
00:33:34,633 --> 00:33:35,700
- No rice?
- No rice.

346
00:33:35,767 --> 00:33:37,133
I'm making rice.

347
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,400
It's enough for two people.

348
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:45,000
Who told you to cook that little?

349
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,066
I'm so sorry!

350
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,433
My goodness.

351
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:54,233
I think you can open it now.

352
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,834
- It's still cooking.
- Right.

353
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,333
Rice is ready.

354
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,533
It's done now.

355
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,767
Gosh, it's done.

356
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
We can scoop rice.

357
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:19,133
Serve it with this.

358
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,767
- Serve them together?
- Yes.

359
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,133
Here's rice.

360
00:34:25,734 --> 00:34:27,533
- Make two bibimbaps together.
- Okay.

361
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,667
We need one more bowl of rice.

362
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:41,133
One more rice? Okay.

363
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:50,033
- Here.
- Thanks.

364
00:34:59,133 --> 00:35:00,600
You're doing great.

365
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:02,400
Right. We're doing great.

366
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:05,600
Is gomtang for Table Five served?

367
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:06,767
No, not yet.

368
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:24,300
<i>Kkori-gomtang </i>is on the stove.
<i>Bibimbap </i>is being cooked.

369
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,433
Min-si, the dolsot...

370
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,734
- Yes?
- We need to speed up.

371
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,700
Okay.

372
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:32,300
We're almost there.

373
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,300
Gosh, this is no joke.

374
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,867
I didn't expect so many customers today.

375
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,533
- I know.
- Seriously.

376
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:53,533
Two dolsot-bibimbap.

377
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,200
Kkori-gomtang will be ready
in a minute too.

378
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,400
Kkori-gomtang.

379
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,066
Jeez.

380
00:36:04,133 --> 00:36:05,533
We worked so hard.

381
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,867
- Min-si.
- Yes?

382
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,900
Give me a high five.

383
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:10,500
Sounds good. My gosh.

384
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:13,900
Excellent job.

385
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:15,567
You did very well, Min-si.

386
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:18,133
You're the best, Chef Choi.

387
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,367
Chef Choi's successful debut.

388
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,066
You're so good at this.

389
00:36:25,734 --> 00:36:27,233
- You...
- You're the best.

390
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,266
You must have been practicing.

391
00:36:32,667 --> 00:36:34,100
I did practice a lot.

392
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:41,433
Bibimbap?

393
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:43,233
Dolsot-bibimbap.

394
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,800
Now I want your food.
I'm always like this.

395
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,834
Let's try each other's food.

396
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:07,100
Thank you.

397
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,867
With the meat.

398
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,800
This tastes so good.

399
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,934
Yes, this is it.

400
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,367
- Nice.
- I know.

401
00:38:53,533 --> 00:38:54,900
This is a bit like...

402
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,400
This is kimchi but in a form of radish.

403
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,834
This is good. It's a bit like the roots.

404
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,734
Now I don't know how to eat this.

405
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,100
Use your hands.

406
00:39:21,166 --> 00:39:23,200
I'm dipping the meat in the sauce.

407
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,100
It goes well with the mustard sauce.

408
00:39:45,367 --> 00:39:48,333
The meat and the sauce
go really well together.

409
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:55,433
This is so good.

410
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,066
This is so good.

411
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,000
Yes.

412
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,633
I really love seaweed.

413
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm very happy with my food.

414
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:25,734
It's good.

415
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,233
Wow, I didn't know they could give more.

416
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,033
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

417
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:02,200
I didn't want to eat the rest without it.

418
00:41:21,133 --> 00:41:23,200
Finally, the last piece of seaweed.

419
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,400
1 yuzu tea, please.

420
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,900
We have two more dessert orders.

421
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,567
What? Which table?

422
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:36,967
The group in the room.

423
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,066
Nice.

424
00:44:18,367 --> 00:44:20,734
This looks like that popcorn.

425
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
- Like fried rice snacks.
- A little.

426
00:44:22,867 --> 00:44:25,200
It's like oatmeal.

427
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:28,066
- This is good.
- It's savory.

428
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,166
Okay.

429
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,734
What? When did those dishes come?

430
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,934
Let me do it.

431
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,433
Goodness!

432
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,500
- Dishes...
- Now...

433
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,066
Let's just put them here.

434
00:44:58,133 --> 00:45:00,266
The dishwasher doesn't really work.

435
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:02,033
So I'll wash the dishes.

436
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,633
Gosh.

437
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,900
We have to buy more beef ribs.

438
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:07,567
How much kkori-gomtang is left?

439
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:09,133
About 6 or 7 portions.

440
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,767
- 6 or 7 portions?
- Yes.

441
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,533
We have to prepare everything again.

442
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,600
Everything? Even the meal prep?

443
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,633
Yes. We're running low.

444
00:46:23,734 --> 00:46:25,367
We shouldn't be taking a break.

445
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:27,233
We should go grocery shopping.

446
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,667
For grocery shopping,

447
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:33,433
how do you want to do it?
Do you want to go?

448
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,133
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

449
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,066
Let's make a list.

450
00:46:37,133 --> 00:46:38,567
I need mushrooms.

451
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:42,233
Mushrooms, sesame seeds, laver, ribs,
zucchini, spinach, bean sprouts,

452
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,266
and green onions.

453
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:44,633
Good job.

454
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:45,567
Thank you.

455
00:46:52,367 --> 00:46:53,400
Seaweed!

456
00:46:53,467 --> 00:46:55,000
- What?
- What?

457
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:56,867
We need seaweed too!

458
00:46:56,934 --> 00:46:58,467
- Seaweed.
- I wrote it down.

459
00:47:02,734 --> 00:47:04,633
I don't know what just happened.

460
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,133
For dinner hours...

461
00:47:06,834 --> 00:47:08,100
We're in big trouble.

462
00:47:08,166 --> 00:47:09,233
Goodness.

463
00:47:10,867 --> 00:47:12,166
<i>It's hectic, isn't it?</i>

464
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:13,133
<i>It is.</i>

465
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,667
<i>I don't know if I'm in Iceland</i>

466
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:17,667
when I'm in the kitchen.

467
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,367
All you see is the stove.

468
00:47:19,767 --> 00:47:22,333
But I'm glad there are so many customers.

469
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Right.

470
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:25,767
Look at the mountains.

471
00:47:26,033 --> 00:47:28,066
- Yes, I can see.
- Goodness.

472
00:47:28,133 --> 00:47:28,967
<i>My gosh.</i>

473
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:31,133
<i>That looks fantastic.</i>

474
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,867
It feels like we're in Iceland now.

475
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:18,133
- Oh.
- Goodness.

476
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,233
So now...

477
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:46,500
We have to start prepping right away.

478
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:49,600
We have to repeat what we did yesterday.

479
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,000
What's going on?

480
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:58,400
Are they lining up?

481
00:48:58,967 --> 00:49:00,767
Our restaurant is so popular.

482
00:49:00,834 --> 00:49:02,867
We are dead tonight for sure.

483
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,033
People are lining up outside.

484
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,233
- Really?
- Yes.

485
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,233
There's a line?

486
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:10,033
- Yes!
- There are over ten people.

487
00:49:10,967 --> 00:49:11,800
Really?

488
00:49:20,266 --> 00:49:21,667
We open at six.

489
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,433
If ten people order one dish each...

490
00:49:33,867 --> 00:49:36,767
Please wear masks.
We will start as we wash our hands.

491
00:49:36,834 --> 00:49:37,867
I washed mine.

492
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:39,300
- Where is...
- All right.

493
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:40,667
...my mask?

494
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,333
I'll do my best.

495
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,800
Where did they get this?

496
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,133
The quality of the ingredients
is getting better.

497
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,333
Where do I start?

498
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:57,333
Goodness.

499
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,400
Hey, that's huge.

500
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,700
It doesn't feel like it's our first day.

501
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:55,066
Seo-jun. Can we open at six?

502
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:57,533
Can we?

503
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,967
- I'm not sure.
- What?

504
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,867
How long does it take?

505
00:51:01,633 --> 00:51:02,767
If we start making it now...

506
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:04,233
- About two hours.
- Two hours.

507
00:51:04,734 --> 00:51:06,333
It takes about two hours.

508
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,800
Check again after 30 minutes.

509
00:51:46,133 --> 00:51:48,934
- We have to start soon.
- Yes.

510
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,834
Put them in two big pots and...

511
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,400
Okay.

512
00:52:01,533 --> 00:52:03,734
- Do you need help?
- Boil it for five minutes.

513
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:05,000
- On high heat?
- Yes.

514
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,500
This too.

515
00:52:23,367 --> 00:52:25,333
I should be making the marinade.

516
00:52:36,367 --> 00:52:38,500
- Is that the pear juice can sound?
- Yes.

517
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,100
He's...

518
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:42,767
opening another 20 cans of pear juice now.

519
00:52:42,867 --> 00:52:45,400
I thought he was drinking a lot of things.

520
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:47,834
Stop drinking.

521
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,934
I'll make it for 60 portions.

522
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:55,900
All right.

523
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:57,800
For tomorrow?

524
00:52:57,867 --> 00:52:58,700
Yes.

525
00:53:10,567 --> 00:53:12,200
- Can I scoop rice?
- Which one?

526
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,734
- I'll scoop rice.
- Oh, rice.

527
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:36,066
Next...

528
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:54,133
- Seo-jun, the marinade is ready?
- Yes.

529
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,700
Can I take 700 g of it?

530
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:57,700
This is for 60 portions.

531
00:54:00,533 --> 00:54:02,533
You can check it after 30 minutes.

532
00:54:16,567 --> 00:54:18,266
- It's for that, right?
- Yes.

533
00:54:18,333 --> 00:54:20,467
- Vegetable fritters.
- Right.

534
00:54:24,433 --> 00:54:26,133
You can fry now.

535
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,166
Should I add more frying powder?

536
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:39,834
I think you can add a bit more of that.

537
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:42,633
Right? It falls apart.

538
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,767
You fried a lot.

539
00:55:13,834 --> 00:55:16,133
That's extra 11 pieces, so...

540
00:55:16,834 --> 00:55:18,133
- Chef.
- Yes?

541
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,333
Should I do more potatoes?

542
00:55:19,433 --> 00:55:21,266
- Potatoes?
- No, not potatoes.

543
00:55:21,333 --> 00:55:22,266
I mean the fritters.

544
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,533
Why? Are you done?

545
00:55:23,633 --> 00:55:25,633
- I made 15 more.
- That should be enough.

546
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,934
- Is it?
- Yes. Well done.

547
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,967
Make 15 more.

548
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,266
Fifteen more? Okay.

549
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,400
Fifteen pieces more.

550
00:55:42,066 --> 00:55:43,333
Is this not boiling?

551
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:46,133
When will it get boiled at this speed?

552
00:56:06,266 --> 00:56:08,166
Gosh, you have to work on that?

553
00:56:08,233 --> 00:56:09,867
- Yes.
- Removing fat.

554
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:11,333
- Yes.
- I'll join you.

555
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:14,500
Once again, it's a time of no thoughts.

556
00:56:22,867 --> 00:56:25,133
Who's giggling? Oh.

557
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,100
You can take a seat here.

558
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,000
Gosh, my back aches.

559
00:56:32,066 --> 00:56:33,166
My gosh.

560
00:56:41,166 --> 00:56:42,834
<i>So I walked</i>

561
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,533
<i>Somebody was beside me</i>

562
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:48,633
We are all going crazy.

563
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:52,000
I'm done.

564
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,800
Oh, my.

565
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,633
- You are the best.
- This is a lot.

566
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:02,900
This is eight kilograms.

567
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:10,000
We did a lot.

568
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:12,166
Goodness.

569
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,133
<i>Gosh, we have to get ready.</i>

570
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,567
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

571
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:20,567
Let's go.

572
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,967
I think it looks good.

573
00:57:37,266 --> 00:57:38,433
I'll boil them in advance.

574
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,066
I'll boil it for another 20 minutes
with potatoes.

575
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,767
Now, dolsot-bibimbap.

576
00:58:02,233 --> 00:58:03,600
What time is it now?

577
00:58:30,767 --> 00:58:33,066
<i>I wonder how many customers come today.</i>

578
00:58:34,066 --> 00:58:34,967
Woo-shik.

579
00:58:36,166 --> 00:58:37,166
Are you ready?

580
00:58:37,233 --> 00:58:38,133
I'm ready.

581
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,133
Should we open?

582
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,834
It would be best if we open at 6:10...

583
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,500
- It'd be the best.
- Come on, no.

584
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,000
Then they will be eating hard meat.

585
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,567
That'll be on you.

586
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:50,600
It'll be your fault.

587
00:58:50,667 --> 00:58:53,000
But this isn't ready...

588
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,333
This is just not ready. What can I do?

589
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,667
It's six o'clock!

590
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,367
What?

591
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:19,333
What?

592
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,734
We have customers.

593
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,033
I see ten people coming.

594
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:34,533
Hello.

595
01:01:01,367 --> 01:01:02,867
Do we have more printed menus?

596
01:01:02,967 --> 01:01:04,133
We don't have enough menus?

597
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,300
Eight...

598
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:06,200
Eleven...

599
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,700
- We have 14 customers.
- What?

600
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,300
- Fourteen?
- Fourteen people?

601
01:01:10,367 --> 01:01:11,533
We need more printed menus.

602
01:01:12,934 --> 01:01:14,066
Min-si.

603
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:15,767
No time to laugh. Work!

604
01:01:15,834 --> 01:01:17,400
- I need to hurry.
- Yes, you need to.

605
01:01:17,467 --> 01:01:18,700
- I need to hurry.
- Yes.

606
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:20,934
My gosh, this dolsot...

607
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:27,734
- Ttukbaegi?
- Ttukbaegi.

608
01:01:27,834 --> 01:01:29,600
It's like an unglazed bowl.

609
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,400
Aren't you cold?

610
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:43,600
Kkori-gomtang.

611
01:01:46,266 --> 01:01:48,333
- I'll take the order in the room.
- Okay.

612
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:49,667
You take orders here.

613
01:01:50,233 --> 01:01:51,066
Sure.

614
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:24,633
- Hello.
- Six people.

615
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:45,633
Should I put the tables together?

616
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,900
I think we should, for the group of six.

617
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:01,166
Seo-jin, turn it around.

618
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,633
We're done with one dolsot-bibimbap.

619
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:18,600
- Yes.
- Okay.

620
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:20,533
- I'm almost done with two.
- Okay.

621
01:03:20,633 --> 01:03:22,467
I think one of them
will order dolsot-bibimbap.

622
01:03:22,567 --> 01:03:23,400
Right.

623
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:24,700
- Let's put it on the stove.
- Okay.

624
01:03:29,667 --> 01:03:31,233
- Chef.
- Yes.

625
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:32,567
It's full.

626
01:03:32,633 --> 01:03:33,900
- It's full?
- Yes.

627
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,166
Don't get nervous.

628
01:03:36,567 --> 01:03:37,433
- Is it full?
- Yes.

629
01:03:38,533 --> 01:03:39,800
Don't be nervous.

630
01:03:39,867 --> 01:03:40,767
I'm nervous.

631
01:03:40,867 --> 01:03:41,967
Hey, don't get nervous.

632
01:03:42,066 --> 01:03:44,066
- Just do what we do.
- I can do this.

633
01:03:44,133 --> 01:03:45,166
- Yes, we can.
- Yes, we can.

634
01:03:48,133 --> 01:03:49,433
Don't be nervous.

635
01:03:49,533 --> 01:03:51,133
Gosh, this is incredible.

636
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,333
How many rounds can we make today?

637
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,967
Gosh, we're in trouble.

638
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:57,800
We're in big trouble.

639
01:03:59,033 --> 01:04:01,633
We can just keep making dolsot-bibimbap.

640
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:03,033
Yes, nonstop bibimbap.

641
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,467
And short ribs.

642
01:04:10,533 --> 01:04:12,567
- Short ribs.
- Short ribs.

643
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:15,734
Green plum tea, okay.

644
01:05:30,266 --> 01:05:31,567
Spicy beef galbijjim.

645
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,533
I'll have beer.

646
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,900
- Beer?
- Yes.

647
01:05:48,333 --> 01:05:49,166
No soju?

648
01:05:59,767 --> 01:06:01,066
Four green plum teas.

649
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:04,000
One soju, one beer. Okay.

650
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,367
You can say, "Thank you."

651
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:07,800
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

652
01:06:21,333 --> 01:06:23,066
We don't have any dishes
with peanuts, right?

653
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,333
No.

654
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:25,266
Okay.

655
01:06:25,567 --> 01:06:26,800
We have a new order.

656
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:31,500
One kkori-gomtang, one dolsot-bibimbap.

657
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:32,934
One spicy beef galbijjim.

658
01:06:33,033 --> 01:06:34,333
We have another order.

659
01:06:35,166 --> 01:06:36,533
It's for the big group.

660
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,567
Okay.

661
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,567
What should we serve now, Min-si?

662
01:06:40,633 --> 01:06:42,734
Kkori-gomtang and dolsot-bibimbap.

663
01:06:42,834 --> 01:06:43,800
Two bowls are ready.

664
01:06:43,867 --> 01:06:45,433
- Right, we can serve them.
- Right.

665
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:50,500
- I hear the sizzling.
- Right.

666
01:06:50,567 --> 01:06:52,367
- It's cooked.
- Yes.

667
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:54,266
You can serve that now.

668
01:06:54,834 --> 01:06:56,300
- Middle one first.
- Okay.

669
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:00,967
Is this <i>kkori-gomtang </i>ready?

670
01:07:01,033 --> 01:07:02,433
- Yes, let's serve it.
- Okay.

671
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:10,333
Let's make two galbijjims at once.

672
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,400
- Two spicy ones.
- Okay.

673
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,500
I'll keep quiet for now.

674
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:37,633
- We need rice...
- I'm on it.

675
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,533
Goodness.

676
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:40,400
You're really good at your job.

677
01:07:52,066 --> 01:07:53,900
If you put that here,
I'll put on the fritters.

678
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:54,967
Okay, great.

679
01:08:01,834 --> 01:08:04,934
Spicy beef galbijjim is ready.

680
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,400
- Serve it, Min-si.
- Got it.

681
01:08:13,667 --> 01:08:15,767
We should make four more green plum teas.

682
01:08:15,834 --> 01:08:18,033
- Yes, they just asked.
- Right.

683
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:19,633
And one soju.

684
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:24,934
Yuzu tea.

685
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,033
- Yes.
- I actually have it.

686
01:08:41,333 --> 01:08:42,633
- Which table?
- Table Three.

687
01:08:42,734 --> 01:08:44,233
- Table Three?
- Yes.

688
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:47,000
- Both of them?
- Hold on. Let me check.

689
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:50,467
Can I put it here first?

690
01:08:50,567 --> 01:08:51,400
Sure.

691
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,633
- Seo-jin.
- Yes?

692
01:08:55,734 --> 01:08:58,133
- We should serve them together.
- Okay, hold on.

693
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:01,000
- We should serve them together.
- Okay, hold on.

694
01:09:02,066 --> 01:09:02,934
For which table?

695
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,166
Table Three.

696
01:09:04,233 --> 01:09:05,133
- Table Three?
- Yes.

697
01:09:05,233 --> 01:09:06,367
- It's ready?
- Yes.

698
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,567
- That was fast.
- They cook so fast.

699
01:09:08,633 --> 01:09:09,533
Really?

700
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,200
They want to work on the later orders.

701
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:28,433
You got more rice?

702
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:29,834
No.

703
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:31,400
- Just one?
- We need one more rice.

704
01:09:50,667 --> 01:09:51,500
Wait.

705
01:09:52,066 --> 01:09:53,600
There's rice inside? Wait.

706
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:55,000
Let's take photos.

707
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:56,967
- What's inside?
- Photos.

708
01:09:57,033 --> 01:09:58,400
My goodness.

709
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:00,800
Show me the plushy.

710
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:04,567
It's so cute.

711
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:06,467
I'll be quick.

712
01:10:09,233 --> 01:10:10,066
Oh, nice.

713
01:10:14,433 --> 01:10:16,233
It doesn't take long for the food to come.

714
01:10:20,033 --> 01:10:22,200
- It's quite spicy.
- Right, it is.

715
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:26,834
This tastes good.

716
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,333
It's tasty. It's good.

717
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,367
- Is it good?
- It's very nice.

718
01:10:32,667 --> 01:10:34,133
I want to have gomtang.

719
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,266
This is how you eat.

720
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,333
Put the rice here?

721
01:10:42,867 --> 01:10:45,633
In China, we get scolded by parents
if we put rice in soup.

722
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,900
Really?

723
01:10:46,967 --> 01:10:50,000
Eating rice and soup together
upsets stomach.

724
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:53,100
Also, we shouldn't be
taking too much water.

725
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:56,200
- It won't digest.
- My mom would scold me.

726
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,367
When I was little, I got scolded by my dad
when I drank water while eating.

727
01:11:07,166 --> 01:11:08,166
I like eating it like this.

728
01:11:08,233 --> 01:11:09,934
- What?
- I like eating rice with soup.

729
01:11:55,166 --> 01:11:57,200
Can't you just grab the oxtail
with your hand and eat?

730
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:50,033
Goodness.

731
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:00,867
It's done.

732
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,367
Three spicy and three regular galbijjim?

733
01:14:07,433 --> 01:14:09,667
- Yes?
- Then...

734
01:14:09,767 --> 01:14:13,000
We should serve
that dolsot-bibimbap a bit later.

735
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:14,767
Hold on. What was I about to do?

736
01:14:15,233 --> 01:14:17,133
I have to work on beef galbijjim...

737
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:21,734
Why is this off?

738
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,333
One.

739
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:26,033
Two.

740
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:32,734
Why is the heat so low?

741
01:14:36,567 --> 01:14:37,400
Is it on?

742
01:14:37,467 --> 01:14:38,667
Oh, yes.

743
01:14:40,433 --> 01:14:42,066
More orders are coming.

744
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:43,066
Okay.

745
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:55,867
Oh, it's not done yet.

746
01:14:56,934 --> 01:14:59,133
Put that here.
I'll add vegetable fritters.

747
01:15:25,033 --> 01:15:26,367
This will be done shortly.

748
01:15:26,433 --> 01:15:27,633
- That's done.
- It's done?

749
01:15:27,734 --> 01:15:29,233
- Yes.
- Well, then...

750
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,667
This time,
we need three people in the kitchen.

751
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:47,934
You said this would take long, right?

752
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:59,166
Now the fritters.
I scooped the rice already.

753
01:15:59,266 --> 01:16:00,700
So please work on the fries.

754
01:16:00,767 --> 01:16:01,767
One more of this.

755
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:05,233
We are falling behind, right?

756
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:07,367
- It's all right.
- No, it's fine.

757
01:16:07,934 --> 01:16:09,033
You can put that here.

758
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,400
- Don't worry about it.
- Let's go.

759
01:16:10,467 --> 01:16:12,400
Spicy beef galbijjim is ready.

760
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:16,600
- They're all for Table Five.
- All of them.

761
01:16:17,467 --> 01:16:19,133
All dishes have been served.

762
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:29,400
Three original beef galbijjims are ready.

763
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:30,400
That's a lot of rice.

764
01:16:30,467 --> 01:16:32,600
The group ordered spicy beef galbijjim.

765
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:35,367
Two more dishes to come.
But let's bring these now.

766
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:21,834
One more soju, please.

767
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,166
This looks so good.

768
01:18:59,233 --> 01:19:01,367
I'm drooling. My mouth is watering.

769
01:19:04,467 --> 01:19:06,000
It's good when it's mixed.

770
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:08,934
Do I mix it with my spoon?

771
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:19,266
Oh!

772
01:19:19,734 --> 01:19:21,233
How do I eat the seaweed?

773
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,333
Watch.

774
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:26,133
You mix the rice,
and put it on top of seaweed.

775
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:27,533
Then have it.

776
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,767
It's rich in flavor.

777
01:19:40,834 --> 01:19:42,967
- You know so well about this.
- Right.

778
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,266
Oh! This is good.

779
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,500
It tastes like turnips.

780
01:19:57,133 --> 01:19:57,967
Like what?

781
01:19:58,033 --> 01:20:00,233
It tastes like turnips.
But it's a bit different.

782
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,000
I don't know what this is.
But this is good.

783
01:20:02,066 --> 01:20:03,867
Oh, this is good.

784
01:20:18,834 --> 01:20:20,000
This is a very mild soup.

785
01:20:20,934 --> 01:20:23,066
Korean soups are really good.

786
01:20:24,834 --> 01:20:26,767
- Everything is good.
- Right.

787
01:20:26,867 --> 01:20:29,233
I didn't know it was this good.

788
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,800
But this is really good.

789
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,400
I want to go to Korea even more now.

790
01:20:34,233 --> 01:20:36,233
Are we ordering ice cream for everyone?

791
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,333
Yes.

792
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,400
It looked nice.

793
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,233
Did we serve all dishes?

794
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:47,834
- Dessert for that table.
- Just dessert.

795
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,734
Yes.

796
01:21:26,433 --> 01:21:29,100
Hey, we have to serve dessert.

797
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:30,000
Right.

798
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:31,967
They're still eating.

799
01:21:32,066 --> 01:21:33,166
- They're almost done.
- Right.

800
01:21:33,233 --> 01:21:34,867
I will go now

801
01:21:34,934 --> 01:21:37,367
and ask if the food was okay.

802
01:21:43,834 --> 01:21:45,033
- Okay.
- Then they will...

803
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,567
- Do I put this now?
- Yes.

804
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,834
- I'll put two big scoops.
- Yes, two.

805
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:57,700
- Vanilla.
- Red beans on vanilla.

806
01:22:57,800 --> 01:22:58,967
Red beans.

807
01:22:59,533 --> 01:23:01,867
What did they say this was? Fried grains?

808
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,800
Fried grains of rice.

809
01:23:03,867 --> 01:23:05,934
- Corn.
- Corn?

810
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Gosh, I just revealed my age.

811
01:23:19,100 --> 01:23:20,000
Oh!

812
01:23:20,633 --> 01:23:23,066
This is the vanilla flavor I like.

813
01:23:23,133 --> 01:23:25,900
It's my first time having ice cream
in Iceland.

814
01:23:27,367 --> 01:23:28,700
This means a lot.

815
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:30,867
What does it mean?

816
01:23:31,633 --> 01:23:35,066
It means we're having something cold
in a very cold place.

817
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:40,600
That doesn't mean anything.
It's like I heard nothing.

818
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:50,066
Is every dish out?

819
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,467
Gosh, we're done.

820
01:23:56,967 --> 01:23:57,967
We're done.

821
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:59,166
We're finally done.

822
01:24:05,266 --> 01:24:07,133
How come no dish is here to wash?

823
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,133
Oh, it's here.

824
01:24:15,233 --> 01:24:16,166
Min-si.

825
01:24:17,233 --> 01:24:18,367
Let's take a break.

826
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:20,700
No, we have to wash dishes.

827
01:24:27,166 --> 01:24:28,600
I saw people waiting.

828
01:24:29,667 --> 01:24:31,166
Seo-jin isn't here, right?

829
01:24:31,934 --> 01:24:33,967
People are lining up and all...

830
01:25:51,133 --> 01:25:52,567
We have six teams that are waiting.

831
01:25:52,633 --> 01:25:53,467
What?

832
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:54,900
Six teams are waiting.

833
01:25:54,967 --> 01:25:56,066
Oh, what do we do?

834
01:25:56,166 --> 01:25:58,367
This never happened before.

835
01:26:01,767 --> 01:26:04,066
Let's check how much is left.

836
01:26:05,834 --> 01:26:07,700
From this...

837
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,066
I can make about six servings.

838
01:26:10,734 --> 01:26:13,700
I can make more bibimbap.

839
01:26:13,767 --> 01:26:16,066
About fifteen.

840
01:26:17,667 --> 01:26:20,934
Do you know how many people
are there in the waiting teams?

841
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:23,500
- Yes, I made a list.
- You wrote it down?

842
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:25,333
I'll check how much
of the ingredients is left.

843
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,767
Six portions of beef galbijjim.

844
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:29,467
- That's it?
- Yes.

845
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,567
We shouldn't let them wait then.

846
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:44,467
This isn't a lot.

847
01:26:47,967 --> 01:26:50,100
We are running out of food.

848
01:26:50,867 --> 01:26:53,200
I don't think
we can take everyone in the line.

849
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:54,400
Of course not.

850
01:26:55,266 --> 01:26:57,066
They are waiting in the order.

851
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,934
I feel bad for sending them back
without feeding them.

852
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:25,266
It's fine.

853
01:28:12,834 --> 01:28:14,166
Do we have...

854
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,667
some radish?

855
01:28:16,734 --> 01:28:18,633
- Is kkakdugi done?
- Yes.

856
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:20,133
We got it for tonight.

857
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:23,433
But we should make some before we go home.

858
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,600
We have to prepare for tomorrow again.

859
01:28:26,667 --> 01:28:27,934
It just doesn't end.

860
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,800
It's never ending.

861
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,400
I know. I'm sorry.

862
01:28:32,066 --> 01:28:33,133
What time is it?

863
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,033
What was that?

864
01:28:36,133 --> 01:28:37,100
You know what?

865
01:28:37,166 --> 01:28:39,800
You said one whole day of prep
would be enough for a few days.

866
01:28:39,867 --> 01:28:40,700
Exactly.

867
01:28:40,767 --> 01:28:42,066
How many hours have we been open?

868
01:28:42,133 --> 01:28:44,066
I don't know. I have no idea.

869
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:47,133
How many days have we been here?

870
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,467
Oh, right. It's our first day.

871
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,233
- Weren't they kind?
- They were kind.

872
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,800
Take your time and go through the menu.

873
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:24,033
Can I just order anything?

874
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:26,300
Sure. Order whatever you want.

875
01:31:26,367 --> 01:31:28,700
Can I order two dishes?

876
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,266
You're paying for your food, not us.

877
01:31:43,433 --> 01:31:45,000
beef galbijjim.

878
01:32:06,133 --> 01:32:09,767
Dolsot-bibimbap and beef galbijjim.
Make one of each.

879
01:32:09,834 --> 01:32:12,500
- Is it a new order?
- Bibimbap and beef galbijjim?

880
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:15,000
Yes. We have new customers for Table One.

881
01:32:15,500 --> 01:32:17,133
Bibimbap and beef galbijjim.

882
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:18,133
Okay.

883
01:32:24,633 --> 01:32:27,400
- I'll cook at the same speed.
- Okay.

884
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:38,900
- You can do this.
- Sure.

885
01:32:40,967 --> 01:32:42,367
I'll mix it later.

886
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:44,200
Yes, later.

887
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,300
Let's give them more.

888
01:32:46,367 --> 01:32:47,934
Four more beef galbijjim orders.

889
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:53,333
One original
and three spicy beef galbijjim.

890
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:54,433
- Three spicy.
- Right.

891
01:32:54,533 --> 01:32:56,700
One original. Just cook them all together.

892
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:01,433
Okay.

893
01:33:50,734 --> 01:33:52,333
One, two, three portions.

894
01:33:55,567 --> 01:33:56,667
Let me take a look.

895
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,300
Oh, no...

896
01:34:17,767 --> 01:34:19,934
They're all boiled down,
you can serve them.

897
01:34:27,900 --> 01:34:29,900
This dolsot-bibimbap looks delicious.

898
01:34:39,033 --> 01:34:42,333
How long will it take for dolsot-bibimbap?

899
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:44,100
About five minutes.

900
01:34:49,533 --> 01:34:51,333
- I'm putting dolsot-bibimbap here.
- Okay.

901
01:34:57,967 --> 01:34:59,400
I'll help them in the kitchen.

902
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:00,667
- What?
- I'll help them.

903
01:35:01,834 --> 01:35:03,667
Well, I'm here to help.

904
01:35:03,734 --> 01:35:05,500
Thank you. Help me with the bibimbap.

905
01:35:05,567 --> 01:35:07,600
Two more orders on dolsot-bibimbap.

906
01:35:07,667 --> 01:35:09,066
Two more?

907
01:35:09,133 --> 01:35:11,533
Yes, one more beef galbijjim as well.

908
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,567
Okay.

909
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:15,166
Let's sell them all.

910
01:35:33,700 --> 01:35:35,600
- Please scoop the rice.
- Okay.

911
01:35:38,834 --> 01:35:39,867
I'm stepping up.

912
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,633
- Min-si.
- Yes.

913
01:35:41,734 --> 01:35:44,100
Is it the first bucket of yakgochujang?

914
01:35:44,834 --> 01:35:46,066
Yes, the first one.

915
01:35:46,166 --> 01:35:48,200
We still have a lot of it.

916
01:35:48,266 --> 01:35:50,000
It was important for me to know that.

917
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,633
- This?
- Should we add more water here?

918
01:36:03,166 --> 01:36:05,400
You get speechless here, right?

919
01:36:05,934 --> 01:36:07,734
We haven't been talking.

920
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,834
We haven't said a word.

921
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,734
- Can I serve the beef galbijjim?
- Yes, hold on.

922
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,233
- Let me finish the fritters.
- Fritters? Okay.

923
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:55,200
- Let's slow down. It's fine.
- Yes.

924
01:36:55,266 --> 01:36:56,433
Vegetable fritters are done.

925
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,900
- What is this? An edge?
- It's an antenna.

926
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,767
I'll serve up to this.

927
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,967
I'll take this. It can be served.

928
01:37:07,567 --> 01:37:08,500
Last one.

929
01:37:10,266 --> 01:37:11,700
This is beef galbijjim.

930
01:37:24,433 --> 01:37:25,266
You want it?

931
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,300
This is good.

932
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,200
- Did you work on all of those drawers?
- Yes.

933
01:37:38,266 --> 01:37:42,200
The bar table here
and two drawers over there.

934
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:49,033
I worked on the whole kitchen as well.
It looked nice.

935
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:53,367
So this is all homemade.

936
01:37:54,066 --> 01:37:56,867
- Something is coming.
- Food is coming.

937
01:37:57,633 --> 01:37:59,667
Gosh, the whole cart has our food.

938
01:37:59,767 --> 01:38:01,900
Yes, I thought so.

939
01:38:01,967 --> 01:38:03,233
Oh, I'm so excited.

940
01:38:16,467 --> 01:38:19,266
- Should we order one more?
- I know.

941
01:38:19,333 --> 01:38:22,166
- We are very hungry.
- I'm starving.

942
01:38:33,533 --> 01:38:34,633
Kimchi is good.

943
01:38:35,367 --> 01:38:36,433
Potato is good too.

944
01:38:39,467 --> 01:38:40,600
Nice.

945
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:46,066
Gosh, look at the mushroom.

946
01:38:46,166 --> 01:38:47,233
It's shiitake mushroom.

947
01:38:54,633 --> 01:38:55,633
What is this?

948
01:38:57,066 --> 01:38:58,400
I think it's fried.

949
01:39:04,166 --> 01:39:05,133
It's delicious.

950
01:39:05,200 --> 01:39:06,633
Korean vegetable fritters.

951
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:08,033
You are right.

952
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:09,533
Is it good?

953
01:39:11,734 --> 01:39:14,500
- How's bibimbap?
- It's really good.

954
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,266
- Is it good?
- Yes, try it.

955
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:29,200
Let's order more if you're hungry.

956
01:39:41,266 --> 01:39:42,500
This is really good.

957
01:39:43,700 --> 01:39:47,367
Is he the chef?

958
01:39:47,433 --> 01:39:49,000
He's the best chef.

959
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:55,066
I wish there was a restaurant
like this one in the city.

960
01:39:58,433 --> 01:40:01,633
I would like to have more food like this
in the future.

961
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:05,367
I can pay 4,000 krona.

962
01:40:05,433 --> 01:40:09,033
The problem is we don't have food
like this in Iceland.

963
01:40:09,967 --> 01:40:12,500
This is authentic Korean food.

964
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:15,667
That was a hearty meal.

965
01:40:16,533 --> 01:40:17,400
I agree.

966
01:40:18,333 --> 01:40:20,500
They served it fast too.

967
01:40:20,567 --> 01:40:23,200
Compared to what we ordered...

968
01:40:24,166 --> 01:40:25,700
I'm excited to try the ice cream.

969
01:40:25,767 --> 01:40:27,033
I'm excited too.

970
01:40:28,333 --> 01:40:31,433
I'll bring a crowbar
if they're out of ice cream.

971
01:40:58,233 --> 01:40:59,500
I think this is a type of corn.

972
01:41:00,934 --> 01:41:02,033
This is rice.

973
01:41:02,767 --> 01:41:03,667
I see.

974
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,734
- It's crispy.
- It's good.

975
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:13,433
Oh, red beans.

976
01:41:13,533 --> 01:41:15,266
Right, red beans.

977
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:18,600
It's too sweet. Oh, but I already had it.

978
01:41:18,667 --> 01:41:21,033
Let's skip diet for today.

979
01:41:24,066 --> 01:41:25,033
Hey, Woo-shik.

980
01:41:26,633 --> 01:41:27,467
What?

981
01:41:27,533 --> 01:41:28,934
I'm scared.

982
01:41:29,033 --> 01:41:30,100
- Why is he calling me?
- Why?

983
01:41:30,166 --> 01:41:31,433
Why is he calling me?

984
01:41:31,734 --> 01:41:33,133
Did he get a complaint?

985
01:42:25,533 --> 01:42:27,200
Oh, we have to pay.

986
01:42:42,467 --> 01:42:43,400
Are you done?

987
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:45,834
- Well done.
- Good job.

988
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,133
Give them one each.

989
01:42:59,367 --> 01:43:00,333
Thank you.

990
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,633
I'm scared of the weekend.

991
01:43:13,867 --> 01:43:17,633
I told myself that I'd work hard
with all my heart

992
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:19,900
even if there were only three tables.

993
01:43:21,066 --> 01:43:22,033
I didn't expect so many...

994
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,033
I don't know I'm in Iceland or what.

995
01:43:29,567 --> 01:43:31,333
I can do better tomorrow.

996
01:43:32,934 --> 01:43:33,900
First, rice.

997
01:43:33,967 --> 01:43:35,800
I have to cook the right amount.

998
01:43:35,900 --> 01:43:39,333
I have to mix the rice
and the gochujang faster.

999
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,367
I have to reduce it.

1000
01:43:41,433 --> 01:43:44,333
I can mix it right before the order.

1001
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:45,900
With setting,

1002
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,066
I can speed up now.

1003
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:52,133
We should make a lot of fries in advance.

1004
01:43:52,233 --> 01:43:54,367
We also have to make kkakdugi.

1005
01:43:54,433 --> 01:43:56,066
Oh, right.

1006
01:43:56,166 --> 01:43:57,467
I should do that now.

1007
01:44:21,266 --> 01:44:22,100
What are you doing?

1008
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:24,400
I'm on kkakdugi.

1009
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:25,934
I'm making kkakdugi.

1010
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,500
Why aren't you taking a break?

1011
01:44:27,567 --> 01:44:30,467
If I don't make it now
I have to make it after work.

1012
01:44:30,533 --> 01:44:31,934
We're out of kkakdugi?

1013
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,533
That's what I heard. We're running out.

1014
01:44:39,367 --> 01:44:41,033
Min-si, did you drink water?

1015
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:44,700
No. I can't drink.
I don't want to go to the bathroom.

1016
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:46,233
You can't do this.

1017
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,533
I'm scared I'll have to use the bathroom

1018
01:44:54,667 --> 01:44:57,033
I didn't even think it through that far.

1019
01:44:59,033 --> 01:45:01,400
I use the bathroom a lot.

1020
01:45:01,467 --> 01:45:04,800
I had no idea that could be the reason.

1021
01:45:13,734 --> 01:45:15,300
I'm so sorry, Min-si.

1022
01:45:15,967 --> 01:45:17,867
I need to take a glass of water.

1023
01:45:18,567 --> 01:45:19,400
Go ahead.

1024
01:45:21,533 --> 01:45:23,033
- I just have to drink water.
- Sure.

1025
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:23,934
Then I'll help you.

1026
01:45:24,467 --> 01:45:25,300
It's okay.

1027
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:32,433
Oh, gosh.

1028
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:36,600
I'll wash those.

1029
01:45:37,133 --> 01:45:38,433
I'll wash those.

1030
01:45:38,500 --> 01:45:40,300
No, it won't take long.

1031
01:45:41,367 --> 01:45:43,200
We're almost done.

1032
01:46:24,266 --> 01:46:26,133
Min-si, you. can run away now.

1033
01:46:28,834 --> 01:46:30,500
You can run away now.

1034
01:46:30,567 --> 01:46:32,166
You should leave, I'm fine.

1035
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,834
Goodness, I mean...

1036
01:46:45,934 --> 01:46:48,200
They finished the whole food.

1037
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:49,200
I do feel...

1038
01:46:49,834 --> 01:46:51,367
I do feel good about this.

1039
01:46:51,433 --> 01:46:52,533
That's good to know.

1040
01:46:52,600 --> 01:46:55,000
- It's a nice thing, isn't it?
- I'm very relieved.

1041
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:05,133
Are they all gone?

1042
01:47:05,767 --> 01:47:07,400
- No.
- Not yet.

1043
01:47:09,367 --> 01:47:11,033
Should I go pay?

1044
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:12,033
Sure.

1045
01:47:12,433 --> 01:47:14,667
We should pick up our girls.

1046
01:47:14,734 --> 01:47:17,533
Yes, my parents need a break too.

1047
01:47:19,900 --> 01:47:23,600
I have to do some sawing at night.
Gosh, I'm too lazy to do it.

1048
01:47:54,533 --> 01:47:57,000
Aren't you all hungry?

1049
01:47:58,734 --> 01:47:59,734
Aren't you?

1050
01:48:02,767 --> 01:48:05,633
Min-si, you are still working?

1051
01:48:07,233 --> 01:48:09,567
I have to make kkakdugi.

1052
01:48:09,633 --> 01:48:10,900
You are unbelievable.

1053
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,367
Goodness.

1054
01:48:13,133 --> 01:48:14,233
I think...

1055
01:48:14,300 --> 01:48:15,567
I'm done.

1056
01:48:16,734 --> 01:48:19,667
Gosh, I'm exhausted. This is tiring.

1057
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:21,600
I'm done.

1058
01:48:27,300 --> 01:48:29,367
I heard you cooked rice five times.

1059
01:48:30,567 --> 01:48:31,467
Gosh.

1060
01:48:32,900 --> 01:48:35,233
You technically cooked the whole sack.

1061
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:45,333
You should all stop working.

1062
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:48,667
No, this is...

1063
01:48:49,433 --> 01:48:50,600
You guys...

1064
01:48:50,667 --> 01:48:52,700
This is crazy.

1065
01:48:57,767 --> 01:48:58,600
Do you want a beer?

1066
01:48:58,667 --> 01:48:59,834
- Yes.
- Do you want a beer?

1067
01:49:07,433 --> 01:49:09,100
Can I drink one from here?

1068
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:11,633
- Beer? Of course. Have it.
- Go ahead.

1069
01:49:12,133 --> 01:49:14,734
- I want to drink beer.
- Finish it all.

1070
01:49:16,667 --> 01:49:18,500
Gosh, this is delicious.

1071
01:49:19,934 --> 01:49:20,767
Do you...

1072
01:49:20,834 --> 01:49:22,166
Do you have to work again?

1073
01:49:22,233 --> 01:49:24,300
I'm still salting radish for kkakdugi.

1074
01:49:24,367 --> 01:49:25,800
Stop it now.

1075
01:49:25,867 --> 01:49:27,066
My gosh.

1076
01:49:27,133 --> 01:49:29,633
Until 9:40 p.m...
It should be salted for an hour.

1077
01:49:30,533 --> 01:49:32,467
Look at Min-si's eyes. They're tired.

1078
01:49:33,133 --> 01:49:34,467
Her eyes are tired.

1079
01:49:41,767 --> 01:49:42,967
So today...

1080
01:49:43,066 --> 01:49:44,900
How many tables did we serve?

1081
01:49:44,967 --> 01:49:47,533
We had a total of 55 customers.

1082
01:49:48,066 --> 01:49:49,333
16 teams.

1083
01:49:54,133 --> 01:49:55,967
I'm smiling there.

1084
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:01,166
I guess...

1085
01:50:01,266 --> 01:50:03,100
Woo-shik won his first victory.

1086
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,100
His debut play.

1087
01:50:33,367 --> 01:50:34,967
- It's ready?
- Yes.

1088
01:50:35,033 --> 01:50:36,000
That was fast.

1089
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,333
They cook so fast.

1090
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:38,934
- What?
- They're so fast.

1091
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,567
Pass!

1092
01:51:09,033 --> 01:51:11,000
Who's going to be the chef tomorrow?

1093
01:51:12,033 --> 01:51:13,000
I'll pick Yu-mi.

1094
01:51:17,233 --> 01:51:18,667
<i>I'm at work.</i>

1095
01:51:22,133 --> 01:51:23,633
<i>Gosh, Yu-mi is good.</i>

1096
01:51:25,467 --> 01:51:27,700
One regular
and one spicy beef galbijjim, right?

1097
01:51:27,800 --> 01:51:29,700
Dolsot-bibimbap on the stove.

1098
01:51:31,934 --> 01:51:34,100
I feel stable somehow.

1099
01:51:34,166 --> 01:51:36,066
I feel at ease.

1100
01:51:40,066 --> 01:51:42,266
Gosh, I can't ask for more!

1101
01:51:42,333 --> 01:51:43,667
There's a lot of rice.

1102
01:52:15,367 --> 01:52:17,100
We're out of potatoes.

1103
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:18,533
No potatoes?

1104
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:20,266
We're almost out
of bibimbap toppings, too.

1105
01:52:20,367 --> 01:52:22,500
We're short on ingredients again?

1106
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:25,600
What? What happened?

1107
01:52:25,667 --> 01:52:27,233
Is this how you're going to handle?

1108
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:28,500
Why are you two fighting?

1109
01:52:28,600 --> 01:52:30,333
He missed one kkori-gomtang order.

1110
01:52:31,433 --> 01:52:32,900
No.

1111
01:52:32,967 --> 01:52:34,567
It takes too long.

1112
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:41,533
<i>You ready, Yu-mi?</i>

1113
01:52:42,266 --> 01:52:43,600
<i>Let's just take the orders.</i>

1114
01:52:47,433 --> 01:52:49,433
Since when did you have dimples?

1115
01:52:52,767 --> 01:52:55,033
You think they just came up like that?

1116
01:52:55,667 --> 01:52:57,100
- What?
- You think they just came up?

1117
01:52:57,166 --> 01:52:58,467
You had them when you were a kid?

1118
01:52:58,567 --> 01:52:59,867
I had them since I was born.

1119
01:53:01,266 --> 01:53:02,533
My dad has them.

1120
01:53:03,900 --> 01:53:05,834
- My dad has dimples.
- I see.

1121
01:53:06,734 --> 01:53:07,567
Me too.

1122
01:53:08,033 --> 01:53:10,734
Your dimples are getting deeper.

1123
01:53:11,266 --> 01:53:13,533
What if they get connected at one end?

1124
01:53:16,734 --> 01:53:18,400
I'll go make galbitang.

1125
01:53:18,900 --> 01:53:20,000
No, it's not galbitang.

1126
01:53:20,567 --> 01:53:22,200
- It's galbijjim.
- Galbijjim.

1127
01:53:24,934 --> 01:53:26,200
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

1128
