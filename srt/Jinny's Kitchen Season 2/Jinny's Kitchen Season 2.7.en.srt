00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,033 --> 00:00:21,100
So many people are lining up.

3
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,333
This is no joke.

4
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:25,000
...cooking oil.

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,767
I hope they order a lot of sundubu.

6
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:37,767
It smells really good.

7
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:39,667
It's amazing.

8
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,567
I'm thinking about
getting customers in, every ten minutes.

9
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,700
Why do we do that?

10
00:00:50,767 --> 00:00:51,600
- What?
- Why?

11
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,133
Because if we take orders at once,
the kitchen gets hectic.

12
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,633
- I can do this for a month.
- I agree.

13
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,266
We can make five rounds a day
at this rate.

14
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,700
We'll probably have a lot of orders soon.

15
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:15,266
We finally have a system.

16
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,333
He surely is a NYU business major.

17
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:19,667
Let's eat now.

18
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:21,133
- What?
- We should eat.

19
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:23,333
Why don't you say, "Let's eat"?

20
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,066
Do we still have gomtang?

21
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,300
- Yes.
- We have a lot left.

22
00:01:26,367 --> 00:01:27,800
It didn't sell a lot today.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,333
We have to finish that up then.

24
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,433
- Right.
- Let's eat.

25
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:31,567
I'm hungry.

26
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,767
Seo-jun went to the kitchen to cook.

27
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:45,967
- Min-si, it's good that you're here.
- Sorry?

28
00:01:46,033 --> 00:01:47,900
Please open three cartons of sundubu.

29
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:48,834
Okay.

30
00:01:50,567 --> 00:01:52,100
Goodness.

31
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,000
We should finish the rice.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,133
We all worked hard.

33
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,500
We should eat a lot.

34
00:02:18,166 --> 00:02:19,767
What are you, a farmhand?

35
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you a farmhand?

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,266
We have to finish it.

37
00:02:34,867 --> 00:02:35,700
Is this ours?

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,667
It looks delicious.

39
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,266
Please bring this out.

40
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,300
- Okay.
- Bring it out.

41
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,734
Gosh, it looks delicious.

42
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,800
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy.

43
00:03:21,934 --> 00:03:23,233
Why do I love noodles?

44
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,734
I didn't like it before.

45
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:28,700
Isn't it delicious?

46
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,367
- Hey!
- It's so good.

47
00:03:30,467 --> 00:03:31,600
I just had it.

48
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:32,934
- You had it?
- Yes.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,433
- It's so delicious.
- What's with the noodles?

50
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Sundubu is really good.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,066
It's so delicious.

52
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:13,300
Is this the whole pack of soft tofu?

53
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:14,834
Or is it the half pack?

54
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Two-thirds.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,867
This is a lot.

56
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,567
It's so delicious.

57
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:24,533
So good.

58
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,467
I dreamed last night...

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,867
I was in the restaurant.

60
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:33,667
Yung-suk said, "Seo-jin,"

61
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,600
"Mr. President is coming."

62
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,033
Out of the blue.

63
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,166
I couldn't believe it.
"Mr. President's coming here?"

64
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,800
So I told everyone, "Guys",

65
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,834
"Mr. President's coming.
You have to do a good job."

66
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,233
...something like that in my dream.

67
00:04:47,934 --> 00:04:50,033
You are so overly immersed.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
The next chef is Yu-mi.

69
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,967
- Let's do this.
- Yes.

70
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,800
Launching yukjeon bibim-guksu.

71
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm going to ace this dish.

72
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
Bibim-guksu is done?

73
00:05:36,066 --> 00:05:37,367
It's the first one to come out.

74
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,200
- We're left with Table Five?
- Yes.

75
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,200
I'll make it quick.

76
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,333
This is so pretty.

77
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,834
- It's done.
- It's done.

78
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,433
Done.

79
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,934
I'll make bibim-guksu seasoning sauce
before I go home.

80
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,867
You should go home first.

81
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,100
But why?

82
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,667
It needs to ripen.

83
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,100
The seasoning sauce.

84
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:06,767
- Why make it so early?
- What?

85
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,166
Why make it so early?

86
00:06:08,233 --> 00:06:10,266
The longer the better it tastes.

87
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,900
Let's prep the ribs before we go.

88
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:14,700
Okay. I'll make the seasoning sauce
while you do that.

89
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:16,633
In that case, let's go back home together.

90
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,333
I have to prep for kkakdugi as well.

91
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,467
I have to remove the beef fat too.

92
00:06:20,533 --> 00:06:21,500
Beef fat...

93
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,734
Are we all going to work overtime tonight?

94
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,633
What are you making, Min-si?

95
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,500
I have to make the seasoning sauce
for kkakdugi.

96
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,600
- Yu-mi, I have a gift for you.
- What?

97
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,500
It's for your seasoning sauce.

98
00:07:19,567 --> 00:07:20,834
- Thank you.
- Sure.

99
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,700
- You're the best.
- Of course.

100
00:07:22,767 --> 00:07:24,633
- You're the best.
- There you go.

101
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,533
450 grams.

102
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:32,834
- This is perfect.
- It is perfect.

103
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,533
- Yes.
- This can go back now.

104
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,567
- Woo-shik, you can keep this.
- Okay.

105
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,934
Okay.

106
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,367
This can go away too.

107
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,066
- Put it back.
- Okay.

108
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,967
Sugar can go back to its place.

109
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:08,266
- Put it back.
- Sesame oil can go away.

110
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:15,834
Put it back.

111
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,033
Black pepper?

112
00:08:28,266 --> 00:08:29,233
It's done.

113
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,333
Let's go now.

114
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,100
Bye.

115
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:38,934
Bye.

116
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,600
We're going home.

117
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,433
Did Seo-jin leave first?

118
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,367
I think so.

119
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:51,033
- Hey, hold on.
- What?

120
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,100
- Why?
- Stay here.

121
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,767
It's too windy out there.

122
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:02,200
Run when the light turns green.

123
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:03,567
- Okay, let's go!
- Okay.

124
00:09:03,633 --> 00:09:04,667
Let's go now.

125
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,767
Don't stop!

126
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,066
It's so cold.

127
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:17,900
Gosh, it's freezing.

128
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:22,834
It's too cold.

129
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,633
Gosh, it's too cold.

130
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:31,133
Seo-jin is still there!

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,033
Where?

132
00:09:32,834 --> 00:09:33,667
Where?

133
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:35,333
- He's over there.
- At the crosswalk.

134
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,500
- Let's go.
- It's too cold.

135
00:09:47,266 --> 00:09:49,300
Good night.

136
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:51,367
I'll go down.

137
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:58,266
It's so cold.

138
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:02,266
Gosh, Iceland is too cold.

139
00:10:02,967 --> 00:10:04,200
Oh, it's warm in here.

140
00:10:13,266 --> 00:10:14,467
Gosh, what was that?

141
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,867
It was suddenly so warm.

142
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,367
I thought I was back to Mexico.

143
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,266
It's my birthday today.

144
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:32,900
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

145
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,166
Are you here early because of me?

146
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,600
No. We haven't turned on the lights yet.

147
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,633
I heard you're making miyeokguk
as a surprise.

148
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,934
If I have the time...

149
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,000
We celebrated his birthday at 12:00 a.m.

150
00:13:05,433 --> 00:13:07,300
Then we went to bed right away.

151
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:09,333
We had nothing to feed him.

152
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,834
We changed it for now.
When you fall asleep...

153
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,734
It's 12:00 a.m.

154
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:15,667
- Woo-shik!
- Woo-shik.

155
00:13:15,734 --> 00:13:16,667
- Woo-shik.
- Yes.

156
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:17,700
Woo-shik!

157
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:18,667
What time is it?

158
00:13:18,734 --> 00:13:20,567
- It's 12:00 a.m.
- Right, 12:00 a.m.

159
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,166
- You're 34?
- Happy birthday.

160
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:23,633
Let's work hard tomorrow.

161
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,934
You are 34.

162
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,266
Happy birthday.

163
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:45,133
Hello. Welcome to Yu-mi's Miyeokguk.

164
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,300
I'll rinse it once.

165
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,400
So I heard that he's already 34.

166
00:14:25,467 --> 00:14:27,066
When I first met him...

167
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,433
He was only 23 when I first met him.

168
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,367
We shot Train to Busan then.

169
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:33,166
Woo-shik was that young then?

170
00:14:33,233 --> 00:14:34,333
Yes, he was young.

171
00:14:43,934 --> 00:14:47,200
He doesn't show it,
but maybe Woo-shik's expecting this.

172
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,600
Maybe a little.

173
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,633
It can get really awkward

174
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,000
when it's someone's birthday
during the shoot.

175
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:57,367
We have to shoot
right after celebrating the birthday.

176
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,633
I should taste it.

177
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,166
Should I add this?

178
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:29,000
It doesn't taste good
with the soy sauce alone.

179
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,934
It tastes much deeper now.

180
00:15:46,066 --> 00:15:47,333
It's so easy to use.

181
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,867
We'll give you this beforehand.

182
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:11,700
I can pay with my credit card.

183
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,400
I'll pay with mine. It's...

184
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,000
It's Woo-shik's birthday.

185
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,500
I can't use the corporate card for this.

186
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,100
What should I get?

187
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,133
I think this color is the prettiest.

188
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,266
I should get this one.

189
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,467
- Let's go.
- Okay.

190
00:16:47,934 --> 00:16:49,300
Gosh, this one...

191
00:16:49,934 --> 00:16:52,133
Doesn't this suit Woo-shik very well?

192
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,233
This...

193
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
Don't you need wind for this?

194
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,633
- Does it spin?
- It needs wind.

195
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:08,266
This one too.

196
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,834
I should get this.

197
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:20,066
- Get both.
- This is his birthday gift.

198
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,266
Getting down...

199
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,300
I love lying down

200
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,934
Yu-mi, are you ready?

201
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,500
- Let me get miked.
- Shall we go?

202
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,300
You know the way?

203
00:19:35,066 --> 00:19:36,200
I do.

204
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:38,967
Hello. Woo-shik and Yu-mi are back.

205
00:19:39,066 --> 00:19:41,266
- It's Winter Vacation.
- Winter Vacation.

206
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
We are on our way to shop for groceries.

207
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,734
Today, we are making...

208
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,033
Beef galbijjim.

209
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,667
And yukjeon bibim-myeon.

210
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,300
Yukjeon bibim-guksu.

211
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:57,467
Bibim-guksu and...

212
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,500
- Bibimbap.
- Bibimbap.

213
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,934
- Kkori-gomtang.
- Kkori-gomtang.

214
00:20:02,533 --> 00:20:03,533
We are here.

215
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,800
How much of it do you need?

216
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,100
Want some free coffee?

217
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,500
This is the best.

218
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,567
I love free stuff

219
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,700
I should get ingredients whenever I can.

220
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,133
Just in case.

221
00:20:45,133 --> 00:20:47,100
So they give it like this.

222
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:49,066
- We don't have to cut it.
- Right.

223
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,667
Hi.

224
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,800
I'm the first one today

225
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:22,066
Inside out.

226
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:26,767
It's a nice morning.

227
00:21:28,266 --> 00:21:29,567
I should wear this.

228
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:35,767
Let's get started.

229
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,100
One...

230
00:21:41,567 --> 00:21:43,100
Two...

231
00:21:46,633 --> 00:21:47,800
That's 12.

232
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:52,066
Done.

233
00:22:21,734 --> 00:22:23,600
Since I'm here by myself,

234
00:22:23,667 --> 00:22:26,000
I feel like I'm the chef today.

235
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:30,300
It feels like I'm the owner
of a small restaurant.

236
00:22:34,467 --> 00:22:38,133
We are here

237
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,100
- That was fast.
- Oh, gosh.

238
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,433
That was a fast trip.

239
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,767
You are back so fast.

240
00:22:42,834 --> 00:22:43,667
- Min-si.
- Yes.

241
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,300
All right

242
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:48,433
And now...

243
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:50,266
The prep!

244
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,567
People keep texting me.

245
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,500
It's my birthday today.

246
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:56,133
Happy birthday, Woo-shik.

247
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:57,700
Thank you.

248
00:22:57,967 --> 00:22:59,266
Later, are we doing...

249
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:01,367
- We don't have time.
- No.

250
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:02,400
We don't have time.

251
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:04,033
We have to work non-stop.

252
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,066
Goodness.

253
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,233
But please be understanding.

254
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,934
People keep texting me.

255
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:11,033
So I have to check my phone.

256
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:13,467
My goodness.

257
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,300
I couldn't sleep well.

258
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:17,533
I kept getting messages from people.

259
00:23:18,633 --> 00:23:20,467
Does it have to be Korean time?

260
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:23,934
Or does it have to be Icelandic time,
where I am now.

261
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:26,700
Isn't it better to keep Korean time?

262
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:27,600
Right...

263
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,600
You only have one hour to go.

264
00:23:29,667 --> 00:23:31,000
Enjoy it for an hour.

265
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:32,166
All right.

266
00:23:32,266 --> 00:23:33,300
Seriously,

267
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,100
you guys are cold-hearted.

268
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:36,567
My gosh.

269
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,233
My mom said,

270
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,333
"Still, it's your birthday."

271
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:43,467
"Did you get to have a cake?"

272
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,133
"A cake?"

273
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,834
"Right, I had it."

274
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,567
"I got to blow out the candles."

275
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:54,533
"They even got me the birthday hat."

276
00:23:57,934 --> 00:23:59,867
"I'm being so loved here, Mom."

277
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,400
I was lying down on my bed.

278
00:24:04,467 --> 00:24:05,900
The cold air was so bad.

279
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,633
"It's warm here, Mom."

280
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,300
Come here and add the meat.

281
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:13,567
Woo-shik.

282
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,000
You are here already?

283
00:24:21,066 --> 00:24:22,266
- Hello.
- Yes.

284
00:24:22,567 --> 00:24:23,800
We have to be quick.

285
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,967
Where is Seo-jun?

286
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
He's on his way.

287
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,800
By the way, this...

288
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,600
- You can give it to us.
- Okay.

289
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:40,967
I should act like I'm late.

290
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:48,033
Hello.

291
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:49,600
- Hello.
- You're here.

292
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,867
We are now working without a break

293
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,800
Please be nice, cucumbers.

294
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,967
- The cucumber smells nice.
- Right.

295
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,066
This cabbage is very sturdy.

296
00:25:47,767 --> 00:25:50,000
- It's sturdy, right?
- How do I chop it?

297
00:26:03,567 --> 00:26:05,400
I think I'm done chopping.

298
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:18,033
I'll work on the meat now.

299
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:20,800
The meat looks so delicious.

300
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,667
This looks fresh.

301
00:26:48,433 --> 00:26:49,400
Goodness.

302
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,066
Gosh, this is...

303
00:26:54,633 --> 00:26:55,467
Good.

304
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,233
Happy birthday

305
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:36,700
Happy birthday

306
00:27:37,967 --> 00:27:42,834
Happy birthday to me

307
00:27:43,367 --> 00:27:47,367
Happy birthday to me

308
00:27:49,433 --> 00:27:54,066
Happy birthday to me

309
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:01,867
It's all right.

310
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:36,967
You make the sauce.

311
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:57,900
Well, here...

312
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,166
Should we ventilate?

313
00:29:13,066 --> 00:29:14,600
- Seo-jin.
- Yes?

314
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,000
Is cooking wine a type of alcohol?

315
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:20,400
No.

316
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,500
Try taking a sip.

317
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,934
When are we doing this?

318
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:30,900
Shouldn't we eat first?

319
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:33,166
The cake is dessert anyway.

320
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:36,600
Are we doing the cake first?

321
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:37,834
Or after the meal?

322
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,400
I made miyeokguk already.

323
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:42,000
Then let's do the cake
and then have the soup.

324
00:29:42,066 --> 00:29:43,000
We can do that.

325
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:53,400
Here it is.

326
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:58,233
I'll call the rest of them
when you bring it out.

327
00:30:05,233 --> 00:30:06,233
What is this?

328
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,967
I just bought it.

329
00:30:08,033 --> 00:30:10,433
I think you have to unfold it.

330
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,633
It'll be funny if we make him wear that.

331
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,100
And this is his gift.

332
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:38,967
Seo-jin!

333
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,500
- What?
- Whoever wants to eat now...

334
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:42,800
Shall we eat?

335
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,233
- In a pair.
- Well...

336
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,967
I think he's working on something.

337
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:49,200
- Let's eat when he's done.
- Okay.

338
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:50,567
I shouldn't have done it now.

339
00:30:58,633 --> 00:30:59,467
- Yu-mi!
- Yes.

340
00:30:59,533 --> 00:31:00,667
- Min-si!
- Yes.

341
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,033
Come out for a second.

342
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,767
Is this cooked?

343
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,767
Let's go!

344
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,934
I told you not to do this.

345
00:31:29,133 --> 00:31:31,100
- Dear Woo-shik
- Dear Woo-shik

346
00:31:31,166 --> 00:31:32,734
Dear Woo-shik...

347
00:31:32,834 --> 00:31:34,133
Thank you.

348
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,500
Make a wish.

349
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,900
Thank you.

350
00:31:47,834 --> 00:31:49,133
Thank you.

351
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,233
You can serve with that hat today.

352
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,934
Gosh, thank you.

353
00:31:53,033 --> 00:31:54,633
This is your birthday gift.

354
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,467
- Goodness.
- Oh, nice.

355
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:00,400
Goodness!

356
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,834
- It's so cute.
- Goodness.

357
00:32:06,033 --> 00:32:08,166
Propeller hat, fly!

358
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,633
- Thank you so much.
- This is funny.

359
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:17,700
What is this?

360
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:20,533
Is this miyeokguk?

361
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,633
Goodness!

362
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,967
When did you make it?

363
00:32:23,266 --> 00:32:24,767
She made it this morning.

364
00:32:24,834 --> 00:32:25,667
- Really?
- Yes.

365
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,200
- Who made it?
- I did.

366
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,867
We can have breakfast with this.

367
00:32:29,967 --> 00:32:31,333
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

368
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,834
It looks good on him.

369
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:36,367
My goodness.

370
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:46,667
Yu-mi made the curry too.

371
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:48,967
Right. She said she'd make me curry.

372
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,333
You like curry.

373
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,300
Right?

374
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:00,300
Thank you.

375
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,066
Thank you so much, Yu-mi.

376
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,300
It looks delicious.

377
00:33:04,367 --> 00:33:05,400
There are few ingredients.

378
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:06,367
It smells good.

379
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,567
I can't believe I'm having miyeokguk

380
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:10,133
made by Yu-mi in Iceland.

381
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,767
You know, my mom likes Yu-mi the most.

382
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:15,266
A lot of rice for Woo-shik.

383
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,066
- It's so much.
- It's for Woo-shik.

384
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,400
Give me just half of that.

385
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,400
Stop it with the farmhand rice. Okay?

386
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,700
Let's work together
until we celebrate my 50th birthday.

387
00:33:26,033 --> 00:33:28,400
I'm not sure if I will still be alive.

388
00:33:29,266 --> 00:33:30,567
Let's bring these out.

389
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,533
We should eat quick and work.

390
00:33:35,867 --> 00:33:36,734
Goodness.

391
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:38,333
- Oh, my.
- Nice.

392
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,333
- Is this mine?
- Yes.

393
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:41,800
This is Woo-shik's.

394
00:33:41,867 --> 00:33:43,533
This is yours, Woo-shik. I changed it.

395
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,433
- This is your miyeokguk.
- I see.

396
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,500
- This is all for you.
- Gosh.

397
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,133
I'm so loved here.

398
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,867
I'm happy.

399
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,300
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy.

400
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,800
- Thank you, Yu-mi.
- Sure.

401
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,767
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you, Yu-mi.

402
00:33:58,834 --> 00:33:59,734
I'll enjoy it.

403
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,133
Gosh, it's delicious.

404
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:05,266
- Haven't had miyeokguk in ages.
- Isn't that too much curry?

405
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,200
- It's so good.
- Right.

406
00:34:11,734 --> 00:34:13,166
Don't make weird sounds.

407
00:34:15,767 --> 00:34:17,967
It's been ages since I last had miyeokguk.

408
00:34:23,033 --> 00:34:24,667
Goodness.

409
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,700
It feels like my stomach is eased.

410
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,166
This is delicious!

411
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,567
- It's good.
- It's so good.

412
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,433
Delicious.

413
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:40,333
I'll send a photo to my mom.

414
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
My mom might cry seeing the photo.

415
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:51,000
My mom says, "Thank you."

416
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:52,367
She isn't asleep?

417
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:53,834
I probably woke her up.

418
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:57,200
She said, "Where did you get seaweed?"

419
00:34:57,433 --> 00:34:59,400
Tell her I brought it from Seoul.

420
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:00,567
- Really?
- Yes.

421
00:35:00,734 --> 00:35:01,700
Goodness.

422
00:35:03,033 --> 00:35:07,367
Then you made this after grocery shopping?
Or before that?

423
00:35:07,433 --> 00:35:08,266
Before work.

424
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:10,033
- Before grocery shopping.
- Really?

425
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,700
- When?
- It didn't take long.

426
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:15,900
Yu-mi, you are the best.

427
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:21,233
I'm sleepy now after eating this.

428
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,233
I'm a bit tired.

429
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,600
I sweated a lot while eating.

430
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
Hey, it's snowing!

431
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,900
Many things are happening on his birthday.

432
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:46,000
Isn't this your first time seeing snow
on your birthday?

433
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:46,934
Goodness.

434
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,500
It doesn't snow around this time in Korea.

435
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,567
Right, in March.

436
00:35:53,834 --> 00:35:55,867
Everyone, it's my birthday.

437
00:35:55,934 --> 00:35:57,100
I see a drone.

438
00:35:57,967 --> 00:35:59,066
It's here.

439
00:35:59,166 --> 00:36:00,967
The drone is here to see you.

440
00:36:04,867 --> 00:36:06,333
It's coming very close.

441
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,266
We should have the cake.

442
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:10,734
- I really wanted a cake.
- It looked delicious.

443
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
I really wanted to eat it.

444
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:13,667
Since last night.

445
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,266
Honestly, I was expecting something

446
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,767
before I went to bed.

447
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,400
Something like this, at midnight.

448
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,000
But we had nothing.

449
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:26,233
You mean at midnight last night?

450
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,467
Yes. I thought
you guys were bringing a cake

451
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,066
and celebrating.

452
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:34,066
Let's dig in with spoons.
It looks delicious.

453
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,867
Hey. Wow.

454
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:40,033
- Is it good?
- Yes.

455
00:36:40,533 --> 00:36:42,133
No, this is orange.

456
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,033
I see.

457
00:36:44,166 --> 00:36:45,166
What is this?

458
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:47,467
Congrats.

459
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:50,133
I'm 34 years old now.

460
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,700
Do you recall anything special
when you were 34?

461
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,300
- When I was 34?
- Yes.

462
00:36:56,166 --> 00:36:58,066
When I was 34...

463
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:01,233
It was back in 2004.

464
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:04,066
I was filming TV series
like Damo and Phoenix.

465
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,767
- That was almost...
- Goodness...

466
00:37:06,867 --> 00:37:09,734
- It was your golden age.
- Your prime time.

467
00:37:09,834 --> 00:37:13,100
That's when you were at the peak.

468
00:37:13,266 --> 00:37:16,166
They were your major series.

469
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,967
But I was rather sensitive back then.

470
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:23,066
If you miss someone

471
00:37:23,233 --> 00:37:26,900
You will get to meet one day

472
00:37:27,533 --> 00:37:28,767
Like a movie

473
00:37:28,834 --> 00:37:30,467
What song is this?

474
00:37:30,734 --> 00:37:32,400
- Boohwal's song.
- Boohwal's.

475
00:37:32,867 --> 00:37:34,133
"Never Ending Story."

476
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:36,834
I was in middle school, third grade.

477
00:37:38,033 --> 00:37:39,734
"A Story About Rain And You" and "Heeya."

478
00:37:39,834 --> 00:37:40,667
Heeya

479
00:37:40,734 --> 00:37:41,867
"Heeya" is an amazing song.

480
00:37:41,934 --> 00:37:43,934
- Look at me
- Look at me

481
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:48,367
You like me

482
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,567
"Heeya" is a great song.

483
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:53,000
- What's "A Story About Rain And You"?
- It's "Rain And You."

484
00:37:53,066 --> 00:37:53,934
I love you

485
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,333
What's "A Story About Rain And You"?

486
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,233
I love you, I love you

487
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,600
- That song.
- Oh, "I love you."

488
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:01,333
And didn't... Didn't they sing
a lot for your drama shows?

489
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:04,100
That song got popular again
thanks to Phoenix.

490
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:05,700
- "Fate."
- Right, "Fate."

491
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,367
I was 34 during Phoenix.

492
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,166
- Right.
- You were very young.

493
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,400
- Woo-shik's age.
- My age.

494
00:38:15,834 --> 00:38:19,033
That's when Lee Seung Chul quit Boohwal.

495
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:22,200
He released his first solo album.

496
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,600
It was a mega hit.

497
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,033
- What was the name of the song?
- "Don't Say Goodbye."

498
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,934
- I see!
- Right.

499
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:31,266
His album was a mega hit.

500
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:34,233
The songs were all amazing
on his first album.

501
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,367
They were so nice.

502
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:37,734
It perfectly suits the time then.

503
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,233
This voice and this music.

504
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:43,367
This is "Don't Say Goodbye."

505
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,233
- You don't know it?
- No.

506
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,500
I don't know either.

507
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:52,967
- You will know the verse.
- You will know the verse.

508
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,900
His voice sounds very sticky.

509
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,367
Don't move

510
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:02,066
The snow is so pretty.

511
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,934
- It suits the song.
- I know.

512
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,233
It's like...

513
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:10,333
I'd always sing this

514
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,600
when I drank back then.

515
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,600
You did?

516
00:39:14,033 --> 00:39:15,133
Don't say goodbye

517
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,400
I think I know this part.

518
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:22,000
I can remember all the songs

519
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,266
from those days.

520
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,300
But I can't remember the songs these days.

521
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,667
When it comes to songs,
the melody is important too,

522
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:31,400
but I remember each scene of the memory.

523
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,033
- Each scene.
- You mean your memories?

524
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,934
Yes.

525
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:35,467
I have never listened to this song.

526
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:36,834
Do you know this song?

527
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:38,633
"I Even Loved The Pain."

528
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,600
- No.
- You don't?

529
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:41,266
I know "No One Else Like That."

530
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:43,133
- That's Lee Seung Chul's.
- Right.

531
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,600
The song's for a snowy day.

532
00:39:44,667 --> 00:39:46,333
- Whose song?
- Jo Jung Hyun.

533
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,667
Oh, Jo Jung Hyun's.

534
00:39:47,767 --> 00:39:49,133
Snow? What did you say?

535
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,467
"Love My Pain"?

536
00:39:50,567 --> 00:39:53,033
- "I Even Loved The Pain."
- "Love My Pain"?

537
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,667
"I Even Loved The Pain."

538
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:56,300
"I Even Loved The Pain."

539
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,600
We listen to one last song.

540
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:05,867
- Then we clean up.
- We get up.

541
00:40:07,533 --> 00:40:09,367
The day I first met you

542
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,700
I don't know this song.

543
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,233
Without any sound

544
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:17,600
He surely is a type F. NF.

545
00:40:18,567 --> 00:40:19,500
What's that?

546
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,800
He's affective.

547
00:40:21,066 --> 00:40:22,567
- He's affective.
- His eyes are teary.

548
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:24,433
It looks like he's tearing up.

549
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,333
I'm telling you, he's affective.

550
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,734
He just had a flashback.

551
00:40:29,834 --> 00:40:32,734
Seo-jin isn't a type T. He's an F.

552
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,600
He's into the old days.

553
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:36,233
Can you be both type T and type F?

554
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,900
You can be both.

555
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:40,734
But people think you're a type T.

556
00:40:40,834 --> 00:40:43,633
But you're a mix of type N and F.

557
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,200
He surely is a type F.

558
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,166
I was also young then.

559
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:49,900
I was emotional and sensitive.

560
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,500
How old were you then?

561
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:54,233
I was a freshman in college.

562
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:59,033
Your flashback is back again, right?

563
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,233
It's snowing

564
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:06,700
When lonely nights are gone

565
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:13,934
You can hear the morning bells
From far away

566
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:18,533
Loving someone by yourself

567
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,200
Don't say that it's sad

568
00:41:22,133 --> 00:41:23,133
Does it hurt?

569
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,266
It also hurts me.

570
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,000
Please put your hands up.

571
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,400
One, two, three.

572
00:41:35,433 --> 00:41:38,900
Even when my heart aches from loneliness

573
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:41,233
Gosh, let's clean up.

574
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,300
Let's clean up.

575
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,734
I'm so full.

576
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,200
- I even loved the pain
- I even loved...

577
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,000
Hold on, Woo-shik.

578
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:48,800
- Please lift your foot.
- Okay.

579
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,500
- Let's go!
- Let's do this.

580
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,033
I have to stir-fry now.

581
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,667
Great, let's stir-fry.

582
00:41:56,734 --> 00:41:58,000
Stir-fry everything.

583
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,133
I'm nervous.

584
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:46,800
The yolks come out like this.

585
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,900
Yu-mi, you have to season the gomtang.

586
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,433
Oh, it's bland.

587
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,900
- Is it good?
- It's the best.

588
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,266
The best so far.

589
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,867
How does "Invitation Only" work?

590
00:44:00,266 --> 00:44:01,734
For those who helped us.

591
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:06,233
Those who renovated this place
and helped with getting the people.

592
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:07,266
Right.

593
00:44:44,533 --> 00:44:48,066
SORRY, TODAY IS BY INVITATION ONLY

594
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,000
Will it be okay for you?

595
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:52,867
Yes, it worked well yesterday.

596
00:44:52,934 --> 00:44:54,734
- Really?
- Here in the middle...

597
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,633
You can put everything up here.

598
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,467
These are for you to mix.

599
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:26,266
Let's do this.

600
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,800
Sure, let's get it done.

601
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:28,767
We can do this.

602
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:30,767
Today's the first day of serving

603
00:45:30,967 --> 00:45:32,300
yukjeon bibim-guksu.

604
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,333
Are you all ready?

605
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,567
- Yes.
- Yes.

606
00:45:38,467 --> 00:45:40,367
One, two, three. Jinny's Ttukbaegi?

607
00:45:40,433 --> 00:45:41,400
One, two, three.

608
00:45:41,467 --> 00:45:42,967
One, two, three sounds...

609
00:45:43,033 --> 00:45:44,633
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi.
- All right.

610
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:45,867
Don't count slowly.

611
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:48,533
You count it fast like this.
One, two, three.

612
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:50,266
Say it.

613
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:53,300
One, two, three! One, two, three!

614
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,100
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi!
- Let's go!

615
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:12,400
Thank you.

616
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,433
- Can we wait for a few minutes?
- Yeah, yeah.

617
00:47:20,533 --> 00:47:21,867
He's on his way.

618
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:48,433
It probably is "Volli."

619
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,066
There's a hanger here.

620
00:47:53,133 --> 00:47:54,333
Thank you.

621
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:56,667
Thank you.

622
00:47:56,734 --> 00:47:57,967
Thank you.

623
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:05,133
Do you know Korean food well?

624
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,433
Yes, but I haven't been to Korea yet.

625
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,367
I see.

626
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:09,567
- Not yet.
- Right, not yet.

627
00:48:09,633 --> 00:48:10,700
It's on my bucket list.

628
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,233
It's been 20 years since I went to Korea.

629
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,967
So you've been to Korea before.

630
00:48:15,033 --> 00:48:19,266
Yes, it was a very nice trip.

631
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,166
The food was great.

632
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:28,900
Our friend works as a chef in Korea.

633
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,133
- You should go to Korea soon.
- Right.

634
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:33,600
It's on the top of my bucket list.

635
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,000
They are here.

636
00:48:46,066 --> 00:48:47,100
Okay.

637
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,367
I'll just wrap this up.

638
00:50:28,767 --> 00:50:31,533
- Can you bring me some ice?
- Ice?

639
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,633
- Ice here.
- Okay, you can put it there.

640
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:02,100
That man is a famous chef.

641
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,367
- I see.
- And the owner of our lodging.

642
00:51:04,433 --> 00:51:05,767
Oh, really?

643
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:08,166
Me too.

644
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,166
The group is all here.

645
00:54:53,233 --> 00:54:55,266
You should wait that table.

646
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,367
Okay.

647
00:55:23,033 --> 00:55:25,400
- Are you Korean?
- Yes.

648
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,133
- Come in.
- Okay.

649
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:36,900
I want to sit here.

650
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,533
Do you want to sit there?

651
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:48,133
Look at that, Dad. Look!

652
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:53,033
There are so many colors, like the church.

653
00:55:53,166 --> 00:55:55,600
Look at this, Mom.

654
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,433
Look at that. Isn't it pretty?

655
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,400
What is this?

656
00:55:58,467 --> 00:56:00,667
This is stained glass.

657
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,500
Stained glass?

658
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,300
Yes, it's very pretty. Right?

659
00:56:04,367 --> 00:56:06,166
Yes, it's very pretty.

660
00:56:43,533 --> 00:56:46,066
I have no idea
what kind of food we'll have.

661
00:56:46,133 --> 00:56:48,367
- Me too.
- It's going to be interesting.

662
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:53,400
I can't wait to find your work.

663
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,033
It's everywhere. On the shelves...

664
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,000
We can order two or three dishes.

665
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,700
So how does it work?
How long have they been filming?

666
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:52,834
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

667
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,467
I should take this too.

668
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:07,567
Yes, if you want.

669
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,967
Okay, beef galbijjim.

670
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,266
- What do we do?
- What?

671
00:58:42,367 --> 00:58:45,000
- They ordered three yukjeon bibim-guksu.
- What, three?

672
00:58:45,133 --> 00:58:46,767
- Three bibim-guksu.
- Great.

673
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:48,734
One beef galbijjim and one bibimbap.

674
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,967
- Yes.
- One bibimbap.

675
00:58:50,066 --> 00:58:50,900
For the first table?

676
00:58:50,967 --> 00:58:52,800
Make three yukjeon all at once.

677
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,734
Sure.

678
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:56,367
- We have new orders.
- Okay.

679
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,667
That's three beef galbijjim
and four dolsot-bibimbap.

680
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,834
I should boil the noodles
then work on the meat.

681
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:45,934
Should I bring cold water?

682
00:59:46,734 --> 00:59:48,467
Yes, please bring cold water.

683
00:59:48,567 --> 00:59:50,133
In the bowl.

684
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,467
Okay.

685
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,100
Oh, great.

686
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,967
- Good.
- Tell me if you need more water.

687
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:12,433
Yes. This is done.

688
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,734
- This is...
- Table One.

689
01:02:14,433 --> 01:02:15,400
It's cooked already?

690
01:02:15,467 --> 01:02:17,767
- Yes, bibimbap and galbijjim are served.
- For which table?

691
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:19,000
- Table Four.
- Table Four?

692
01:02:24,633 --> 01:02:26,266
- Hold on.
- You're very fast.

693
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:37,734
- Is it done?
- Yes.

694
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:42,233
It's soup.

695
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,500
Is that soup?

696
01:03:49,233 --> 01:03:50,233
Beef broth.

697
01:03:52,367 --> 01:03:54,100
Yes, beef broth.

698
01:04:18,467 --> 01:04:19,900
This tastes so good.

699
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,533
How is it? Spicy?

700
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:23,600
Not so.

701
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:43,633
On a scale of one to ten...
This one's three?

702
01:04:43,767 --> 01:04:45,767
Three. How about you?

703
01:04:45,834 --> 01:04:46,867
No!

704
01:04:46,934 --> 01:04:48,767
How about to you?

705
01:04:48,934 --> 01:04:50,834
- To me, it's seven.
- What, seven?

706
01:04:50,934 --> 01:04:52,000
- Yes.
- Okay, seven.

707
01:06:45,734 --> 01:06:47,800
Food is here. Yes!

708
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:16,266
Gosh, it looks good.

709
01:07:19,867 --> 01:07:21,934
You put rice here, right?

710
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:25,166
No, that's not it.

711
01:07:25,233 --> 01:07:26,967
This is not the correct way?

712
01:07:27,066 --> 01:07:30,867
Eat it like how Mom eats.
It's hard to wrap.

713
01:07:31,033 --> 01:07:32,633
It's a small hot dog.

714
01:07:35,533 --> 01:07:37,400
- He's good.
- Right.

715
01:07:53,133 --> 01:07:55,400
It's really good.

716
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,266
This is delicious.

717
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:12,767
Eggs are...

718
01:08:13,233 --> 01:08:15,133
It's covered with eggs.

719
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,033
The meat is wrapped with eggs.

720
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:18,767
Yes, this beef.

721
01:08:18,834 --> 01:08:20,133
This tastes so good.

722
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:36,200
Is it good or not?

723
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,800
This one that's wrapped with eggs...
It's so good.

724
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,900
Don't touch it.
You should just look at it.

725
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:36,233
- Wow.
- Be gentle.

726
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:38,533
It's so pretty.

727
01:09:38,633 --> 01:09:41,567
- I'm looking at it.
- Right, you can look at it.

728
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:43,600
It's so pretty.

729
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:46,500
Is it so pretty?
What's the prettiest thing here?

730
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:50,100
- Ready? Can I take your order?
- Yes.

731
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:09,500
Two.

732
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:48,066
Orders.

733
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:50,667
Here are the orders.

734
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,734
- We have orders.
- Okay.

735
01:11:54,266 --> 01:11:58,767
We have to make three yukjeon bibim-guksu.

736
01:12:42,834 --> 01:12:44,967
It looks like a noodle restaurant.

737
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:50,233
Amazing.

738
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:03,567
The noodles are well boiled.

739
01:13:25,333 --> 01:13:27,967
That's two dolsot-bibimbap for Table Five.

740
01:13:31,233 --> 01:13:33,667
- For which table?
- Watch out. Bibimbap coming through.

741
01:13:33,734 --> 01:13:35,700
- Bibimbap for Table Five.
- For Table Five.

742
01:14:10,633 --> 01:14:11,467
We're done.

743
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:13,000
One round is done.

744
01:14:13,066 --> 01:14:14,867
I'll turn off the heat.

745
01:14:18,834 --> 01:14:19,667
What is it?

746
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:21,500
- Coffee.
- Goodness, thank you.

747
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:33,467
Beef galbijjim.

748
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:57,367
The crispy rice on the bottom is the best.

749
01:15:57,433 --> 01:15:58,533
Oh, you have that?

750
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:01,100
- Yes.
- Do you have a name for that?

751
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,033
Nurungji!

752
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:02,934
Nurungji?

753
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:04,166
Nu-rung-ji.

754
01:16:04,233 --> 01:16:05,500
- Nurungji.
- Nurungji.

755
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,400
- Do you want to try some beef?
- Yes.

756
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:19,100
Gochujang?

757
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:20,633
It is gochujang?

758
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,233
What is this?

759
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:49,600
Omija ade. It's really good.

760
01:18:49,667 --> 01:18:51,967
I want to have omija ade.

761
01:18:52,100 --> 01:18:53,867
Do you want to have omija ade?

762
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,400
This is not a straw.

763
01:18:58,467 --> 01:18:59,967
But try it. Is it good?

764
01:19:09,834 --> 01:19:12,300
- Are you going to share this?
- Yes, here.

765
01:19:12,367 --> 01:19:13,900
I'll put it in the middle.

766
01:20:17,133 --> 01:20:18,900
Dip it in the sauce.

767
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:37,266
Yes, this is it.

768
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,867
You're so cute when you eat like that.

769
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,700
Nice.

770
01:20:51,867 --> 01:20:53,400
I knew you would love it.

771
01:21:16,767 --> 01:21:18,233
- Nice.
- Nice.

772
01:21:19,533 --> 01:21:20,667
Isn't it delicious?

773
01:21:20,734 --> 01:21:22,066
It's delicious!

774
01:21:27,166 --> 01:21:28,433
It's so tasty.

775
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,100
Excellent.

776
01:21:36,567 --> 01:21:38,567
Isn't this fritter so good?

777
01:21:39,567 --> 01:21:41,700
You have to eat it with the fritter.

778
01:21:49,767 --> 01:21:50,700
It's so good.

779
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:55,066
This is my favorite.

780
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:01,934
The meat is so good.

781
01:22:02,467 --> 01:22:04,734
The vegetables are unbelievable.

782
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,934
These vegetable fritters...

783
01:22:29,266 --> 01:22:30,800
It's good.

784
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,200
Super tasty.

785
01:22:39,767 --> 01:22:41,266
I love the kimchi.

786
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:44,633
Finally, a good kimchi.

787
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,367
It's like he read my mind.

788
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:10,233
Is it good?

789
01:23:10,767 --> 01:23:12,166
It's really good.

790
01:23:19,734 --> 01:23:20,800
This is so good.

791
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,333
I think this is
the most delicious one. Yukjeon.

792
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:28,800
Okay. Noodles with the meat.

793
01:24:11,266 --> 01:24:12,233
Superb.

794
01:24:14,233 --> 01:24:16,734
It would be good to have when we are sick.

795
01:24:17,700 --> 01:24:20,200
- Thanks for the meal.
- Are you sure you had enough?

796
01:24:20,266 --> 01:24:22,333
No. It was more than enough.

797
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,400
Should we order dessert?

798
01:24:24,467 --> 01:24:25,300
Yes.

799
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:39,500
One twibap ice cream.

800
01:24:39,567 --> 01:24:40,934
Green plum...

801
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,166
One green plum ade.

802
01:24:42,233 --> 01:24:43,500
- Green plum ade.
- Yes.

803
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:44,433
One each?

804
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:45,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

805
01:25:41,967 --> 01:25:44,400
- Three spoons?
- No, this is for the baby.

806
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:45,333
Oh, the baby.

807
01:25:47,433 --> 01:25:48,600
Thank you.

808
01:25:49,633 --> 01:25:50,567
Alan.

809
01:25:54,967 --> 01:25:56,700
You have to say, "Thank you."

810
01:25:57,166 --> 01:25:58,300
Thank you.

811
01:26:14,667 --> 01:26:17,100
Alan, what are you doing?

812
01:26:23,433 --> 01:26:25,900
The title of the episode...

813
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,100
"Babysitting in Iceland."

814
01:26:48,867 --> 01:26:50,600
- These are beans.
- Beans?

815
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,700
I've never had beans with ice cream.

816
01:27:06,166 --> 01:27:11,934
I think this is the elder guy
next to the table.

817
01:27:17,767 --> 01:27:19,400
Yes, he has dimples too.

818
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,467
Even the hair style...

819
01:27:22,033 --> 01:27:24,633
Dimples and eyebrows.

820
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:32,533
I think he's the owner or something.

821
01:27:33,133 --> 01:27:34,367
He's very polite.

822
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:35,734
Right.

823
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:40,700
Where do we pay?

824
01:27:42,734 --> 01:27:44,900
The oldest one pays, right?

825
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:46,300
Maybe.

826
01:28:01,934 --> 01:28:04,967
I was telling my wife
that this looks just like you.

827
01:28:05,033 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah, that's me.

828
01:28:06,166 --> 01:28:08,700
- Right? I was right. It's him.
- Yes.

829
01:28:11,266 --> 01:28:13,533
I said, "I'm telling you, that's him!"

830
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,867
- Thank you for the food.
- I hope you enjoyed it.

831
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:37,667
I think you will have Season Three.

832
01:28:37,734 --> 01:28:39,900
I hope so.

833
01:28:39,967 --> 01:28:43,133
Thanks to you guys,
maybe we'll have the third season.

JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

835
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:16,100
It looks like you'll fly away.

836
01:29:16,166 --> 01:29:19,166
The concept for today is "Generous."
You got that?

837
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:22,100
- I'll get it.
- Okay. Be careful.

838
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:24,100
Just trust me.

839
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,300
I'll make bulgogi now.

840
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:34,367
These glass noodles are fresh today.

841
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,166
I have a good feeling about bulgogi.

842
01:29:38,266 --> 01:29:39,700
Bulgogi?

843
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:42,834
Two more bulgogi.

844
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:44,400
- Sorry?
- Two more bulgogi.

845
01:29:44,467 --> 01:29:47,033
Bulgogi is getting great responses.

846
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:50,834
Some people even asked me
how you made the bulgogi.

847
01:29:52,934 --> 01:29:54,567
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

848
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:01,066
What do we do?

849
01:30:01,867 --> 01:30:02,967
What should we do?

850
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,567
- That's two bulgogi.
- It's three.

851
01:30:06,633 --> 01:30:08,900
- We have to make two bulgogi.
- Two bulgogi?

852
01:30:08,967 --> 01:30:11,066
- How come it doesn't get cooked?
- What's going on?

853
01:30:11,133 --> 01:30:13,166
The middle part doesn't get cooked.

854
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,834
This is making me angry.

855
01:30:14,967 --> 01:30:17,200
Where am I?

856
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,066
Where am I?

857
01:30:19,867 --> 01:30:21,233
Relax.

858
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,300
Oh, no!

859
01:30:22,367 --> 01:30:24,000
Hey, be careful.

860
01:30:24,066 --> 01:30:26,700
Help me.

861
01:30:28,433 --> 01:30:30,400
Let's just make it until the end.

862
01:30:30,867 --> 01:30:34,500
I'm watching you

863
01:30:34,567 --> 01:30:37,567
However

864
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:41,567
My eyes keep getting teary

865
01:30:42,233 --> 01:30:47,900
So I can't see you

866
01:30:48,533 --> 01:30:53,667
Please don't say goodbye

867
01:30:53,734 --> 01:30:55,533
We still don't know

868
01:30:56,834 --> 01:31:01,100
What separation is

869
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:05,900
Don't say goodbye

870
01:31:06,433 --> 01:31:08,233
We still don't know

871
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:13,700
What separation is
