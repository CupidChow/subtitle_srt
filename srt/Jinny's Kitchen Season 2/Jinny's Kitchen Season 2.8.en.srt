00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,166
It's my birthday today.

3
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:22,800
I made miyeokguk already.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,567
Happy birthday to me...

5
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:32,900
It's all right.

6
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,367
Thank you.

7
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,967
Hey, it's snowing!

8
00:01:01,333 --> 00:01:04,266
- They ordered three yukjeon bibim-guksu.
- What, three?

9
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:06,033
- Three bibim-guksu.
- Great.

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,266
Boil the noodles, then work on the meat.

11
00:01:12,066 --> 00:01:13,166
It's cooked already?

12
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,233
You're very fast.

13
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,367
We're done.

14
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:16,834
One round is done.

15
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,066
I'll turn off the heat.

16
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:22,266
Now, let me get organized here
before the next orders come in.

17
00:01:30,033 --> 00:01:32,100
I have to wash the dishes next.

18
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,400
- These go to the bin?
- Yes, to the bin.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,767
- Clean the plates.
- We need to make another round.

20
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,800
I have to put them in the dishwasher.

21
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,100
Do we have more?

22
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:39,266
- Both plates of eggs?
- Yes, let's crack them all.

23
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,967
- Is this enough?
- Great.

24
00:02:56,033 --> 00:02:57,300
- This should be enough.
- Great.

25
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:58,200
Done.

26
00:02:58,867 --> 00:03:00,533
Let's kill this yukjeon.

27
00:03:01,467 --> 00:03:02,500
Wait and see.

28
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:13,867
I'll put them in the egg wash.

29
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,467
I'll grill whatever I can now.

30
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,433
Each piece means so much.

31
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:09,734
Someone is here.

32
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,600
The menu is written in Icelandic.

33
00:04:42,934 --> 00:04:45,800
- Yes.
- Great, I'm excited.

34
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,166
Oh, this sounds delicious.

35
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,834
How do you say it? "Bibim"?

36
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,734
Bibimbap.

37
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,934
Bibimbap.

38
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,133
So the rice is at the bottom?

39
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,033
Yeah.

40
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,967
It's served in a stone bowl
called "Ttukbaegi."

41
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:08,400
It's really hot, so the rice continues
to get cooked even when it's served.

42
00:05:08,467 --> 00:05:10,133
You mix everything together.

43
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,166
What are you getting?

44
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,266
I have no idea.

45
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,100
Why don't we order everything and try all?

46
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,100
- Of course. Shall we do that?
- That sounds fun.

47
00:05:29,266 --> 00:05:31,100
Where are the other two?

48
00:05:42,433 --> 00:05:44,500
- There they are.
- They're there.

49
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,166
How have you been?

50
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:28,633
- It's very mouthwatering. It's crazy.
- Right.

51
00:06:52,433 --> 00:06:54,900
And ice cream after the meal.

52
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:56,066
- Three, please.
- Three.

53
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,967
Two beef galbijjim.

54
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,867
One yukjeon.

55
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,300
One bibimbap.

56
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,734
One kkori-gomtang.

57
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:08,834
All dishes.

58
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,233
Two yukjeon.

59
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:14,433
One more gomtang and dolsot.

60
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,934
One more kkori-gomtang.

61
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,500
Let's cook beef galbijjim first.

62
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,400
Sure.

63
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:23,000
- Beef galbijjim...
- This...

64
00:07:23,066 --> 00:07:24,000
Give me that.

65
00:07:28,834 --> 00:07:30,800
- For two portions?
- Yes, two portions.

66
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,934
It's done.

67
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:32,533
- Omija tea?
- Yes.

68
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,033
Are we having soju too?

69
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,133
Hold on.

70
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:42,867
What are we having again?

71
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,934
That's three of us.

72
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Soju? It's like we're in Korea.

73
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,100
- Right.
- Yes.

74
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:51,000
We're in Korea again.

75
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,633
- This tea is really good.
- Really?

76
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,967
- Can I try it?
- Sure.

77
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Can I try it too?

78
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:31,800
This is nice.

79
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,567
Oh, it has honey in it. It's sweet.

80
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,967
It tastes very nice.

81
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,800
I think they'll make somaek.

82
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:42,767
Right.

83
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,166
- What's that called?
- It's soju.

84
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,767
No, you have to shake it first.

85
00:09:57,834 --> 00:09:59,467
I can't.

86
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:04,467
Hold it upside down. Grab the head.

87
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:08,400
Then you suddenly stop,
and you'll get a swirl.

88
00:10:08,533 --> 00:10:10,567
- What?
- You're good.

89
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:18,500
- Are you mixing it with beer?
- Yes.

90
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,000
I get to see new things each time.

91
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:31,934
Right.

92
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,266
You have to mix it well.

93
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,533
How about we use chopsticks?

94
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,500
They do that in Korea.
But it's embarrassing to do it here.

95
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,400
- I just can't do it.
- I get you.

96
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,367
- Like this?
- Yes.

97
00:10:44,433 --> 00:10:47,367
You poke it with a chopstick.

98
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,834
Poke it down.

99
00:10:49,367 --> 00:10:51,400
- What do you mean by that?
- Just poke it.

100
00:10:51,467 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay, you got it. Thank you.

101
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,233
What are you talking about? Poke what?

102
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,033
- Let's toast.
- Sure, cheers.

103
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:01,467
Cheers to those who invited us.

104
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:03,300
How do you say that in Korean?

105
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,200
Gunbae.

106
00:11:04,266 --> 00:11:05,433
- Gunbae.
- Gunbae.

107
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:11,266
Got it.

108
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
Is the heat on?

109
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:39,166
One, two. These two can be served first.

110
00:11:57,033 --> 00:11:58,800
Which dish will be done first?

111
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:01,400
The first order can be served together.

112
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:02,433
Okay.

113
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,433
- Kkori-gomtang is ready.
- Okay.

114
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,700
Kkori-gomtang for Table Three.

115
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,600
Okay.

116
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,133
Bibimbap for Table Three coming through.

117
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,700
Done.

118
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:21,166
- Decorate beef galbijjim.
- It's coming.

119
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,100
Beef galbijjim for Table Three.

120
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,467
This is kkori-gomtang for Table Four.

121
00:12:41,533 --> 00:12:42,834
Bibimbap for Table Four.

122
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,500
- Bibimbap for Table Four.
- Yes.

123
00:12:44,567 --> 00:12:45,967
- Yukjeon?
- Yes, it's all ready.

124
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,800
- Table Three?
- This is for Table Four.

125
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,800
How did you make yukjeon so quickly?

126
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:51,900
How did you make this one first?

127
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:54,166
- Well...
- She made yukjeon in advance.

128
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:57,533
I think you should slow down.

129
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,333
I mean...

130
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,133
Woo-shik, they're here.

131
00:13:33,266 --> 00:13:34,967
This is my seat.

132
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,500
That's your seat.

133
00:14:09,367 --> 00:14:11,667
This place is so pretty.

134
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,266
Bibimbap.

135
00:14:31,667 --> 00:14:33,100
The lamp is very pretty.

136
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:35,400
- If we move this...
- No.

137
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,934
What is this?

138
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:40,333
That's our microphone.

139
00:14:43,467 --> 00:14:45,533
It's like a James Bond series.

140
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,400
- Like a taco?
- Yes, like a taco.

141
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,867
This is exciting. Can we have one each?

142
00:15:41,934 --> 00:15:43,333
We can start with kkori-gomtang.

143
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:56,433
It's like a modified version
of Icelandic meat soup.

144
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:57,633
Right!

145
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,100
But it tastes so much better.

146
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,300
Right.

147
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,600
- We all just went for the sauce.
- We're all greedy.

148
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,867
Nobody is respecting the elder one here.

149
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,133
This is really good.

150
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,633
Dip the oxtail in the sauce. It's amazing.

151
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:27,567
- Do I eat it with this?
- That's right.

152
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:28,900
This looks amazing.

153
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,734
It's very good. The seaweed is so good.

154
00:16:35,633 --> 00:16:37,700
- You can have it first.
- Thank you.

155
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:42,166
You're the only one
who allows me to eat at this table.

156
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,934
No, mom.

157
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,934
I just made one mistake. Just once.

158
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,533
- He was the only one who did that.
- She'll never forget this.

159
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,033
Shall I have one of this?

160
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,533
This is very good.

161
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:05,200
It's not this tasty

162
00:17:06,533 --> 00:17:09,834
- Is this just vegetable?
- It's very succulent and crispy.

163
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,700
It's delicious.

164
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,633
This beef is amazing.

165
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,834
Beef galbijjim is surely delicious.

166
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,633
It's good. You can easily remove
the meat from the bone.

167
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,100
Are these noodles and fried eggs?

168
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:30,500
No, there's meat too.

169
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,934
This tastes good.

170
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,300
Everything is so good.

171
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,800
Yes, these are all so good.

172
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,367
Who invented this?

173
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:51,467
This is very interesting.

174
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:55,500
I've never had these when I was in Korea.

175
00:17:56,934 --> 00:17:59,233
It's funny how I get to have them here.

176
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,600
Mom, is there meat between my teeth?

177
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,066
- Yes, some.
- Right.

178
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:21,367
- Seo-jin.
- Yes?

179
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,367
Where did you get this?

180
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,767
Get one for me too.

181
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:34,200
- Do you want one too?
- Yes.

182
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:46,433
We all have something between our teeth.

183
00:18:46,567 --> 00:18:49,533
This is why I'm happy
I have gaps between my teeth.

184
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,433
Right, you don't need to use toothpicks.

185
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:55,066
Not the bottom ones. They don't have gaps.

186
00:18:55,133 --> 00:18:56,967
I eat with my upper teeth only.

187
00:18:58,767 --> 00:19:00,800
- Just with your upper teeth?
- Yes.

188
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:01,934
That's very odd.

189
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,333
Orders.

190
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:29,133
Table Five.

191
00:19:29,734 --> 00:19:32,133
- Just for Table Five now, right?
- Yes.

192
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,934
I can make it quick.
Just two kkori-gomtang...

193
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,934
How many pieces of meat
for kkori-gomtang should I get?

194
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,900
About three or four pieces
depending on the sizes.

195
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,367
Okay, three or four pieces
depending on the sizes.

196
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:49,100
What a relief.

197
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,967
Let the kkori-gomtang boil hard.

198
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,400
Kkori-gomtang.

199
00:21:02,033 --> 00:21:04,166
- It looks so...
- I'll make one for you later.

200
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,567
It looks so delicious.

201
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:08,100
I want to get off work and eat it.

202
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,333
Kkori-gomtang.

203
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,166
Coming through.

204
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,000
- Is it bibimbap?
- Yes.

205
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,200
I'll leave it here.

206
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,734
- Finished.
- Finished.

207
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,734
- Done.
- Done.

208
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:04,700
Done.

209
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,100
It's done.

210
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:16,633
So, who's having this?

211
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,600
Beef?

212
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,600
He's very kind.

213
00:22:49,667 --> 00:22:52,567
Is this a small tortilla?
It looks like one.

214
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:53,767
It looks delicious.

215
00:22:53,834 --> 00:22:55,433
Look how well it's plated.

216
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:57,467
Like spaghetti.

217
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,533
No, it was so pretty.

218
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,333
It's so good, isn't it?

219
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,667
What is this?

220
00:23:17,033 --> 00:23:18,633
- Isn't it beef?
- It's meat.

221
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,700
I love this type of Korean food.

222
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
It's really good.

223
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,400
This is the best grilled pancake
I've ever had.

224
00:23:36,133 --> 00:23:37,700
I love this. It's so good.

225
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,467
"Dolsot-bibimbap."

226
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,066
Let's try this.

227
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,233
The plating is so good.

228
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,667
Remember how we talked about colors?

229
00:23:48,734 --> 00:23:50,333
It has all sorts of colors.

230
00:23:50,834 --> 00:23:55,367
Korean food has a lot of colors.

231
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,967
Does it have spinach?

232
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,834
Doesn't the rice look good?

233
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,867
Sesame...

234
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,133
I love this rice.

235
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,700
The rice is so good.

236
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:17,367
There's sesame oil in the rice.

237
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,800
I love the noodles.

238
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,300
I loved the pancake as well.

239
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:31,333
And I love how we get to try
all these together at once.

240
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,967
We should give them a pass.

241
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,900
So everyone likes the food.

242
00:24:50,233 --> 00:24:53,000
We should invite them
to Bæjarins Beztu Pylsur.

243
00:24:53,467 --> 00:24:56,767
"I work here. Come try a hot dog."
Talk to him like this.

244
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,266
We should order ice cream now.

245
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,633
Could you raise your hand, my brother?

246
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,567
Say, "Hi," and smile.

247
00:25:08,433 --> 00:25:10,000
Can we have two ice cream?

248
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:42,633
It's 73 years old.

249
00:25:44,567 --> 00:25:45,633
I recommend it.

250
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:48,333
Look. That cart is for us.

251
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:50,233
Right.

252
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,834
Look how pretty it's arranged.

253
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,367
So well-arranged.

254
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,533
The hot dog must be really good.

255
00:25:58,834 --> 00:25:59,667
Right?

256
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:01,700
I should get one on my way home.

257
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,400
Let's give them less work.

258
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:46,033
They ordered ice cream.
Three here and two there.

259
00:27:17,266 --> 00:27:19,066
This tastes very interesting.

260
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,533
It's amazing how it's not too sweet.

261
00:27:23,633 --> 00:27:26,133
- But it's good. I like it.
- Yes, it's good.

262
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,433
There'll be three more bibim-guksu.

263
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,567
- What?
- What?

264
00:27:33,633 --> 00:27:34,633
Really?

265
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:36,533
There'll be three more bibim-guksu.

266
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,633
- What?
- What?

267
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,734
Really?

268
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,834
Just kidding.

269
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,567
- Just kidding.
- I'm going to kill you.

270
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,734
We were about to work on something else!

271
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:02,600
Gosh, he scared me.

272
00:28:02,667 --> 00:28:04,967
It suddenly hurts here.

273
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,066
I'll get back at you tomorrow.

274
00:28:09,934 --> 00:28:12,700
My shoulders are suddenly so stiff.

275
00:28:17,433 --> 00:28:19,000
Gosh, my legs.

276
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:21,533
That man with glasses. That old man...

277
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
He worked on the electricity here.

278
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,433
Isn't one of them a chef
from the ramen place?

279
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,834
Which one is the chef?

280
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,533
- The one in white knit.
- I see.

281
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,300
They had two bottles of soju, right?

282
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,900
Two soju, four beer.

283
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,533
- My gosh.
- Somaek.

284
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,700
They drink somaek?

285
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,467
But look at this.
These guys on the soju glasses.

286
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,066
Mom, look.

287
00:28:50,934 --> 00:28:53,967
Look how they respect the elders.

288
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:59,600
Mom, you should know we respect you.

289
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:01,467
Let's toast.

290
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:03,700
- Gunbae.
- Gunbae.

291
00:29:03,767 --> 00:29:05,200
- Gunbae.
- Gunbae.

292
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:06,834
Thanks for coming tonight.

293
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,400
Thank you for having us.

294
00:29:18,266 --> 00:29:19,333
Take them.

295
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,400
Not everything, just us three.

296
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,800
Thank you so much.

297
00:30:12,266 --> 00:30:15,400
Just a bit.

298
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,800
- What?
- What?

299
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:17,900
Santa is coming!

300
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,467
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

301
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,233
- Min-si, please bring Woo-shik.
- Woo-shik.

302
00:30:31,767 --> 00:30:34,533
Woo-shik, hot dogs.

303
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,967
- What?
- Hot dogs.

304
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,000
Hot dogs? Where?

305
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:40,500
They bought us hot dogs.

306
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:43,033
Hot dogs. They got us hot dogs.

307
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:45,667
What? Hot dogs?

308
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,567
They got us hot dogs?

309
00:30:49,633 --> 00:30:50,934
They bought hot dogs?

310
00:30:53,934 --> 00:30:55,467
- Woo-shik, here.
- You got hot dogs?

311
00:30:55,533 --> 00:30:57,433
- You have hot dogs?
- Hot dogs?

312
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,100
That's the famous hot dog.

313
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,133
Happy birthday

314
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,467
- To you
- To you

315
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,567
Thank you.

316
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:03,500
Happy birthday to you

317
00:31:03,567 --> 00:31:04,734
- To you
- To you

318
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,266
Thank you.

319
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:08,467
Happy birthday to you

320
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,633
Thank you.

321
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,333
I'll work hard!

322
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:13,734
From the 73-year-old place?

323
00:31:24,333 --> 00:31:25,400
This is good.

324
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,633
It's not super special, but it's good.

325
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,066
No, it's super great.

326
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:35,867
It's delicious!

327
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,433
What is this?
Is it hot sauce with mayonnaise?

328
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,667
What sauce is this?

329
00:31:45,734 --> 00:31:47,300
It's delicious.

330
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,033
Have your hot dog.

331
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,033
- Is it our dinner?
- You like stuff like this.

332
00:31:59,467 --> 00:32:01,166
Oh, it's delicious.

333
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,633
It's tasty.

334
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,667
- It's very simple but tasty.
- Yes.

335
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,533
It's delicious.

336
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:09,734
- Everyone left.
- They did?

337
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,433
Yu-mi, good job.

338
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:20,600
Well done.

339
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,533
What do we do tomorrow?

340
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,333
We open for lunch and dinner.

341
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
We might have to come at 7:00 a.m.

342
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,834
We have to prepare 40 portions each.

343
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,767
How about we only do
the spicy version for galbijjim tomorrow?

344
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,934
How about that?
Tomorrow is Woo-shik's day.

345
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,867
I'll make spicy beef galbijjim for lunch.

346
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:45,967
No bulgogi tomorrow for lunch?

347
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:49,133
Well, I can make that for lunch too.

348
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,033
From lunch?

349
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,100
- You're the best.
- Yes.

350
00:33:12,266 --> 00:33:13,867
Ttukbaegi bulgogi is ready.

351
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:20,767
Let's go.

352
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,133
Let's go, Seo-jin.

353
00:34:13,767 --> 00:34:15,300
I'll go to bed, good night.

354
00:34:15,367 --> 00:34:16,834
- Good night.
- Good night.

355
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:12,834
What?

356
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,066
It doesn't fall.

357
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,567
It still doesn't fall.
I think I could run with this on.

358
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,967
It's so moisturizing.

359
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,467
- Hi, Min-si.
- Hello.

360
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,800
You only have two days to go.

361
00:35:50,867 --> 00:35:52,633
- I can't believe this.
- How do you feel?

362
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,033
Time does pass.

363
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,500
I will miss this place a lot,
back in Korea.

364
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:03,600
- Hello, Chef.
- Hi.

365
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:05,100
Did everyone sleep well?

366
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:06,467
There is a rumor.

367
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,066
- What?
- That you are nervous.

368
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:09,800
- I'm nervous?
- He went to bed

369
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:10,700
at 11:30 p.m.

370
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,834
- I'll rely on Min-si today.
- No.

371
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:16,934
Let's go now.

372
00:36:17,033 --> 00:36:19,700
I'll see you in a bit.

373
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:21,400
Let's go!

374
00:36:29,734 --> 00:36:32,967
Once I start running, I can't stop.

375
00:36:43,934 --> 00:36:47,567
Hey, look at me

376
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,066
What?

377
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:55,967
Gosh, it's so cold.

378
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,033
Are we selling gomtang today?

379
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,433
Yes, we are.

380
00:37:38,967 --> 00:37:39,900
- Woo-shik.
- Yes.

381
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,300
Tell the hygiene rules.

382
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,400
- What?
- The rules.

383
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,333
- The rules.
- The rules.

384
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:48,100
- Do you need a rubber band, Min-si?
- Yes.

385
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,467
One.

386
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:53,667
Keep it hygienic at all times.

387
00:37:53,734 --> 00:37:55,333
- Hygienic.
- Hygienic.

388
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:02,533
Four, clean all cooking tools after work.

389
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,567
- Clean them.
- Clean them.

390
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:06,400
Five, Ask always you're...

391
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,166
No, I mean...

392
00:38:08,266 --> 00:38:10,166
Always ask.

393
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:11,700
- Always ask.
- Always ask.

394
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:14,066
Shoot it with this when you shout.

395
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:16,934
Let's go!

396
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,000
I think we should put it like this.

397
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,533
- All right.
- Where am I?

398
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
Find your spots.

399
00:38:24,867 --> 00:38:25,700
All right.

400
00:38:25,767 --> 00:38:27,633
Make sure your faces are shown.

401
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:28,967
- All right.
- One, Two, Three.

402
00:38:29,033 --> 00:38:30,233
- Jinny's?
- Ttukbaegi.

403
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,900
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi.
- Please.

404
00:38:31,967 --> 00:38:33,066
Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

405
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,800
Let's go, "Jinny's Ttukbaegi."

406
00:38:34,867 --> 00:38:35,934
- Okay.
- To the air.

407
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,967
- Okay.
- Right.

408
00:38:37,033 --> 00:38:39,600
- One, Two, Three. Jinny's Ttukbaegi!
- To the bottom!

409
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:40,867
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

410
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,767
- To the bottom!
- Let's go, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

411
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,834
Let's go!

412
00:38:49,233 --> 00:38:50,066
All right.

413
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,867
You're on kkori-gomtang today, yes?

414
00:38:53,467 --> 00:38:54,300
Yes.

415
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:00,734
Kkori.

416
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,900
So the kkori...

417
00:39:24,967 --> 00:39:26,433
Can I do it my way?

418
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:28,400
With my style.

419
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,433
How will you work on it?

420
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:34,667
I want to make broth
with onions and vegetables in a bag.

421
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:36,834
- Min-si.
- Yes?

422
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,033
Do we have carrots?

423
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,700
- Sliced ones?
- No, just whole carrots.

424
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,266
We sliced them all.

425
00:39:42,333 --> 00:39:43,700
We only have sliced ones?

426
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,367
In here... I see carrots here!

427
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:48,300
Great.

428
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:52,333
Do we have whole garlic?

429
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,133
Here it is. Where did you find it?

430
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,500
- Here.
- What was I about to do?

431
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,367
Yu-mi. Can I take these onions?

432
00:39:57,433 --> 00:39:59,166
- Peel them for me then.
- Okay.

433
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,066
I have to prepare for bulgogi too now.

434
00:40:46,967 --> 00:40:49,233
Min-si, you made this last night?

435
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,000
- Yes.
- Okay.

436
00:40:54,934 --> 00:40:59,133
The seasoning sauce for bulgogi
and the mushroom is the same.

437
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:15,567
The seasoning sauce is the same.

438
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:18,333
I'm making it four times as much.
For bulgogi.

439
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:21,934
I have to make four times as much
sauce for bulgogi as well.

440
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:34,266
Seasoning sauce for bulgogi is done!

441
00:41:35,567 --> 00:41:37,633
This sauce is for bulgogi.

442
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,100
Your birthday gift.

443
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,834
- Wow.
- Wow.

444
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:43,667
My birthday gift.

445
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:45,934
Thank you so much.

446
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:47,467
You're the best, Min-si.

447
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:49,200
I mean it.

448
00:41:52,166 --> 00:41:55,200
Should I start marinating the bulgogi now?

449
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,800
I have to add other ingredients too.

450
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,200
Onions?

451
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,834
Yes.

452
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:01,834
How many?

453
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,734
I'll take one onion.

454
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,233
- Take it.
- I'll take two.

455
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,900
- Take them.
- Okay.

456
00:42:10,734 --> 00:42:12,233
I have to get more onions.

457
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:45,266
Onion thieves, bring me back my onions!

458
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,433
Thanks.

459
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:04,233
Let the frying powder get mixed well

460
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:10,734
Vegetables, please be delicious

461
00:43:10,834 --> 00:43:13,767
I think it's good to go.

462
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,700
- I'll pass it to you. Can you cut it?
- Okay.

463
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:32,934
Do you want coffee?

464
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,400
Anyone wants coffee?

465
00:43:34,467 --> 00:43:36,100
- I want iced Americano.
- Me.

466
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,100
- Me.
- My gosh.

467
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:42,867
The weather is good. It's warm.

468
00:43:43,633 --> 00:43:45,533
Is it where you got the toast?

469
00:43:46,133 --> 00:43:47,233
No.

470
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,700
This place is nice.

471
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:50,834
- Here?
- They sell breakfast.

472
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:52,233
The vibe here is nice.

473
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,367
It's pretty.

474
00:44:01,266 --> 00:44:02,600
Let's just get coffee.

475
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:38,734
Nice, coffee.

476
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,266
The straw is blue today.

477
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,000
Oh, my.

478
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:51,467
The carrots are ready.

479
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:54,800
Here, onions.

480
00:44:58,767 --> 00:44:59,600
Done.

481
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,700
Great.

482
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,100
I think we're doing great.

483
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:07,233
Working systematically and all.

484
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,600
Can I take this away?

485
00:45:13,066 --> 00:45:13,900
Yes.

486
00:45:14,767 --> 00:45:16,367
Let's put it here.

487
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,200
I'll do a test run for the bulgogi.

488
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:38,800
Three ladles of vegetable broth.

489
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:47,500
Rice wine.

490
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,100
Great.

491
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:09,967
This should be enough for one portion.

492
00:46:12,667 --> 00:46:13,800
Oh, this...

493
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:40,734
This tastes amazing.

494
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:58,066
How is it?

495
00:46:59,266 --> 00:47:00,767
How does the soup taste?

496
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,633
Is it spicy?

497
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:06,500
It's much better.

498
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:07,500
- Is it?
- Yes.

499
00:47:08,633 --> 00:47:10,133
I added salt. That's why.

500
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,467
But it's not the salt.

501
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:13,667
- It's not?
- No.

502
00:47:13,767 --> 00:47:14,800
It's much better.

503
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:19,433
I can eat kkori-gomtang today too.

504
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,800
It gets different each time.

505
00:47:34,734 --> 00:47:35,867
It's boiling here.

506
00:47:35,934 --> 00:47:37,300
Yes, I'll put these in.

507
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,200
Who are the servers today?

508
00:47:54,266 --> 00:47:55,533
- Me.
- Okay.

509
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,166
Keep smiling.

510
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,100
All right.

511
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:22,066
It's full.

512
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:28,500
Goodness.

513
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,033
It's like concentrate.

514
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,667
It must be easy to drink juice
in the morning with this.

515
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:51,333
I only put in fruit, but it's so good.

516
00:49:42,433 --> 00:49:45,367
I don't think there will be
many customers today.

517
00:49:56,233 --> 00:49:58,600
We'll put up the open sign later, right?

518
00:49:58,667 --> 00:49:59,500
Right.

519
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,767
- Should I pull it in?
- We have to bring it in.

520
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,266
I'll do it.

521
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:09,166
- How do we lift this?
- Just lift it.

522
00:50:13,133 --> 00:50:15,667
We have to put up Woo-shik's picture here.

523
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,100
Right.

524
00:50:31,467 --> 00:50:32,300
Gosh!

525
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:33,700
Gosh!

526
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,266
What? Are people rushing in?

527
00:50:36,333 --> 00:50:37,900
- I was shocked.
- Why?

528
00:50:37,967 --> 00:50:40,567
- There is a long queue outside.
- Really?

529
00:51:01,867 --> 00:51:04,033
The room? No, Table Three.

530
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:05,934
Table Three?

531
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:52,900
- Are they coming in now?
- They'll wait here.

532
00:51:52,967 --> 00:51:54,533
- Right.
- It's cold outside.

533
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:07,133
My hands are freezing.

534
00:52:09,433 --> 00:52:11,033
We still have Table Five left.

535
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:14,233
I think we'll have walk-in customers.

536
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:36,600
Hello. Can I put my name on?

537
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,066
So we will have seven people in the room.

538
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,400
- Seven is fine.
- Let me see.

539
00:53:34,934 --> 00:53:37,633
Today's goal is...

540
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,633
Yes?

541
00:53:39,133 --> 00:53:42,333
- A generous serving...
- A generous serving...

542
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,667
- ...of every dish.
- ...of every dish.

543
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:47,033
- Even if we run out...
- Even if we run out...

544
00:53:47,266 --> 00:53:51,333
- ...for customers in this weather...
- ...for customers in this weather...

545
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,166
- ...be warm...
- ...be warm...

546
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:55,500
- ...and feed them well.
- ...and feed them well.

547
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:56,400
Okay.

548
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:03,667
It's done. Fritters should be enough.

549
00:54:03,734 --> 00:54:05,433
Let's check on the rice now.

550
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:13,066
The rice and the fritters
all look so good today. Seriously.

551
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,767
What's with the rice?

552
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:16,467
It's so well-cooked.

553
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,667
Great. It's going really well.

554
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:25,100
Okay, how about we put two bowls
of ttukbaegi bulgogi on the stove?

555
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,600
Let's get them ready.

556
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,300
That's a great idea.

557
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:29,834
A great idea.

558
00:54:32,467 --> 00:54:33,533
Okay.

559
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,667
Fresh glass noodles.

560
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,800
For one person.

561
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,967
Goodness.

562
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,433
All right.

563
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:52,300
A half ladle of cooking wine.

564
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,734
Just three ladles of vegetable broth.

565
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:15,100
I'll put it on low heat.

566
00:55:16,467 --> 00:55:19,133
It takes a bit of time
to heat up the bowls.

567
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,400
It looks delicious.

568
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
The rice looks great today.

569
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,500
It's amazing.

570
00:55:46,266 --> 00:55:48,033
Today's concept is "Generous."

571
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,233
- Okay?
- Generous.

572
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,867
It's so cold here.

573
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,900
We should warm up their stomachs.

574
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,300
Just trust me.

575
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:02,033
I'm putting a generous amount
of rice in each bowl.

576
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,900
Assistant?

577
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:10,800
Yes?

578
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:13,066
- How many bowls of bibimbap are ready?
- Three.

579
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:14,734
That's great.

580
00:56:14,834 --> 00:56:17,200
- Great.
- All right, great.

581
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:20,700
Min-si, the most important thing today...

582
00:56:20,767 --> 00:56:22,433
The most important... Yikes!

583
00:56:22,533 --> 00:56:24,633
The most important... Yikes!

584
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,800
- This is the most important thing.
- Okay.

585
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:28,233
- It's this.
- Yes.

586
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,033
So it overflows with the lid.

587
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:33,533
Right. Let's take it out.
That's the most important part.

588
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,033
The most important part.

589
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,233
Woo-shik, are you cooking already?

590
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,166
- What?
- Yes, he is.

591
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:54,800
Can we get the customers in now?

592
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,667
Well, okay.

593
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,700
I'll take their orders now.

594
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,233
Sure.

595
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,066
And is it okay to order like that?

596
00:57:40,467 --> 00:57:43,066
We want all the dishes.

597
00:57:58,967 --> 00:58:00,800
- Can I have this one?
- Yes.

598
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,834
- Bibimbap and bulgogi?
- Yes.

599
00:58:14,767 --> 00:58:16,200
- It's in.
- We got orders.

600
00:58:16,266 --> 00:58:19,066
We got orders.

601
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,734
One gomtang, bibimbap,
spicy beef galbijjim and bulgogi.

602
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,834
One each.

603
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,200
Four dishes.

604
00:58:26,266 --> 00:58:28,834
Let's take our time and cook.

605
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:31,166
Dolsot, all set. Gomtang, ready to go.

606
00:58:31,266 --> 00:58:32,800
I should re-fry the fritters.

607
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:35,100
Two kkori, spicy and ttuk-bul.

608
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:37,567
Second orders.

609
00:58:40,633 --> 00:58:43,734
Ttuk... bulbaegi...
What was it called again?

610
00:58:43,834 --> 00:58:45,700
One ttuk bulbaegi and bibimbap.

611
00:58:45,767 --> 00:58:46,834
"Ttuk bulbaegi"?

612
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,433
"Ttuk bulbaegi..."

613
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:53,166
What was it called again?

614
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:54,900
"Ttuk bulgogi."

615
00:59:20,834 --> 00:59:23,800
This is complimentary. One more piece.

616
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:32,367
Yes, I hear the rain drops.

617
00:59:32,467 --> 00:59:34,000
- Is the bibimbap ready?
- Yes.

618
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,467
- It's ready.
- Bibimbap is ready.

619
00:59:36,567 --> 00:59:38,800
- Be careful.
- Be careful. Bibimbap is here.

620
00:59:38,867 --> 00:59:40,767
Please serve the bibimbap first.

621
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:43,333
It's all set.

622
00:59:44,834 --> 00:59:46,900
- Sesame oil.
- Gomtang is also ready.

623
00:59:46,967 --> 00:59:48,667
Okay. One round.

624
00:59:48,767 --> 00:59:50,333
They can go together then.

625
00:59:54,834 --> 00:59:57,400
- One, two, three.
- Okay. You're doing great.

626
00:59:58,567 --> 00:59:59,567
Okay.

627
00:59:59,633 --> 01:00:01,433
Green onions. It's done.

628
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:07,266
Spicy galbijjim will be ready soon.

629
01:00:07,433 --> 01:00:10,233
Open your mouth. Spicy galbijjim is ready.

630
01:00:16,567 --> 01:00:19,867
Spicy beef galbijjim is ready.
I'll pass it to them.

631
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:21,533
- What?
- Wait, it's not done.

632
01:00:22,767 --> 01:00:23,834
Ms. Ko.

633
01:00:23,934 --> 01:00:25,367
- Where is it?
- Could you...

634
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:26,800
- Sesame oil?
- ...give me a sec?

635
01:00:26,867 --> 01:00:27,700
Sure.

636
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,066
Wow, it looks so delicious.

637
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,734
It looks so good. It cannot be bad.
Take it.

638
01:00:44,433 --> 01:00:46,166
This can be served now.

639
01:00:46,233 --> 01:00:47,467
- Let's go. Yes.
- Serve it?

640
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:49,100
Let's serve it.

641
01:00:52,967 --> 01:00:55,266
This is the first ttukbaegi bulgogi.

642
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:57,533
We should garnish it. Green onions?

643
01:00:57,633 --> 01:00:58,467
Okay.

644
01:01:05,967 --> 01:01:08,867
- Here comes the first ttukbaegi bulgogi.
- Will they like it?

645
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:16,066
- It's warm.
- Okay.

646
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,166
The second bulgogi is done.

647
01:01:26,066 --> 01:01:27,633
Shall we start?

648
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,967
- Yes.
- Let's start.

649
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:31,767
From where do we start?
I don't know how to start.

650
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,800
This tastes good.

651
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,433
I love it. I like sweet food.

652
01:01:50,867 --> 01:01:52,700
Get the soup too.

653
01:02:13,867 --> 01:02:14,934
Beef slices.

654
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:18,266
- Should I just put the rice here?
- Yes.

655
01:02:18,967 --> 01:02:20,266
But this is too hot.

656
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:13,133
- So they have bulgogi.
- Right, that's new.

657
01:03:16,433 --> 01:03:17,967
Do you know what you want?

658
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:21,700
- What are you getting?
- This one. Kkori-gomtang soup.

659
01:03:35,667 --> 01:03:37,667
We want it all. No, just kidding.

660
01:03:42,967 --> 01:03:44,800
I'd like soup because I'm cold.

661
01:03:44,867 --> 01:03:46,433
- So I'll get this.
- Okay.

662
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:47,533
Me too. The soup.

663
01:03:50,100 --> 01:03:51,600
And this one for me.

664
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:07,300
This tastes so good.

665
01:04:10,166 --> 01:04:12,800
I love this soup so much.

666
01:04:20,867 --> 01:04:21,734
Well...

667
01:04:38,934 --> 01:04:41,133
They'll order more ttukbaegi bulgogi.

668
01:04:41,934 --> 01:04:43,433
One more order.

669
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:49,500
Hey, look at me

670
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,900
The glass noodles are very fresh today.

671
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,333
We have more orders.

672
01:05:13,433 --> 01:05:14,834
More orders.

673
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,800
Guess what?

674
01:05:15,867 --> 01:05:16,800
Bulgogi.

675
01:05:16,867 --> 01:05:18,433
- That is correct.
- Okay.

676
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,600
We have to make two bulgogi.

677
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,000
Two more bulgogi?

678
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,400
Bulgogi takes long, right?

679
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,867
As soon as bulgogi is on the menu,
they only order bulgogi.

680
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:33,800
Please get cooked soon.

681
01:05:58,166 --> 01:05:59,900
This doesn't get cooked fast.

682
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,700
It doesn't get cooked well in the middle.

683
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,400
Hey, it's boiling.

684
01:06:08,467 --> 01:06:09,367
Hey!

685
01:06:12,266 --> 01:06:14,333
So it overflows if I close the lid.

686
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,300
Right.

687
01:06:21,433 --> 01:06:25,000
Cook it in a big wok.
Then you can make two portions at once.

688
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,066
Are you making a lot in advance?

689
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,500
Yes, it takes too long to cook.

690
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:50,166
No menu can beat bulgogi, right?

691
01:06:51,133 --> 01:06:52,400
Oh, kkori-gomtang.

692
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:53,433
How many pieces?

693
01:06:53,533 --> 01:06:56,166
As many as you want. Generously.

694
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:57,767
- Generously.
- Yes.

695
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:59,367
We'd be sad...

696
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:02,233
if gomtang is left over.

697
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,266
- The meat might get torn, careful.
- I'll be careful.

698
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:18,867
Treat it gentle, like a baby.

699
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,233
Treat it like a baby.

700
01:07:22,767 --> 01:07:24,400
Please get cooked fast.

701
01:07:28,266 --> 01:07:30,266
- Okay, it's ready.
- Let's serve it.

702
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:31,200
These guys...

703
01:07:31,934 --> 01:07:33,133
I'll scoop the rice.

704
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:40,533
- Bulgogi is for Table Four too?
- Yes.

705
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,567
For both Table Four and Table One.

706
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:44,900
Let's serve this to Table One,

707
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:46,500
and that to Table Four.

708
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,266
We need two bowls for Table Four.

709
01:07:48,333 --> 01:07:49,500
- Bulgogi?
- Yes.

710
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,800
Three bowls in total.

711
01:07:51,867 --> 01:07:53,166
- Oh, is it three?
- Yes.

712
01:07:53,266 --> 01:07:54,333
Three bowls?

713
01:07:58,967 --> 01:08:02,467
- Three portions earlier...
- Right, I was working on it.

714
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:05,166
Relax.

715
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:06,066
- Relax.
- No!

716
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,033
Hey!

717
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,033
No!

718
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:10,200
It's hot. You must be careful.

719
01:08:10,266 --> 01:08:11,667
- For Tables One and Two.
- Get out!

720
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:15,367
It's distracting.

721
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,633
Great.

722
01:08:23,333 --> 01:08:25,367
Did you stir-fry the meat earlier?

723
01:08:25,433 --> 01:08:26,400
- Yes.
- Maybe that's why.

724
01:08:26,467 --> 01:08:27,767
- It is cooked.
- Right?

725
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:29,367
Yes. Let's serve it.

726
01:08:34,767 --> 01:08:36,600
- It's cooked.
- You can serve it.

727
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:37,934
Okay.

728
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,433
One, two, three. Green onions.

729
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,867
You can leave that out.

730
01:08:49,233 --> 01:08:50,633
Is Woo-shik doing okay?

731
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:53,600
- Is he?
- He's making people laugh.

732
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,133
Should I wait until you two...

733
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,467
Maybe we'll visit next year.

734
01:09:32,667 --> 01:09:35,400
I want to go this year.
But he says next year.

735
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:41,300
I'm especially excited about the food.

736
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:52,633
We have been watching a lot of shows too.

737
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,900
Especially, I love this part...

738
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,734
Where the family sits together.

739
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:00,834
They always put the food in the middle.

740
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,633
And I love when they give each other
the food.

741
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,233
I found that so sweet.

742
01:10:18,633 --> 01:10:20,900
My gosh, this is so good.

743
01:10:26,033 --> 01:10:27,300
This is crazy.

744
01:10:28,166 --> 01:10:32,700
This can warm my frozen hands.

745
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,033
I hope it helps.

746
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,133
Are you still cold?

747
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:43,800
How can this be so good?

748
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,200
They have a different type of...

749
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,367
Glass noodles.
It's different from what we had.

750
01:11:00,467 --> 01:11:02,066
They're super good.

751
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,400
Glass noodles are similar to rice noodles.

752
01:11:07,467 --> 01:11:10,367
- But they are not, right?
- No.

753
01:12:40,266 --> 01:12:44,333
I can't wait to try it in Korea.

754
01:12:44,433 --> 01:12:49,367
Each family has their own way
to make kimchi, it seems.

755
01:12:49,433 --> 01:12:53,400
We have seen that moms have
different recipes.

756
01:13:20,367 --> 01:13:22,266
We also love seafood.

757
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:25,667
They have amazing seafood there also.

758
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:37,266
Most likely.

759
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:41,467
I watched this show called
Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha.

760
01:13:43,066 --> 01:13:46,934
The things they eat in small provinces
look so good.

761
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:50,200
This is so good. But it's too hot.

762
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:01,100
It's so delicious.

763
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,400
"Neomu masisseoyo."

764
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,834
- "Neomu masisseoyo."
- Right.

765
01:14:15,333 --> 01:14:16,467
"Neomu masisseoyo."

766
01:14:18,934 --> 01:14:19,834
Thank you.

767
01:14:22,033 --> 01:14:23,767
- It's so good.
- Thank you.

768
01:14:24,433 --> 01:14:25,367
Thank you.

769
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:28,400
We need to remember that one.

770
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:29,667
Yes.

771
01:14:29,767 --> 01:14:32,934
When we go to Seoul, and we're like,

772
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:34,667
"Neomu masisseoyo."

773
01:14:34,734 --> 01:14:36,400
This is, "Neomu masisseoyo."

774
01:14:36,467 --> 01:14:37,834
This is delicious too.

775
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,166
"Ade"?

776
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,066
Green plum ade.

777
01:15:43,133 --> 01:15:45,433
- Green plum ade?
- Green plum ade.

778
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:52,400
- Should I practice?
- What would you like?

779
01:15:52,500 --> 01:15:54,533
I was born in the States.
My Korean isn't so good.

780
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:55,734
It's fine.

781
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:57,233
Can we take food away?

782
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,567
We don't do takeaway.

783
01:16:00,734 --> 01:16:02,667
I just miss Korean food so much.

784
01:16:02,734 --> 01:16:04,600
Well...

785
01:16:04,767 --> 01:16:07,800
- One kkori-gomtang.
- All right.

786
01:16:11,934 --> 01:16:12,934
- You'll share three.
- Yes.

787
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:14,400
- They'll have one each.
- Right.

788
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:35,500
There is no original beef galbijjim today.

789
01:16:35,567 --> 01:16:37,367
- Just spicy one, right?
- We can make it.

790
01:16:37,433 --> 01:16:38,433
- You can?
- Yes.

791
01:16:38,533 --> 01:16:40,100
- Can you make one for her?
- Sure.

792
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:42,166
I'll just key in two spicy beef galbijjim.

793
01:16:42,233 --> 01:16:44,233
One normal and one spicy galbijjim.

794
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:47,266
- I'll cook it myself.
- Okay.

795
01:16:47,333 --> 01:16:49,867
- So they ordered five dishes?
- Yes.

796
01:16:49,934 --> 01:16:52,066
The Korean guy wanted to eat it all.

797
01:16:59,567 --> 01:17:02,567
It would be perfect
if someone orders bulgogi now.

798
01:17:02,734 --> 01:17:04,467
Please someone order bulgogi.

799
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,000
They ordered beef galbijjim.
But I'll cook.

800
01:17:08,867 --> 01:17:10,033
I'll make it.

801
01:17:14,033 --> 01:17:16,467
- No bulgogi.
- There're two more bulgogi.

802
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:17,734
- What?
- Two bulgogi.

803
01:17:28,567 --> 01:17:31,500
One kkori-gomtang and two bulgogi.

804
01:17:32,033 --> 01:17:33,700
Spicy beef galbijjim.

805
01:17:33,767 --> 01:17:35,734
One spicy and one original.

806
01:17:35,834 --> 01:17:38,600
Then I have to re-fry
four vegetable fritters.

807
01:17:45,467 --> 01:17:47,567
- Put gomtang on the stove.
- Here.

808
01:17:47,633 --> 01:17:49,800
Good, you're doing great.

809
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:55,967
One spicy beef galbijjim
and one original one.

810
01:18:00,700 --> 01:18:02,066
Add a lot of mushroom.

811
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:27,867
The veggie fritters are very crispy today.

812
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:28,767
Right.

813
01:18:29,367 --> 01:18:30,433
- Done.
- Great.

814
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:32,600
- Great. Okay.
- I'll serve them now.

815
01:18:34,133 --> 01:18:35,400
Is the bulgogi ready?

816
01:18:35,467 --> 01:18:37,934
Bulgogi is done. It's ready to be served.

817
01:18:38,667 --> 01:18:41,033
I put a lot of meat in here.

818
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:43,934
It's hot.

819
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:49,166
- Gomtang is ready.
- Gomtang is ready too.

820
01:18:50,166 --> 01:18:51,700
- Gomtang.
- Watch out.

821
01:18:53,066 --> 01:18:55,233
- Be careful.
- It's hot.

822
01:18:56,533 --> 01:18:59,133
Gomtang and bulgogi.

823
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,600
It's all done.

824
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,834
That was 10 out of 10, Min-si.

825
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:37,100
Do you live here?

826
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:39,767
- Yes, it's been four years.
- Four years?

827
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:42,500
I was born in America,
so my Korean is a bit...

828
01:19:42,567 --> 01:19:43,567
No, you're good.

829
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:45,133
- Really? Thank you.
- Sure.

830
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:46,300
- Good.
- Thank you.

831
01:19:58,333 --> 01:20:00,934
"Jal meokgetseumnida."

832
01:20:02,633 --> 01:20:03,934
"Jal-meokgetseumnida."

833
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:11,800
- Kkori-gomtang.
- Yes, gomtang.

834
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,000
- Here's Kkakdugi.
- Wow. Yes!

835
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:16,200
- It's been so long.
- Tell me if you need more.

836
01:20:16,266 --> 01:20:17,100
Okay.

837
01:20:25,266 --> 01:20:26,533
You ordered one more?

838
01:20:37,633 --> 01:20:39,367
Are you guys ready?

839
01:20:39,433 --> 01:20:40,967
"Jal-meokgetseumnida."

840
01:20:49,500 --> 01:20:51,467
That's a lot of food.

841
01:20:51,567 --> 01:20:53,467
- We can share it.
- Let's eat.

842
01:20:53,567 --> 01:20:55,567
Wait, did I get two bowls of rice?

843
01:21:20,333 --> 01:21:21,166
Nice.

844
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,467
My gosh, this is so good.

845
01:21:47,233 --> 01:21:49,233
Oh, gosh. The noodles are so good.

846
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:50,700
Like jelly.

847
01:22:09,233 --> 01:22:10,734
It looks delicious.

848
01:22:19,333 --> 01:22:20,367
It's good.

849
01:22:42,233 --> 01:22:43,533
It means refreshing.

850
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:44,934
"Goodness."

851
01:24:42,133 --> 01:24:43,633
- Yu-mi, dessert.
- Okay.

852
01:25:14,166 --> 01:25:15,166
It's Woo-shik.

853
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:03,400
Nice.

854
01:26:19,467 --> 01:26:23,800
It doesn't matter
if there's a strong cold storm.

855
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:26,233
People will still crave for ice cream.

856
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:30,467
We love it. It doesn't matter
if it's freezing cold.

857
01:26:36,633 --> 01:26:40,400
Thank you for coming this far,
to this cold country.

858
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:41,700
We're enjoying it.

859
01:27:23,533 --> 01:27:25,233
"Jal-meokeotseumnida."

860
01:27:30,066 --> 01:27:32,166
- Woo-shik.
- I'm sorry...

861
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,600
Thank you for the meal.

862
01:27:33,667 --> 01:27:35,633
Sure. Thank you for eating it.

863
01:27:44,266 --> 01:27:45,166
- Yes.
- Kimchi...

864
01:27:45,233 --> 01:27:46,500
Did you make it here?

865
01:27:46,567 --> 01:27:48,567
- We brought it from Korea.
- Right.

866
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:49,500
It's so good.

867
01:27:49,567 --> 01:27:52,700
It's been years since I had real kimchi.

868
01:27:53,533 --> 01:27:54,934
I live here, so...

869
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Do you want to take some kimchi home?

870
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,467
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

871
01:28:00,533 --> 01:28:02,533
- Oh, that would...
- I'll pack you some.

872
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,000
- I really appreciate it.
- Sure.

873
01:28:04,066 --> 01:28:05,900
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

874
01:28:05,967 --> 01:28:07,200
- Hold on.
- Thank you.

875
01:28:25,467 --> 01:28:27,467
- Unbelievable.
- Are you serious?

876
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,867
- And gochujang.
- Are you serious?

877
01:28:29,967 --> 01:28:31,100
- Gochujang.
- Gosh...

878
01:28:31,633 --> 01:28:32,734
Thank you, sir.

879
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:34,233
- Thank you.
- Oh, my gosh.

880
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:36,266
- Thank you for this.
- Sure, enjoy.

881
01:29:04,200 --> 01:29:07,166
- Some people asked how you made bulgogi.
- What?

882
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:10,567
Oh, my!

883
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:14,967
I told them to google it.
They wanted to know how you made it.

884
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,233
My gosh...

885
01:29:49,567 --> 01:29:51,100
Seo-jun, more dishes here.

886
01:29:51,433 --> 01:29:52,367
What?

887
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,333
- Let me clean it up.
- Okay.

888
01:30:11,967 --> 01:30:14,066
Gosh, you worked on these already.

889
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,900
You're on the ball.

890
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:25,600
- I wiped them all. You can take these.
- Okay.

891
01:30:32,066 --> 01:30:34,200
- I'll pay for everyone.
- No, no.

892
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,700
Should I just tap it?

893
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,467
- Goodness.
- Hey!

894
01:30:48,834 --> 01:30:50,700
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

895
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,066
Could you say hi to the chef?

896
01:30:52,133 --> 01:30:52,967
Sure, thank you.

897
01:30:55,033 --> 01:30:57,467
- Thank you so much for this.
- Sure.

898
01:31:01,133 --> 01:31:03,800
That was too much.

899
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,567
It's a tough day today.

900
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:19,200
Why did it get suddenly busy?

901
01:31:23,834 --> 01:31:25,600
- Keep on smiling.
- Okay.

902
01:31:31,233 --> 01:31:32,600
We just made one round.

903
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:33,667
Yes!

904
01:31:37,567 --> 01:31:40,967
Woo-shik got to be a chef this time.
He will get promoted.

905
01:31:41,066 --> 01:31:42,834
He'll be a board member soon.

906
01:31:44,133 --> 01:31:46,233
- Let's give one more piece.
- Okay.

907
01:31:46,300 --> 01:31:47,967
You're very generous.

908
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:49,900
It's ready to be served.

909
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:51,533
Okay, serve it.

910
01:32:07,133 --> 01:32:09,500
This is the last prep.

911
01:32:09,567 --> 01:32:11,900
I'll show you the meal prep hell.

912
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,400
- What do we need now?
- What do we have left?

913
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:17,800
Sundubu, 30 portions.
Dakgalbi, 40 portions.

914
01:32:17,867 --> 01:32:21,133
Bulgogi, 50 portions. Yukjeon 30 portions.

915
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:23,867
Gomtang, 20 portions.
Bibimbap, 30 portions.

916
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,266
Let's make that 200 portions.

917
01:32:26,367 --> 01:32:28,100
This should be enough, right?

918
01:32:28,767 --> 01:32:31,333
Who put us through this?

919
01:32:32,567 --> 01:32:34,567
I'm sorry. It's all my bad.

920
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,300
Isn't that the five of us?

921
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:41,200
Those five, aren't they us?

922
01:32:41,834 --> 01:32:44,834
Those five look like us.

923
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:45,934
It's us, right?

924
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,166
We were on fire like those horses.

925
01:32:48,533 --> 01:32:49,667
Which horse is me?

926
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,433
You're that one in blue.
Seo-jin in purple. Woo-shik in the back.

927
01:32:53,500 --> 01:32:55,166
Min-si in brown.

928
01:32:56,567 --> 01:32:58,300
The brown one must be the fastest.

929
01:32:58,367 --> 01:33:00,367
The brown one must be the fastest?

930
01:33:00,433 --> 01:33:01,266
Why?

931
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,600
Red horses are the fastest.

932
01:33:03,700 --> 01:33:04,533
Right.

933
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,533
This horse looks like it has dimples.

934
01:33:08,467 --> 01:33:09,734
You're right.

935
01:33:12,233 --> 01:33:13,300
Right.

936
01:33:19,300 --> 01:33:20,567
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI
