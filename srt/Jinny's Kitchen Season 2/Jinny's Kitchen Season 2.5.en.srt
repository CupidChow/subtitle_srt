00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,767
Of course, it's Seo-jun.

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,867
- Let's go, Min-si.
- Yes.

4
00:00:22,934 --> 00:00:23,834
Let's go, Chef.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,033
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

6
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:27,200
Yeah!

7
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:28,633
Yeah!

8
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:39,467
It's full. We have waiting customers.

9
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,667
We knew that.

10
00:00:40,734 --> 00:00:42,133
What matters is the turnover.

11
00:00:49,767 --> 00:00:51,200
- Hey, Woo-shik.
- Yes?

12
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,433
Key in this for Table Two.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,767
The drinks are all backed up.

14
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,233
- Take your time.
- Okay.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,767
Min-si, turn on the stove.

16
00:01:00,834 --> 00:01:01,767
Turn on the stove.

17
00:01:01,834 --> 00:01:03,467
- Let's prepare for bibimbap.
- Okay.

18
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:04,667
The fritters...

19
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:06,100
Fritters out.

20
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:08,266
You two are good at this.

21
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:09,934
You can open up a restaurant.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,033
- Table Three.
- Table Three.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,934
For Table Two.

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,400
I'll remove the bill.
Table One's done.

25
00:01:13,467 --> 00:01:14,367
- All served.
- Done.

26
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:31,734
The sun is up.

27
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,000
It's hotter because of the reflection.

28
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:36,567
Because it's sunny.

29
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,767
Give me two potatoes.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,033
- You want two potatoes?
- No.

31
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,000
- You want two potatoes?
- No.

32
00:01:48,834 --> 00:01:50,800
I thought you were talking to me.

33
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,533
Do you have three ears?

34
00:01:55,367 --> 00:01:56,700
Min-si is a fool.

35
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:57,834
Min-si is a fool.

36
00:01:58,834 --> 00:01:59,667
What's wrong?

37
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:02,033
I couldn't hear you.

38
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,433
But I could hear you murmuring.

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,533
She's scary.

40
00:02:07,033 --> 00:02:08,734
We have a tiger in here.

41
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,567
Two galbijjim, one bibimbap,
one spicy galbijjim, and one Pepsi.

42
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,734
Table Three.

43
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,700
Beef galbijjim.

44
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,867
Bibimbap.

45
00:03:13,867 --> 00:03:15,266
Three beef galbijjim.

46
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:18,567
For Table Three, three galbijjim,

47
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:21,667
one bibimbap,
and one spicy beef galbijjim.

48
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,066
Three beef galbijjim.

49
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,734
One spicy beef galbijjim.

50
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,934
- And...
- Okay.

51
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,734
Then we need eight pieces. One, two...

52
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,633
Four.

53
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:36,967
One.

54
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,633
- Five.
- Two.

55
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,166
- Six.
- Three.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,433
Bibimbap coming through.

57
00:04:02,934 --> 00:04:05,433
That's three original
and one spicy beef galbijjim.

58
00:04:05,834 --> 00:04:06,934
It's ready.

59
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,066
- Table Three.
- I got it.

60
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,767
- For Table Three.
- All of them.

61
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,233
- For Table Three.
- Okay.

62
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,100
- Should we slow down?
- No.

63
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:46,433
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

64
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,834
What's this?
Table Two? All dishes are served?

65
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,500
No. They're not served yet.

66
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,867
We're making it now.

67
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,533
Beef galbijjim?

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
You can put it in the middle.

69
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,800
It's sweet.

70
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,000
This isn't spicy.

71
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,834
I don't remember what I ordered.

72
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,667
I think you ordered the spicy one.

73
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,834
Table Two got a dish.

74
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,266
- Seo-jin, wait.
- What?

75
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,367
- We need to clear something.
- What?

76
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,967
Table Two... they're eating.

77
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:32,033
- What's this for Table Two?
- What?

78
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,000
- Why are they eating?
- Table Two?

79
00:06:34,066 --> 00:06:36,000
They're eating. But what's this?

80
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:40,300
We haven't cooked anything for Table Two.

81
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,400
I told you we had to serve
Table Three first.

82
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,633
Table Three is done.

83
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,567
- It is?
- Yes.

84
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,633
What's this for Table Two?

85
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,100
- Check Table Two, see what they're eating.
- Table Two?

86
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,233
Something's wrong then.

87
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,967
What are they eating?

88
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,300
They're eating that...

89
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:01,667
- What?
- Beef galbijjim.

90
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,000
- Beef galbijjim?
- Yes.

91
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:05,233
I think that was for Table Three.

92
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,133
Are all dishes served to Table Three?

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
- They're all served.
- Then what's happening?

94
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:12,200
Whose dish are they eating now?

95
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,567
Two galbijjim, one bibimbap,
one spicy galbijjim...

96
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:38,934
So they ordered spicy,
but we served the original.

97
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,400
- I think Woo-shik just served it.
- Man...

98
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,633
Yu-mi, can you do this?

99
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,800
- Yes. You go check again.
- I mean...

100
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,467
There is no point.

101
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:11,166
- You served the wrong dish to Table Two.
- What?

102
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,100
- You got the wrong dish.
- I did?

103
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:16,200
She ordered the spicy one,
but you served a regular.

104
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,367
Oh, my...

105
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,233
- Seo-jun?
- Yes.

106
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,133
- Can you make spicy beef galbijjim...
- Yes.

107
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,066
for them?

108
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,567
I feel bad, so...

109
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,266
I know how you feel.

110
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,033
Kkori-gomtang for Table Two.

111
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,300
- Rice, hold on.
- Gomtang for Table Two.

112
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,367
I'll scoop a lot since I feel bad.

113
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,767
A lot of rice.

114
00:09:22,934 --> 00:09:24,266
Here, it's all set.

115
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,600
- I'll quickly make one.
- Okay.

116
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,266
They're really kind.

117
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:30,533
We get to try all of their dishes.

118
00:10:30,934 --> 00:10:33,400
We can leave it. But I can finish it.

119
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,734
What are we?

120
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,166
Food fighters.

121
00:10:39,767 --> 00:10:42,200
I'll sign up for a food fighting contest.

122
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,900
Oh, this is good.

123
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,600
Which one do you like better?

124
00:10:57,767 --> 00:11:00,166
This is good. I'll get more sauce.

125
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,000
You can have this sauce.

126
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,266
- That's very considerate.
- It's nothing.

127
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:16,433
I'll have the potato.
You can have that. Okay?

128
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,834
You can have the meat.

129
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,500
- I haven't had the potato.
- Then you have it.

130
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:21,767
You eat the meat.

131
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:23,567
I'll work on this.

132
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:24,834
You finish the soup.

133
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,700
Can't you have one more of this?

134
00:11:38,867 --> 00:11:40,066
Do you want to pay?

135
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,633
Yes, I'd like to pay.

136
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:56,066
My gosh, I'm so happy.

137
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:23,734
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

138
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,200
There is no space for this.

139
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,333
We're fast, doing it together.

140
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:46,100
More dishes?

141
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll put them in the dishwasher.

142
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,967
I should wash them first.

143
00:14:59,033 --> 00:14:59,867
- Rinse?
- Yes.

144
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:02,066
It doesn't get washed out well.

145
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,266
- It gets you thinking, right?
- It's so hot.

146
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:21,200
It's very hot.

147
00:15:21,533 --> 00:15:22,834
It's hot.

148
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,633
Here. It's cool here.

149
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,500
I wish the window was bigger.

150
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:35,600
I'll open that door.

151
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,233
Gosh, it's cold.

152
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,500
Wow, it's cool.

153
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:52,567
It's really cool.

154
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,333
It's too cold.

155
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,700
It's cool.

156
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:14,967
Min-si.

157
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,600
It's a bit cold here.

158
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,700
Is it?

159
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,500
- May I close the door?
- Sure.

160
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,567
- You can close it. I'm fine.
- What?

161
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,934
- The other door is still open. Yes.
- I can close it, yes?

162
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,667
It's so cold.

163
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,200
We are in Iceland.

164
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,734
- Aren't we almost done?
- We are.

165
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,467
It's an aurora.

166
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:53,834
- Where?
- Here.

167
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:55,600
It's an aurora.

168
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,233
- Where?
- Here.

169
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:07,600
I can see an aurora here.

170
00:17:08,567 --> 00:17:11,133
Don't you think we should eat?

171
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:13,700
My mouth is getting bitter.

172
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,834
I can't talk to customers like this.

173
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,266
That'll be discourteous.

174
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,834
Hey, aren't you hungry?

175
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,400
- What?
- Aren't you hungry?

176
00:17:29,467 --> 00:17:30,467
I'm starving.

177
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,133
- So, four bowls?
- Pass the bowls.

178
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,133
Okay.

179
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,033
I'm scooping a lot of rice.

180
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,066
Min-si, you're amazing.

181
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:52,600
- What?
- You are...

182
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:55,500
- The rice...
- I spilled a lot.

183
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:57,500
It's like a mountain of rice.

184
00:18:02,967 --> 00:18:04,600
Who's having this mountain?

185
00:18:04,667 --> 00:18:06,166
- Not me.
- Yes, you are.

186
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:07,367
I'm not having it.

187
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,333
- Just eat. Hurry.
- Yes, I want to eat.

188
00:18:13,033 --> 00:18:14,367
It's good, right?

189
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,233
It's good.

190
00:18:17,066 --> 00:18:18,367
It's good as it is.

191
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,767
- Min-si, come on. Dig in.
- Okay.

192
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,166
This is so good.

193
00:18:23,633 --> 00:18:25,100
Goodness, this...

194
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,233
We're having Korea's farm products.

195
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,734
Look at my hand.

196
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:42,333
- Look at her hands.
- How can it be like this?

197
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,800
- Oh, no...
- My goodness.

198
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,433
- Do you wear gloves?
- I do.

199
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,667
No, she doesn't.

200
00:18:46,734 --> 00:18:49,400
- Doesn't the water...
- It still gets wet inside.

201
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:54,467
You must wear gloves when you wash dishes.
It's really tough when you wash a lot.

202
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,200
The quail eggs are amazing.

203
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,367
Quail eggs, protein.

204
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,433
Come on, join us.

205
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,333
These are three different types.

206
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,500
I'll make one portion of dakgalbi
for a test.

207
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,100
Dakgalbi is amazing.

208
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,467
To make it convenient,

209
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,600
I'll add them all.

210
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,834
It's getting filled.

211
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,533
Let me pour it.

212
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,033
It gets squeezed this well?

213
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,400
It's delicious.

214
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:24,867
It's hundred percent pineapple.

215
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:27,600
I can go back to working now.

216
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:37,867
One...

217
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,500
Two...

218
00:20:43,967 --> 00:20:45,400
That's 13.

219
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:51,600
I don't think
I'll need to make rice twice.

220
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,166
I'm done with kimchi. Then I'm all done.

221
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,867
There is no room for this.

222
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,233
Hold on, Woo-shik.

223
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,633
What are you going to do?

224
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,400
I'll put this in the middle.

225
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,233
- I'll put it here, Min-si.
- Okay, thank you.

226
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,600
What is this?

227
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,367
We have no space there.

228
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,633
Okay.

229
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,800
Cabbage.

230
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,000
It's here.

231
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,767
Is it for 20 portions?

232
00:22:23,433 --> 00:22:24,734
No, 40 portions.

233
00:22:26,834 --> 00:22:28,200
Let's go.

234
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll cook dakgalbi now.

235
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,266
Minced ginger.

236
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,033
- Do you want to taste it?
- Sorry?

237
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,000
Try the dip.

238
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,300
I can't eat spicy things.

239
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,934
I think it's good.

240
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,800
Right, there are chives too.

241
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,633
Dakgalbi and spicy noodles?

242
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,867
- Regular noodles?
- No, spicy noodles.

243
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:17,200
- Spicy noodles?
- Yes.

244
00:24:17,633 --> 00:24:19,667
But a bit like perilla oil-style.

245
00:24:19,734 --> 00:24:21,533
It sounds even more delicious.

246
00:25:18,834 --> 00:25:19,667
Yes.

247
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,700
Okay, perfect.

248
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,667
Guys, I'll make dakgalbi now.

249
00:26:04,667 --> 00:26:05,767
What is this?

250
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,300
What is it?

251
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,233
This?

252
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,033
- It looks like chunjang.
- It's for bibimmyeon.

253
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,200
Oh, it's seaweed.

254
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:16,900
Now to mix it...

255
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,000
What should I use?

256
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Well...

257
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,734
Seo-jun.

258
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,834
That looks okay.

259
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,567
It takes a bit of time to boil it down.

260
00:26:44,934 --> 00:26:45,900
Let's see.

261
00:26:47,433 --> 00:26:48,467
Let's see.

262
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,500
- Do you want to try it?
- Sorry?

263
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:12,433
My goodness.
It looks delicious.

264
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,800
Do you have to mix it?

265
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:15,233
- This...
- Yes.

266
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,433
You can try them separately.
And you can mix them too.

267
00:27:19,734 --> 00:27:21,467
Noodles? Try it first.

268
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:23,834
I see a lot of ingredients.

269
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,400
Is the sweet potato cooked?

270
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:28,567
Yes.

271
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,934
I made it. I should try.

272
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:31,967
Goodness.

273
00:27:34,166 --> 00:27:35,500
What do you think?

274
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:36,467
Good.

275
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,600
- Good?
- Yes.

276
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,700
How is it?

277
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:41,066
Good.

278
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,133
- It's really good.
- It's good.

279
00:27:46,834 --> 00:27:48,200
It's so delicious.

280
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:50,934
Should I cook the noodles more?

281
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,133
Yes, a bit more.

282
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,233
Cook the noodles more?

283
00:27:54,633 --> 00:27:58,100
I thought it was done, but it got hard
when I washed it with cold water.

284
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,033
You have to wash it with cold water?

285
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,667
- Yes.
- Oh, then...

286
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,700
It's really good.

287
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,533
It will taste better when mixed.

288
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,667
How is it?

289
00:28:40,934 --> 00:28:41,767
It's good.

290
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,834
Okay, let's go.

291
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,233
It must be today's menu.

292
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,533
Alexander, don't move.

293
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,600
Goodness...

294
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:34,467
Did you check outside?

295
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:35,600
Is there a queue?

296
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,300
- It's going around the corner.
- Oh, my gosh.

297
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,333
Let's enjoy it for a change.

298
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,000
A day like this has come.

299
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,567
- The queue is so long.
- It extends till here.

300
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,867
It's up to here.

301
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:01,100
- It's extending till here!
- No!

302
00:32:01,166 --> 00:32:02,834
That's not the end. Come on.

303
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,633
This can't be happening.

304
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,867
Seo-jin, there's a whole queue
around the building.

305
00:32:18,934 --> 00:32:21,934
Seo-jin. Is this a Supreme shop?
Where are we?

306
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,967
Is it a Chanel store or what?

307
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,867
It's like an opening rush.

308
00:32:27,934 --> 00:32:29,033
Open the curtains.

309
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,734
There are so many people!

310
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,033
- The queue is so long.
- It's too many!

311
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,233
- This isn't right.
- What are we going to do?

312
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,467
This is a miracle!
There are so many people.

313
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,633
I should use the bathroom now.

314
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,433
Gosh...

315
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,834
- Seo-jin.
- Yes?

316
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,734
Take a look.

317
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,700
- That's the queue?
- Yes.

318
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,700
But they can't even come in.

319
00:33:16,767 --> 00:33:18,400
So we should tell them now.

320
00:33:18,467 --> 00:33:19,667
We should tell them.

321
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,400
- We need to tell them.
- What?

322
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:27,600
Should we tell them together?

323
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,467
I see policemen.

324
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,400
What? Some policemen are here.

325
00:33:37,734 --> 00:33:39,300
What's with the police?

326
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,533
- The police are here, right?
- Yes.

327
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,233
They are outside. What do we do?

328
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,166
- The police are here too.
- What?

329
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:13,867
- The police are here.
- What?

330
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,967
Because of the crowd?

331
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,734
It's not our fault.

332
00:34:36,734 --> 00:34:38,233
What's important is...

333
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,967
We roughly counted,
and it's about 100 people.

334
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:43,166
We shouldn't just leave it as it is.

335
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:45,633
- Let's do something about this.
- Yes, we should.

336
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,633
- Okay.
- How many servings can you serve?

337
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:50,867
I'll go and check the number of people.

338
00:34:50,934 --> 00:34:53,066
I'll count. Then I'll cut the queue.

339
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,000
We have two rounds. I have to
count the number and set the tables.

340
00:34:57,066 --> 00:34:58,133
All right.

341
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,967
I think we have enough food.

342
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,066
- For two rounds?
- For two rounds.

343
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,500
Where is the list?

344
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:05,767
It's right in front.

345
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:09,000
We didn't see this coming.

346
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:11,867
We need to do something about this.

347
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,600
- Do you have a pen?
- Okay.

348
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,600
Is the door not working?

349
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,333
Hello. We are not open yet.

350
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,166
Hello. We are not open yet.

351
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:15,567
Are we done?

352
00:36:26,166 --> 00:36:27,000
And now...

353
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,867
- Only the big table left.
- Yes.

354
00:37:22,066 --> 00:37:23,233
That's seven people.

355
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,133
7:30 p.m...

356
00:38:32,133 --> 00:38:35,066
- The group...
- This is no joke.

357
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,567
- Woo-shik.
- You have to help me

358
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:39,033
with the table setting now.

359
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,066
How many so far?

360
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:41,333
- Nine.
- So, nine people.

361
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,400
- Yes.
- That's ready for six people.

362
00:38:43,467 --> 00:38:44,900
- Right.
- So three more people?

363
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:45,934
Yes.

364
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:20,000
You can make the drinks.

365
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,900
You can usher them in one by one.

366
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:24,000
- Right.
- Okay.

367
00:39:30,367 --> 00:39:31,367
Okay.

368
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,100
- Three.
- Three?

369
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,600
- Hello.
- Hi.

370
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:00,834
Please bring more menus.

371
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,266
The group can come in now.

372
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:08,533
- Please put one more chair there.
- Okay.

373
00:40:24,834 --> 00:40:26,133
That's quite a change.

374
00:40:26,834 --> 00:40:29,734
From the heat of Bacalar...

375
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,200
to Iceland!

376
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:33,367
What a change.

377
00:40:33,467 --> 00:40:35,734
What are the odds?

378
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,800
They were in Mexico. I'm Mexican.

379
00:40:38,867 --> 00:40:41,166
And now the next place
they come to is Iceland.

380
00:40:41,233 --> 00:40:44,000
My family lives in Iceland. I mean...

381
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,133
We were talking about this.

382
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,700
"It'd be amazing if they came to Iceland."

383
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,300
"But it would never happen."

384
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,166
I can't believe this.

385
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,633
But here they are.

386
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,867
Right! Ramyeon and corn dogs...

387
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:22,033
You wanted to have a corn dog...

388
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:27,000
Let's have corn dogs when we go to Seoul.

389
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,667
But it'd be different eating it in Korea.
Don't you think so?

390
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:45,667
Look, my love. You can see
what kinds of ingredients they use.

391
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,700
It comes with kkakdugi and rice.

392
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,533
The menu is on the wall.

393
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,333
- Is it?
- Yes, dolsot...

394
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,166
Maybe that's the main dish
and the rest are side dishes.

395
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,633
I feel like he's famous.

396
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,333
I guess so.

397
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,834
It's like a war outside.

398
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:34,667
- Min-si.
- Yes?

399
00:42:34,734 --> 00:42:36,266
- Let's go.
- We can do this.

400
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:38,633
- As if today's the last day.
- Okay!

401
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,367
Like there is no tomorrow.

402
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,533
Did you take her passport?

403
00:43:05,066 --> 00:43:07,667
Should I start with dolsot-bibimbap?

404
00:43:07,767 --> 00:43:09,266
Yes, let's go.

405
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:22,867
All right. One bibimbap is ready.

406
00:43:23,533 --> 00:43:24,367
Is it ready?

407
00:43:24,433 --> 00:43:25,433
- Yes.
- What?

408
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,367
- Yes.
- Yes.

409
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:29,467
Intern Ko is working
as if it's her last day.

410
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:32,667
We just started.
What are you talking about?

411
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,633
We sent away so many people.

412
00:43:34,934 --> 00:43:36,100
I can do this.

413
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:38,000
- Is it okay?
- I think it's okay.

414
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:39,600
- Have you tasted it?
- Yes.

415
00:43:40,133 --> 00:43:42,033
It's all tasty.

416
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,900
I'll show them what I got.

417
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:47,066
Three bibimbaps are ready.

418
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:50,800
I should keep making.
No, I should wash these first.

419
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:03,500
Why is it here?

420
00:44:03,567 --> 00:44:04,967
You can remove it.

421
00:44:35,867 --> 00:44:37,800
It's like the calm before the storm.

422
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,500
Alexander. How do we count?

423
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:58,667
Hana kkori-gomtang?

424
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:02,433
- Hana means one?
- That's right.

425
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:05,700
- Hana beef galbijjim.
- Beef galbijjim.

426
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:09,567
- And hana dakgalbi.
- Dakgalbi? Okay.

427
00:45:10,734 --> 00:45:12,800
We should try that drink.

428
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,333
Soju? You like to drink?

429
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,834
- Let's go for it.
- Soju?

430
00:45:23,266 --> 00:45:24,934
- That's one soju and one yuja tea.
- Okay.

431
00:45:27,066 --> 00:45:28,834
Thank you.

432
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,100
- Gamsahamnida.
- Thank you. Gamsahamnida.

433
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,400
You're the only one who knows Korean.

434
00:45:39,467 --> 00:45:42,734
It's because taekwondo is Korean.

435
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:49,967
This too.

436
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,300
- One beef galbijjim?
- Yes.

437
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,734
What else?

438
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,033
And one bibimbap.

439
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:00,166
Bibimbap?

440
00:46:00,266 --> 00:46:01,967
Just one, okay. Thank you.

441
00:46:05,767 --> 00:46:07,033
Let's see.

442
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,233
Show me your teeth.

443
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,166
That's a beautiful smile without teeth.

444
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,700
A smile without teeth.

445
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,200
Have you not tried soju before?

446
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:20,800
No, I have never tried it.

447
00:46:23,567 --> 00:46:25,767
I hope you hate it so I can drink it.

448
00:46:28,934 --> 00:46:31,066
I think I'm going to love it.

449
00:46:31,133 --> 00:46:33,300
- Yes, I think so.
- And we'll be like,

450
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,767
"I wish we could drink a lot."

451
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:38,400
I'm worried
because I'm wearing high heels.

452
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:44,533
How will you take me out
if I get too drunk?

453
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:02,333
You drink a little amount of this.

454
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,266
Because it's for two people.

455
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:10,200
This is for Mom, not for Dad.

456
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:16,500
You have to pour it for me.

457
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,967
I heard that you have to use both hands.

458
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:22,633
You drink it with both hands.

459
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,533
Both hands?

460
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,033
But you're older than me.
I have to turn my head like this.

461
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,934
To respect you.

462
00:47:29,033 --> 00:47:30,633
I'm older by one month.

463
00:47:35,166 --> 00:47:36,433
Gosh, it tastes good.

464
00:47:38,633 --> 00:47:41,600
- It's good.
- It really is good.

465
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:45,734
It doesn't burn my throat.

466
00:47:46,166 --> 00:47:48,600
It's sweet and nice.

467
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:51,400
It has only 20 percent of alcohol.

468
00:47:51,467 --> 00:47:54,567
It's not like tequila
which has 40 percent of alcohol.

469
00:47:54,633 --> 00:47:57,433
- Tequila's 40 percent?
- About 43 percent.

470
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,600
What? I can drink this then.

471
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:02,700
You can easily drink tequila.
This must be nothing.

472
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:20,667
Can you teach me how to count in Korean?

473
00:48:20,734 --> 00:48:21,800
What was it?

474
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:23,567
Hana...

475
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:25,400
Dool...

476
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,333
- Dool.
- Dool.

477
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Set, net, dausut...

478
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:30,400
Yeo...

479
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,600
So that's hana...

480
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,533
- Hana, dool...
- Dool.

481
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:38,400
- Set, net.
- Net.

482
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,266
- Dausut.
- Dausut.

483
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:43,066
- Yeosut.
- Yeosut.

484
00:48:43,133 --> 00:48:44,900
- Ilgup.
- Ilgup.

485
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:45,900
- Ah-hope.
- Ah-hope.

486
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,633
Why do I keep forgetting?

487
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,300
You still know more Korean than I do.

488
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:07,133
Cheers.

489
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:25,567
That's three dakgalbi
and one beef galbijjim.

490
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,300
Dakgalbi is so popular.

491
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:31,333
- Right?
- It's so popular right away.

492
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,333
Why are they ordering it
as soon as we're open?

493
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,100
How many dakgalbi?

494
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,333
Let me see.

495
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,400
That's three dakgalbi for Table Five.
Then there is another one.

496
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,633
We can keep cooking after making dakgalbi.

497
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,567
Okay.

498
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,834
- Let's get rid of the lids.
- All of them?

499
00:50:41,867 --> 00:50:44,834
Does it come with rice?
No, it comes with noodles.

500
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,934
Hold on. Noodles.

501
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,533
Yes, we have to boil them.

502
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:48,467
- Right.
- Hold on.

503
00:51:05,567 --> 00:51:06,867
Here are the noodles.

504
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,333
Noodles are the problem.

505
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,000
The problem is the noodles.

506
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,500
What, is it off?

507
00:51:19,233 --> 00:51:20,600
We're out of gas.

508
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:24,367
This has the highest heat.

509
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,934
I'm not ready with the noodles.

510
00:51:34,066 --> 00:51:35,467
I'll lose about two kg.

511
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,934
Oh, gosh. This isn't working.

512
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:52,033
Did you get the group?

513
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,400
No, I'm on my way now.

514
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:54,300
Okay.

515
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:03,266
Gosh, this is crazy. It's too much.

516
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,834
- I'll take my time.
- Okay.

517
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:06,667
- Okay.
- This is from the group.

518
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:08,333
We can't do it all at once.

519
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,934
I'll take my time
since it's the first dakgalbi.

520
00:52:25,633 --> 00:52:26,967
What should I work on?

521
00:52:27,033 --> 00:52:28,300
Galbijjim...

522
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,467
- Oh... Min-si.
- Yes.

523
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:32,100
This is all dakgalbi.

524
00:52:39,767 --> 00:52:40,834
Noodles!

525
00:52:43,667 --> 00:52:46,633
That pink one is for dakgalbi.

526
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,567
Should I work on beef galbijjim?

527
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:51,500
Beef galbijjim...

528
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
- Can you do galbijjim?
- Sure.

529
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,867
- Table Five?
- It's the first order.

530
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:07,767
Okay.

531
00:54:07,834 --> 00:54:09,066
Three dakgalbi?

532
00:54:16,333 --> 00:54:18,166
Dakgalbi is ready.
All ready for Table One.

533
00:54:18,233 --> 00:54:19,834
One is done, it's for Table Five?

534
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:20,934
Yes.

535
00:54:21,033 --> 00:54:22,734
Beef galbijjim and gomtang.

536
00:54:28,834 --> 00:54:30,900
I don't think we need to boil it.

537
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,200
I agree.

538
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:38,066
Should I serve kkori-gomtang first?

539
00:54:38,133 --> 00:54:39,100
- Yes.
- Whatever is...

540
00:54:39,166 --> 00:54:40,834
It'll be ready soon.

541
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:46,100
Should I get dakgalbi plates ready?

542
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,967
- Yes.
- Noodles are almost done?

543
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,567
- This seaweed...
- Yes.

544
00:54:53,633 --> 00:54:55,300
Sprinkle it in the middle.

545
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,033
You can sprinkle it once.

546
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:05,166
Dakgalbi for Table Three is ready.

547
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,333
- Table Three.
- Table Three.

548
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,133
I'll remove the bill.

549
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:14,433
Beef galbijjim?

550
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,767
It's dakgalbi.

551
00:55:23,834 --> 00:55:24,700
Thank you.

552
00:55:31,934 --> 00:55:33,100
Looks amazing.

553
00:55:33,166 --> 00:55:34,200
Right.

554
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,700
- We need to take pictures.
- Let's take pictures.

555
00:56:18,734 --> 00:56:21,100
Gosh, I'm drooling.

556
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:22,600
Do we mix it?

557
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:24,734
- Yes, mix. Right?
- Mix?

558
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,633
I think so.

559
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:40,734
This is so good.

560
00:56:54,867 --> 00:56:57,133
This is so good. I want to order more.

561
00:56:57,266 --> 00:56:58,400
It's good.

562
00:56:58,467 --> 00:57:00,533
It's good.

563
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:19,200
It's too spicy.

564
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,533
Really?

565
00:57:28,767 --> 00:57:31,533
Gosh, it gets even spicier.

566
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
I can feel something in my throat.

567
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:37,800
I'm about to sneeze.

568
00:57:37,867 --> 00:57:38,700
Me too.

569
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:41,333
My nose is getting runny.

570
00:57:53,834 --> 00:57:55,467
I'd give it ten out of ten.

571
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,367
I love it.

572
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,834
I love it.

573
00:58:03,133 --> 00:58:04,734
I want to try the chicken.

574
00:58:11,567 --> 00:58:12,400
Is it good?

575
00:58:14,667 --> 00:58:17,200
This is better than it looks.

576
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,567
- Better than expected?
- Right.

577
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,633
It's good, right?

578
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,834
I think it has gochujang.

579
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,667
It's perfectly balanced.

580
00:58:39,734 --> 00:58:41,166
It's not too spicy.

581
00:58:42,066 --> 00:58:43,500
It's not spicy at all.

582
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:45,734
I'll try the noodles now.

583
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:51,066
The noodles look amazing.

584
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:56,333
I really want
a little bit of those noodles.

585
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,900
Just a little bit.

586
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,166
Oh, my God, Alexander. You will love it.

587
00:59:01,533 --> 00:59:03,500
Just because you're my kid...

588
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,600
and I love you so much...

589
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,800
So I'm going to share it with you.

590
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,734
I hope they're good.

591
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:16,533
That's enough.

592
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,166
What do you say?

593
00:59:22,233 --> 00:59:25,133
Gracias or gamsahamnida.

594
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,567
Gamsahamnida.

595
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,533
Are they super cold?

596
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,467
But it's so good.

597
00:59:40,867 --> 00:59:42,200
Gosh, it's so good.

598
00:59:44,166 --> 00:59:46,266
Can I eat the vegetable fritters?

599
00:59:47,867 --> 00:59:49,700
Deep-fried vegetables.

600
00:59:51,867 --> 00:59:53,066
Crunchy.

601
00:59:54,033 --> 00:59:55,800
Crunchy.

602
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,100
This isn't too spicy.

603
01:00:41,166 --> 01:00:42,300
It's not too spicy?

604
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,834
As a Mexican, no.

605
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:45,667
- You know about it.
- Of course.

606
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,367
Is it spicy?

607
01:00:48,433 --> 01:00:50,500
- A little.
- A little.

608
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,734
One spicy beef galbijjim.

609
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:00,333
One kkori-gomtang.

610
01:01:05,533 --> 01:01:07,533
One spicy, one gomtang, what's next?

611
01:01:07,934 --> 01:01:09,000
The next one is...

612
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:12,166
That's one beef galbijjim
and one dolsot-bibimbap.

613
01:01:12,233 --> 01:01:13,967
- Let's put on bibimbap.
- Okay.

614
01:01:15,934 --> 01:01:17,834
Dolsot-bibimbap on the stove.

615
01:01:22,934 --> 01:01:24,467
This is the regular one.

616
01:01:24,533 --> 01:01:27,400
- Let's cook with this.
- Okay. The spicy one.

617
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:29,133
So we don't get confused.

618
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,633
- You didn't put this, right?
- No.

619
01:01:38,734 --> 01:01:40,800
Let's serve gomtang and bibimbap.

620
01:01:40,867 --> 01:01:42,467
- Gosh.
- Are you okay?

621
01:01:47,033 --> 01:01:49,734
- Let me get gomtang.
- Okay, you can take it.

622
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:51,533
- This is for Table One.
- Okay.

623
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,834
Here's rice.

624
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:55,266
Bibimbap is ready. You can serve it now.

625
01:01:55,333 --> 01:01:56,400
Yes, the sizzle.

626
01:02:13,266 --> 01:02:15,433
Beef galbijjim is almost ready.

627
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:34,467
- For which table?
- Table One.

628
01:02:34,533 --> 01:02:36,567
Table One? We are on track now.

629
01:02:36,633 --> 01:02:37,867
- Yes.
- Right.

630
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,467
What's next, Min-si?

631
01:02:40,533 --> 01:02:44,266
That's one gomtang, one bibimbap,
and one spicy beef galbijjim.

632
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,900
This is so hectic.

633
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:56,533
Take your time.

634
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,266
Take your time.

635
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:01,000
People are talking. It's great out there.

636
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,934
There is this Mexican lady.

637
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,100
She's literally touched by the food.

638
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:08,767
Really? That's a relief.

639
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,600
She loves the dakgalbi.

640
01:03:10,734 --> 01:03:13,500
- Goodness, I knew it.
- You know what I think?

641
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:15,100
She even cried a little...

642
01:03:16,467 --> 01:03:18,367
when she had it. Seriously.

643
01:03:18,934 --> 01:03:22,133
And I think she knows
that we were in Mexico.

644
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:24,400
She talked to me in Spanish.

645
01:03:25,533 --> 01:03:26,667
In dakgalbi...

646
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:28,033
What vegetables are in it?

647
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,367
I can't see anything.

648
01:03:29,433 --> 01:03:31,967
I don't even know
what vegetables are in it.

649
01:03:32,033 --> 01:03:33,266
You know what's funnier?

650
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:36,133
You see these laver pieces in dakgalbi?
I can't even see them.

651
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,967
People ask me if they can get takeaway.
They love it.

652
01:03:45,300 --> 01:03:46,567
I told them, "No."

653
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:48,800
I'm getting full.

654
01:03:49,767 --> 01:03:51,500
But I want to eat everything.

655
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,533
It's so good.

656
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,467
This is food that...

657
01:03:55,867 --> 01:03:58,133
you will always remember.

658
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,000
Oh, yeah.

659
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,734
We really need more kimchi.

660
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:30,100
There is only one thing I miss...

661
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:32,700
I want to eat a corn dog.

662
01:04:34,867 --> 01:04:36,300
Can you tell him that?

663
01:04:38,967 --> 01:04:40,066
He was telling me,

664
01:04:40,133 --> 01:04:43,233
"The only thing I want to tell them
is that I want a corn dog."

665
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,367
A corn dog, right.

666
01:04:45,433 --> 01:04:46,266
Not this time.

667
01:04:46,367 --> 01:04:49,266
We have been craving it.
We'll have it in Seoul.

668
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,333
What's it called?
That thing he is serving over there.

669
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:58,967
It looks delicious.

670
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,400
How are we going to do this?

671
01:05:03,467 --> 01:05:05,567
Shall we put the three dishes here?

672
01:05:05,633 --> 01:05:07,266
That's what I was thinking.

673
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,300
Bibimbap is almost done.

674
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,200
- It's not ready yet. Okay.
- Okay.

675
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,667
Bibimbap is done. Next, kkori-gomtang...

676
01:05:32,734 --> 01:05:33,967
can be served when done.

677
01:05:34,033 --> 01:05:36,166
Vegetable fritters
on spicy beef galbijjim.

678
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:49,333
I scooped the rice.

679
01:05:50,633 --> 01:05:52,166
Get the fritters ready.

680
01:05:52,233 --> 01:05:53,300
Okay.

681
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,700
- It's ready.
- Beef galbijjim is ready.

682
01:05:57,734 --> 01:05:59,633
Put two pieces.

683
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:01,600
It's all done.

684
01:06:02,033 --> 01:06:04,166
It's t for Table Four, right?

685
01:06:04,667 --> 01:06:05,967
- Yes.
- Table Three is done?

686
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:08,100
- What about Table Four?
- It's done too.

687
01:06:08,967 --> 01:06:10,033
- Woo-shik.
- Yes.

688
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:11,100
To Table Four.

689
01:06:41,834 --> 01:06:43,600
- We need to try it all.
- Right.

690
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:51,567
Gosh, it's good.

691
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:53,934
Emilio.

692
01:06:54,767 --> 01:06:55,600
Is it good?

693
01:06:55,667 --> 01:06:56,767
This sauce...

694
01:06:58,233 --> 01:06:59,233
Is it good?

695
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,166
Nice.

696
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:06,834
What kind of sauce is this?

697
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,867
I don't know. But it's delicious.

698
01:07:08,934 --> 01:07:09,834
I love it.

699
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,900
- Oh, gosh.
- It's good.

700
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:20,600
The oxtail is one
of the best parts of beef.

701
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:22,166
You are right.

702
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:25,734
But what surprised me the most
was the sauce.

703
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,700
- That?
- Yes, that sauce.

704
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:35,300
It's good.

705
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:39,266
- What is it?
- Vegetable fritters.

706
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,367
It's so good.

707
01:07:52,433 --> 01:07:53,266
Delicious.

708
01:08:03,867 --> 01:08:06,000
The marinade is so good.

709
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,967
It's not too spicy.

710
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:09,033
Right.

711
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,266
But it's so good.

712
01:08:10,934 --> 01:08:13,934
I want to have more marinade.

713
01:08:14,467 --> 01:08:15,300
Right.

714
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:17,333
The sauce is so good.

715
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,333
This is good.

716
01:08:49,934 --> 01:08:52,300
- After trying these three dishes...
- Yes?

717
01:08:52,367 --> 01:08:55,433
I'd order this if I ever come again.

718
01:08:56,934 --> 01:08:57,934
- This one?
- Yes.

719
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:01,934
The combination is so good.
It goes so well with the rice.

720
01:09:02,233 --> 01:09:04,467
- Right.
- It is a bit spicy.

721
01:09:05,767 --> 01:09:07,133
But it's just perfect.

722
01:09:09,533 --> 01:09:11,367
I love this kimchi too.

723
01:09:13,567 --> 01:09:14,667
Isn't it so tasty?

724
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:15,800
It's really good.

725
01:09:16,633 --> 01:09:17,600
Kimchi...

726
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:18,800
It's good.

727
01:09:19,233 --> 01:09:20,633
Have it with rice.

728
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,900
Gosh, it's even more delicious.

729
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:28,567
Try it, my love.

730
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,767
So you don't get curious.

731
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,800
This will be a romantic moment.

732
01:09:33,867 --> 01:09:35,734
Try it, my love.

733
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:44,567
So you don't get curious.

734
01:09:46,867 --> 01:09:48,033
Emilio.

735
01:09:53,033 --> 01:09:55,000
How many gomtangs for this table?

736
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,033
- Four?
- Yes.

737
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:58,734
- We make four kkori-gomtang now.
- Hold on.

738
01:09:58,834 --> 01:10:01,033
Three spicy beef galbijjim
and one dakgalbi...

739
01:10:01,133 --> 01:10:02,367
- Beef galbijjim.
- The group?

740
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:03,266
Yes.

741
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:05,000
- Four kkori-gomtang.
- Right.

742
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:11,300
Min-si, scoop the rice first.

743
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:14,066
Four bowls of rice. Four kkori-gomtang.

744
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,367
Two bibimbaps too?

745
01:10:20,433 --> 01:10:22,500
Yes, I can put them on the stove.

746
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,166
I'll put two on the stove.

747
01:10:24,233 --> 01:10:25,567
Yes, two bibimbaps.

748
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:32,200
- Three spicy beef galbijjims?
- Yes.

749
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:33,100
Okay.

750
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,066
One, two, three, four.

751
01:10:35,133 --> 01:10:37,433
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

752
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,533
Re-fry ten pieces of fritters.

753
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,166
- Did you say three?
- Yes, three spicy galbijjim.

754
01:10:49,433 --> 01:10:50,867
One, two, three, four...

755
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,500
Vegetable fritters are done!

756
01:11:05,133 --> 01:11:05,967
And...

757
01:11:13,233 --> 01:11:14,734
Woo-shik.

758
01:11:14,834 --> 01:11:16,633
It's going too slow for the group.

759
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,133
- Right.
- So you tell them

760
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:20,100
to take their time.

761
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:22,133
- Okay.
- Okay.

762
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,333
I think we ordered too much.

763
01:11:42,266 --> 01:11:44,633
We did order a lot because we eat a lot.

764
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,767
What they ordered outside is
similar to what we ordered.

765
01:11:47,834 --> 01:11:48,967
- Aren't you hungry?
- I am.

766
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:50,000
I can't wait.

767
01:11:56,867 --> 01:11:58,600
You can serve one by one now.

768
01:11:58,667 --> 01:12:00,233
You can serve those two first.

769
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,200
Let's serve whatever is ready.

770
01:12:02,633 --> 01:12:05,233
Bibimbap coming through. Here.

771
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,433
Two bowls of bibimbap are ready.

772
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:14,233
We can serve three gomtang together.

773
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,667
- We served one earlier.
- Okay, great.

774
01:12:15,734 --> 01:12:16,734
- Right.
- Okay.

775
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,500
Kkori-gomtang is ready.

776
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,533
One, two, three.

777
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,633
- Give it to me.
- Wait.

778
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,734
- Give me.
- Okay. Wait.

779
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:26,800
Kkori-gomtang coming through.

780
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:31,133
Here's the last gomtang.

781
01:12:31,233 --> 01:12:32,166
Coming through.

782
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:38,367
All gomtangs are served.
Let's quickly make that.

783
01:12:38,834 --> 01:12:40,433
One dakgalbi, right?

784
01:12:50,266 --> 01:12:52,333
Two beef galbijjims are ready.

785
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,333
Okay.

786
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,100
It's all served.
Just waiting for the dakgalbi.

787
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,233
Yes, it's done.

788
01:13:14,333 --> 01:13:15,266
- Done?
- Done.

789
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,166
Okay.

790
01:13:17,734 --> 01:13:20,734
It's all done. That was just one round?

791
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:27,500
What is this?

792
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:28,600
Beef.

793
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:31,567
This piece is huge.

794
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,567
It's tasty.

795
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:42,233
I love this.

796
01:13:44,867 --> 01:13:46,000
It's very crunchy.

797
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,834
I like the dakgalbi noodles the most.

798
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,834
I can't wait to try it.

799
01:14:06,767 --> 01:14:07,967
I'm excited.

800
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:36,667
What dessert do you have?

801
01:14:36,734 --> 01:14:40,033
- I think we ordered two ice creams.
- Two ice creams, yes.

802
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:40,934
Are you finished?

803
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:41,834
Thank you very much.

804
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,600
Yu-mi, one ice cream.

805
01:14:55,433 --> 01:14:57,333
Yu-mi. Make that two.

806
01:15:01,400 --> 01:15:02,900
- Now?
- Yes.

807
01:15:02,967 --> 01:15:04,000
Right now.

808
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,900
Twibap ice cream.

809
01:15:45,734 --> 01:15:47,233
- Gamsahamnida.
- Thank you.

810
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:52,033
I know it's food,
but we need to do cheers.

811
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:54,033
One, two, three.

812
01:15:55,533 --> 01:15:59,166
I want a bit of these crunchy things.

813
01:16:04,133 --> 01:16:05,633
I like the bottom.

814
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,500
The ice cream and the crunchy ones.

815
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:13,133
- What?
- What happened?

816
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:17,166
- I finished it all.
- We were talking too much.

817
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,000
And I finished it.

818
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,133
It's fantastic.

819
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:22,700
It's really good.

820
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:24,133
Yes, it's amazing.

821
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,200
We're so happy. And he loved everything.

822
01:16:44,533 --> 01:16:45,867
The food was so nice.

823
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,000
I think it's an amazing show.

824
01:16:48,066 --> 01:16:50,967
You are bringing Korea
to people around the world.

825
01:16:51,033 --> 01:16:52,166
And that's amazing.

826
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:53,867
- Thank you.
- That's so meaningful.

827
01:16:53,934 --> 01:16:55,600
We're really happy for that.

828
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,266
Gamsahamnida. It was nice to meet you.

829
01:17:07,433 --> 01:17:09,800
We had no time for a break in the hall.

830
01:17:09,867 --> 01:17:12,200
Of course. It must've been hectic.

831
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:15,033
It's seven... What time is it?

832
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:17,367
It's 7:16 p.m.

833
01:17:17,433 --> 01:17:20,700
We'll have customers in 16 minutes.

834
01:17:22,567 --> 01:17:26,100
What do we do with the dishes?
They're all brought back at once.

835
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:27,033
Plates here.

836
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,066
We have dishes on the bottom too.

837
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:31,300
Well, then...

838
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,900
What do we do with the group?

839
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,567
Give them some more time.

840
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:50,033
We have to set the tables again.

841
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,033
Okay? Woo-shik.

842
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:52,834
The problem is...

843
01:17:53,467 --> 01:17:54,767
We have no problem.

844
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,934
Excuse me.

845
01:18:00,667 --> 01:18:02,200
Get the clean...

846
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:04,533
Ice cream?

847
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,000
Oh, ice cream?

848
01:18:07,066 --> 01:18:08,767
We ordered two ice creams.

849
01:18:08,834 --> 01:18:09,767
Oh, yeah, yeah.

850
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,166
You ready for dessert?

851
01:18:11,233 --> 01:18:12,800
- Yes. Okay.
- Thank you.

852
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,734
Please make two ice cream.

853
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,633
Okay.

854
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,400
I'll be clearing away
the dishes in the room.

855
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:10,700
This glass...

856
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:12,333
Do we have it?

857
01:19:12,433 --> 01:19:13,800
We need a lot of those.

858
01:19:13,867 --> 01:19:14,934
- A lot?
- Yes.

859
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,500
A lot? How many?

860
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:21,633
I'll wash every glass here.
We don't have a lot of these.

861
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,400
Yu-mi, place spoons and chopsticks
over there.

862
01:19:24,467 --> 01:19:25,800
We need extra plates.

863
01:19:26,633 --> 01:19:28,367
Woo-shik, we need plates.

864
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,266
Here, six glasses for now.

865
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,367
- Keep working on it.
- We're on it.

866
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,867
What?

867
01:19:36,934 --> 01:19:37,867
Be careful.

868
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:39,700
- Goodness.
- You're dropping it.

869
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:41,767
Lower yourself for a second.

870
01:19:41,834 --> 01:19:42,734
Hold on.

871
01:19:59,467 --> 01:20:02,834
Mr. Lee needs more glasses.
How many does he need?

872
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:04,934
He probably needs them all.

873
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:20,800
They want to move to Korea for the food.

874
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,533
They finished everything.

875
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,567
- Everything.
- They ate everything.

876
01:20:24,633 --> 01:20:26,567
It's all empty.

877
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:34,567
I get you.

878
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:37,266
Just think of it as a dream.

879
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:38,400
Okay.

880
01:20:39,333 --> 01:20:40,934
- I'm passing through.
- Okay.

881
01:20:41,734 --> 01:20:42,633
Now...

882
01:20:43,734 --> 01:20:45,300
Min-si got smaller.

883
01:20:46,233 --> 01:20:47,433
This is...

884
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,900
Min-si, where are you?

885
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,100
My back is getting crouched.

886
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,700
Where are you? I'm sorry.

887
01:20:52,767 --> 01:20:55,433
I don't even know how I look now.

888
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,767
We still have a lot of dishes to wash?

889
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:10,500
Yes, one more tray.

890
01:21:10,567 --> 01:21:11,834
- One more tray?
- Gosh.

891
01:21:19,200 --> 01:21:22,133
- I'll bring these. Clean up this part.
- All right.

892
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,467
How can we make another round?

893
01:21:31,533 --> 01:21:32,467
We can do this.

894
01:21:33,233 --> 01:21:34,467
I'm sure Min-si can.

895
01:21:34,567 --> 01:21:36,367
Gosh, this is no joke.

896
01:21:37,500 --> 01:21:39,367
How many glasses have we used?

897
01:21:40,300 --> 01:21:41,800
I need more glasses.

898
01:21:41,867 --> 01:21:42,767
Sorry?

899
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,233
- Colored glasses.
- I'm on it.

900
01:21:54,333 --> 01:21:56,033
They're not ready, are they?

901
01:21:56,133 --> 01:21:57,800
Only except for the group room.

902
01:21:57,867 --> 01:21:59,433
- You can let them in.
- If so...

903
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:00,800
We can do this.

904
01:22:05,133 --> 01:22:06,700
I have to place the glasses.

905
01:22:06,767 --> 01:22:07,867
Let them in first.

906
01:22:07,967 --> 01:22:08,900
- Should I?
- Yes.

907
01:22:11,100 --> 01:22:12,333
He needs more?

908
01:22:12,433 --> 01:22:15,333
How come there are so many glasses?
My goodness!

909
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:21,700
- It needs one more table mat.
- For five?

910
01:22:21,767 --> 01:22:24,000
- Yes, with glasses.
- Okay. I'll get it.

911
01:22:24,333 --> 01:22:26,300
- We're starting with Daisy.
- Okay.

912
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:13,100
We have a great view.

913
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:44,633
Woo-shik, how about you set the room
and I take orders?

914
01:23:45,533 --> 01:23:46,500
- What do you say?
- Yes.

915
01:23:46,567 --> 01:23:48,066
I'll take orders one by one.

916
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:49,433
- Table by table.
- Okay.

917
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:01,100
You can put them there now.

918
01:24:01,166 --> 01:24:03,100
- What?
- They're all seated.

919
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,900
They're seated?

920
01:24:04,967 --> 01:24:06,667
He's about to take orders.

921
01:24:06,767 --> 01:24:08,433
Oh, no. I should hurry up.

922
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,000
Take your time.

923
01:24:10,066 --> 01:24:11,734
I'm just letting you know.

924
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:14,233
I'm not even ready for this.

925
01:24:15,700 --> 01:24:18,266
Oh, my goodness.

926
01:24:19,033 --> 01:24:19,934
My back hurts.

927
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:24,133
Here is your tray.

928
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,800
We have another tray here.

929
01:24:25,867 --> 01:24:27,400
Why did this leak so much?

930
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:29,467
If you need a tea spoon, here.

931
01:24:29,533 --> 01:24:31,433
- I'll take it.
- It's all done.

932
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,567
Okay.

933
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,700
Did you divide their orders?

934
01:25:11,767 --> 01:25:13,667
- Yes.
- You wrote them separately?

935
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,200
- Yes.
- Where is it?

936
01:25:16,367 --> 01:25:17,567
What? It was here.

937
01:25:18,834 --> 01:25:19,667
It's not here.

938
01:25:20,467 --> 01:25:21,700
It's right here.

939
01:25:25,767 --> 01:25:27,000
What is this?

940
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,500
Two people...

941
01:25:35,367 --> 01:25:37,700
Let's start again.

942
01:25:40,633 --> 01:25:41,500
One more time.

943
01:25:41,567 --> 01:25:42,767
- One more time?
- Yes.

944
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:43,667
Go!

945
01:25:46,633 --> 01:25:48,567
We are getting orders now.

946
01:25:48,967 --> 01:25:50,667
- What?
- We're getting orders.

947
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:52,734
My gosh.

948
01:25:55,467 --> 01:25:58,166
That's one bibimbap
and one spicy beef galbijjim.

949
01:25:58,233 --> 01:25:59,300
And one dakgalbi.

950
01:25:59,367 --> 01:26:00,333
All right.

951
01:26:01,867 --> 01:26:02,700
Okay.

952
01:26:40,934 --> 01:26:42,900
I took orders from the group.

953
01:26:48,567 --> 01:26:51,000
That's one bibimbap
and one beef galbijjim.

954
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:52,867
Then I should make bibimbap.

955
01:26:53,734 --> 01:26:55,734
I'm putting bibimbap on the stove.

956
01:26:57,633 --> 01:26:59,834
Dakgalbi takes some time anyway...

957
01:27:00,834 --> 01:27:03,400
I'll work on fritters then.
One, two, three, four.

958
01:27:03,467 --> 01:27:04,333
Five, six.

959
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:06,500
You talk to yourself a lot, Min-si.

960
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:08,734
Like this.

961
01:27:10,066 --> 01:27:12,100
I do it more when I get anxious.

962
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:14,433
One, two, three, four.

963
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:16,333
Five.

964
01:27:43,033 --> 01:27:44,500
Goodness.

965
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,433
I should make drinks.

966
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,800
Table One's done.
What did Table Two order?

967
01:27:54,266 --> 01:27:56,834
I'll make the drinks for the group.

968
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:58,800
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

969
01:28:08,734 --> 01:28:09,867
Here are the plum ades.

970
01:28:50,967 --> 01:28:53,200
Dangerous pots coming in and out.

971
01:28:54,533 --> 01:28:58,367
- I'll hold the baby when you serve food.
- Okay.

972
01:29:01,133 --> 01:29:02,500
In the hall, I'm...

973
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:04,400
- I'm doing so great.
- What?

974
01:29:04,467 --> 01:29:06,066
I'm doing a great job.

975
01:29:06,467 --> 01:29:07,367
Well, I mean...

976
01:29:07,433 --> 01:29:09,000
Did you dominate the hall?

977
01:29:09,066 --> 01:29:10,400
It's over now.

978
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:15,600
We're out of soju.

979
01:29:16,433 --> 01:29:17,500
Soju?

980
01:29:18,367 --> 01:29:20,300
- Soju is here.
- I see. Where?

981
01:29:21,367 --> 01:29:22,200
Okay.

982
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,734
- I'll put them in the fridge later.
- Okay.

983
01:29:40,567 --> 01:29:41,800
Did they want Coke?

984
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:08,633
We're waiting for Table Three.

985
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:15,767
It's going smooth.

986
01:30:15,834 --> 01:30:17,233
- What?
- Don't you think?

987
01:30:17,333 --> 01:30:18,767
- Right.
- It's going well.

988
01:30:18,834 --> 01:30:19,734
Right.

989
01:30:36,767 --> 01:30:38,000
I'll do it.

990
01:30:50,066 --> 01:30:51,333
- Sweet potatoes.
- Yes.

991
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:52,400
Check if they're cooked.

992
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:57,867
It's all cooked.

993
01:30:57,934 --> 01:30:58,834
- All done?
- Yes.

994
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,600
Let's work on this first.

995
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:02,867
- You can turn off the heat.
- I got it.

996
01:31:05,367 --> 01:31:07,300
We are almost done.

997
01:31:09,266 --> 01:31:10,266
I can't hear it.

998
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:12,500
We need to hurry up.

999
01:31:12,734 --> 01:31:14,233
How many beef galbijjims?

1000
01:31:14,300 --> 01:31:15,133
Three.

1001
01:31:15,767 --> 01:31:16,667
All spicy?

1002
01:31:16,734 --> 01:31:17,567
Yes!

1003
01:31:17,633 --> 01:31:18,700
Three spicy galbijjim.

1004
01:31:18,767 --> 01:31:20,367
- Let's start now.
- I got it.

1005
01:31:25,667 --> 01:31:27,367
One spoon of chili powder?

1006
01:31:27,433 --> 01:31:28,633
- For three portions?
- Yes.

1007
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,133
One spoon. What about garlic?

1008
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:31,033
Minced garlic...

1009
01:31:31,133 --> 01:31:32,667
- One pinch.
- I got it.

1010
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:34,800
I hope your fingers aren't too big.

1011
01:31:34,867 --> 01:31:35,700
No. It's...

1012
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:37,867
Just a bit.

1013
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:39,900
We got no green onions.

1014
01:31:39,967 --> 01:31:40,934
Green onions?

1015
01:31:41,734 --> 01:31:43,033
We have tons of them.

1016
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:45,433
That's good.

1017
01:31:46,367 --> 01:31:48,066
- Are the fritters ready?
- Yes!

1018
01:31:49,133 --> 01:31:51,000
That's very good.

1019
01:32:12,433 --> 01:32:13,800
- Let's serve it.
- Okay.

1020
01:32:14,233 --> 01:32:15,867
I'll start sizzling the dolsot.

1021
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:17,200
Yes, the dolsot.

1022
01:32:23,367 --> 01:32:25,934
- For Table Three.
- Yes.

1023
01:32:26,033 --> 01:32:28,133
All right. Table Three is all done.

1024
01:32:28,900 --> 01:32:29,767
Next...

1025
01:32:32,967 --> 01:32:35,600
Do you remember in one of the episodes...

1026
01:32:35,667 --> 01:32:37,767
There was this number thing, right?

1027
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:39,834
Right, I remember.

1028
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:41,967
Was it in Mexico?

1029
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,834
Were those three statues in Mexico?

1030
01:32:50,934 --> 01:32:52,467
Did you watch the episode?

1031
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:53,800
Yes.

1032
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,900
We came here from London to see this.

1033
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:58,266
- Really?
- Yes.

1034
01:32:58,867 --> 01:32:59,934
Wow.

1035
01:33:07,367 --> 01:33:08,633
They're from London.

1036
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:12,667
Is our show that big?

1037
01:33:12,734 --> 01:33:15,133
- I don't know.
- Is it a global show now?

1038
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,100
Let me ask.

1039
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:21,300
Where did we find out?

1040
01:33:21,367 --> 01:33:22,266
On the news.

1041
01:33:22,333 --> 01:33:23,500
- Really?
- Twitter.

1042
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,066
No, London.

1043
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:47,100
From all over Europe,

1044
01:33:47,934 --> 01:33:50,000
people are coming here for this.

1045
01:33:53,100 --> 01:33:54,533
From all over Europe.

1046
01:33:55,834 --> 01:33:57,934
- They saw on Twitter.
- Keep it down.

1047
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,767
- That's how they're coming.
- Be quiet.

1048
01:33:59,934 --> 01:34:02,066
Imagine, we've been watching the show...

1049
01:34:02,934 --> 01:34:04,133
I know.

1050
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,266
For two seasons...

1051
01:34:05,633 --> 01:34:07,100
No, not two.

1052
01:34:07,166 --> 01:34:09,000
- Three seasons.
- Three? Okay.

1053
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:11,967
We started with Youn's Kitchen.

1054
01:34:12,066 --> 01:34:17,233
The only show we weren't able to watch
was Youn's Stay.

1055
01:34:17,867 --> 01:34:19,467
We watched everything else.

1056
01:34:19,533 --> 01:34:21,667
We need to watch it when we go back.

1057
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:23,533
This is new.

1058
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:44,700
What's the sauce?

1059
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:47,867
Is it good?

1060
01:34:47,934 --> 01:34:49,200
The sauce is so good.

1061
01:34:49,266 --> 01:34:52,033
It's different from what we used to have.

1062
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:05,700
This isn't normal gochujang.

1063
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,066
What do you think is different? Honey?

1064
01:35:08,133 --> 01:35:10,066
I think they added honey.

1065
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,200
Is there honey in here?

1066
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,734
How did it become sweet?

1067
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:16,367
It's a secret sauce.

1068
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:34,867
I want to make this at home.

1069
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,300
Where's Johan's snack?

1070
01:35:58,367 --> 01:36:00,200
The chicken is so good.

1071
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,266
Isn't the chicken good?

1072
01:36:11,333 --> 01:36:12,166
It's so good.

1073
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:13,233
This is good too.

1074
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:14,834
Beef galbijjim is amazing.

1075
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,433
The chef is very talented.

1076
01:36:19,166 --> 01:36:20,367
One kkori-gomtang.

1077
01:36:20,867 --> 01:36:23,500
That's one bibimbap
and one beef galbijjim.

1078
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:34,834
All served to Table Three.

1079
01:36:34,900 --> 01:36:36,433
- Table Three is done.
- Right.

1080
01:36:36,533 --> 01:36:38,633
- Are you working on Table Four?
- Yes.

1081
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:45,133
- Three tables to go.
- Three.

1082
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:46,834
We are almost done, Min-si.

1083
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,367
Yes, we are almost done.

1084
01:36:49,233 --> 01:36:52,200
- You're making bibimbap?
- Yes, I'm putting it on the stove.

1085
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,433
Yes.

1086
01:37:03,166 --> 01:37:04,667
We have enough beef ribs.

1087
01:37:06,867 --> 01:37:08,967
But it's four spicy galbijjim.

1088
01:37:09,033 --> 01:37:11,367
I should make more fritters then.

1089
01:37:14,667 --> 01:37:15,767
Please don't rush.

1090
01:37:15,834 --> 01:37:17,266
I have to make fritters.

1091
01:37:17,333 --> 01:37:18,400
We can slow down.

1092
01:37:18,467 --> 01:37:20,533
I'll work on bibimbap. You do that.

1093
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:21,433
Okay!

1094
01:37:21,934 --> 01:37:23,967
Let's make vegetable fritters.

1095
01:37:43,133 --> 01:37:44,633
You are doing great.

1096
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:47,867
That's so cute.

1097
01:37:47,967 --> 01:37:50,133
- This is all we got.
- It's all right.

1098
01:37:54,967 --> 01:37:56,200
Are the fritters done?

1099
01:37:56,734 --> 01:37:58,233
Yes, they're almost done.

1100
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,467
Okay.

1101
01:37:59,567 --> 01:38:00,834
Hold on.

1102
01:38:01,433 --> 01:38:04,066
Hold on. I need to add this.

1103
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:07,433
- It should go with the next dish.
- Okay.

1104
01:38:07,500 --> 01:38:10,500
They ordered one dish each.
You can serve it first.

1105
01:38:10,567 --> 01:38:12,233
- I can serve it first?
- Yes.

1106
01:38:12,867 --> 01:38:13,700
What?

1107
01:38:13,867 --> 01:38:16,033
- They can just one second.
- Table Four.

1108
01:38:16,100 --> 01:38:16,934
I know.

1109
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,734
Nobody knows

1110
01:38:18,834 --> 01:38:20,166
- how we feel.
- I know.

1111
01:38:20,767 --> 01:38:23,600
We have many things
that need to go together.

1112
01:38:33,033 --> 01:38:36,633
We are quite free in the hall.
Tell me if you need help.

1113
01:38:47,133 --> 01:38:50,367
- What are you eating?
- Cabbage.

1114
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:52,800
I thought you were a rabbit.

1115
01:38:52,867 --> 01:38:54,333
- This is done.
- Great.

1116
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,934
Whatever is ready for the group,
just hand it to me.

1117
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,967
They aren't together anyway.

1118
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:01,133
- There are three teams.
- Really?

1119
01:39:01,233 --> 01:39:02,066
- Yes.
- Right.

1120
01:39:02,533 --> 01:39:05,667
Whatever that can be done fast,
galbijjim, bibimbap...

1121
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:21,200
Two dakgalbi.

1122
01:39:21,700 --> 01:39:24,433
A lot of dakgalbi orders today.

1123
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:27,633
- Beef galbijjim is ready.
- Okay.

1124
01:39:29,533 --> 01:39:32,834
We'll be done once we make
four spicy beef galbijjims.

1125
01:39:33,533 --> 01:39:34,934
This is exhausting.

1126
01:40:06,133 --> 01:40:07,433
My goodness.

1127
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:10,467
Go get some fresh air.

1128
01:40:11,266 --> 01:40:12,600
Yes, wash your face.

1129
01:40:12,667 --> 01:40:13,834
Get some air.

1130
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,834
Done, done, done!

1131
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:25,266
I want to go home.

1132
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:28,367
Min-si, I'm going home first.

1133
01:40:29,233 --> 01:40:30,300
I want to go home.

1134
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:32,934
Did you think it'd be fun?

1135
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:36,233
I didn't know it was this tough.

1136
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,033
Bibimbap?

1137
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,233
We are all sharing.

1138
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,133
Okay.

1139
01:40:45,367 --> 01:40:46,200
Let's try.

1140
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,900
I'm starting now.

1141
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:51,834
- Nice.
- Gosh.

1142
01:40:52,900 --> 01:40:54,033
Is this from Korea?

1143
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,633
I don't know. It tastes very authentic.

1144
01:41:01,700 --> 01:41:02,967
Gosh.

1145
01:41:07,667 --> 01:41:10,333
This is clearly different
from what we have.

1146
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,800
It's totally different.

1147
01:41:13,333 --> 01:41:14,233
Oh, my gosh.

1148
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:16,734
It's like that spicy buldak ramyeon.

1149
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:19,533
Spicy beef galbijjim.

1150
01:41:21,233 --> 01:41:23,233
Hurry up!

1151
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,800
This meat...

1152
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:30,934
- Is it that good?
- Let me taste it.

1153
01:41:34,266 --> 01:41:35,266
Goodness.

1154
01:41:36,367 --> 01:41:37,633
Are you guys sharing?

1155
01:41:37,734 --> 01:41:38,867
- Yes.
- Okay.

1156
01:41:40,533 --> 01:41:41,734
This...

1157
01:41:41,834 --> 01:41:43,900
Can we ask? How did they make this?

1158
01:42:00,533 --> 01:42:01,934
How do we eat the soup?

1159
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:03,567
- Use your spoon.
- Scoop it.

1160
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:14,367
Oh, it's cold!

1161
01:42:14,433 --> 01:42:15,767
It's delicious.

1162
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,667
This is amazing.

1163
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:22,767
I really want to go to Korea now.
I can't wait!

1164
01:42:26,633 --> 01:42:29,300
They ordered ice cream for the baby.

1165
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:30,934
The baby should eat first.

1166
01:42:31,200 --> 01:42:33,233
- Did she ask for it?
- Yes, the mom.

1167
01:42:42,900 --> 01:42:45,767
Because she's very picky with her food.

1168
01:43:10,867 --> 01:43:11,700
Is it good?

1169
01:43:12,166 --> 01:43:13,767
Okay, good.

1170
01:44:11,233 --> 01:44:13,066
- Hello.
- Hi.

1171
01:44:36,100 --> 01:44:37,533
Min-si. You should rest.

1172
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:39,700
You will collapse soon.

1173
01:44:39,767 --> 01:44:41,033
I'm exhausted.

1174
01:44:41,133 --> 01:44:42,767
Take breaks when you can.

1175
01:44:42,834 --> 01:44:45,467
I don't have time for breaks.

1176
01:44:46,066 --> 01:44:47,734
You should sit for a while.

1177
01:44:48,166 --> 01:44:49,600
You can use your phone.

1178
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:51,867
I'll call you when I need you.

1179
01:44:51,934 --> 01:44:52,867
Okay.

1180
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,467
There's an aurora
right above our restaurant.

1181
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:08,200
- Is that the aurora?
- Is that it?

1182
01:46:08,266 --> 01:46:10,600
- We have to go somewhere darker.
- Where?

1183
01:46:10,667 --> 01:46:11,500
Where?

1184
01:46:12,633 --> 01:46:14,767
- I can't see it. Where is it?
- Sorry!

1185
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:18,300
Isn't it the aurora?

1186
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:19,834
Where?

1187
01:46:20,433 --> 01:46:22,166
I can see it!

1188
01:46:22,667 --> 01:46:24,700
It's there, it's there!

1189
01:46:24,767 --> 01:46:26,133
It's up there!

1190
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,433
Maybe it's too bright here.

1191
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:30,533
I can see it from here. Come here.

1192
01:46:30,633 --> 01:46:32,767
See it from here.

1193
01:46:33,467 --> 01:46:35,033
I can see it very clearly.

1194
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:38,100
I should tell them to come out.

1195
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,000
Yes!

1196
01:46:41,734 --> 01:46:43,367
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

1197
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:46,500
Hey!

1198
01:46:46,967 --> 01:46:49,467
- Min-si. There's an aurora outside.
- Where?

1199
01:46:49,533 --> 01:46:51,066
Where?

1200
01:46:52,367 --> 01:46:53,767
Woo-shik.

1201
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:57,834
- There's an aurora!
- What?

1202
01:46:57,900 --> 01:46:59,500
- There's an aurora!
- Really?

1203
01:47:03,934 --> 01:47:04,800
Where?

1204
01:47:15,734 --> 01:47:16,934
It's right there.

1205
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:18,633
- Aurora, Woo-shik.
- Where?

1206
01:47:19,767 --> 01:47:20,600
Where?

1207
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:21,633
Here.

1208
01:47:21,734 --> 01:47:23,000
- Where?
- Over there!

1209
01:47:23,100 --> 01:47:25,233
From here. Tell Seo-jin to come out.

1210
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:26,967
It's getting clearer!

1211
01:47:27,033 --> 01:47:28,033
Oh, my goodness.

1212
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:29,567
- Woo-shik.
- Go forward.

1213
01:47:29,633 --> 01:47:31,934
- Try looking through this.
- My goodness.

1214
01:47:32,033 --> 01:47:33,166
This is incredible.

1215
01:47:33,233 --> 01:47:34,767
It's unbelievable.

1216
01:47:36,767 --> 01:47:38,667
It stretches from here to there.

1217
01:47:38,734 --> 01:47:40,133
Can you see the lights?

1218
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:42,433
- Goodness.
- Please take photos for me.

1219
01:47:42,500 --> 01:47:43,934
Send me later.

1220
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,900
- Goodness.
- I'll send the photos.

1221
01:47:46,433 --> 01:47:47,967
Here!

1222
01:47:48,033 --> 01:47:49,333
Where?

1223
01:47:49,967 --> 01:47:52,100
It's right here. You can see it.

1224
01:47:52,166 --> 01:47:53,300
It's amazing.

1225
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,500
What!

1226
01:47:57,166 --> 01:47:59,467
So the aurora is moving?

1227
01:47:59,533 --> 01:48:01,767
- Gosh.
- I can see it now.

1228
01:48:07,033 --> 01:48:08,233
Goodness!

1229
01:48:08,767 --> 01:48:09,800
This is amazing.

1230
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:12,300
Incredible.

1231
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:14,233
Wow!

1232
01:48:19,233 --> 01:48:20,266
Hello!

1233
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:22,834
Hi. I finally feel like I'm in Iceland.

1234
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:25,367
Gosh, here.

1235
01:48:25,433 --> 01:48:26,800
What's that?

1236
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:30,667
Look at this.

1237
01:49:10,934 --> 01:49:13,533
I thought I wasn't going to see it
this time.

1238
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,233
Wow.

1239
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:30,734
This is so nice.

1240
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,133
I saw the northern lights!

1241
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,767
I saw the aurora!

1242
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:44,600
It suddenly feels very rewarding.

1243
01:49:47,066 --> 01:49:49,400
This must be a good sign for us.

1244
01:50:10,900 --> 01:50:12,333
We worked really hard.

1245
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,834
Of course, it's Seo-jun.

1246
01:50:15,934 --> 01:50:17,800
It's my star.

1247
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:20,700
It smells so good.

1248
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,633
What is it?

1249
01:50:22,600 --> 01:50:24,667
I'll start with sundubu.

1250
01:50:25,767 --> 01:50:26,934
It smells so good.

1251
01:50:27,600 --> 01:50:29,533
- You look pretty.
- It's pretty.

1252
01:50:30,667 --> 01:50:31,834
It looks delicious.

1253
01:50:31,900 --> 01:50:32,834
Who made this?

1254
01:50:33,767 --> 01:50:34,633
It's a heart.

1255
01:50:35,300 --> 01:50:36,233
It's so good.

1256
01:50:42,467 --> 01:50:44,000
I'm almost like a machine.

1257
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:45,967
I wish they order a lot of sundubu.

1258
01:50:46,066 --> 01:50:48,533
Right, sundubu is good.

1259
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:53,900
The queue is very long.

1260
01:51:00,734 --> 01:51:02,266
Let's cut it like this.

1261
01:51:02,367 --> 01:51:03,200
Like this.

1262
01:51:03,266 --> 01:51:04,767
Isn't it smooth this way?

1263
01:51:04,834 --> 01:51:06,400
I can do this for a month.

1264
01:51:08,867 --> 01:51:09,934
Okay, let's go.

1265
01:51:12,734 --> 01:51:14,633
This is very relaxing.

1266
01:51:14,734 --> 01:51:17,233
We finally have a system.

1267
01:51:17,967 --> 01:51:18,934
Finally.

1268
01:51:19,033 --> 01:51:21,233
No wonder he is a NYU business major.

1269
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,800
- Oh!
- Where is it?

1270
01:51:24,867 --> 01:51:26,100
- Look up.
- It's up in the sky.

1271
01:51:26,166 --> 01:51:27,500
- Where?
- Above here.

1272
01:51:27,567 --> 01:51:28,467
I don't see it.

1273
01:51:29,033 --> 01:51:31,200
Seo-jin. Come here.

1274
01:51:33,166 --> 01:51:36,000
What's that thing called?
It helps with eyesight.

1275
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:37,867
- Lutein.
- Give it to me.

1276
01:51:38,633 --> 01:51:40,700
Seo-jin can't see it.

1277
01:51:42,533 --> 01:51:43,700
Hurry up.

1278
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:49,500
You can see it from here.

1279
01:51:49,567 --> 01:51:51,133
What? I don't see anything.

1280
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:57,400
- Give him the lutein.
- This is marvelous.

1281
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:59,767
You can't see it, can you?

1282
01:51:59,834 --> 01:52:01,767
Seo-jin can't see it.

1283
01:52:01,834 --> 01:52:03,066
Give him the lutein.

1284
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:04,633
Give it to him right now.

1285
01:52:05,533 --> 01:52:07,533
It's more vivid on the camera.

1286
01:52:07,600 --> 01:52:10,200
That's right.
It's more vivid on the camera.

1287
01:52:10,700 --> 01:52:11,934
Seo-jin, here.

1288
01:52:12,734 --> 01:52:14,166
Give him the lutein now.

1289
01:52:14,900 --> 01:52:16,467
What's with the tears?

1290
01:52:17,700 --> 01:52:18,734
