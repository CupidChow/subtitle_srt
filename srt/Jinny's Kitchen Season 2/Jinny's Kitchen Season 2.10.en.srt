00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,233
All right, everyone.

3
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:25,100
We definitely are making a presence here.

4
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,500
- One, two, three!
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

5
00:00:32,333 --> 00:00:33,600
Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

6
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,467
Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

7
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:37,667
Let's go!

8
00:00:37,734 --> 00:00:38,800
Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

9
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:40,600
Let's go, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

10
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,433
I'm so happy today.

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,033
You're open
until you run out of ingredients.

12
00:01:07,333 --> 00:01:09,667
- Two hundred and ten?
- Two hundred and ten servings?

13
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,667
We have to start all over again.

14
00:01:15,934 --> 00:01:18,233
- It's all done.
- I'm taking these off.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,467
It's so cold.

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,333
It's not so windy tonight.

17
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,600
- What time are we coming to work tomorrow?
- At 8:00.

18
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,200
I think we can come at 9:00.

19
00:01:36,934 --> 00:01:39,467
- I think so too.
- We did a lot of prep.

20
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:41,834
Honestly, we can come at 9:00.

21
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,100
We can come at 9:00.

22
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:45,133
We did it for an hour.

23
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:47,300
Is it 11:00?

24
00:01:47,367 --> 00:01:49,467
- It's past 11:00.
- Is it?

25
00:01:49,767 --> 00:01:52,066
Then how about we get there by 9:00?

26
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:55,433
That means we should
try to get there by 8:30.

27
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,300
All right, 8:30.

28
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,734
I'll leave it to you all.

29
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,400
Good night.

30
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,233
- Good night.
- Great work today.

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,467
Good night.

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,233
I should watch TV and rest.

33
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:11,333
Gosh, it's cold.

34
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:13,834
It's minus 10 degrees outside.

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,400
It's 50 degrees in here.

36
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:19,166
I get sleepy as soon as I put it on.

37
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:04,100
- Hello.
- Hello.

38
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,200
Finally, it's the last day.

39
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,800
Our last day at work.

40
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:12,900
Mr. Lee, it's the last day of work.
How do you feel?

41
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:14,734
Feels like my real last one.

42
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,767
For this season...

43
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,467
Change the title.

44
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,633
Change it to what?

45
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,967
"Junny's Kitchen" or "Yumi's Kitchen."

46
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:25,834
- Or "Jung's Kitchen."
- "Jung's Kitchen."

47
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,433
I'll leave it up to you.
Or "Min-si's Kitchen."

48
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:31,500
I can do it.

49
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,400
I can't go out of the kitchen today.

50
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:36,333
There will be one extra helper.

51
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,500
The beanie guy!

52
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,200
So he's my direct subordinate.

53
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,000
- Right.
- Am I right?

54
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,133
Yes, he is.

55
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,166
He's here.

56
00:03:49,033 --> 00:03:50,633
I'll teach him properly.

57
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,533
Hold on, wait a minute.

58
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,967
- Hold on, please.
- Sure.

59
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:57,367
- Rice bowls.
- For the group...

60
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:58,600
Thank you.

61
00:03:58,667 --> 00:03:59,667
Sundubu...

62
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,667
Slow down. Be careful.

63
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,367
What do we do if we get there now?

64
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:13,166
- We get ready.
- Kkori-gomtang.

65
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,467
I have to stir-fry.

66
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,100
That won't take much time.

67
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,133
- I need to do the cucumbers.
- Seaweed sauce.

68
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,567
I have to make seaweed sauce.

69
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:22,033
I need to work on squid and clams.

70
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,166
- So much to do.
- It's fine.

71
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:29,166
- It's okay.
- There's so much to do.

72
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:34,200
Let's go.

73
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,333
Gosh, it's cold.

74
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,734
You should go in first.

75
00:04:56,433 --> 00:05:01,333
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

76
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,033
Finally! It's our last day.

77
00:05:07,533 --> 00:05:08,633
I'm so nervous.

78
00:05:36,767 --> 00:05:40,367
Hello, good morning.
It's the last morning here.

79
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:44,367
It's finally over.

80
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,000
It's good.

81
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,867
The mega meal prep I did last night.

82
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,367
This is a lot.

83
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,834
It's scary.

84
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,367
I'll stir-fry it all.

85
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,700
Stir-fry for bibimbap first?

86
00:07:02,066 --> 00:07:05,567
I feel like I'm getting healthy
looking at fresh vegetables.

87
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,166
Just by looking at them...

88
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:11,567
I'll get healthier
eating these here for a month.

89
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,800
Are you slicing zucchinis?

90
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,133
No, I'm going to pickle these in salt.

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,900
- Are those cucumbers?
- Yes.

92
00:08:05,233 --> 00:08:06,600
Please turn off the tap.

93
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:08,166
Thank you.

94
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:36,333
Has it been one hour?

95
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
- Already?
- It's 9:52 a.m. now.

96
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:39,433
Right.

97
00:09:13,734 --> 00:09:15,934
Seo-jin, what about our meals?

98
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,133
Hot dogs?

99
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:23,900
The ones we had the other day?

100
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,700
Woo-shik doesn't look happy.

101
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,500
You aren't eating?

102
00:09:30,066 --> 00:09:31,033
No?

103
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:33,367
Are you eating or not?

104
00:09:33,734 --> 00:09:34,567
Woo-shik!

105
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,066
- Aren't you going to eat?
- Right.

106
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,400
- Aren't you going to eat?
- Right.

107
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,600
- What was that?
- You're not having hot dogs?

108
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,500
Hot dogs? Is everyone okay with hot dogs?

109
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:50,066
Let's just eat hot dogs.

110
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,133
- Okay.
- Hot dogs.

111
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:53,734
The hot dog place opens quite early.

112
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,200
I didn't put in a lot of water
compared to the meat.

113
00:10:25,734 --> 00:10:27,700
So I think it'll be thicker.

114
00:10:29,233 --> 00:10:31,266
You might choke on the thick soup.

115
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:37,900
Do we have whole black pepper?

116
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:39,266
- We do.
- Where is it?

117
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:40,533
I think I saw it.

118
00:10:41,834 --> 00:10:42,834
It's here!

119
00:10:44,934 --> 00:10:46,166
It will get infused anyway.

120
00:10:46,233 --> 00:10:47,633
- For gomtang, yes?
- Yes.

121
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,567
The soup is very rich today.

122
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,567
Gosh, it's very rich.

123
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,867
The color of the soup is amazing.

124
00:11:18,333 --> 00:11:19,166
Nice.

125
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:25,233
I think I've been holding this,
more than a spoon, for a year.

126
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,133
Don't you think?

127
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:30,367
I don't think I hold a spoon
longer than I hold this.

128
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,900
This ladle's part of my body.

129
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,467
You know?

130
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:40,734
Now I think we should've set up a huge pot
outside for me to cook this.

131
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,533
Why do this in the kitchen?

132
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,033
You could have prepared

133
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,066
a huge pot outside.

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,166
During the day, I could've cut firewood
in the mountains. Right?

135
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:58,000
I could've just dropped by in the morning
to drop firewood and charcoal.

136
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,900
And deliver meat.

137
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,233
Then I'd go back to the mountain.

138
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:08,200
Living up there in a small cabin.

139
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,300
Right?

140
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,633
It's rich since I put in less water.

141
00:12:24,834 --> 00:12:25,667
What is it?

142
00:12:48,266 --> 00:12:49,500
So it has started.

143
00:12:50,066 --> 00:12:51,100
It has started.

144
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,667
Mr. Lee...

145
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,900
I think you should go and check outside.

146
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,500
- Why?
- Customers are here?

147
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,266
Already?

148
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,934
- I'm scared.
- Already?

149
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,200
- What time is it?
- About 40 to 50 people.

150
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:07,100
- Already?
- What? Seriously?

151
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,700
It's not even 10:30 yet.

152
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:09,834
Really?

153
00:13:45,633 --> 00:13:46,967
This is crazy.

154
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,200
Are there a lot?

155
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:49,734
My goodness.

156
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,633
Why don't they go to good restaurants?

157
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,467
Ours is a good restaurant.

158
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,767
No?

159
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:03,767
A lot of people have lined up.

160
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,166
How come our business is so good?

161
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,433
There's no other Korean restaurant here.
That's big.

162
00:14:17,066 --> 00:14:18,867
People are lining up already.

163
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,633
Gosh, the queue is...

164
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,333
It's amazing.

165
00:14:30,867 --> 00:14:32,033
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

166
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,533
Come here.

167
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:37,300
Yes, what is it, sir?

168
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:42,133
What will you do with the working hours?

169
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,533
What do you mean?

170
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,266
Are we going to accept them all
or cut off the line?

171
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:50,066
That's up to you, Boss.

172
00:14:50,133 --> 00:14:51,200
What do you think?

173
00:14:53,567 --> 00:14:56,533
It's 10:30, but they're lining up
to the corner already.

174
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Reached the corner already?

175
00:14:58,266 --> 00:14:59,500
- No.
- I'll go check.

176
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,600
Gollum!

177
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:11,133
There's Gollum in the restaurant.

178
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,734
Did someone bring an animal here?

179
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,834
The line has reached the corner.

180
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,567
- It has?
- Yes.

181
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,367
But we can't do it right now...

182
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:34,367
If we cut off the queue now,
other people will come and line up again.

183
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,467
So we should leave it.

184
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:45,133
Seo-jin, then,

185
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,266
why did you call me?

186
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,300
- I had to discuss it with you.
- Got it.

187
00:15:51,667 --> 00:15:53,467
I'll go back to cutting cuttlefish.

188
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:59,000
You and me are waiters today.

189
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:24,800
What's left now?

190
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,300
Can you marinate the bulgogi?

191
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,967
The last bulgogi sauce I'll ever make.

192
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,166
Goodbye.

193
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,100
This kimchi looks so good.

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,567
Min-si, want some gomtang?
Have it with kimchi.

195
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:30,867
Okay.

196
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,166
I eat kimchi without anything.

197
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:36,934
- Not even rice?
- No, no rice.

198
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,533
I look for it the moment I wake up.

199
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,734
Hot dogs are here.

200
00:17:44,567 --> 00:17:45,867
Hot dogs.

201
00:17:58,433 --> 00:17:59,867
- Where did you...
- Yu-mi.

202
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:01,533
Min-si, did you have hot dogs?

203
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,000
- I can't eat now.
- You can't?

204
00:18:03,066 --> 00:18:05,333
Me neither, I have to work on the carrots.

205
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,700
Here. I'm coming.

206
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:17,300
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

207
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,800
- Min-si, you have the badge?
- Sorry?

208
00:20:10,867 --> 00:20:12,600
- Let me put it on for you.
- Okay.

209
00:20:15,533 --> 00:20:16,367
Thank you.

210
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,200
This isn't anything big.

211
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:19,767
I don't have mine either.

212
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
Thank you.

213
00:20:28,467 --> 00:20:29,867
Shall we do the chant?

214
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,166
Hold on.

215
00:20:39,166 --> 00:20:41,700
I got this star badge yesterday.

216
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,567
I'd like to give it to Min-si.

217
00:20:45,767 --> 00:20:47,166
Oh, my.

218
00:20:47,233 --> 00:20:48,934
- Yesterday, you really...
- Thank you.

219
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,200
Good job.

220
00:20:55,967 --> 00:20:59,433
Today as well,
let's work hard until we're sold out!

221
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,367
- Are you ready now?
- Yes.

222
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:30,934
- Just five minutes to go.
- Five minutes!

223
00:21:31,266 --> 00:21:33,433
- Come on. Let's do the chant.
- Let's do this.

224
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,266
Right. We have to do that.

225
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:38,166
I've been waiting for this day.

226
00:21:38,767 --> 00:21:40,400
- Finally!
- Five warriors.

227
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,100
- Finally.
- All right.

228
00:21:42,767 --> 00:21:44,233
- All right.
- All right.

229
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:48,133
- Our last day!
- Yes.

230
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,600
Hold on a second.

231
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,066
You're blocking your face.

232
00:21:52,734 --> 00:21:54,300
- No, your face.
- It's fine.

233
00:21:54,367 --> 00:21:55,800
- Let's do this.
- Come on.

234
00:21:56,734 --> 00:21:58,533
- What was it?
- "One, two, three."

235
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,567
One, two, three.

236
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:03,033
One, two, three.
Let's go, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

237
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,867
Go, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

238
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,367
Okay, let's go!

239
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:20,266
Hey, we don't have orders for yukjeon,

240
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,700
let me know
if you need help with anything.

241
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:23,767
Sure, sure!

242
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,600
The meat is a bit bland.

243
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,400
Look! We got a great table.

244
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,533
Her hair is a mess.

245
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:57,967
I haven't left out anything, have I?

246
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,767
Here it comes! He's coming.

247
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,133
He's here!

248
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:07,000
- Order!
- Okay.

249
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,333
One bibim-guksu and one ttuk-bul.

250
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,333
The water won't boil.

251
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,333
The noodles aren't getting cooked.

252
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,200
- The water won't boil.
- How about the wok?

253
00:24:43,934 --> 00:24:45,900
They aren't getting cooked at all.

254
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:50,266
Give it to me. This has a higher heat.

255
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,400
Should I use that?

256
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,967
The meat pieces are huge today.

257
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,500
Yes, so it's easier.

258
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,200
This is much better.

259
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,033
This is it.

260
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,000
Yukjeon bibim-guksu is ready.

261
00:26:19,066 --> 00:26:21,066
You can serve it right now.

262
00:26:23,533 --> 00:26:24,967
- Green onions.
- Oh, my.

263
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:27,166
Isn't this too much yukjeon?

264
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:29,033
- I mean...
- It's okay.

265
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,166
This is too much.

266
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:31,900
- Table One is done.
- Just serve it.

267
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,633
We aren't making any profits.

268
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:37,767
We should use up all the ingredients.

269
00:26:37,834 --> 00:26:39,467
I think the bulgogi is cooked.

270
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:41,367
- You can remove it.
- Okay!

271
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,767
I'm taking the bibimbap out.

272
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:44,700
- No, I mean the bulgogi.
- Right.

273
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:51,767
Green onion here.

274
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,233
Should I go?

275
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:08,600
This is for the first table.

276
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,633
It's done.

277
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:17,066
We have more orders.

278
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,333
One gomtang and one dakgalbi.

279
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:23,166
One gomtang and one yukjeon bibim-guksu.

280
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,633
A lot of cabbage...

281
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,867
Oh, we haven't cooked the sweet potatoes.

282
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:44,667
I didn't cook the sweet potatoes
beforehand.

283
00:27:53,433 --> 00:27:54,900
- Dakgalbi?
- Yes.

284
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:58,066
It's really good. But it's spicy.

285
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,800
I'll just order dakgalbi for you.

286
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,100
Here.

287
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,467
Thank you.

288
00:28:26,266 --> 00:28:28,033
I want soup.

289
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,333
You want some soup?

290
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,367
They have soju here.

291
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:17,567
- The lid.
- Where is it?

292
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
There it is.

293
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:22,467
How come I didn't see it?

294
00:29:23,266 --> 00:29:24,100
My goodness.

295
00:29:29,066 --> 00:29:30,467
No need to rush.

296
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,100
- We have new orders.
- Okay.

297
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:37,100
That's two bibimbap and three dakgalbi.

298
00:29:37,166 --> 00:29:38,834
- We have more orders.
- Okay.

299
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,867
We can do it

300
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,200
I think the noodles are almost done.

301
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:58,967
Will you do that for me?

302
00:29:59,033 --> 00:30:00,500
Rinse them in water?

303
00:30:00,567 --> 00:30:02,200
- Yes, in cold water.
- Okay.

304
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,100
Dakgalbi is almost done.

305
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,400
- You can leave it.
- Okay.

306
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,033
Because of sweet potatoes.

307
00:30:19,934 --> 00:30:21,700
I'll put the gomtang on the stove.

308
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,400
Then I'll put two bowls
of bibimbap on, first.

309
00:30:31,467 --> 00:30:32,834
Looks delicious.

310
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,133
I put one gomtang on the stove.

311
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,066
I forgot to pre-cook the sweet potatoes.

312
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,500
Oh, well...

313
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,867
I realized it
because they ordered dakgalbi.

314
00:30:43,934 --> 00:30:45,433
I know. That's good.

315
00:30:47,667 --> 00:30:49,266
- Done.
- That should be okay.

316
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,467
I'll remove the gomtang then.

317
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:52,400
Okay.

318
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,700
Gomtang coming through!

319
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:57,767
I'll add green onion.

320
00:30:58,266 --> 00:31:01,033
- Gomtang's popular.
- Did you serve gomtang for Table Two?

321
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,667
Yes. And dakgalbi
is being served right now.

322
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,100
We're working on the gomtang
for the group.

323
00:31:07,166 --> 00:31:09,300
I'll put one more gomtang
on the stove then.

324
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:11,600
Yes. One bowl is already on the stove.

325
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,734
- That's for this table.
- Oh, this?

326
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,934
That's for Table Four.

327
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,233
Gomtang's quite popular.

328
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,233
Bibimbap is ready.

329
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:33,900
There's two more bibimbaps.

330
00:31:33,967 --> 00:31:36,266
I'm putting on one bowl of bibimbap again.

331
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,533
Should I put this on again?

332
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,467
One bibimbap is done.
Two bibimbap in total.

333
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:46,200
Gomtang is boiling.

334
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:47,400
Gomtang is boiling.

335
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,633
Kkori-gomtang for the group is ready.

336
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,133
You're good at reporting back.

337
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:56,066
- Gomtang is boiling.
- Gomtang is boiling.

338
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:58,333
Min-si is a fool.

339
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:10,767
I'll be here the whole day.

340
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,367
So this is where I'm looking
the entire day.

341
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,800
Three dakgalbi for the group.

342
00:32:39,934 --> 00:32:41,467
Okay, this is for Table Four.

343
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:43,400
Ttukbaegi. Hold on.

344
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:52,333
Why did she press that?

345
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,133
Do you know how to use these?

346
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,533
I'll just use them like this.

347
00:33:02,533 --> 00:33:03,834
Like this.

348
00:33:10,333 --> 00:33:12,600
- I'm knitting.
- Are you knitting?

349
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:13,667
Yes.

350
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:16,300
You just can't sit still.

351
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,734
I want that soup.

352
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,100
I'm so hungry.

353
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:29,934
- I'm so hungry and excited.
- I can't believe I'm having bibimbap.

354
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,734
We all share it, right?

355
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:33,533
- What?
- We'll all share, yes?

356
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:34,700
- No.
- No.

357
00:33:34,934 --> 00:33:36,934
- Absolutely not.
- Sorry for asking.

358
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,934
But I want to try.

359
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,066
- Yes, you can try it.
- That's what I meant.

360
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:42,467
I thought you wanted to share the dish.

361
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:44,300
No, I just wanted to try your dishes.

362
00:33:44,367 --> 00:33:46,967
All right, you can try it.

363
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,233
I love it!

364
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,934
You speak Korean?

365
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,100
- A bit
- A little?

366
00:34:18,066 --> 00:34:20,567
Did you learn it at school?

367
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:21,900
On the internet.

368
00:34:21,967 --> 00:34:23,600
- On the internet.
- Right.

369
00:34:24,033 --> 00:34:25,767
Kkori-gomtang...

370
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:27,400
Dakgalbi is here.

371
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:28,934
Ttukbaegi bulgogi?

372
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,633
These are two bowls of bibimbap
after Table Four.

373
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:49,000
Two bibimbap.

374
00:34:58,066 --> 00:34:59,734
I should do it.

375
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:06,133
Dakgalbi for Table Four is done.

376
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,500
- Dolsot for Table Four.
- Dolsot for Table Four.

377
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:11,000
Dakgalbi for Table Four is also coming.

378
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:12,133
Dolsot-bibimbap?

379
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:18,967
- Dakgalbi for Table Four.
- Dakgalbi for Table Four.

380
00:35:30,066 --> 00:35:31,100
When?

381
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,700
Well... About three years ago.

382
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,767
I see.

383
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,700
My gosh.

384
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,967
That was really fast.

385
00:35:53,033 --> 00:35:55,467
- Right.
- If we were at another restaurant,

386
00:35:55,533 --> 00:35:58,066
we would still be waiting for the drinks.

387
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,300
Right.

388
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,433
They must be well-prepared.

389
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:04,700
Can I have this?

390
00:36:04,767 --> 00:36:06,567
Sure, you can have one.

391
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,800
It's good!

392
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:13,633
- Do you want to try one?
- No.

393
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,066
I don't like it.

394
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,533
It's good, though.

395
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,500
It's really good.

396
00:36:26,734 --> 00:36:27,734
It's really good.

397
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,133
Right.

398
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,567
She loves it so much.

399
00:36:34,633 --> 00:36:35,834
You're funny.

400
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:43,033
It's hot.

401
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,433
I know. Blow on it to cool it, it's okay.

402
00:36:57,433 --> 00:36:58,834
Do you want more soup?

403
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:00,867
- Yes.
- Okay.

404
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,834
This is good.

405
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,433
Delicious.

406
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:12,300
She doesn't want to eat the soup.

407
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,600
Do you want her soup?

408
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:26,500
Goodness.

409
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,700
This is very long!

410
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,500
Now put it in your mouth
and just slurp it.

411
00:37:42,467 --> 00:37:45,166
Oh, this is great.

412
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:48,900
It's nice.

413
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,667
The meat is especially nice.

414
00:37:50,734 --> 00:37:51,934
It's so good!

415
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:53,467
It's very good.

416
00:37:53,567 --> 00:37:55,066
I'm glad we came.

417
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,300
- I know.
- Yes.

418
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:58,467
It's worth it.

419
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,533
This smells so good.

420
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,200
I wanted to eat it with this so badly.

421
00:38:23,633 --> 00:38:24,800
Nice!

422
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,467
My gosh, it's so good.

423
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,600
Do you know how to say,
"It's delicious" in Korean?

424
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:54,533
No.

425
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,533
"Masisseoyo."

426
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,500
- What is it?
- "Masisseoyo."

427
00:38:57,567 --> 00:38:59,233
"Masisseoyo."

428
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:02,667
- May I try a few pieces?
- Sure, take it.

429
00:39:02,734 --> 00:39:03,667
Is it spicy?

430
00:39:03,734 --> 00:39:04,667
No.

431
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,333
I swear, the food here is so good.

432
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,834
How's the soup?

433
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:32,867
It's very good.

434
00:39:32,967 --> 00:39:37,233
As you can see, it's very mild.
But it's one delicious soup.

435
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,166
How should we say it?

436
00:39:40,767 --> 00:39:42,500
"Skal" or "Jjan", which one?

437
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,200
In Icelandic.

438
00:39:44,266 --> 00:39:45,567
Let's stick to "Skal."

439
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,734
- Skal.
- Skal.

440
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,667
Bottoms up.

441
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,767
Next time we eat out,
it won't be as good as this.

442
00:39:57,533 --> 00:39:58,367
I know.

443
00:39:58,834 --> 00:40:00,567
Our standards are higher now.

444
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,400
It's so delicious, I'm crying.

445
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,867
It was worth the wait.

446
00:40:12,233 --> 00:40:13,333
It won't get backed up.

447
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,333
It's Table One, Two, Three, Four, Five.

448
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,867
It's okay for now,
but we'll be backed up from here.

449
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:03,967
Look at this.

450
00:41:05,266 --> 00:41:07,934
It's a microphone. It's so cute.

451
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,900
I see cameras here and there!

452
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,467
Are they following you?

453
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:23,800
It's watching you?

454
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,133
She's very excited.

455
00:41:30,967 --> 00:41:32,700
It's moving like this.

456
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:37,734
Let's see if it's following you.

457
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:39,834
Walk over here.

458
00:41:47,734 --> 00:41:49,233
- Dance.
- Dance.

459
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,033
That was a great choice.

460
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,767
I like mine, you like yours?

461
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:33,900
I like mine.

462
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,166
We have new orders.

463
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,467
- Okay.
- Table Five.

464
00:42:42,567 --> 00:42:46,467
That's one bibimbap, one dakgalbi,
and one bulgogi for Table Five.

465
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,367
Another dakgalbi?

466
00:42:48,433 --> 00:42:49,934
Yeah, another dakgalbi.

467
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:50,934
Really?

468
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,967
You go in.

469
00:43:10,233 --> 00:43:12,300
- Can you remove the water?
- Sweet potatoes?

470
00:43:19,233 --> 00:43:21,433
We have a lot of sweet potatoes here.

471
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:28,300
Well, then...
I'll turn on the heat for the bibimbap.

472
00:43:32,233 --> 00:43:34,567
I'll start with bulgogi. Where is it?

473
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,233
HERE COMES TTUKBAEGI BULGOGI

474
00:43:59,433 --> 00:44:00,600
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

475
00:44:03,133 --> 00:44:06,166
New orders, yukjeon and dakgalbi.

476
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
Why so many dakgalbi orders?

477
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:16,066
One more dakgalbi.
One yukjeon bibim-guksu and one bulgogi.

478
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:17,367
One bibimbap.

479
00:44:25,433 --> 00:44:27,867
I can't even think of going
to the hall today.

480
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,734
I'll be here all day.

481
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,600
- Bulgogi is ready.
- Bulgogi's ready. I'll get the rice.

482
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,734
Haven't we made one round yet?

483
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,066
We're almost there.

484
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:48,133
My goodness.

485
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:50,433
Hey, the beanie guy...

486
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:52,033
Isn't he coming in?

487
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:53,934
I think he should come in now.

488
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,934
Could you help with the dishes tomorrow?

489
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,166
Well, sure.

490
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,734
Help us, beanie guy.

491
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:28,633
He's here.

492
00:45:39,633 --> 00:45:41,066
It's all done. It's hot.

493
00:45:41,133 --> 00:45:42,033
All right.

494
00:45:49,633 --> 00:45:51,767
Hey, you are here.

495
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,934
Just think I'm invisible.

496
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,133
All right.

497
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,734
I'll put these glasses here.

498
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,800
Okay.

499
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,000
Hey beanie, you're here.

500
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:08,233
- Here.
- Leave it there.

501
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,967
It's very crowded in here.

502
00:46:14,767 --> 00:46:15,734
Here.

503
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:18,400
Leave it there. I'll take care of it.

504
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,500
Oh, my goodness.

505
00:46:35,367 --> 00:46:37,066
Be careful.

506
00:46:38,033 --> 00:46:40,133
- The part-timer is annoying.
- Right.

507
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:41,900
I'm sorry.

508
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,300
Bibimbap is ready.

509
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:09,834
We need to go five more rounds?

510
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,500
Are all the dishes served?

511
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,166
- Yes, they are all served.
- Okay!

512
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,533
We just made one round.

513
00:47:18,834 --> 00:47:21,100
- Ttukbaegi bulgogi.
- Ttukbaegi bulgogi.

514
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:46,600
Bibimbap?

515
00:48:05,367 --> 00:48:06,300
Dakgalbi.

516
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,867
Why did I blow the kimchi?

517
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,233
- Really?
- This is so good.

518
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,367
It's just so good.

519
00:49:48,834 --> 00:49:50,200
I can't wait to try it.

520
00:49:50,266 --> 00:49:51,900
Bulgogi?

521
00:49:54,367 --> 00:49:55,867
Yukjeon bibim-guksu.

522
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:34,333
- Do you want to try it? You want some?
- Yes, please.

523
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:44,900
Done?

524
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:46,834
Yes.

525
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,467
- You can get the next customers.
- What?

526
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:53,300
- There are customers waiting in the room.
- Who?

527
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:55,166
The next customers.

528
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:57,266
- Should I get them in?
- I think so.

529
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,633
- Can I?
- The previous ones are all gone.

530
00:52:01,066 --> 00:52:03,033
So the second round begins now.

531
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,633
- Yes, let's go.
- Okay.

532
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:07,300
Gosh, this is scary.

533
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:49,734
So nobody has ordered sundubu so far.

534
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,467
Right, there's sundubu too.

535
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,567
We got a sesame oil bottle there.
Any ingredients we are running out of?

536
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,967
- This one here too.
- Okay.

537
00:53:43,033 --> 00:53:44,300
Gosh.

538
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,767
- Give it to me.
- Okay.

539
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,333
Give it to me, sir.

540
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,333
Okay.

541
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,567
Put them up there, please.

542
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:03,900
Are these used ones?

543
00:54:03,967 --> 00:54:04,900
- Yes.
- Okay.

544
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,834
- Director Nah.
- Yes.

545
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:14,667
Yes!

546
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:16,367
- These need to be washed.
- Okay.

547
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:17,367
I'm sorry.

548
00:54:17,433 --> 00:54:18,834
No problem.

549
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,066
The next round begins.

550
00:54:26,166 --> 00:54:28,100
- Okay.
- We are starting again.

551
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,867
That's two dakgalbi for Table One.

552
00:54:29,967 --> 00:54:32,734
- That's one sundubu and one bulgogi.
- We have sundubu.

553
00:54:32,834 --> 00:54:33,700
Ttuk-bul.

554
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,900
Coming through, ma'am.

555
00:55:42,033 --> 00:55:43,000
My gosh.

556
00:55:55,033 --> 00:55:58,467
It really is hectic
since there are so many dishes to cook.

557
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,500
I can only cook two dishes at a time.
Three are too hard.

558
00:56:12,934 --> 00:56:14,533
I'll get the bulgogi out.

559
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:29,033
- Sundubu is ready.
- Okay.

560
00:56:46,266 --> 00:56:48,467
This bulgogi is for Table One.

561
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:50,033
I'll take that.

562
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:52,500
- These need to be washed.
- Okay.

563
00:56:54,266 --> 00:56:55,700
I'll put them outside.

564
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:00,266
- This is for Table One.
- Right.

565
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,300
Ttukbaegi bulgogi.

566
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,333
Bulgogi for Table Two.

567
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,000
- The side dishes too, yes?
- Yes.

568
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:34,233
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi.

569
00:57:34,767 --> 00:57:36,533
- Bulgogi for Table Two.
- For Table Two.

570
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,767
- Is it the last one?
- Yes.

571
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:43,700
Oh, it looks good.

572
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,333
It's not spicy?

573
00:58:31,433 --> 00:58:32,734
- It's not.
- Not spicy?

574
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,934
- No.
- Wow.

575
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,800
- Thank you.
- Sure.

576
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:46,033
I think this must be
the moment I feel closest to Korea.

577
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,100
The food was worthwhile.

578
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,000
Right.

579
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,834
"Takk fyrir matinn."

580
00:58:58,033 --> 00:58:58,867
Takk.

581
00:58:58,934 --> 00:58:59,834
- Matinn.
- Fryir.

582
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:00,834
Fryir.

583
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,100
- Matinn.
- Matinn.

584
00:59:04,734 --> 00:59:06,400
You can also shorten it to "Tak"?

585
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:13,433
Anyway,

586
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,934
shouldn't we go now?

587
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,433
The food was great.

588
00:59:17,433 --> 00:59:19,767
- It was all very delicious.
- I'm so happy with my dish.

589
01:01:09,967 --> 01:01:12,567
- Oh, really? So you can...
- Yes, we'll share.

590
01:01:35,333 --> 01:01:37,433
- We got orders from the group.
- Okay.

591
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:42,100
That's one dakgalbi, two sundubu,
one gomtang, and one bibimbap.

592
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,500
One ttukbaegi bulgogi.

593
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,867
- Okay, here it is.
- Orders, right.

594
01:01:46,433 --> 01:01:48,500
One kkori-gomtang.

595
01:01:48,567 --> 01:01:49,967
One dolsot-bibimbap.

596
01:01:50,533 --> 01:01:51,700
More orders.

597
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:53,967
One dolsot-bibimbap and one dakgalbi.

598
01:01:54,066 --> 01:01:55,533
Yukjeon bibim-guksu too.

599
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:00,400
Let me put this on.

600
01:02:01,233 --> 01:02:04,233
What's with gomtang today?
It's selling really well.

601
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,734
I put the gomtang on the stove.

602
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:38,333
Yukjeon bibim-guksu looks so pretty.

603
01:02:38,433 --> 01:02:39,266
For Table Four.

604
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,700
It looks even prettier sliced like that.

605
01:02:53,533 --> 01:02:55,533
Next, bibimbap.

606
01:02:57,734 --> 01:02:59,767
I'll put those bowls together.

607
01:02:59,867 --> 01:03:01,934
- Are you heating bibimbap?
- No, not yet.

608
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,100
I was waiting to cook
all of them together.

609
01:03:10,567 --> 01:03:12,100
That's it for Table Five.

610
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:16,133
One gomtang and one dakgalbi.
So they ordered every dish.

611
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,500
I'll work on dakgalbi and sundubu.

612
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,166
- Do we have bulgogi?
- Yes, we do.

613
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:44,433
Which one?

614
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,567
I have no time for a break at this rate.

615
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:08,700
What time is it?

616
01:04:08,767 --> 01:04:10,300
What time is it? How...

617
01:04:10,367 --> 01:04:13,100
- How's the world going?
- We still have seven hours left.

618
01:04:13,166 --> 01:04:14,100
All right.

619
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,300
What's wrong with this?
This shouldn't be so complicated.

620
01:04:23,567 --> 01:04:25,100
Give them to me.

621
01:04:26,834 --> 01:04:27,867
I mean...

622
01:04:27,934 --> 01:04:29,967
I feel bad for him. What do we do?

623
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:32,567
Here.

624
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:34,066
Don't do this anymore.

625
01:04:34,133 --> 01:04:35,433
- Sorry?
- Don't do this.

626
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:36,367
- Don't?
- No.

627
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:39,300
- You should've told me earlier.
- I'm sorry.

628
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:49,934
Sir,

629
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,133
- this is disrespectful.
- Why?

630
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,066
- Bringing all at once, it's rude.
- What?

631
01:04:54,133 --> 01:04:56,834
- What else can I do?
- How can you be so rude?

632
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:03,367
I still have the ingredients,
but not the energy.

633
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:11,867
Red and green chili for the sundubu.

634
01:05:11,934 --> 01:05:12,967
- Right.
- Yes.

635
01:05:13,567 --> 01:05:15,166
Bulgogi is ready to go.

636
01:05:15,266 --> 01:05:16,166
Okay.

637
01:05:21,467 --> 01:05:23,900
- Yukjeon bibim-guksu is ready, right?
- Yes.

638
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:27,200
Then should we serve bibimbap
and bibim-guksu first?

639
01:05:27,266 --> 01:05:28,300
- Yes.
- Okay.

640
01:05:28,867 --> 01:05:30,467
- Everyone, get out.
- Okay.

641
01:05:30,533 --> 01:05:31,967
I just want to be alone.

642
01:05:42,767 --> 01:05:44,133
Have we made one round?

643
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,033
My goodness...

644
01:05:57,867 --> 01:05:59,233
He knows what we need.

645
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:06,934
- Is it for Table Four?
- Yes, for Table Four.

646
01:06:07,033 --> 01:06:09,834
- That's also for Table Four.
- Yes. Table Four is done.

647
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:10,834
Okay.

648
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,066
- Is this all?
- This is a lot.

649
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:47,600
We're eating now!

650
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,333
This looks good.

651
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,934
Look at these noodles.

652
01:06:52,066 --> 01:06:53,433
Do they look delicious?

653
01:06:53,533 --> 01:06:55,100
- This is amazing.
- Amazing.

654
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,834
This is really delicious.

655
01:07:07,367 --> 01:07:08,734
Each dish is so good.

656
01:07:08,834 --> 01:07:10,767
Much better than what we had in London.

657
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:11,867
You are right.

658
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,200
It's on another level.

659
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:23,500
I think these cold noodles are the best.

660
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,934
This is so good.

661
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,400
- This meat with eggs is so good.
- Right.

662
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:29,166
This soup is also very nice.

663
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:33,600
This soup must have been boiled
for a very long time.

664
01:07:46,934 --> 01:07:48,467
Let me try the gomtang.

665
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:51,633
It's really light and delicious.

666
01:07:53,633 --> 01:07:54,467
Nice.

667
01:07:56,934 --> 01:07:58,200
- Nice.
- Is it good?

668
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,133
- It's really neat.
- Right!

669
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,567
It's really delicious.

670
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,300
It's very soft.

671
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,967
The beef isn't tough at all.
It's very delicious.

672
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:25,066
It's very good.

673
01:08:30,934 --> 01:08:35,000
For the last five days in Iceland, this is
my first time tasting such rich flavors.

674
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,734
- So? Should we get the bill?
- Yes.

675
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:20,567
- I'll take their orders.
- Okay.

676
01:09:20,667 --> 01:09:22,100
I'm taking their orders.

677
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:24,367
- Okay.
- I'm taking their orders.

678
01:09:33,533 --> 01:09:34,834
- Dakgalbi.
- Dakgalbi.

679
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:16,934
Is it ordinary?

680
01:11:18,867 --> 01:11:20,266
Not too much for me.

681
01:11:24,533 --> 01:11:26,233
It doesn't smell anything.

682
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:27,734
Can I smell it?

683
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,100
It smells like a hand sanitizer.

684
01:11:30,166 --> 01:11:31,667
You are right.

685
01:11:31,767 --> 01:11:33,166
I don't smell anything.

686
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:36,967
Should I finish it up?

687
01:11:37,033 --> 01:11:38,066
No.

688
01:11:38,133 --> 01:11:39,266
Yes, go on.

689
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:42,667
I'd taste it first
instead of finishing it at once.

690
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,467
I think I know
why a lot of people drink this.

691
01:11:48,533 --> 01:11:49,867
Is it strong for you?

692
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:51,734
It's quite mild.

693
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,867
Right.

694
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:56,133
I get why many people keep drinking this.

695
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:59,100
- It's not too strong.
- It says here, 20.1 percent.

696
01:11:59,166 --> 01:12:01,367
- What?
- It's 20.1 percent of alcohol.

697
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:08,367
It says here.

698
01:12:25,233 --> 01:12:28,934
It's warm as if we're home.

699
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,834
It's not just my stomach.
Even my shoulders are warm.

700
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:39,834
I'm hungry.

701
01:12:40,433 --> 01:12:41,467
Goodness.

702
01:12:43,367 --> 01:12:44,200
Why?

703
01:12:44,834 --> 01:12:46,834
How come it won't get less?

704
01:12:49,567 --> 01:12:51,433
I have to stir-fry more onion.

705
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,467
Do you have enough rice?

706
01:12:54,533 --> 01:12:56,333
- It's more than enough.
- I see.

707
01:12:57,367 --> 01:12:59,433
We're running out of yakgochujang.

708
01:13:03,166 --> 01:13:05,700
This is the last container
of yakgochujang.

709
01:13:09,333 --> 01:13:10,266
It's the last one.

710
01:13:10,333 --> 01:13:12,667
You can't make any more bibimbap
if you use that up.

711
01:13:12,734 --> 01:13:14,533
I have to use this up as well?

712
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:16,834
- No.
- Even yakgochujang?

713
01:13:16,900 --> 01:13:19,166
- No, stop.
- No!

714
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,834
That's one bibimbap, one dakgalbi,
and one sundubu.

715
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:28,834
- Orders.
- More orders.

716
01:13:30,166 --> 01:13:31,400
More orders.

717
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,567
You can make two dakgalbi in total.

718
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,500
I prepared them ahead.

719
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:48,967
Go!

720
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,266
- We're much faster now, right?
- Yes.

721
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,900
Yukjeon bibim-guksu... No.

722
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,266
I mean dolsot-bibimbap.

723
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,800
Two bowls on the stove.

724
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:51,400
Should I put them on a higher heat?

725
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:53,767
On a higher heat.

726
01:15:05,967 --> 01:15:07,333
Sundubu is ready to go.

727
01:15:07,433 --> 01:15:09,166
- Right.
- The bibimbap is sizzling.

728
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:23,333
Here, bulgogi.
Bibimbap, too, will be ready soon.

729
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:24,834
Bibimbap's coming.

730
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:26,900
Where did the bibimbap go?

731
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:31,967
- Where did the bibimbap go?
- On your right.

732
01:15:32,033 --> 01:15:33,133
- I mean left.
- Right.

733
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,500
This is done for Table Five.

734
01:15:42,066 --> 01:15:43,166
All right.

735
01:15:43,233 --> 01:15:44,467
He just took it.

736
01:15:45,967 --> 01:15:47,934
I wish there were songs playing.

737
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,567
With beats,

738
01:15:49,633 --> 01:15:51,467
I can hang in there.

739
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:54,767
The only sound we hear is the dishwasher.

740
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:04,667
- This dishwasher is amazing.
- Right? It's so fast.

741
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:07,934
- And it's hygienic.
- Wait, where is cabbage?

742
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,033
- It sterilizes very well.
- Cabbage.

743
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,600
And it drains water well.

744
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:24,567
By the way, seriously...

745
01:16:25,266 --> 01:16:27,834
He's being very helpful.

746
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:30,700
Seriously. Very helpful.

747
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:36,200
Hey.

748
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:37,533
You are fast.

749
01:16:37,967 --> 01:16:39,800
You are done? My gosh.

750
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:42,300
- That was very fast.
- This is my only job.

751
01:16:42,967 --> 01:16:46,233
We actually need one person
who only washes the dishes.

752
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,033
Hey!

753
01:16:53,633 --> 01:16:55,700
What's with the fuss in the back?

754
01:16:58,934 --> 01:17:01,166
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

755
01:17:04,033 --> 01:17:05,233
Gosh, I'm starving.

756
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:07,700
Hot dogs get digested fast.

757
01:17:07,767 --> 01:17:08,700
I'm hungry.

758
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:10,734
Why did it get digested so fast?

759
01:17:10,967 --> 01:17:13,567
I'm hungry.
That means it gets digested fast.

760
01:17:13,633 --> 01:17:16,900
It's not that. The hot dog was small.
It was this small.

761
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:20,133
You all finished the hot dogs, yes?

762
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,700
- I didn't.
- I didn't either.

763
01:17:21,767 --> 01:17:23,367
- I'm so hungry now.
- I'm hungry too.

764
01:17:23,433 --> 01:17:27,567
Call the HQ and get special meals.
Tell Mr. Lee to hurry up.

765
01:17:27,633 --> 01:17:28,467
Yes, sir.

766
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:33,934
We don't have time to eat.

767
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:36,467
None at all, what do we do?

768
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,567
I definitely will want to drink
after this.

769
01:17:40,467 --> 01:17:42,834
Today will be one impressive day.

770
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,734
Son.

771
01:17:47,934 --> 01:17:49,066
I'm almost done.

772
01:18:02,367 --> 01:18:03,200
It's all done.

773
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,233
My legs can't hurt so soon.

774
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:27,033
Here, bulgogi is ready.

775
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:28,633
Please scoop two bowls of rice.

776
01:18:30,834 --> 01:18:32,400
These are for Table Five and Table Three.

777
01:18:32,467 --> 01:18:35,000
This dakgalbi is for Table One.

778
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:37,967
- This is also for Table Four.
- All of these are for Table Four.

779
01:18:38,066 --> 01:18:40,467
They all have to be served.
I'll cook the gomtang now.

780
01:18:40,533 --> 01:18:42,567
Yes, do it.
Let the dishes be served first.

781
01:18:42,633 --> 01:18:43,633
Okay.

782
01:18:51,633 --> 01:18:53,700
It will be all done after the dakgalbi.

783
01:19:08,233 --> 01:19:11,233
What do you want to eat the most
when you go back to Korea?

784
01:19:11,300 --> 01:19:12,367
Jjajangmyeon.

785
01:19:14,934 --> 01:19:17,200
Seo-jin, two bowls of bulgogi
for the group.

786
01:19:21,633 --> 01:19:23,667
- Should I go with you?
- No.

787
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:30,133
Is this yours?

788
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,033
Yes.

789
01:20:20,633 --> 01:20:22,300
University of Iceland.

790
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:24,100
A university?

791
01:20:27,033 --> 01:20:30,900
So do you watch Korean shows or movies?

792
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,033
Thank you.

793
01:21:33,934 --> 01:21:35,700
This is beyond delicious.

794
01:21:36,667 --> 01:21:38,033
Mine is very good too.

795
01:21:38,133 --> 01:21:39,300
Great.

796
01:21:39,367 --> 01:21:42,033
- Do you want to try mine?
- Sure, you can try mine too.

797
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,300
Try the chicken.

798
01:21:53,367 --> 01:21:54,867
- Is it good?
- Yes.

799
01:21:54,934 --> 01:21:55,900
- A bit spicy.
- Thanks.

800
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:56,834
Just a bit.

801
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:00,700
Thank you.

802
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,834
How's mine?

803
01:22:01,900 --> 01:22:03,533
I want to try yours.

804
01:22:03,633 --> 01:22:04,667
Thank you.

805
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:08,300
Thank you.

806
01:22:14,133 --> 01:22:15,734
What I just had is so good.

807
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,700
We need hot soup when it's cold.

808
01:22:18,233 --> 01:22:20,567
Right. I really wanted hot soup.

809
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:25,233
Table Four.

810
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,100
Hold on. I'll get you rice.

811
01:22:46,033 --> 01:22:47,200
- Table Four?
- Yes.

812
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:50,266
Bibimbap?

813
01:22:50,367 --> 01:22:51,266
Bibimbap.

814
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:55,900
Here's your dish.

815
01:23:00,900 --> 01:23:03,100
Okay. I'll video this.

816
01:23:04,233 --> 01:23:06,500
- Can I eat it now?
- No.

817
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,567
It just looks so good.

818
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:10,900
Oh, God.

819
01:23:13,934 --> 01:23:16,166
Can I start eating?

820
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,600
Okay, let's start.

821
01:23:23,467 --> 01:23:26,166
- Use that.
- I never tried seaweed before.

822
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,433
Look. I'm a genius!

823
01:24:19,467 --> 01:24:21,200
Does anyone have a hair band?

824
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:23,367
- No.
- No.

825
01:24:23,467 --> 01:24:25,934
Then I'll put my hair back like this.

826
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:45,767
Happy dance. Gosh.

827
01:25:04,033 --> 01:25:06,266
Are you finishing up the rest of soju?

828
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:07,834
Well...

829
01:25:08,934 --> 01:25:10,633
I want to walk out sober.

830
01:25:10,734 --> 01:25:12,667
I might roll down the stairs.

831
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:18,367
This is so good.

832
01:25:18,433 --> 01:25:19,667
Right, it's so good.

833
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:22,834
Can I have some? I'll give you mine.

834
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,000
Is this enough?

835
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,200
Is it good?

836
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:40,567
It's so good.

837
01:25:41,533 --> 01:25:43,233
Can you just feed me?

838
01:25:51,233 --> 01:25:53,934
This is better than
all of the dishes I've ever had.

839
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:54,867
Really?

840
01:25:54,934 --> 01:25:57,300
Now I've betrayed my grandmother.

841
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:11,934
It's my first time
looking at the sky today.

842
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:13,567
The weather is amazing.

843
01:26:13,633 --> 01:26:14,900
Weather's so nice today.

844
01:26:17,834 --> 01:26:21,367
If we cast you again for this show...

845
01:26:21,433 --> 01:26:23,166
- Yes.
- Will you join us again?

846
01:26:23,834 --> 01:26:25,734
Of course. Because...

847
01:26:25,834 --> 01:26:29,133
Because I'll be
in a different position then.

848
01:26:29,633 --> 01:26:30,967
I'll be promoted.

849
01:26:32,033 --> 01:26:34,567
Min-si, I'm the director
but I'm washing dishes.

850
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:35,633
Right.

851
01:26:36,533 --> 01:26:38,066
Hold on. Let me take this.

852
01:26:38,133 --> 01:26:39,066
All right.

853
01:26:39,967 --> 01:26:41,400
Yu-mi, have some apples.

854
01:26:41,467 --> 01:26:42,367
They are so good.

855
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:48,333
Gosh, this is amazing.

856
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:51,433
I got some noodles on my shoe.

857
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:53,867
I brought back some noodles
a few days ago.

858
01:26:58,133 --> 01:26:59,967
People are still eating, right?

859
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:00,934
- Yes.
- Yes.

860
01:27:01,333 --> 01:27:04,066
- We still have dishes.
- The dishes will come in five minutes?

861
01:27:04,133 --> 01:27:05,500
- Right.
- More dishes...

862
01:27:08,967 --> 01:27:10,934
Kimchi fried rice is ready.

863
01:27:11,033 --> 01:27:13,266
Do you want to have some here?

864
01:27:13,367 --> 01:27:14,367
Can we eat?

865
01:27:15,133 --> 01:27:17,000
I want to eat.

866
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,166
I have to eat and get back to work.

867
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:23,133
Our lunch is done.

868
01:27:23,233 --> 01:27:24,633
- But I can't eat now.
- Really?

869
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:26,700
- You guys go first. Sure.
- Should we?

870
01:27:26,767 --> 01:27:28,166
He wants us to eat first.

871
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,333
Let's eat quickly and rest.

872
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,266
Okay.

873
01:27:33,367 --> 01:27:35,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

874
01:27:38,567 --> 01:27:40,333
The fried egg is nicely done.

875
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,800
I know.

876
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,433
It's so pretty.

877
01:27:44,967 --> 01:27:47,867
- Gosh, gimbap looks so good.
- I want to have this.

878
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:50,266
- Thank you for this.
- Thank you, enjoy.

879
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:51,867
Thank you for this.

880
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:54,433
What's with the gimbap?

881
01:28:01,333 --> 01:28:02,467
What's with the gimbap?

882
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:11,500
- Did they wrap it with seasoned laver?
- I don't know.

883
01:28:11,567 --> 01:28:13,100
It must be seasoned laver.

884
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:14,567
Nice.

885
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,667
The best part of gimbap is the tip.

886
01:28:19,934 --> 01:28:21,133
The gimbap is so good.

887
01:28:23,734 --> 01:28:24,867
Isn't it tasty?

888
01:28:34,266 --> 01:28:35,166
What is this?

889
01:28:35,233 --> 01:28:36,567
- Eat it now.
- It's chapagetti.

890
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:43,934
Woo-shik, go eat. I'll be here.

891
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:46,133
- Woo-shik, let's eat.
- Okay.

892
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:48,567
- Is this gimbap?
- Yes.

893
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:58,100
This is the toughest day ever.

894
01:29:00,233 --> 01:29:01,233
Right?

895
01:29:01,300 --> 01:29:03,133
I thought about this yesterday.

896
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:05,467
The quality of the show...

897
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:07,800
You know the concept of the show.

898
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:09,867
I think it changed a lot.

899
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:12,734
We'll have the highest profit today.

900
01:29:13,500 --> 01:29:15,700
It should be more than six million won.

901
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:16,633
What?

902
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:20,200
- It'll be more than six million.
- Right, if we repeat this...

903
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:23,633
Plus, we only had six people
for the room today.

904
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,200
It would be too crowded
if we had eight people.

905
01:29:26,266 --> 01:29:27,700
That's not impossible, though.

906
01:29:27,767 --> 01:29:28,700
Stop at six people.

907
01:29:28,767 --> 01:29:31,166
Strangers are sharing the table.

908
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:36,100
They become friends here.
This is where they make friends.

909
01:30:46,266 --> 01:30:47,600
Sit and get some rest.

910
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,600
Oh, no. I'm in no place to sit.

911
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,500
We have a long way to go.

912
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,467
You just eat. Don't mind me.

913
01:30:56,633 --> 01:31:00,233
Do you want to be substituted
if you're tired?

914
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,667
If you substitute me, I'll accept it.

915
01:31:08,066 --> 01:31:09,300
So Yung-suk is out?

916
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,333
- Shall we go up?
- Let's go.

917
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:19,734
You can go down and come in
through the back door.

918
01:31:20,567 --> 01:31:22,900
We are changing the part-timer.

919
01:31:22,967 --> 01:31:23,834
Why?

920
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,767
- You can go in.
- Okay.

921
01:31:45,633 --> 01:31:47,600
I'm the new part-timer, Rhee Myung Han.

922
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:08,567
Are you serious about this?

923
01:32:08,633 --> 01:32:10,233
No, no.

924
01:32:11,066 --> 01:32:12,133
No, you can't.

925
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:19,900
You have to learn then.

926
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,533
They said I'd just wash dishes.

927
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,467
You have to use the dishwasher.

928
01:32:23,533 --> 01:32:25,066
I don't need a dishwasher.

929
01:32:25,133 --> 01:32:27,767
Are you going to handwash them?
All of them?

930
01:32:28,667 --> 01:32:30,500
- How will you do it?
- It's not easy.

931
01:32:30,567 --> 01:32:32,667
- Do something.
- I don't need a dishwasher.

932
01:32:32,734 --> 01:32:34,734
We need to reduce the electricity bill.

933
01:32:34,900 --> 01:32:37,000
It's not easy to use the water.

934
01:32:40,333 --> 01:32:43,233
- To make the water run through the hose...
- Right.

935
01:32:43,734 --> 01:32:44,633
Okay.

936
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,834
I got it.

937
01:32:50,533 --> 01:32:51,934
- Sir.
- Yes.

938
01:32:52,467 --> 01:32:53,600
- I mean...
- Yes?

939
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,433
- Dishes will come in soon.
- Right.

940
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,166
- Don't wash them now.
- Endless...

941
01:32:57,233 --> 01:32:58,600
They come in like a train.

942
01:32:58,667 --> 01:33:00,600
- It's going to be like...
- I mean...

943
01:33:00,667 --> 01:33:02,333
- You'll have to start now.
- I mean...

944
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,667
I'll wash them like I play a game.

945
01:33:04,734 --> 01:33:06,800
It's too many to do it like a game.

946
01:33:07,066 --> 01:33:09,333
It's like you're doing the last stage.

947
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:13,834
I think I should leave now.

948
01:33:16,066 --> 01:33:17,567
We'll get out now.

949
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:20,166
But he doesn't look like a rookie.

950
01:33:34,433 --> 01:33:35,467
Thank you.

951
01:33:39,033 --> 01:33:41,100
So I soak them in water here.

952
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,033
- It won't come off well.
- Right.

953
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,533
- I got it.
- The scorched rice on the bowl.

954
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:02,567
Oh, well...

955
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,400
Just say it.

956
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,800
Just treat me like one of you.

957
01:34:08,867 --> 01:34:10,266
- So I feel comfortable.
- Right.

958
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:42,567
I mean...

959
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:45,967
Please do something about him.

960
01:34:48,333 --> 01:34:50,900
He won't last an hour at this rate.

961
01:34:51,266 --> 01:34:53,900
You won't even last an hour like this.

962
01:34:54,934 --> 01:34:57,266
- Not the wooden chopsticks here, no.
- No?

963
01:34:57,367 --> 01:34:59,266
Ask the intern before you do it.

964
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,300
- Go, Woo-shik.
- Let's go!

965
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,233
Thank you for coming.

966
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:34,333
This is hilarious.

967
01:35:38,867 --> 01:35:42,166
I still get surprised
whenever I see his face.

968
01:35:46,333 --> 01:35:47,166
He keeps...

969
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:50,367
I see some dark shadow
walking around the kitchen.

970
01:35:50,467 --> 01:35:52,967
This black shadow...

971
01:35:55,533 --> 01:35:57,200
You're standing so politely.

972
01:35:57,300 --> 01:35:58,767
He's very shy.

973
01:35:59,367 --> 01:36:01,633
This is his first day of work.

974
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:07,433
His presence is big, isn't it?

975
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,800
His presence is huge.

976
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:13,433
I didn't know it would be this big.

977
01:36:14,934 --> 01:36:16,433
I should stay there.

978
01:36:33,400 --> 01:36:35,333
Why are you sitting there?

979
01:36:36,033 --> 01:36:37,000
You can sit

980
01:36:37,433 --> 01:36:39,734
comfortably outside.

981
01:36:39,834 --> 01:36:41,333
I can't get used to this.

982
01:36:41,767 --> 01:36:44,500
He says he can't get used to it.

983
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:52,567
Leave it. I'll do it.

984
01:36:52,633 --> 01:36:54,700
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll use it.

985
01:36:55,266 --> 01:36:57,433
You can rest for now.

986
01:36:57,533 --> 01:36:59,166
A lot will come in soon.

987
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:10,467
It's fine now. You can come back later.

988
01:37:10,567 --> 01:37:12,600
Tell him to come back later.

989
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:13,934
He can come at 6:30.

990
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,133
Yes, but he's...

991
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,433
He's just waiting in the corner.

992
01:37:24,467 --> 01:37:27,233
He doesn't know the timing yet.

993
01:37:29,934 --> 01:37:31,433
Customers are coming in.

994
01:37:31,500 --> 01:37:32,500
Okay.

995
01:38:27,834 --> 01:38:29,734
- Do you need any drinks?
- Right.

996
01:39:22,166 --> 01:39:23,934
- I think this...
- Oh, bulgogi!

997
01:40:04,133 --> 01:40:04,967
Scalpel.

998
01:40:13,233 --> 01:40:14,100
It's coming.

999
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:18,133
No?

1000
01:40:19,333 --> 01:40:20,333
You got me.

1001
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,567
I'm hearing things now.

1002
01:40:22,767 --> 01:40:24,900
I just turned around because of you.

1003
01:40:24,967 --> 01:40:27,800
I thought it was the ticket
when I heard a noise.

1004
01:40:35,133 --> 01:40:36,934
- New orders.
- Here they are.

1005
01:40:37,667 --> 01:40:38,567
Let's see.

1006
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:42,166
That's two bibimbap, one kkori-gomtang,
and one bulgogi.

1007
01:40:42,266 --> 01:40:44,533
- New orders.
- Okay.

1008
01:40:44,633 --> 01:40:46,266
So many all of a sudden?

1009
01:40:53,834 --> 01:40:54,767
Focus!

1010
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,100
No, I can't hear the sizzle.

1011
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,133
Hold on.

1012
01:41:51,633 --> 01:41:53,834
All right. Gomtang is ready.

1013
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:54,767
Okay.

1014
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,300
It's boiling.

1015
01:42:00,967 --> 01:42:02,734
Red chili, green chili.

1016
01:42:09,533 --> 01:42:11,066
These are all for Table Three.

1017
01:42:12,633 --> 01:42:14,934
Sundubu is selling well for dinner.

1018
01:42:15,467 --> 01:42:16,700
Is it because it's cold?

1019
01:42:16,767 --> 01:42:18,066
Is it cold outside?

1020
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:19,800
It's always hot in here.

1021
01:42:21,066 --> 01:42:23,266
Are you making bulgogi after this?

1022
01:42:23,333 --> 01:42:24,834
I can work on it after this.

1023
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:26,600
As long as it's not dakgalbi.

1024
01:42:27,033 --> 01:42:30,200
Nobody has ordered dakgalbi

1025
01:42:34,934 --> 01:42:38,367
Dakgalbi, gomtang, sundubu, yukjeon.

1026
01:42:38,467 --> 01:42:39,900
So the guy is here.

1027
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,834
Someone ordered bibim-guksu.

1028
01:43:09,033 --> 01:43:10,400
Two bulgogi, right?

1029
01:43:10,467 --> 01:43:11,834
- Yes.
- Two bowls.

1030
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:41,667
- Min-si, could you get the noodles out?
- Okay.

1031
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:46,200
- Be careful.
- Watch out, it's hot.

1032
01:43:46,667 --> 01:43:48,033
We are in the kitchen.

1033
01:43:48,333 --> 01:43:49,800
We deal with fire.

1034
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,100
Are the noodles done?

1035
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,333
They're all done.

1036
01:44:17,433 --> 01:44:18,700
Are the noodles done?

1037
01:44:18,767 --> 01:44:20,100
They are done.

1038
01:44:20,200 --> 01:44:21,367
Min-si is a fool.

1039
01:44:21,467 --> 01:44:23,400
What? Here!

1040
01:44:23,767 --> 01:44:24,834
"What?"

1041
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:27,333
"What?"

1042
01:44:30,834 --> 01:44:33,000
Everyone is going crazy.

1043
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,700
I'm back to myself. My normal self.

1044
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:37,533
Your line is weird.

1045
01:44:40,100 --> 01:44:42,567
- Back to myself.
- "I'm back to myself."

1046
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,533
Dakgalbi is ready to go?

1047
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
I'm about to be done with the bulgogi.

1048
01:45:00,667 --> 01:45:02,934
- Bulgogi is done.
- Right.

1049
01:45:03,033 --> 01:45:05,333
Bulgogi coming through.

1050
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,100
It's here.

1051
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:16,934
- It's here.
- Done.

1052
01:45:17,633 --> 01:45:18,767
This will be served?

1053
01:45:18,834 --> 01:45:21,333
Two dakgalbi ready.

1054
01:45:22,367 --> 01:45:24,166
Kimchi, kimchi.

1055
01:45:25,166 --> 01:45:26,433
Look, that's ours.

1056
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,133
This meat is good.

1057
01:46:08,934 --> 01:46:10,900
This is really good.

1058
01:46:12,367 --> 01:46:13,967
It's an amazing dish.

1059
01:46:14,033 --> 01:46:15,066
It's excellent.

1060
01:46:16,734 --> 01:46:18,600
Is this good?

1061
01:46:23,767 --> 01:46:24,667
It's good.

1062
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:29,567
This kimchi is very tasty.

1063
01:46:31,367 --> 01:46:33,333
Among my favorite TV drama shows,

1064
01:46:33,400 --> 01:46:34,834
there's a show called...

1065
01:46:38,233 --> 01:46:39,367
Yes?

1066
01:46:39,867 --> 01:46:42,500
The main characters have
a contract marriage.

1067
01:46:43,667 --> 01:46:45,233
Then they live together.

1068
01:46:45,333 --> 01:46:48,000
In the contract,
when one joins the other's family event,

1069
01:46:48,066 --> 01:46:49,400
the partner must do the same.

1070
01:46:49,467 --> 01:46:52,800
So the man goes to the girl's hometown.

1071
01:46:52,867 --> 01:46:55,467
He makes kimchi with her family.

1072
01:46:55,533 --> 01:46:58,533
All the people in the town
gather together.

1073
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:03,400
When they make kimchi in Korea,

1074
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:06,500
each family has their own tradition.

1075
01:47:06,567 --> 01:47:07,934
At least in the series.

1076
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:08,834
I see.

1077
01:47:12,033 --> 01:47:12,867
Cheers!

1078
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:16,767
I'd like to toast...

1079
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:20,266
to Korean TV shows and food.

1080
01:47:20,367 --> 01:47:21,700
Yes, that's good.

1081
01:47:21,800 --> 01:47:23,033
Let's toast to that.

1082
01:47:23,900 --> 01:47:24,934
Skal!

1083
01:47:27,834 --> 01:47:30,433
- Did we all get kimchi?
- I think so.

1084
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,500
- The kimchi is so good.
- This is very hot.

1085
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:39,500
I'll work on the beef first.

1086
01:47:46,567 --> 01:47:49,700
Help me out here. I'm in panic.
How do I eat the rest?

1087
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:52,633
Just put it in your mouth and slurp.

1088
01:48:01,266 --> 01:48:02,467
This is good.

1089
01:48:04,233 --> 01:48:06,066
Dolsot-bibimbap looks good too.

1090
01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:07,900
- I'll go like this.
- Okay.

1091
01:48:14,433 --> 01:48:17,600
It's hard to eat it with seaweed.

1092
01:48:17,700 --> 01:48:20,266
Shape it to the side
where you want to bite off.

1093
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:22,066
Then put the seaweed on top.

1094
01:48:22,133 --> 01:48:25,200
And it fits perfectly.

1095
01:48:33,266 --> 01:48:35,834
Look. My chopsticks passed
through seaweed.

1096
01:48:39,266 --> 01:48:40,367
It's really hard.

1097
01:48:40,467 --> 01:48:43,700
I'm just crushing the seaweed
and eating it all at once.

1098
01:48:44,266 --> 01:48:45,667
That's my new strategy.

1099
01:48:45,734 --> 01:48:47,400
I made it pretty like this.

1100
01:48:52,700 --> 01:48:54,667
I see clams here.

1101
01:48:57,333 --> 01:48:59,533
I like how there's so much tofu here.

1102
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:01,734
And there is so much other stuff in it.

1103
01:49:01,834 --> 01:49:03,200
Right, it's nice.

1104
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:10,900
What are you chewing on?

1105
01:49:10,967 --> 01:49:11,934
Your teeth?

1106
01:49:12,533 --> 01:49:13,633
Clam shell.

1107
01:49:14,233 --> 01:49:16,133
Then stop eating!

1108
01:49:16,233 --> 01:49:17,900
No, it's delicious.

1109
01:49:17,967 --> 01:49:20,166
You don't eat clam shells.

1110
01:49:20,767 --> 01:49:23,500
I'm full. But the problem is,
I'm still eating.

1111
01:49:24,734 --> 01:49:26,367
Then you can say this.

1112
01:49:27,266 --> 01:49:29,367
"Stop. I've had enough."

1113
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:33,000
"I've had enough."

1114
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:35,600
This is a famous line.

1115
01:49:36,166 --> 01:49:37,333
It's from a Korean movie.

1116
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,166
"Stop. I've had enough."

1117
01:49:40,033 --> 01:49:41,834
All right. Just eat your food.

1118
01:50:24,633 --> 01:50:25,734
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1119
01:50:28,667 --> 01:50:29,600
Can I pay?

1120
01:50:41,834 --> 01:50:42,667
Gosh!

1121
01:51:10,100 --> 01:51:13,367
It's my first time seeing the CEO.
And he washed the dishes.

1122
01:51:13,433 --> 01:51:16,133
It's my honor to see him wash the dishes.

1123
01:51:16,567 --> 01:51:19,467
- It must be the first time for all of us.
- Really?

1124
01:51:21,033 --> 01:51:22,266
So it's not just me.

1125
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:28,400
It's here.

1126
01:51:28,500 --> 01:51:29,867
Where's the part-timer?

1127
01:51:30,133 --> 01:51:31,734
- Part-timer.
- Help.

1128
01:51:37,133 --> 01:51:38,567
This is too strong.

1129
01:51:38,633 --> 01:51:39,700
He's here already.

1130
01:51:40,467 --> 01:51:42,300
Was he listening to me?

1131
01:51:55,333 --> 01:51:58,033
So it's true. He's bad at this.

1132
01:51:59,967 --> 01:52:01,734
He's bad at this.

1133
01:52:06,333 --> 01:52:09,400
You have to run the water.

1134
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:14,100
- And then...
- Excuse me. I'll do it my way.

1135
01:52:18,667 --> 01:52:20,934
You have to do it twice then.

1136
01:52:21,834 --> 01:52:24,400
He just sounded
like she treated him badly.

1137
01:52:24,467 --> 01:52:26,500
You can't get annoyed so soon.

1138
01:52:48,367 --> 01:52:50,367
This is the last order.

1139
01:52:51,333 --> 01:52:52,500
So here it comes.

1140
01:52:55,867 --> 01:52:57,066
Bye.

1141
01:52:57,667 --> 01:52:58,667
Bye.

1142
01:52:59,567 --> 01:53:00,700
It's over.

1143
01:53:02,266 --> 01:53:05,133
These dishes are all Iceland to me.

1144
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,467
It's a thrilling moment.

1145
01:53:11,200 --> 01:53:12,600
Thank you.

1146
01:53:21,166 --> 01:53:23,667
This is the ceremony to close out
Jinny's Kitchen.

1147
01:53:26,834 --> 01:53:28,166
Let's hear from Mr. Rhee.

1148
01:53:28,600 --> 01:53:30,133
Come back, Mr. Dishwashing.

1149
01:53:30,233 --> 01:53:32,633
Somebody has to keep the restaurant.

1150
01:53:33,066 --> 01:53:35,066
They drank a lot.

1151
01:53:35,166 --> 01:53:36,767
It's time for recreation.

1152
01:53:36,867 --> 01:53:38,900
- It's big.
- Gosh, what is it?

1153
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,033
Take that one out.

1154
01:53:42,433 --> 01:53:43,266
There you go!

1155
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,834
We prepared for only good stuff.

1156
01:53:47,600 --> 01:53:48,500
- What?
- What?

1157
01:53:48,567 --> 01:53:49,433
What is it?

1158
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:58,133
You can sit down here.

1159
01:54:02,834 --> 01:54:04,667
Everyone is being sweet.

1160
01:54:06,734 --> 01:54:08,033
Yes, last take.

1161
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,467
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

1162
01:54:10,166 --> 01:54:11,100
Let's get this.

1163
01:54:30,934 --> 01:54:33,000
- Let's go!
- Yes, cheer up.

1164
01:54:43,734 --> 01:54:44,734
Okay.

1165
01:54:44,834 --> 01:54:46,000
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

1166
