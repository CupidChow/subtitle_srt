00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,800
Let's go, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

3
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,900
Let's take our time.

4
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:29,367
How about we put two bowls on?

5
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,567
Let's get them ready.

6
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,166
Let's serve this to Table One,

7
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,767
and that to Table Four.

8
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,767
Just trust me.

9
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:38,200
Dolsot, all set. Gomtang, ready to go.

10
00:00:38,266 --> 00:00:40,467
- Put gomtang on the stove.
- Here.

11
00:00:40,533 --> 00:00:42,433
Good, you're doing great.

12
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:52,100
Now that bulgogi is on the menu,
that's all they order.

13
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,800
Today's concept is "Generous."

14
00:00:58,867 --> 00:00:59,867
- Okay?
- Generous.

15
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,734
This is complimentary. One more piece.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,333
I'm putting a generous amount
of rice in each bowl.

17
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:20,500
We can't stop serving it now.

18
00:01:22,467 --> 00:01:24,467
More meat for bulgogi.

19
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,834
Vegetables.

20
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:38,300
And...

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,233
Carrots.

22
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,400
- I'm so sorry, but...
- Yes?

23
00:01:49,467 --> 00:01:51,400
- You know where the carrots are?
- Carrots!

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,834
Have we used them all?

25
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:02,567
These are all we have.

26
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,266
Why do we only have three?
We got a lot of them.

27
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:07,367
It's okay.

28
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,433
Do we have 15 minutes left?

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,767
Just 15 minutes?

30
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,033
- I'll work on the green onions.
- Okay.

31
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,967
Good, it's done.

32
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,300
Great.

33
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll make some sauce for the bulgogi now.

34
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,500
It's done.

35
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
This is done too.

36
00:02:50,266 --> 00:02:53,667
I'll soak more glass noodles in the water.

37
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,500
- Min-si. I think we're...
- Doing okay.

38
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:04,767
- We are, right?
- Yes.

39
00:03:37,934 --> 00:03:38,767
Is it good?

40
00:03:38,834 --> 00:03:41,000
- It must be very good. Good!
- Of course!

41
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,400
It's cooked. Try it.

42
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:46,166
This tastes good.

43
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,800
It's very delicious.

44
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:49,433
Surprisingly, not much meat is left
for gomtang.

45
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:52,567
I feel like they'll order kkori-gomtang.

46
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,266
They always order it
when we're running out.

47
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,300
We have orders.

48
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,033
One kkori-gomtang.

49
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,900
One kkori-gomtang.

50
00:05:11,967 --> 00:05:13,600
One dolsot-bibimbap.

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,867
- One spicy beef galbijjim and one bulgogi.
- Yes.

52
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:21,000
One kkori-gomtang and one bibimbap...

53
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,567
Just as he expected.

54
00:05:28,967 --> 00:05:31,000
- Min-si. Can you see this?
- Yes?

55
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:33,133
- Yes.
- Your eyesight is amazing.

56
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,767
Gomtang, bibimbap, galbijjim.

57
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,133
Your ears and eyes are all good.

58
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:39,400
Your eyesight is really good.

59
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,800
Bibimbap is done.

60
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:07,734
Put it on the stove.

61
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,900
- Put it on the stove.
- Thank you.

62
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,367
Good, bibimbap's on the stove.

63
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,700
This is stronger, right?

64
00:06:49,633 --> 00:06:51,867
Spicy beef galbijjim is ready.

65
00:06:53,934 --> 00:06:56,200
- I'll give them the bibimbap.
- It's sizzling.

66
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:57,900
- Yes, it's sizzling.
- Right.

67
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:11,934
Hot, hot.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's hot.

69
00:07:16,066 --> 00:07:17,333
- Done.
- Table Three.

70
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,834
- Yes.
- Next...

71
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,734
Yes.

72
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,133
One more bulgogi.

73
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
Okay.

74
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,367
We have one spicy galbijjim.

75
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,133
- Should I put it in the wok?
- Yes.

76
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,433
Galbijjim...

77
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,066
It's done.

78
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:56,967
Four pieces of ribs.

79
00:08:01,133 --> 00:08:02,567
- Spicy.
- Okay.

80
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,767
Big chunks don't get cooked well.

81
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,700
Ttukbaegi...

82
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:31,000
- Bulgogi?
- No. Can you get that for me?

83
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,000
Are the fritters done?

84
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:45,533
- They're done.
- Okay.

85
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:01,000
- It can be served now, right?
- Sure, it's ready.

86
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,900
Table Three.

87
00:09:17,233 --> 00:09:18,166
Bibimbap?

88
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:34,433
It's like a well-cooked home meal.

89
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:38,300
There is this noodle you like.

90
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,867
Can you order for me?
Bulgogi and bibimbap.

91
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:58,767
Okay, I'll give it a try.

92
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,467
- Are they here?
- Yes, they're coming.

93
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,767
There they are. He's setting up the table.

94
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,266
One more bulgogi.

95
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,066
As soon as bulgogi comes in,
only bulgogi comes out.

96
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:31,133
Ttukbaegi bulgogi...

97
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:33,400
Let's just...

98
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:35,433
keep making it.

99
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,967
Help!

100
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,800
Help.

101
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,600
They ordered bulgogi and bibimbap.

102
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,467
New orders are here.

103
00:13:29,533 --> 00:13:30,500
More orders!

104
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,266
Two spicy galbijjim and one bulgogi!

105
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:34,200
I knew it.

106
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,533
Let's keep going.

107
00:13:44,767 --> 00:13:46,967
All right. Tear it apart.

108
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:49,000
Tear it.

109
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,266
Okay, close it.

110
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,367
- I'll put the bibimbap on the stove.
- Okay, thank you.

111
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:50,967
I'll fry the fritters then.

112
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:53,100
One, two, three, four. Four pieces.

113
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,600
Can you do it all by yourself, Min-si?

114
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,300
You're in charge of bulgogi.

115
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,266
Right...

116
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,500
- How is it?
- Not yet. It's still not cooked.

117
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:29,600
- Still pink?
- Yes.

118
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,300
I think it's ready.

119
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,633
It's done.

120
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,166
It's ready.

121
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,700
- The fritters?
- Done.

122
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
- They're in the strainer.
- Okay.

123
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,467
- Should I bring out bulgogi?
- Yes.

124
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:18,734
- Okay.
- All right.

125
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,266
The Ttukbaegi bulgogi looks so good.

126
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,367
- I want to taste it, but it's so hot.
- Can I try it?

127
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,100
It'll hurt if I burn my tongue.

128
00:17:04,033 --> 00:17:06,867
- It's okay. You can cool it.
- Oh, it's delicious.

129
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,100
Gosh, this is so good.

130
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:12,700
Hold on. This is very delicious.

131
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:17,033
Would it be bad if I dip rice in the soup?

132
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,667
No, I think it will be fine.

133
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,600
This is incredibly delicious.

134
00:17:28,467 --> 00:17:30,100
- Can I have a bite?
- Sure.

135
00:17:34,734 --> 00:17:36,133
It's still very hot.

136
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,066
That was very hot. Gosh, this is good.

137
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:45,633
- Can I try the noodles?
- Oh, I forgot about them.

138
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,633
Oh, hold on.

139
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,266
I like my food,
but I want to have the noodles.

140
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,767
Be careful.

141
00:17:56,266 --> 00:17:58,033
The noodles are very slippery.

142
00:18:09,834 --> 00:18:10,667
I got it.

143
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:12,533
So you wanted to eat mine.

144
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,633
It's so good, but it's hard to eat.

145
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
The glass noodles are very good.
The texture is interesting.

146
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,033
I don't know how to do this.

147
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,433
These are good together.
Bibimbap and seaweed.

148
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,433
- Do you want to try mine?
- Sure.

149
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,633
You have to eat it with seaweed.

150
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,367
This is so delicious.

151
00:18:59,333 --> 00:19:01,233
I'll feed you. Open your mouth.

152
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,367
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

153
00:19:07,967 --> 00:19:09,400
Can I have another bite?

154
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,834
You need patience for this.

155
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:14,934
I'm very patient.

156
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,867
You just said you were patient.

157
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,433
She spilled water on her phone.

158
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,533
Do you want more water?

159
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:09,367
I'll be careful.

160
00:20:11,266 --> 00:20:12,667
You will spill again.

161
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:16,667
I was being very careful.

162
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,967
Do you want to try this?

163
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Can I?

164
00:20:23,567 --> 00:20:24,567
Of course.

165
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,667
This is just...

166
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:37,967
Gosh, it's hot.

167
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:39,867
It's delicious.

168
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,967
It's really good.

169
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,066
This is fantastic.

170
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:00,800
- Is it good?
- Yes.

171
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,266
Do you want to try?

172
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,266
Can you put it here?

173
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,567
- That's too much.
- Is it too much?

174
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:13,834
This is crazy delicious.

175
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:17,300
I'm so happy that I can have it here.

176
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,433
- What's wrong?
- Why is it so tiring today?

177
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,834
Well, you did the dishes.

178
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,333
It's because you helped with the dishes.

179
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:38,667
There are only three?

180
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,867
- What? I think...
- I need one more.

181
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:44,800
- I washed them all and put them here.
- Oh, great.

182
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:46,533
I knew I saw them somewhere.

183
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,834
- I kept washing dishes.
- Great job.

184
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:58,133
What are you having?

185
00:22:58,633 --> 00:22:59,900
Spicy beef galbijjim.

186
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:01,700
The dish on the lower frame.

187
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,066
What are you having?

188
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Bibimbap.

189
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,567
- Can I try yours?
- Sure.

190
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,600
Can I try yours?

191
00:23:09,066 --> 00:23:10,600
- Let's change seats.
- Sure.

192
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:17,333
Hello, I'm here.

193
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:22,300
My daughter spilt some water.

194
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:24,000
Yes, I saw that.

195
00:23:25,967 --> 00:23:27,700
- Oh, there's seaweed.
- Right.

196
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,233
There's meat in here?

197
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:33,066
Well... No.

198
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,166
- This is so good.
- Right.

199
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:38,467
- It's very good but spicy.
- It's a bit spicy.

200
00:23:38,533 --> 00:23:41,233
I can't stand spicy food.

201
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,066
- It's all right. We have our weaknesses.
- Right.

202
00:23:46,066 --> 00:23:48,166
I spilled a lot of water just now.

203
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,967
It was horrible.
I spilt it on my mom's phone.

204
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,533
Swapping seats. That's very smart.

205
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,567
Right?

206
00:24:24,734 --> 00:24:27,333
- So the second round isn't over, right?
- No.

207
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,367
- Ask them, Min-si.
- About how many tables left?

208
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:33,200
Aren't they all for Round 2?

209
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:34,734
Mr. Lee.

210
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,900
- More orders?
- Sorry?

211
00:24:38,967 --> 00:24:40,867
- Just now...
- Right, more orders.

212
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:42,400
Then I should go back.

213
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:44,166
You two shouldn't come out.

214
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,967
Take this.

215
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,500
What did they order?

216
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,000
Two ttukbaegi bulgogi.

217
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:54,834
- Spicy...
- Two spicy galbijjim.

218
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:59,600
- Then let's do the spicy beef galbijjim.
- Get eight pieces of ribs, please.

219
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,567
- Okay, eight pieces.
- Yes.

220
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:14,867
All right.

221
00:25:38,333 --> 00:25:39,700
Green onions are there.

222
00:25:39,767 --> 00:25:41,367
Green onions are here.

223
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:48,333
You can serve this right now.

224
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,066
- Yes, it's ready now.
- Right.

225
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:51,433
Half and half.

226
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,767
- Half and half.
- Okay.

227
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,900
Bulgogi is ready!

228
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,633
Okay! Then scoop the rice.

229
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,266
- Okay.
- Goodness.

230
00:26:14,333 --> 00:26:15,700
Rice is done.

231
00:26:15,767 --> 00:26:16,967
- Okay.
- Done.

232
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,567
You're doing great.

233
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:30,266
It looks delicious.

234
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,633
This is fermented cabbage.

235
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,934
It smells so good.

236
00:26:43,767 --> 00:26:45,500
Bulgogi.

237
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:51,233
The bowl is really hot.

238
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,000
It smells super.

239
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,767
- Kimchi?
- Yes.

240
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:09,800
I'll try some kimchi.

241
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,400
They make kimchi only once a year.

242
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,567
- Really?
- Yes, just once a year.

243
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:19,200
They pick one week
and make and ferment it for a year.

244
00:27:19,266 --> 00:27:20,100
My goodness.

245
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,133
This is good.

246
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,900
How is this?

247
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:52,367
They made it from rice.

248
00:27:53,633 --> 00:27:55,633
- I even add it to ramyeon.
- It's so good.

249
00:27:56,033 --> 00:28:00,433
You can eat them after soaking them
in warm water without boiling.

250
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:05,533
This is so good.

251
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,133
Goodness, it's really hot.

252
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,834
It's so good.
Carrots and onions make it sweet.

253
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:17,867
- Try it. Put it in your mouth.
- The meat is so good.

254
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:20,033
The sweetness is so good.

255
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,333
- This is so good.
- It's sweet, right?

256
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,533
Is it okay?

257
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,066
Look. I'll add a bit of rice here.

258
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,900
And put some sauce.

259
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,100
- Look, a bit of rice.
- Okay.

260
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:53,834
I added some rice here.

261
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,800
This is so good.

262
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,033
- I loved it.
- Right.

263
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:29,467
Thank you.

264
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:33,500
- Gosh, that was so embarrassing.
- No, it's fine.

265
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,066
For Table One.

266
00:30:45,633 --> 00:30:49,400
The first menu looks so good.
And the dessert.

267
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
- Should we share?
- Yes.

268
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,633
Thank you.

269
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,033
- Please.
- Oh...

270
00:31:19,133 --> 00:31:21,500
Please.

271
00:31:28,166 --> 00:31:29,900
- That was really good.
- Right?

272
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
He said my pronunciation was good.

273
00:31:32,467 --> 00:31:34,400
Right! Good for you.

274
00:31:34,467 --> 00:31:36,133
I was quite happy.

275
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:56,333
Seo-jun!

276
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,333
Yes?

277
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,066
Have you taken an order from the group?

278
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,066
Seo-jin just did.

279
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:06,767
- Here it is.
- It's here.

280
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Two bulgogi.

281
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:09,533
- Two bulgogi.
- Two bulgogi.

282
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,834
One dolsot and another bulgogi.

283
00:32:11,934 --> 00:32:13,467
Two bulgogi, one dolsot.

284
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,066
Two bulgogi, one dolsot.

285
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,100
Okay, this is ready.

286
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:30,400
Okay.

287
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,300
Thank you.

288
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:35,233
It's done.
We made all dishes for the group.

289
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,333
So five people ordered three dishes?

290
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,066
That's two dishes for three,
and one for two.

291
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:47,867
Those two girls are very young.
They speak good Korean.

292
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:50,967
They're studying Korean.
They're really good.

293
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,266
- Let's eat now.
- It looks perfect.

294
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:22,734
It looks so good.
Look how they decorated it.

295
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:24,133
Thank you for the meal.

296
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,934
I forgot to say that earlier.

297
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,767
Thank you for the meal.

298
00:34:31,567 --> 00:34:32,734
This is quite good.

299
00:34:32,834 --> 00:34:35,533
It has many flavors.

300
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,467
A very nice meal for us.

301
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,400
This is just too good.

302
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,533
Should we toast with our spoons?

303
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,200
- Skal.
- Skal.

304
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,333
Skal.

305
00:35:03,266 --> 00:35:04,166
Are you done?

306
00:35:05,667 --> 00:35:07,533
- Do you want dessert?
- Everything is so good.

307
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,333
- Do you want dessert?
- Yes, thank you.

308
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,900
- Later?
- Yes, in a second.

309
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:11,900
Take your time.

310
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
- Thank you.
- Okay.

311
00:35:15,633 --> 00:35:17,200
What did he say?

312
00:35:17,266 --> 00:35:19,200
Did you understand what he said?

313
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,800
I did. He asked if we wanted dessert.

314
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,567
I said I would want it.

315
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:27,567
And he asked, "Later?" So I said yes.

316
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:30,500
And he told you to take your time...

317
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,166
Take your time.

318
00:35:32,867 --> 00:35:34,266
They're so adorable.

319
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:37,867
- What did they say?
- "Everything is so good."

320
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,133
What? What happened?

321
00:35:41,233 --> 00:35:43,767
They're studying Korean, apparently.

322
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:47,066
He says they're so adorable.
They're good at Korean.

323
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,500
Woo-shik.

324
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,834
Go talk to the girls for a second.

325
00:35:58,734 --> 00:36:01,000
- Is it good?
- Everything is very good.

326
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,533
Where did you learn Korean?

327
00:36:03,633 --> 00:36:05,066
- Here, in Iceland.
- Here?

328
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:05,967
Yes.

329
00:36:06,033 --> 00:36:07,333
- In college?
- With videos.

330
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,333
- Videos?
- Online?

331
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,667
- Online?
- Yes.

332
00:36:09,734 --> 00:36:11,166
- Nice.
- You're very good.

333
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:12,333
- Wow.
- Then...

334
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:16,200
- TV series and movies.
- Right. Movies.

335
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,200
- So the subtitles...
- And lyrics.

336
00:36:18,266 --> 00:36:20,300
- Can you watch it without subtitles?
- Lyrics.

337
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,266
Yes!

338
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,633
- Without subtitles?
- Without subtitles.

339
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,600
- How is she so good?
- She's really good.

340
00:36:30,767 --> 00:36:31,734
Thank you.

341
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,433
Gosh, this is crazy.

342
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:54,200
I thought you were going to stutter
because I saw you getting nervous.

343
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,500
- Now you know how cool your sister is.
- I agree.

344
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:00,934
I'm full.

345
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,667
- Not yet for me.
- Not yet?

346
00:37:03,767 --> 00:37:07,333
Why don't you eat some more?
I'm done with this.

347
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:10,000
- I'll add rice here.
- No.

348
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,400
You just said you were full.

349
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,667
I meant, after having this.

350
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,433
Okay. Are you done now?

351
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:20,800
- Yes, just one more bite.
- Okay.

352
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:25,967
Thank you. Oh, right.
I'll take some sauce.

353
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:27,367
Okay.

354
00:37:27,433 --> 00:37:28,633
I'll eat it now.

355
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,834
Are you done?

356
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,967
Are you a college student?

357
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:55,100
- Yes, I'm a college student.
- Which year?

358
00:37:55,166 --> 00:37:57,834
- I'm a junior.
- My goodness.

359
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,367
We can have dessert now.

360
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,533
I need this.

361
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,967
Really? Hold on. Sorry.

362
00:38:28,033 --> 00:38:29,867
- I have to clear the table.
- Which table?

363
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:30,767
- The group.
- What?

364
00:38:30,867 --> 00:38:32,233
- The room.
- The room? Okay.

365
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,400
- Is this your desk or what?
- My back suddenly hurt.

366
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:05,367
How do you like Iceland?

367
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:07,834
I haven't been able
to look around the place yet.

368
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,133
Oh, no. You haven't?

369
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:12,633
- I've been working here the whole time.
- Right.

370
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:14,633
Is it very cold for you?

371
00:39:15,166 --> 00:39:16,333
Yes, it's so cold.

372
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,734
Two for them, and one for them.

373
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,834
Here's your ice cream.

374
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,967
One more for them.

375
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,433
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

376
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:44,533
There's a lot to clear away.

377
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,967
Min-si, you are down.

378
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:14,367
I'm exhausted.

379
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,200
Oh, no...

380
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,567
- Min-si.
- Just two rounds of dinner left.

381
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:21,767
Min-si, you know what?

382
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,500
It's today.

383
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,433
What is?

384
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,367
It would be perfect if you cry.

385
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:32,133
Should we get going?

386
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,266
- They're coming.
- Give them gifts.

387
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:38,667
Was the food okay?

388
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:41,000
- Yes, everything was so good.
- Was everything good?

389
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,033
Thank you.

390
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:44,066
No, we thank you.

391
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:50,900
- This is a fridge magnet.
- Okay.

392
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,200
It's so pretty.

393
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:56,834
Take whatever you want.

394
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,300
We can take as many as we want.

395
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,166
How do you say "Goodbye" in Icelandic?

396
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:04,567
It's just, "Bye."

397
00:41:04,633 --> 00:41:05,934
Just "Bye?"

398
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,033
- Like English.
- Right.

399
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:11,767
Sjaumst.

400
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:13,266
Sjaumst.

401
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,433
Sjaumst, right.

402
00:41:14,533 --> 00:41:15,934
- Do you want the receipt?
- Yes.

403
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:19,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

404
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,433
Hello.

405
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,300
She speaks good Korean.

406
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,133
Is Ko Min-si here?

407
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,333
You know Ko Min-si too?

408
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,233
- Yes, I know...
- How do you know her?

409
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:29,667
How do you know Min-si?

410
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,367
- What?
- How do you know Min-si?

411
00:41:31,433 --> 00:41:32,266
Sweet Home.

412
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:33,734
Oh, Sweet Home.

413
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:35,633
Here she is.

414
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,734
- Hello.
- She watched Sweet Home.

415
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:42,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

416
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,533
- Have a good day.
- Bye.

417
00:41:58,333 --> 00:41:59,467
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

418
00:42:30,567 --> 00:42:31,934
Are we eating or what?

419
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,333
I think we should eat.

420
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,767
I want to eat tteokbokki.

421
00:42:36,834 --> 00:42:38,567
Anyone wants tteokbokki?

422
00:42:38,667 --> 00:42:40,967
- Me.
- Me.

423
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:41,967
All right, then...

424
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:47,967
It takes a long time to make tteokbokki.

425
00:42:48,066 --> 00:42:51,166
But this can shorten the cooking time.

426
00:42:53,066 --> 00:42:56,433
I'll pour this and add powder.

427
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:01,033
Fill the cup to the line with water.

428
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,100
This much.

429
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:04,367
All right.

430
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,834
I can smell it now.

431
00:43:10,934 --> 00:43:11,934
Is it done?

432
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:18,133
Oh, it's changed. When did it get changed?

433
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:22,900
- Gosh, it must be delicious.
- Goodness.

434
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,667
- I want the sweet one.
- I want the hot one.

435
00:43:26,934 --> 00:43:28,467
This looks very delicious.

436
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:32,033
- This is amazing.
- It's delicious.

437
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,967
You just add the sauce and water
and microwave it?

438
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,100
It's so good.

439
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:41,300
It's sweet and spicy, as well as simple.

440
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,100
Goodness.

441
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,600
This spiciness brings up my appetite.

442
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,233
Mine is very sweet.

443
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,767
- It's hot.
- Really spicy, right?

444
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:52,700
This one's spicy.

445
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:54,133
- So spicy.
- Mine's so sweet.

446
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,400
No wonder they are
the biggest food company.

447
00:44:01,033 --> 00:44:02,500
What should we prepare?

448
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,767
- Everything.
- Everything.

449
00:44:03,834 --> 00:44:05,133
- Every menu?
- Everything.

450
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:07,333
We have to prep carrots and zucchinis.

451
00:44:07,433 --> 00:44:08,800
And vegetable fritters.

452
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:11,233
Then, do we have all the ingredients
for bibimbap?

453
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,100
I just have to prep carrots and zucchinis.

454
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,066
Tomorrow will be a big problem.

455
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,767
- What time do we come to work tomorrow?
- Maybe 7:00 a.m.

456
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,900
We have to be here at dawn tomorrow.

457
00:44:28,967 --> 00:44:30,600
We have to get up at 5:00 a.m.

458
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,934
After we're done today,
let's do the meal prep for an hour.

459
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,967
I can. I need more than one hour.

460
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,867
I'll go home after I do as much as I can.

461
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:49,500
I can't open my eyes.

462
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,567
I can't see anything.

463
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,066
Let's check together.

464
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,300
We need to prepare
more zucchinis and carrots.

465
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,066
We have enough beef galbijjim.

466
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,567
We need veggie fritters.

467
00:45:12,233 --> 00:45:16,100
Woo-shik, for bulgogi...
What vegetables do you need?

468
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,867
Carrots and onions.

469
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:20,500
I have to make vegetable fritters too.

470
00:45:20,567 --> 00:45:23,033
Let's slice all the vegetables then.

471
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:25,900
I'll work on the onions.
Can you help with this?

472
00:45:49,934 --> 00:45:54,033
Our boss is the best

473
00:45:54,767 --> 00:45:56,734
No, he's not

474
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:58,967
No, he's not

475
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:06,166
Let's make rice

476
00:46:27,967 --> 00:46:29,967
This should be enough for tonight.

477
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:31,133
Yes, it's enough.

478
00:46:31,233 --> 00:46:32,266
Bibimbap's done.

479
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,900
- Min-si, how do you feel?
- Great.

480
00:46:51,967 --> 00:46:53,333
- Great?
- How are you?

481
00:46:53,433 --> 00:46:55,300
I'm good.

482
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,333
No, Woo-shik.

483
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:58,667
I have herbal medicine.

484
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:00,834
No. In my experience,

485
00:47:00,934 --> 00:47:04,000
the kitchen is fine
as long as you are fine.

486
00:47:04,066 --> 00:47:06,800
Everything is okay if you are fine.

487
00:47:07,567 --> 00:47:09,133
Do we have potatoes?

488
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,200
Potatoes?

489
00:47:10,266 --> 00:47:11,200
Potatoes...

490
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,533
We don't have them.

491
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,633
We don't have potatoes, do we?

492
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:16,567
- No potatoes?
- We have potatoes.

493
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:17,500
- Where?
- Where?

494
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:19,367
That scared me.

495
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,800
Potatoes.

496
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:24,300
Mushroom.

497
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:25,567
What about mushrooms?

498
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,200
Mushrooms? Mushrooms...

499
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,834
This isn't enough.
It's only enough for two.

500
00:47:32,967 --> 00:47:34,600
We are out of mushrooms.

501
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,233
- Yu-mi.
- Yes.

502
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,433
- How should I chop the mushrooms?
- Which one? For what?

503
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,367
For galbijjim.

504
00:47:42,467 --> 00:47:44,467
- Just chop the ends.
- And cut them in half?

505
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:45,367
- Yes.
- Okay.

506
00:47:45,467 --> 00:47:46,967
I'll help you if you need me.

507
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:49,433
- This is for beef galbijjim, right?
- Yes.

508
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:00,367
- This is done.
- Okay.

509
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:03,133
- If this is all you need.
- Yes, that's enough.

510
00:48:49,567 --> 00:48:50,467
Seo-jun.

511
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,834
Seo-jun.

512
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,967
There are so many people waiting
that we can't accept them all.

513
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:59,166
I think there are about 60 people.

514
00:48:59,266 --> 00:49:03,166
So it's better to cut the waiting line
and send them away now.

515
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,133
Let's go.

516
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,900
- We just made one round, yes?
- Yes.

517
00:49:39,934 --> 00:49:41,066
We're done now, right?

518
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:42,667
That'd make it six people.

519
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,834
That was a long queue.

520
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,166
My hair is a mess.

521
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:14,300
Thank you.

522
00:50:15,867 --> 00:50:17,333
- Min-si.
- Yes.

523
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,133
- Have some coffee.
- Thank you.

524
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:20,333
What do you want to have?

525
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,734
- Iced Americano.
- Okay.

526
00:50:21,834 --> 00:50:24,100
- How about you, Yu-mi?
- Iced Americano.

527
00:50:24,734 --> 00:50:26,166
And I'll have this.

528
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,033
That's Seo-jin's.

529
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,967
- I don't want it.
- I was just kidding.

530
00:50:31,066 --> 00:50:32,333
- I don't want it.
- Come on.

531
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:34,867
- I was kidding.
- I don't want to have coffee.

532
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,100
- Come on.
- Come on.

533
00:50:36,166 --> 00:50:37,900
I was just kidding.

534
00:50:39,033 --> 00:50:40,467
Seo-jun, do you want it?

535
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:41,433
Iced Americano.

536
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:43,400
- I'll have a bit of this.
- Okay.

537
00:50:43,967 --> 00:50:45,433
Are you all ready?

538
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,000
All right. Go, Chef Choi!

539
00:50:48,066 --> 00:50:50,867
Sure. Thanks to you all,

540
00:50:50,934 --> 00:50:53,000
I think we can do well for dinner.

541
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:54,467
- All right.
- Good luck.

542
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:56,734
- Thank you so much. Okay.
- No problem.

543
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:01,834
In how many minutes?

544
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,066
Four minutes.

545
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:06,934
- What do we have to do now, Min-si?
- Work on dolsot-bibimbap.

546
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,100
That's right.

547
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,633
Woo-shik, are you ready?

548
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:10,533
- Yes.
- Yes.

549
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,700
- I'll let them in.
- Yes.

550
00:51:11,767 --> 00:51:13,200
- All right?
- Yes, Seo-jin.

551
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:14,100
Yes?

552
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:20,066
Let's cheer up before we start.

553
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:44,433
What was I going to do?

554
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:11,934
He's a tough guy.

555
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,333
Hello.

556
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,333
Oh, thank you.

557
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:46,867
There are so many dishes here.

558
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:49,567
But I can't decide.

559
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,767
Just pick a random dish.

560
00:52:51,834 --> 00:52:52,934
No.

561
00:52:58,033 --> 00:52:59,467
I'll get beef galbijjim.

562
00:52:59,533 --> 00:53:01,734
I'll have the one on the first page.

563
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,200
- Are you ready?
- I think so.

564
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,934
Min-si, let's make it all very generous.

565
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,500
- Generous.
- Okay.

566
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,467
- For those waiting outside.
- Sure.

567
00:53:53,767 --> 00:53:55,433
Also, always put on a smile.

568
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,667
Okay.

569
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:01,867
- Orders from Table One.
- Table One, okay.

570
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:05,467
One spicy beef galbijjim and one bulgogi.

571
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,967
One bulgogi.

572
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:08,166
One bulgogi.

573
00:54:08,233 --> 00:54:09,433
One more bulgogi.

574
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:11,200
That's two bulgogi in total.

575
00:54:12,934 --> 00:54:15,867
Okay, beef galbijjim.

576
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,600
For one portion.

577
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,033
- You know how to tear it, yes?
- Yes.

578
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,967
Great.

579
00:54:27,066 --> 00:54:29,200
- I'll remove the fritters.
- Okay.

580
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,233
Great.

581
00:54:39,633 --> 00:54:42,333
Soak glass noodles...
Wait, we don't need to?

582
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,100
Let's soak them now.

583
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,867
It's good you brought it up.

584
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,266
It looks like some small octopus.

585
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,400
And chili powder.

586
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:01,934
Chili powder.

587
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,834
And a spoon. Do you have a spoon?

588
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:04,867
Here's the spoon.

589
00:55:05,867 --> 00:55:06,700
Thank you.

590
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,100
- Just keep stirring it.
- Okay.

591
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:12,600
Stir it.

592
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:13,900
The heat is too low.

593
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,633
- Should I use a portable gas stove?
- You can.

594
00:55:16,734 --> 00:55:19,266
- The heat is too low.
- Do whatever you want.

595
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,800
The heat is too low.

596
00:55:27,066 --> 00:55:28,266
It smells nice.

597
00:55:29,734 --> 00:55:32,433
Spicy beef galbijjim and bulgogi.

598
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,333
This is very well-cooked.

599
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,633
Great, it's going well.

600
00:55:40,467 --> 00:55:42,233
You can add the vegetable fritters now.

601
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,800
- I'll take it.
- Okay.

602
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,200
All right then.

603
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:49,500
And next, Table Two.

604
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:50,934
One bulgogi.

605
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:55,834
You want to go out? Okay.

606
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,100
Let's go.

607
00:55:58,166 --> 00:55:59,166
The bulgogi is ready.

608
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:05,033
Thank you.

609
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:07,900
Green onions.

610
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:12,333
Done.

611
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,367
Table Two is done.

612
00:56:23,867 --> 00:56:25,533
Are you making me pour it?

613
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,533
Of course.

614
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,266
Hold on. Don't you know drinking manners?

615
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:34,934
Do you want me to show you?

616
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,700
No, let's wait until the food is here.

617
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,033
How do you toast with an older person?

618
00:56:40,133 --> 00:56:41,734
I put my glass below yours.

619
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,400
And I turn away and close my eyes too.

620
00:56:44,467 --> 00:56:46,367
You don't have to do that.

621
00:56:46,433 --> 00:56:49,166
How do you hold your glass
when I pour it for you?

622
00:56:50,367 --> 00:56:52,333
No, grab it with both hands.

623
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:56,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

624
00:57:01,567 --> 00:57:03,200
Gosh, that's mine.

625
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,533
- Is that yours?
- Yes.

626
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,033
What did you order?

627
00:57:19,467 --> 00:57:20,967
- Okay!
- Let's toast again.

628
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,000
Bottoms up this time.

629
00:57:25,433 --> 00:57:26,667
Cheers.

630
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,667
Cheers.

631
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,166
What do you do when my glass is empty?

632
00:57:33,967 --> 00:57:36,266
- I have to pour you more.
- That's right.

633
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,200
The vegetable fritters are very good.

634
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,667
I should take a big bite.

635
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,300
I can finish it up in a bite.

636
00:58:04,367 --> 00:58:05,266
A big bite.

637
00:58:05,333 --> 00:58:06,166
Right.

638
00:58:06,767 --> 00:58:07,934
Is the meat good?

639
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Yes.

640
00:58:26,033 --> 00:58:27,166
Is that really hot?

641
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,967
There's steam.

642
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,734
Look at the steam.

643
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,233
This is warm.
I don't know how to eat these noodles.

644
00:58:42,633 --> 00:58:43,600
It's hot.

645
00:58:44,266 --> 00:58:45,300
Just eat it.

646
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,667
Why does it slip?

647
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:53,433
Should I put it on my spoon
like spaghetti?

648
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,467
Well...

649
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,900
Just lower your head and eat it.

650
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,633
This is too hot.

651
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,233
Oh, my.

652
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,033
But I want to eat it.
The noodles are tasty.

653
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,800
Try my noodles. It's so good.

654
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:18,600
This isn't spicy.

655
00:59:18,667 --> 00:59:21,433
Mine's very good too.
It's not spicy either.

656
00:59:32,433 --> 00:59:33,533
I'm getting hot.

657
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,266
I won't feel cold if I go outside now.

658
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:38,100
Should I put it all in?

659
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,700
Yes.

660
00:59:48,667 --> 00:59:53,166
There you go. This kimchi is so good.

661
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:56,166
It's crunchy and spicy.

662
00:59:57,767 --> 01:00:00,700
How does the rice taste with the soup?

663
01:00:00,767 --> 01:00:01,734
- The rice?
- Yes.

664
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,867
It's really good.

665
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,100
I finished it all.

666
01:00:10,934 --> 01:00:11,967
Good job.

667
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,000
The sunlight is really good here.

668
01:01:04,066 --> 01:01:06,166
- My clothes will dry soon.
- I like this table.

669
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:15,033
It'd be best if we order all of them.

670
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,533
Right.

671
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,834
Let's order one of each.

672
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,133
- Great.
- Dessert too.

673
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:20,800
- One of each.
- I'm in.

674
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,900
Let's order two bulgogi.

675
01:01:39,934 --> 01:01:43,400
- We don't have enough potatoes.
- We don't, so...

676
01:01:44,066 --> 01:01:46,433
Should we steam some more potatoes?

677
01:01:46,533 --> 01:01:47,900
It'll only take 20 minutes.

678
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,333
We have some left. Should we do it now?

679
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,066
That's a lot of potatoes.

680
01:01:56,900 --> 01:01:59,500
Mr. Lee is really good
at peeling potatoes.

681
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,967
Hold on. I think three should be enough.

682
01:02:05,066 --> 01:02:05,900
- You think so?
- Yes.

683
01:02:05,967 --> 01:02:07,400
- Three should be enough.
- Okay.

684
01:02:07,867 --> 01:02:09,033
Why am I so good?

685
01:02:22,667 --> 01:02:24,166
To the beef galbijjim pot?

686
01:02:24,233 --> 01:02:25,166
Yes, put them in.

687
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:35,467
- Orders.
- Orders!

688
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,800
Two ttukbaegi bulgogi.

689
01:02:37,867 --> 01:02:41,133
One spicy beef galbijjim,
bibimbap, and gomtang.

690
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:43,233
One bibimbap and one gomtang.

691
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,900
- For five.
- I should put this.

692
01:02:44,967 --> 01:02:46,066
Dolsot-bibimbap.

693
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:48,166
Two bulgogi first.

694
01:02:58,567 --> 01:02:59,700
And beef galbijjim.

695
01:02:59,767 --> 01:03:00,934
- Yes.
- I'll put it on.

696
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,233
Put bibimbap and gomtang on the stove.

697
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,367
Put one more piece.

698
01:03:09,433 --> 01:03:10,266
- Six pieces.
- Okay.

699
01:03:10,367 --> 01:03:11,533
And add more soup.

700
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:12,934
Add more soup.

701
01:03:14,734 --> 01:03:15,834
One.

702
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:19,800
Okay.

703
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,066
Did you add red chili powder?

704
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:28,333
- Yes.
- Minced garlic?

705
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,233
- Yes.
- Great.

706
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:30,834
You're good.

707
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,333
- You added it.
- Right.

708
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:40,533
I'm sorry.

709
01:03:41,133 --> 01:03:42,734
Did you add potatoes?

710
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:45,133
No, not yet.

711
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,967
Two pieces of potato.

712
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:49,533
Okay.

713
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:51,533
- Great.
- Great.

714
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:53,800
- Everyone, you're doing great.
- Great.

715
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:54,700
Right.

716
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,333
I think you should put in the bulgogi now.

717
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,600
- Bulgogi.
- It would be great

718
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:00,867
if you add bulgogi.

719
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:02,166
I just need to add bulgogi?

720
01:04:02,233 --> 01:04:03,834
Onions and the minced...

721
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:06,567
Onions and carrots. Minced ones...

722
01:04:06,633 --> 01:04:09,033
Add them, please.

723
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:24,600
Min-si, pass me that soy sauce.

724
01:04:24,667 --> 01:04:26,266
- Soy sauce.
- That soy sauce.

725
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:29,633
You have to mix it on the bottom.
Just put it all in.

726
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,567
Great!

727
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:34,633
Nice.

728
01:04:37,467 --> 01:04:38,533
Great.

729
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:40,433
- Add some onion.
- Okay.

730
01:04:41,834 --> 01:04:42,667
Great.

731
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,667
We have a lot of green onions.

732
01:04:49,767 --> 01:04:51,500
I'm massaging the bulgogi.

733
01:04:51,567 --> 01:04:53,700
Great.

734
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,767
Now that we look at it closely,
Woo-shik isn't doing much.

735
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:06,667
The head chef doesn't do much.

736
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:07,834
Right.

737
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:09,600
Add some more onion.

738
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,433
There must be more onions here.

739
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:12,867
Dolsot-bibimbap.

740
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:23,367
Great.

741
01:05:24,066 --> 01:05:26,200
The gomtang looks like it's ready.

742
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:31,033
It's ready, one, two, three. Go.

743
01:05:31,133 --> 01:05:32,333
Serve this bulgogi first.

744
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,567
- It's ready.
- This one?

745
01:05:33,633 --> 01:05:34,900
- Yes.
- Okay.

746
01:05:34,967 --> 01:05:36,033
Okay.

747
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:38,700
- I'll take it there.
- Come here.

748
01:05:39,433 --> 01:05:41,100
Sesame oil and green onions.

749
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,967
I'm managing the whole kitchen.

750
01:05:47,066 --> 01:05:49,633
I'm checking from here if everything is...

751
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:55,433
That should be enough.

752
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,033
Okay, I'll turn it off.

753
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:58,467
It's hot.

754
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,934
Great.

755
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:04,900
It's done.

756
01:06:05,433 --> 01:06:07,266
- Red chili.
- Right.

757
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:08,300
- Rice for bulgogi.
- Okay.

758
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,700
- Two of them, right?
- Coming right up.

759
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:11,367
I'll add some green onion.

760
01:06:11,433 --> 01:06:12,967
It smells so good.

761
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:15,433
- It's hot.
- It's hot.

762
01:06:15,867 --> 01:06:16,967
It's hot as lava.

763
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:19,433
- Green onion. Yes, done.
- Careful.

764
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,700
- Chef Choi got much faster.
- I mean...

765
01:06:21,767 --> 01:06:23,600
He looks sloppy.

766
01:06:24,467 --> 01:06:26,100
But he is good.

767
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,333
Kkori-gomtang?

768
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,867
You had that in England,
and now here as well.

769
01:06:37,934 --> 01:06:39,567
It's my favorite.

770
01:06:39,633 --> 01:06:41,767
I've loved soup my entire life.

771
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:52,800
Can I take a photo?

772
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:54,533
Can we take it all together?

773
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,166
Goodness, guys.

774
01:06:57,266 --> 01:06:59,633
You're all doing the same pose.

775
01:07:07,867 --> 01:07:09,367
Nice.

776
01:07:12,033 --> 01:07:13,467
It's quite nice.

777
01:07:16,934 --> 01:07:19,834
It's been a while
since I had this glutinous rice.

778
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:23,400
I can tell that they used
good ingredients.

779
01:07:24,033 --> 01:07:25,166
It's delicious.

780
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,834
Shall we both order bulgogi?

781
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,900
- Sure.
- Let's each order one dish.

782
01:07:53,967 --> 01:07:57,066
We don't have to share it.

783
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:02,133
I think bulgogi looks the best here.

784
01:08:03,533 --> 01:08:05,200
I want to have the noodles.

785
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,200
- Let's prepare more.
- Okay.

786
01:08:22,633 --> 01:08:26,567
Bam, bam

787
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,934
All right.

788
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,033
Did you put the bibimbap on the stove?

789
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,500
- Yes.
- Goodness, this.

790
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,233
- I haven't turned it on yet.
- Oh, on purpose?

791
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,266
- Yes.
- Goodness.

792
01:08:42,033 --> 01:08:42,934
All right.

793
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,867
You're making more beforehand.

794
01:08:46,967 --> 01:08:50,066
Yes, this takes us a bit of time.

795
01:08:50,133 --> 01:08:52,533
- I think you can put more on.
- Right.

796
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:54,333
- Should I turn it on?
- No.

797
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:55,233
Okay.

798
01:08:57,033 --> 01:09:00,166
Watch what you say in front of the intern.

799
01:09:00,233 --> 01:09:02,166
I told you. You only listen to me.

800
01:09:02,266 --> 01:09:03,533
- I give you...
- Right.

801
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,200
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.

802
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,600
There is no ventilation here?
My eyes are getting sore.

803
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:11,600
Is it just me?

804
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:13,567
- Yes. I'm good.
- I see.

805
01:09:16,533 --> 01:09:17,800
So it's just me.

806
01:09:19,667 --> 01:09:21,433
Two bulgogi and one dolsot.

807
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,934
- Two bulgogi, one dolsot.
- Okay.

808
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,200
- Yes.
- Are these new orders?

809
01:09:24,266 --> 01:09:25,433
- Yes.
- Okay.

810
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:28,800
Two bulgogi and one dolsot!

811
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,700
They must be taking orders right now.

812
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:46,266
Okay, new orders.

813
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,767
- Orders.
- Okay.

814
01:09:47,867 --> 01:09:49,834
Three bibimbap, no four.

815
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:50,767
Four bibimbap?

816
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,934
One gomtang and one bulgogi.

817
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:53,934
Okay, great.

818
01:09:54,834 --> 01:09:57,066
How should we do it with bulgogi then?

819
01:09:57,133 --> 01:09:58,100
- Bulgogi?
- Yes.

820
01:09:58,166 --> 01:09:59,500
We put them on.

821
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:00,700
Right, when they...

822
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:03,633
- It's done. Then gomtang.
- And we have more bibimbap.

823
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,200
We have to make bibimbap.

824
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:06,266
Prepare the bibimbap.

825
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,834
And the gomtang on the stove? Served?

826
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:10,400
- Yes.
- Put more on the stove.

827
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,500
The bibimbap is ready now, yes?

828
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,533
Yes, it's ready.

829
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:39,767
- Okay.
- Okay.

830
01:10:42,266 --> 01:10:43,867
It's two bulgogi for Table Five.

831
01:10:44,734 --> 01:10:47,367
For Table Five, serve it
with the dish just now.

832
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:49,900
So four bibimbap then.

833
01:10:49,967 --> 01:10:51,500
- Yes.
- Okay.

834
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,500
Are any bowls ready?

835
01:10:53,567 --> 01:10:56,600
These two bowls are almost done.

836
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,700
Gomtang's on here. Bibimbap will be soon.

837
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,266
The bulgogi is on the stove. And dolsot...
Three should be ready.

838
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:17,433
Kkori-gomtang too.

839
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:20,233
What should I do? Bibimbap, bulgogi...

840
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,300
Ttukbaegi bulgogi...

841
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:25,567
Bulgogi, one of them is...
It's cooked, right?

842
01:11:32,934 --> 01:11:34,533
Can you work on this first?

843
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:37,033
- This is done.
- It's done? I'll put it on the stove.

844
01:11:41,266 --> 01:11:42,867
This is done too.

845
01:11:42,934 --> 01:11:44,400
Okay, that's great!

846
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,867
Did you add the green onion?

847
01:12:19,166 --> 01:12:21,700
Then, Kkori-gomtang is served.

848
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,166
Three bibimbaps are done.
I just have to make one more.

849
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,033
The second bibimbap is ready.

850
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,734
Okay, take it easy.

851
01:12:41,734 --> 01:12:42,934
It's all done.

852
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,533
Our orders never get piled up.

853
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,100
Thank you.

854
01:14:38,266 --> 01:14:39,433
It looks so good.

855
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:40,400
It smells good.

856
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:44,667
Nice.

857
01:17:47,433 --> 01:17:48,300
Salute.

858
01:17:48,367 --> 01:17:49,900
- Salute.
- Salute.

859
01:17:55,633 --> 01:17:57,767
- What does it taste like?
- How is it?

860
01:17:58,300 --> 01:17:59,700
It's like vodka.

861
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:27,834
Skal?

862
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:29,066
- Skal.
- Skal.

863
01:18:29,166 --> 01:18:30,266
Skal!

864
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:32,800
- Skal!
- Skal!

865
01:18:33,533 --> 01:18:34,700
Buon appetito.

866
01:18:34,767 --> 01:18:36,200
Buon appetito is Italian.

867
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,400
- It's good.
- Right.

868
01:18:53,133 --> 01:18:54,233
This is so good.

869
01:18:55,633 --> 01:18:56,934
I'm very satisfied.

870
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:07,433
Incredibly spicy.

871
01:19:25,367 --> 01:19:27,033
I have to try hard.

872
01:19:27,533 --> 01:19:29,500
Do you want to have some of mine?

873
01:19:52,967 --> 01:19:56,100
I need ice cream right now.

874
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:58,700
I have to extinguish this fire
in my mouth.

875
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,333
- So I have to make five more?
- Right.

876
01:20:37,467 --> 01:20:38,433
Is it done?

877
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:52,100
We just made one round.

878
01:20:52,166 --> 01:20:54,000
- Yes.
- Goodness.

879
01:20:55,734 --> 01:20:56,600
Great.

880
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:58,133
Oh, this is...

881
01:20:58,233 --> 01:21:00,900
This goes out to Seo-jun who helped me.

882
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,033
And Min-si, of course.

883
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:04,700
- Goodness.
- Without Seo-jun,

884
01:21:04,767 --> 01:21:06,433
- I would have been...
- Right.

885
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,233
He washed the dishes for us too.

886
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,567
Min-si, do you want any drinks?

887
01:21:13,166 --> 01:21:14,767
- I'd like a Coke.
- A Coke?

888
01:21:21,467 --> 01:21:23,934
- Should I take out the potatoes?
- Yes, potatoes.

889
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,166
I'll take them out.

890
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:27,400
- Okay.
- Min-si, that Coke is for you.

891
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,900
Thank you.

892
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,567
- Thank you.
- Did you finish it?

893
01:21:33,633 --> 01:21:34,700
Sorry?

894
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:36,800
I have to remove the potatoes now.

895
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:39,767
- Here, have your Coke.
- Okay.

896
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,500
Did we just make two rounds?

897
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,800
Round 2 begins at 7:30 p.m.

898
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:46,667
In 15 minutes.

899
01:22:04,433 --> 01:22:06,333
Let's go now. That was a great experience.

900
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,500
It was the best. A great experience.

901
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:16,133
Do it now.

902
01:22:16,233 --> 01:22:17,900
Why didn't you speak Korean?

903
01:22:18,166 --> 01:22:19,200
I don't know.

904
01:22:29,834 --> 01:22:31,266
Enjoy Iceland.

905
01:22:31,333 --> 01:22:32,867
Thank you.

906
01:23:17,834 --> 01:23:20,133
That's two bulgogi, one dolsot,

907
01:23:20,233 --> 01:23:21,166
- one galbijjim.
- Yes.

908
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,767
You have to make one of each.

909
01:23:23,867 --> 01:23:24,800
Are these new?

910
01:23:24,867 --> 01:23:25,834
Yes, new orders.

911
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:28,066
There are more orders for the group.

912
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,200
What orders are in?

913
01:23:29,266 --> 01:23:31,133
- That's three spicy galbijjim.
- Spicy? Then...

914
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,100
Three in total.

915
01:23:32,767 --> 01:23:33,700
This...

916
01:23:45,900 --> 01:23:48,066
Should I put one bowl of bibimbap
on the stove now?

917
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:49,166
That would be great.

918
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,633
Great, let's go.

919
01:23:55,633 --> 01:23:57,967
All right. What's next...

920
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:05,367
Put that at the bottom.

921
01:24:05,433 --> 01:24:06,433
Okay.

922
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,033
- Okay.
- Okay.

923
01:24:14,867 --> 01:24:16,767
When can we have all the dishes?

924
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:18,433
Well, this is done now.

925
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,033
This is done. Now, the bibimbap

926
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,200
- will be ready soon.
- Dolsot.

927
01:24:25,266 --> 01:24:26,834
It's sizzling now.

928
01:24:26,900 --> 01:24:28,367
It's sizzling.

929
01:24:28,867 --> 01:24:29,900
Give it to me.

930
01:24:30,266 --> 01:24:32,533
- Okay.
- We have another bibimbap there.

931
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,400
- Yes, the bibimbap is ready.
- Okay.

932
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:36,233
Please close the lid.

933
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,734
We need one more bowl.

934
01:24:37,800 --> 01:24:38,734
Really?

935
01:24:52,867 --> 01:24:54,667
- Dolsot on the stove now.
- Okay.

936
01:25:02,166 --> 01:25:03,266
Okay.

937
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,500
That's a generous amount of bibimbap.

938
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:11,500
Okay.

939
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:13,934
- The last one.
- You are the winner today.

940
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,166
A lot of rice since it's the last one.

941
01:25:16,266 --> 01:25:17,467
- Done.
- Thank you.

942
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:18,900
- Table Five is done?
- Done.

943
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,567
We just have to cook for the six people.

944
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,367
This is the last order.

945
01:25:31,433 --> 01:25:32,800
Last one.

946
01:25:33,367 --> 01:25:35,200
- Go, Woo-shik.
- Thank you.

947
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:36,800
- Don't get tired.
- Okay.

948
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:38,400
- You can do this.
- Min-si,

949
01:25:38,467 --> 01:25:40,367
we're almost there.

950
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:44,166
My hands are shaking now.
I think I've reached my limit.

951
01:25:44,233 --> 01:25:45,533
We're almost there.

952
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,900
Those are the last ones. Hang in there.

953
01:25:47,967 --> 01:25:48,800
- Okay.
- Okay.

954
01:25:48,867 --> 01:25:49,734
Thank you.

955
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,867
- We're almost there.
- Right.

956
01:25:51,934 --> 01:25:53,300
- Should I add all the potatoes?
- Yes.

957
01:25:53,367 --> 01:25:56,000
- I fried all the fritters.
- Let's add 2 or 3 more potato pieces.

958
01:25:56,066 --> 01:25:58,100
Two or three more pieces. Done.

959
01:25:58,166 --> 01:25:59,066
Great.

960
01:26:04,467 --> 01:26:06,367
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

961
01:26:06,433 --> 01:26:08,600
Goodness, this is a generous amount.

962
01:26:08,667 --> 01:26:10,767
Put the vegetable fritters
on the spicy beef galbijjim.

963
01:26:10,834 --> 01:26:11,667
Okay.

964
01:26:11,734 --> 01:26:13,567
Green and red chili.

965
01:26:13,667 --> 01:26:15,433
- Just one more bulgogi to go.
- Right.

966
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:17,367
- This is the last dish.
- Okay.

967
01:26:19,300 --> 01:26:21,200
This is done. For which table?

968
01:26:26,533 --> 01:26:28,100
Yes, we are done.

969
01:26:32,567 --> 01:26:35,367
You are the most precious one ever.

970
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:37,834
My precious Min-si.

971
01:26:39,633 --> 01:26:41,934
Precious Min-si sent from above.

972
01:26:59,133 --> 01:27:00,433
Dolsot-bibimbap.

973
01:28:01,233 --> 01:28:04,400
He said finish the meat first,
then have the rice with soup.

974
01:28:04,467 --> 01:28:05,667
Right.

975
01:28:09,633 --> 01:28:11,834
- It's really good.
- Right.

976
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,734
It's a whole different dish.

977
01:28:19,934 --> 01:28:21,300
It's very hot.

978
01:28:30,667 --> 01:28:31,800
It's really good.

979
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:52,700
It's been so long since I had meat.

980
01:28:54,734 --> 01:28:56,433
- Seriously?
- Since yesterday.

981
01:29:01,800 --> 01:29:04,600
I'm glad I didn't order that.

982
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,400
This wouldn't have been good
for you, my love.

983
01:29:09,533 --> 01:29:11,667
Look at you.

984
01:29:11,734 --> 01:29:13,433
I should perform on this.

985
01:29:16,834 --> 01:29:18,867
- This is good, though.
- Right.

986
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:23,900
And the weather today, we are so lucky.

987
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:26,433
I wonder if we'll see the aurora tonight.

988
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,033
I think we will.

989
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:52,700
How many do you want?

990
01:29:52,767 --> 01:29:54,800
- I'll try it.
- Okay.

991
01:29:54,867 --> 01:29:56,033
So four?

992
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,633
It's really good.

993
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,166
Is it good?

994
01:31:09,967 --> 01:31:11,033
It's really good.

995
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:15,967
I'm so happy.

996
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:37,667
Guys, our dinner is here.

997
01:32:38,834 --> 01:32:41,467
Dinner's here. It's amazing.

998
01:32:42,233 --> 01:32:43,967
Come, let's eat now.

999
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,066
- It looks good.
- Thanks for the meal.

1000
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:47,433
Thanks for the meal.

1001
01:32:49,433 --> 01:32:50,767
- Nice!
- Try this.

1002
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,467
The steamed eggs are so good.

1003
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,433
My goodness.

1004
01:32:59,467 --> 01:33:01,367
Gosh, this is so good.

1005
01:33:04,133 --> 01:33:05,300
Gosh, steamed eggs.

1006
01:33:06,066 --> 01:33:07,033
It's so good.

1007
01:33:08,734 --> 01:33:10,300
- It's hot.
- Goodness.

1008
01:33:11,266 --> 01:33:12,800
Where did they make this?

1009
01:33:18,967 --> 01:33:20,200
This tastes so good.

1010
01:33:20,934 --> 01:33:22,333
Two more of this.

1011
01:33:22,433 --> 01:33:24,600
We can have three pieces of this.

1012
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,233
It's so good.

1013
01:33:28,233 --> 01:33:29,367
It's so good.

1014
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,300
How many dishes did we sell today?

1015
01:33:41,700 --> 01:33:43,066
Which dish? Bulgogi?

1016
01:33:43,133 --> 01:33:45,467
All of them. How many bowls of bulgogi?

1017
01:33:45,533 --> 01:33:48,100
We sold 34 bowls of bulgogi.

1018
01:33:48,533 --> 01:33:50,300
That's a lot.

1019
01:33:50,667 --> 01:33:51,533
Good work.

1020
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:54,600
I think it's a new record.

1021
01:33:54,667 --> 01:33:55,900
I asked people

1022
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,967
as I was serving the food.

1023
01:33:58,033 --> 01:34:00,500
Many of them knew bulgogi.

1024
01:34:03,767 --> 01:34:06,433
They said it was
their favorite Korean food.

1025
01:34:12,633 --> 01:34:16,834
Woo-shik, you worked as a chef this time.
You'll get promoted next time.

1026
01:34:20,066 --> 01:34:22,266
He's almost one of the board members.

1027
01:34:29,367 --> 01:34:31,433
I'll make a team for you next time.

1028
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,734
You want me to leave this show?

1029
01:34:36,633 --> 01:34:37,934
I mean the team leader.

1030
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,567
- Your team.
- Of your own team.

1031
01:34:40,934 --> 01:34:42,934
Then you'll abandon me, right?

1032
01:34:46,934 --> 01:34:50,834
I think it's going to be you guys
leaving me first.

1033
01:34:51,633 --> 01:34:53,533
You did really great this time.

1034
01:34:56,266 --> 01:34:57,367
Such a high praise.

1035
01:34:57,667 --> 01:35:00,533
But there is nothing I did by myself.

1036
01:35:01,033 --> 01:35:05,667
In everything I did,
I had Min-si, Seo-jun, and Yu-mi.

1037
01:35:11,133 --> 01:35:13,834
I am where I am today thanks to them.

1038
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:20,100
This goes out to you all.

1039
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:24,900
This year,

1040
01:35:24,967 --> 01:35:27,767
you might win an award
at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

1041
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:31,734
- That was the perfect speech for it.
- You might get the grand prize.

1042
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,734
- Cheers.
- Everyone.

1043
01:35:37,233 --> 01:35:38,800
Just one more day to go.

1044
01:35:50,133 --> 01:35:53,734
- We are in big trouble!
- Why are you worried?

1045
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,066
- You don't know the menu yet.
- Yes.

1046
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,800
Six groups are waiting.

1047
01:36:00,867 --> 01:36:02,100
What do we do?

1048
01:36:02,166 --> 01:36:04,133
We've never had such a big crowd.

1049
01:36:09,734 --> 01:36:12,100
I'd even have to send away my mom
if she were here.

1050
01:36:38,433 --> 01:36:41,734
How about we work
until we run out of the ingredients?

1051
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,100
That sounds nice.

1052
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:03,867
I have to take notes.

1053
01:37:05,967 --> 01:37:06,867
All right.

1054
01:37:07,734 --> 01:37:10,567
Dakgalbi, 40 servings.

1055
01:37:10,633 --> 01:37:12,667
- Twenty gomtang.
- Twenty gomtang.

1056
01:37:12,734 --> 01:37:14,367
- Forty bibimbap.
- Right.

1057
01:37:14,433 --> 01:37:16,700
- And 30 sundubu.
- Yes.

1058
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:18,800
Thirty yukjeon.

1059
01:37:18,867 --> 01:37:21,800
- As for bulgogi, 50.
- Bulgogi sells a lot.

1060
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:25,033
That's 8, 11, 16...

1061
01:37:25,133 --> 01:37:27,533
- Two hundred and ten?
- Two hundred and ten servings?

1062
01:37:53,433 --> 01:37:55,834
So only the two of us will be serving?

1063
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,433
Min-si has to make six dishes.

1064
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,700
Gosh, that means...

1065
01:38:01,133 --> 01:38:03,100
Can you help us wash the dishes?

1066
01:38:05,767 --> 01:38:08,066
I'm going crazy washing dishes.

1067
01:38:08,500 --> 01:38:10,500
- If you wash dishes...
- Right.

1068
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,100
...there will be no problem.

1069
01:38:12,166 --> 01:38:15,133
Washing dishes is so tough.
It's exhausting.

1070
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:17,200
I'll do the dishes then.

1071
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:21,066
If you could wash the dishes,
we can prepare even 300 portions.

1072
01:38:35,867 --> 01:38:38,066
What time will you open tomorrow?

1073
01:38:38,166 --> 01:38:40,467
- Well we'll open at 12:00.
- At 12:00?

1074
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:42,800
What matters is when we start working.

1075
01:38:42,867 --> 01:38:44,600
- Right.
- Is it 7:00?

1076
01:38:44,667 --> 01:38:46,500
- At 8:00.
- Or is it at 8:00?

1077
01:38:48,967 --> 01:38:51,133
- It's 10:00?
- Gosh, it's 10:00 already?

1078
01:38:51,233 --> 01:38:54,233
- Time passes so quickly.
- All right, then...

1079
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:01,467
We can't go home yet.

1080
01:39:02,233 --> 01:39:03,767
- Just 30 minutes.
- What now?

1081
01:39:03,834 --> 01:39:05,800
- So what do we do?
- Let's decide

1082
01:39:05,867 --> 01:39:08,066
- and work on it for 30 minutes and leave.
- Okay.

1083
01:39:08,133 --> 01:39:09,967
- Cabbage and the sauce.
- Yes, the sauce.

1084
01:39:10,033 --> 01:39:10,900
Seasoning sauce.

1085
01:39:10,967 --> 01:39:13,100
I'll also work on the seasoning sauce.

1086
01:39:13,166 --> 01:39:15,066
- I'll work on cabbage. Yes.
- Cabbage?

1087
01:39:15,133 --> 01:39:17,433
I'll work on sweet potatoes and onions.

1088
01:39:17,500 --> 01:39:19,333
The mushrooms for sundubu.

1089
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:21,233
- Right.
- The mushrooms.

1090
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:23,500
You guys are amazing.

1091
01:39:23,633 --> 01:39:25,900
- Just amazing.
- I'll make rice.

1092
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,300
I don't know who made us like this.

1093
01:39:28,367 --> 01:39:30,734
- You guys are unbelievable.
- I'll make rice.

1094
01:39:31,133 --> 01:39:33,300
We don't have to come at 8:00 then.

1095
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:35,867
If we do the prep now,
we can come at 9:00.

1096
01:39:35,934 --> 01:39:37,834
Yes. You know...

1097
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,433
That thing tomorrow...

1098
01:39:40,233 --> 01:39:42,433
It's the last day, come out an hour early.

1099
01:39:43,033 --> 01:39:43,967
- Okay?
- Okay.

1100
01:39:44,033 --> 01:39:46,700
- Yes.
- I wasn't thinking straight. I'm sorry.

1101
01:39:49,734 --> 01:39:50,734
Okay?

1102
01:39:52,433 --> 01:39:54,834
This is why you're still a junior.

1103
01:39:57,767 --> 01:39:58,633
I'm sorry.

1104
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:01,266
You want to lie down badly, right?

1105
01:40:02,066 --> 01:40:02,934
Yes?

1106
01:40:03,533 --> 01:40:05,200
Let me tell you what life is.

1107
01:40:05,967 --> 01:40:07,266
It's endless pain...

1108
01:40:09,734 --> 01:40:11,133
Gosh, again.

1109
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,033
I have to start again.

1110
01:40:14,100 --> 01:40:16,166
I'll work on cabbage...

1111
01:40:16,233 --> 01:40:18,433
And chives...

1112
01:40:18,934 --> 01:40:23,133
And shiitake mushroom.

1113
01:40:24,266 --> 01:40:25,867
I'll cut the top.

1114
01:40:42,033 --> 01:40:43,633
This should be enough.

1115
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:47,633
Is this enough?

1116
01:40:48,100 --> 01:40:49,266
- Good.
- Good.

1117
01:41:32,600 --> 01:41:34,033
Are you working already?

1118
01:41:34,133 --> 01:41:36,633
I thought I should practice.

1119
01:41:39,166 --> 01:41:40,900
How do I turn on the faucet?

1120
01:41:43,967 --> 01:41:45,000
Yes, open that.

1121
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:47,633
No, open that for water.

1122
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:49,066
Open that.

1123
01:41:49,133 --> 01:41:50,000
Right.

1124
01:41:50,066 --> 01:41:52,066
- Goodness.
- Turn this to the right.

1125
01:41:52,133 --> 01:41:53,100
No, that one.

1126
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:56,033
If you turn it, the water starts running.

1127
01:42:03,967 --> 01:42:07,200
He's so clumsy at this kind of stuff.
I'm worried.

1128
01:42:09,734 --> 01:42:10,900
- Min-si.
- Yes?

1129
01:42:11,467 --> 01:42:13,400
You teach the part-timer, okay?

1130
01:42:14,066 --> 01:42:14,900
Okay.

1131
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,367
Where should I keep the bowl?

1132
01:42:23,867 --> 01:42:25,166
You can keep it here.

1133
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:27,300
Thank you.

1134
01:42:29,667 --> 01:42:32,100
I think we need some paper towel.

1135
01:42:32,166 --> 01:42:34,200
You can use the dish towel.

1136
01:42:34,266 --> 01:42:35,700
- Here.
- This wipes it better.

1137
01:42:35,767 --> 01:42:37,433
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure.

1138
01:42:47,734 --> 01:42:49,867
Where do I put this huge plate?

1139
01:42:49,934 --> 01:42:51,800
Where did you get that?

1140
01:42:51,867 --> 01:42:54,133
- What's that?
- We don't use that plate.

1141
01:42:55,867 --> 01:42:58,033
The new guy has a lot of questions.

1142
01:42:59,133 --> 01:43:01,433
You told him to ask when he was lost.

1143
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:02,734
Right.

1144
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,400
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

1145
01:43:05,066 --> 01:43:06,800
And the bulgogi sauce...

1146
01:43:06,867 --> 01:43:10,567
I made more than enough,
to last a month even after we leave.

1147
01:43:42,033 --> 01:43:43,834
I'll just put them all in.

1148
01:43:47,433 --> 01:43:48,467
The soup is amazing.

1149
01:44:05,367 --> 01:44:06,433
Oh, God...

1150
01:44:06,867 --> 01:44:09,700
Dear God, please give me strength.

1151
01:44:12,367 --> 01:44:14,667
Right, chives. I have to chop them.

1152
01:44:14,734 --> 01:44:16,400
I have to chop the chives.

1153
01:44:16,467 --> 01:44:18,767
This much of zucchini should be enough.

1154
01:44:20,266 --> 01:44:21,834
Woo-shik, we need the chives chopped.

1155
01:44:21,900 --> 01:44:23,166
- Chives?
- I'll do it.

1156
01:44:23,233 --> 01:44:24,834
- What are chives?
- The garnish.

1157
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,233
What are chives?

1158
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:29,133
Speak Korean.

1159
01:44:30,033 --> 01:44:31,967
- What are chives?
- Dakgalbi...

1160
01:44:32,033 --> 01:44:34,667
That thing you put on dakgalbi.

1161
01:44:34,734 --> 01:44:36,333
They're like scallions.

1162
01:44:36,834 --> 01:44:39,867
- How do you chop them?
- Just chop chop chop.

1163
01:44:39,934 --> 01:44:41,433
Do you want to have a go?

1164
01:44:42,066 --> 01:44:43,000
Okay...

1165
01:44:45,600 --> 01:44:46,500
Just chop them.

1166
01:44:46,567 --> 01:44:48,667
- How?
- Like those pieces on the dakgalbi.

1167
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:14,934
I think these chives should be enough.

1168
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,266
- Isn't this a lot?
- It is a lot.

1169
01:45:17,333 --> 01:45:19,600
I think we have enough chives chopped.

1170
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:20,600
Woo-shik?

1171
01:45:21,133 --> 01:45:22,100
Woo-shik!

1172
01:45:22,900 --> 01:45:24,100
Woo-shik...

1173
01:45:25,767 --> 01:45:28,467
You can stop chopping now.

1174
01:45:29,033 --> 01:45:31,567
I won't let you talk about it ever again.

1175
01:45:31,633 --> 01:45:33,500
I'll chop as much as you need.

1176
01:45:33,567 --> 01:45:36,100
- You love chives, don't you?
- Stop it.

1177
01:45:38,033 --> 01:45:40,700
Done. Honestly, I can use all of this.

1178
01:45:41,066 --> 01:45:43,066
- Totally.
- This is a lot of chives.

1179
01:45:51,667 --> 01:45:52,633
What is this?

1180
01:45:53,700 --> 01:45:55,300
Seriously, all of these?

1181
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:56,767
Oh, Lord...

1182
01:45:58,133 --> 01:46:00,333
Please save me. As much as you can.

1183
01:46:03,734 --> 01:46:05,667
I'm sorry for everything.

1184
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,066
Please send me back to Korea
once this is done.

1185
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,500
I can't make a handsome face.

1186
01:46:45,266 --> 01:46:47,400
You don't have to do this.

1187
01:47:13,633 --> 01:47:14,467
This is nine kilograms.

1188
01:47:17,233 --> 01:47:18,266
Good work.

1189
01:47:18,567 --> 01:47:19,867
He did the entire nine kilograms.

1190
01:47:20,667 --> 01:47:24,000
- Go, Seo-jin.
- Go, Seo-jin.

1191
01:47:28,066 --> 01:47:30,767
What if we don't sell everything tomorrow?

1192
01:47:32,734 --> 01:47:35,667
I'm too scared to go to sleep.

1193
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:55,400
Mr. Lee,

1194
01:47:56,233 --> 01:47:58,600
I suggest you to go outside and check.

1195
01:47:58,667 --> 01:48:00,700
- Why?
- Are there people lining up again?

1196
01:48:00,767 --> 01:48:02,700
- So early?
- Just go and take a look.

1197
01:48:02,767 --> 01:48:03,900
- Already?
- I'm scared.

1198
01:48:03,967 --> 01:48:04,934
What time is it?

1199
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:06,734
- There are about 40 to 50 people.
- Already?

1200
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:07,734
What? Really?

1201
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,533
It's not even 10:30 yet.

1202
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,700
Are you serious?

1203
01:48:32,467 --> 01:48:33,400
Let's start.

1204
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:35,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1205
01:48:47,467 --> 01:48:48,667
We have more orders.

1206
01:48:48,734 --> 01:48:50,200
I'll let the second round diners in.

1207
01:48:50,266 --> 01:48:51,266
- Okay.
- Bibimbap...

1208
01:48:51,333 --> 01:48:52,300
It's ready now.

1209
01:48:52,367 --> 01:48:54,166
- Gomtang for the group.
- Yes, I'm scooping the rice.

1210
01:48:54,233 --> 01:48:55,967
- Min-si is a fool.
- Come on.

1211
01:48:59,700 --> 01:49:00,900
Bulgogi is done.

1212
01:49:00,967 --> 01:49:03,333
The bulgogi is ready.
The noodles are ready.

1213
01:49:03,400 --> 01:49:05,967
- Should I clean up Table Four?
- Yes, we should.

1214
01:49:06,834 --> 01:49:09,800
- Min-si, you should serve this.
- Okay, I'll serve it.

1215
01:49:10,433 --> 01:49:11,934
Gosh, this is scary.

1216
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,867
Should we serve bibim-guksu first?

1217
01:49:15,934 --> 01:49:16,800
Yes.

1218
01:49:17,433 --> 01:49:18,600
Everybody out.

1219
01:49:18,667 --> 01:49:20,467
- Okay.
- I want to be alone.

1220
01:49:25,667 --> 01:49:26,567
My back.

1221
01:49:27,633 --> 01:49:29,467
My head is about to explode.

1222
01:49:29,934 --> 01:49:33,367
Producer Nah, please help me.

1223
01:49:35,233 --> 01:49:36,600
He's here.

1224
01:49:38,867 --> 01:49:40,667
Ms. Ko, hold on a second.

1225
01:49:40,734 --> 01:49:42,066
Thank you, Ms. Ko.

1226
01:49:42,133 --> 01:49:44,266
Don't worry about me. I'm not here.

1227
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:51,100
- What's the fuss at the back?
- I'm sorry.

1228
01:49:51,934 --> 01:49:52,867
My goodness.

1229
01:49:57,266 --> 01:49:58,467
You're really doing it?

1230
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:00,700
No, no.

1231
01:50:00,767 --> 01:50:01,600
I'll take the orders.

1232
01:50:03,734 --> 01:50:06,567
Why is it selling so well?

1233
01:50:07,266 --> 01:50:09,166
They started 10 minutes ago.

1234
01:50:09,233 --> 01:50:10,233
Okay.

1235
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,367
He's as skilled as Han Seok-bong's mother.

1236
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:15,333
Right?

1237
01:50:27,367 --> 01:50:29,300
Want me to turn off the lights?

1238
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:32,133
Yes, it's too bright. Please do that.

1239
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,100
He can do it without the lights.

1240
01:50:51,700 --> 01:50:53,033
Are these long enough?

1241
01:50:53,533 --> 01:50:54,867
Is this the right way?

1242
01:50:54,934 --> 01:50:56,200
Yes, it's fine.

1243
01:50:56,266 --> 01:50:57,500
- You think so?
- Yes.

1244
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:58,767
