1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,133
Make one of each.

3
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:25,834
- One each?
- Spicy and original.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,100
- Spicy too?
- Dolsot.

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,233
And kkori-gomtang.

6
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,500
Customers are rushing in.

7
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,266
We have new customers. We're full.

8
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,333
What was I about to do?

9
00:00:36,834 --> 00:00:37,667
The rice...

10
00:00:38,834 --> 00:00:39,767
There's no rice.

11
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,100
What do I do?

12
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,867
I have to make it again.

13
00:00:42,934 --> 00:00:44,500
We have to do it all over?

14
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,200
- Almost.
- What?

15
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:49,934
They're rushing in.

16
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:52,667
We have six groups waiting.

17
00:00:53,367 --> 00:00:54,967
- Scoop the rice.
- I am.

18
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:57,200
You're good at your job.

19
00:00:57,834 --> 00:00:59,767
- It's ready?
- They're very fast.

20
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,300
All for Table Five.

21
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,100
It's all served.

22
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:10,867
- Min-si.
- Yes?

23
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:13,166
Give me a high five.

24
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,667
Let's high five.

25
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,200
Well done.

26
00:01:18,533 --> 00:01:19,900
Min-si, good job.

27
00:01:23,967 --> 00:01:25,600
How much was the sale?

28
00:01:25,934 --> 00:01:27,033
Let me see.

29
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,500
The numbers should tell.

30
00:01:35,033 --> 00:01:36,100
I can't read it.

31
00:01:36,166 --> 00:01:37,000
You can't?

32
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:38,767
Hold on. Goodness.

33
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,367
It's smaller than a watermelon seed.

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,166
You can't even feel it.

35
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,200
Did we really earn this much?

36
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,533
I'm surprised.

37
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:01,033
Over 3,000,000 won?

38
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,600
This is eye-opening.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,567
Who's cooking tomorrow?

40
00:02:09,633 --> 00:02:11,567
Gosh, what do we do?

41
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,433
Who's cooking first?

42
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,066
Can I choose?

43
00:02:18,734 --> 00:02:19,834
Made up your mind?

44
00:02:20,467 --> 00:02:21,367
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

45
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,900
Are you announcing now?

46
00:02:22,967 --> 00:02:23,800
Yes.

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,834
I'll choose Yu-mi.

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,033
Gosh.

49
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:37,166
What?

50
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:38,967
Who's going first?

51
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:39,900
Ms. Jung?

52
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:46,867
Seo-jun has to join...

53
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,066
for the big games.

54
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:51,300
He has to cook on the weekends.

55
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,233
What?

56
00:02:53,467 --> 00:02:54,433
Episode Two...

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,233
Woo-shik's the main one.

58
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,900
It's better if you stand out
on Episode Three.

59
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:02,233
What are you saying?

60
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:09,300
Hello. I'm today's chef.

61
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,500
That's one dolsot-bibimbap
and one spicy...

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,033
I'll start on the order.

63
00:03:21,133 --> 00:03:23,367
She surely is experienced.

64
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:25,266
I feel at ease.

65
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,600
Yu-mi's good.

66
00:03:26,934 --> 00:03:28,800
It's great. Good!

67
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,133
First order.

68
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:34,000
"Dolsot-bibimbap."

69
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:36,367
More coming in?

70
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:37,734
What is going on?

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,667
Let's go.

72
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,300
It's snowing a lot.

73
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,300
- It surely is Iceland.
- I know.

74
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,400
It's all piled up here.

75
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:17,033
Shouldn't you eat?

76
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:20,533
I'm not hungry at all.

77
00:04:34,266 --> 00:04:36,066
Min-si, will you eat ramyeon?

78
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,633
No, I...

79
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,066
Sorry. I'll have some.

80
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:41,100
Sure.

81
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:42,266
It's good.

82
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,300
- Can I have just a bite?
- Sure, it's all yours.

83
00:04:47,367 --> 00:04:49,900
- Just cook more ramyeon.
- Seo-jun's making it.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,266
- Really?
- But try it.

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,100
- Does anyone want ramyeon?
- Me!

86
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,500
I got hungry after a shower.

87
00:04:56,867 --> 00:04:58,400
- What?
- It's relaxed here.

88
00:04:58,867 --> 00:04:59,867
Adding meat?

89
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,900
No, I'm grilling.

90
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,467
It's delicious. Thank you.

91
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,867
- Tasty.
- It's really good.

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,734
How come it tastes so good?

93
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:24,266
- What is...
- Is it a timer?

94
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,800
- Why is it ringing?
- The fridge.

95
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,266
You left it open.

96
00:05:31,033 --> 00:05:34,033
- Do you want more?
- Who'd say we were in Iceland?

97
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,934
Right?

98
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,166
I'm only in the kitchen.

99
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,600
When I get coffee...

100
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,567
or go for grocery shopping...

101
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,433
It just felt surreal.

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,166
Even when I go out to buy...

103
00:05:45,233 --> 00:05:47,100
Did you see the snowy mountains?

104
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,633
- I did, yesterday.
- I did.

105
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:51,033
For two seconds, like this.

106
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,533
How about Woo-shik?

107
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,734
Woo-shik's kind of slow now.

108
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:02,367
Min-si and Woo-shik.
They have bloodshot eyes.

109
00:06:02,433 --> 00:06:03,734
What I felt today...

110
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,467
In the kitchen,

111
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,867
they're restless.

112
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,333
And we're anxious.

113
00:06:10,867 --> 00:06:12,567
That's exactly what I felt.

114
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:14,667
But...

115
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,500
We can't help each other.

116
00:06:18,734 --> 00:06:22,867
We just have to trust
and root for each other.

117
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:25,367
See you tomorrow.

118
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:27,233
- See you tomorrow.
- Good job.

119
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:29,500
- Good job.
- Good night.

120
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,567
It was tough today, yes?

121
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,767
Today...

122
00:06:32,834 --> 00:06:38,633
It was better to work
without a break or anything.

123
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,533
I didn't expect any of this.

124
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:44,800
I'll put it here. Take it.

125
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,166
Sure, gongjindan.

126
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,900
I don't want to go to bed.

127
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:54,200
It will be tomorrow when I open my eyes.

128
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,633
No!

129
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,233
You sleep first.

130
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,500
Aren't you sleeping?

131
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,700
I'll wrap up first.

132
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,433
I'll wash my face and brush my teeth.

133
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,367
We will do well tomorrow.

134
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:04,900
Good night.

135
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,500
Good night.

136
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,500
- Good night.
- Bye.

137
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,100
Are you okay?

138
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,900
You can't be thinking too much.

139
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:26,533
I can't think much.

140
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:30,133
I feel like I'm disconnected
with the world.

141
00:08:31,066 --> 00:08:34,000
I wonder what's happening in Korea.

142
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:35,800
- You know what's the date today?
- No.

143
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,600
It's just Friday.

144
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:38,600
I know that.

145
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,367
It's the weekend tomorrow.

146
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:42,300
I know it's going to be busy.

147
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,867
- Hello.
- Good morning.

148
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,333
I heard that you couldn't do this
because you were too tired.

149
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,633
Right.

150
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,467
That is it for me.

151
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,266
But last year,

152
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:58,734
you said, "This isn't hard."

153
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,433
A year can't be that long.

154
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,567
- Why was I okay then?
- I know.

155
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,567
I was totally fine in Mexico.

156
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,400
You got tired yesterday?

157
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,300
It's tougher than Grandpas Over Flowers.

158
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,800
That show wasn't easy.

159
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,367
You know?

160
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,567
I get Min-si is tired.

161
00:09:16,667 --> 00:09:18,133
Seo-jun must be tired.

162
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:19,700
Woo-shik worked hard.

163
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,166
But you...

164
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,467
I've been walking back and forth.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,734
I have a cramp on my left inner thigh.

166
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,533
I don't get why it hurts here.

167
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,367
Did you stiffen there too?

168
00:09:32,633 --> 00:09:34,600
You two will do well today.

169
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,266
You got shirts under the sweaters.

170
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:39,600
I feel like...

171
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,367
it will be okay at the hall.

172
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,400
- Your hairstyle.
- Hey, Chef.

173
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,166
Let's go.

174
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
She's back with the handkerchief
after a long time.

175
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,300
Thank you.

176
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:58,567
We'll make ramyeon at the end.

177
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,300
This is for your vlog.

178
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,400
I'm...

179
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm really bad with this.

180
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,800
How do you feel about this?

181
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:12,000
It feels like I'm back to eight years ago.

182
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,633
I'm the chef for the second day.

183
00:10:14,734 --> 00:10:18,467
I'm heading out with the staff.

184
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,767
I'll rush now.

185
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,133
This is hilarious.

186
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's film together.

187
00:10:26,133 --> 00:10:28,600
- I look forward to this.
- Me too.

188
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:30,500
I'll do my best.

189
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,600
Stay still.

190
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,767
I'll film you.

191
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,533
You know that MZ thing.

192
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:43,734
Let me do it for you.

193
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,700
Hold on. Look straight.

194
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,667
Okay.

195
00:10:46,767 --> 00:10:47,900
You go like this...

196
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:49,467
Move along the song.

197
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:51,266
- Can I stay still?
- Like this.

198
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:55,200
I'm today's chef.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,867
Oh, that.

200
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,166
This is MZ shot.

201
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:04,133
- Let's go.
- Okay.

202
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:06,734
- It's cold.
- Let's go.

203
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm glad you're all coming.

204
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:11,767
My first day to work as a chef.

205
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,300
I'm back from Gili after eight years.

206
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:18,967
So I put on a white bandana.

207
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,500
I look different now.

208
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:26,934
It has been eight years. That's why.

209
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,867
Today is the second day

210
00:11:29,934 --> 00:11:30,834
of business.

211
00:11:30,934 --> 00:11:32,300
Today's the second day.

212
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,133
It's quite cloudy.

213
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,834
I haven't seen the snowy mountains yet.

214
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,767
But now,

215
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:40,433
I can see them!

216
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,667
Seo-jin, look.

217
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,300
- You see something?
- Snowy mountains.

218
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:46,266
- I can see it.
- I see it now.

219
00:11:46,367 --> 00:11:47,667
It's clearer than yesterday.

220
00:11:47,734 --> 00:11:49,400
I can see it now. Can I zoom in?

221
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,533
I've never seen snowy mountains before.

222
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,633
It's our first time seeing it.

223
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,367
We'll be there in ten seconds.

224
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:30,834
Jung Yu-mi!

225
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,700
- Let's go, Yu-mi.
- Jung Yu-mi.

226
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,633
Get in now.

227
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,133
Hey.

228
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:42,567
That's the end of my smile.

229
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:45,667
I'm at work.

230
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,734
Gosh, it's cold.

231
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,200
We have to change this.

232
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,734
It's not been changed yet?

233
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,367
He's yesterday's chef.

234
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:57,633
A major contributor.

235
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,867
That's the highest sales in all seasons.

236
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,934
I'm under a lot of pressure.

237
00:13:06,967 --> 00:13:07,800
The end.

238
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,900
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

239
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,800
Come here.

240
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,033
Put this on. Your debut was a success.

241
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:29,967
What?

242
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,033
You like it?

243
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:33,867
- A star badge on me?
- Yes.

244
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:34,800
Yesterday...

245
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,433
Here.

246
00:13:46,467 --> 00:13:49,133
A star badge on chefs
who worked the day before.

247
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,300
A successful debut...

248
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,066
I'm a one-star.

249
00:14:08,033 --> 00:14:09,100
- Is it gold?
- What?

250
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
- Put it on for me.
- Gold for chefs.

251
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,200
So you got it.

252
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,333
- I got a one-star.
- I'm so jealous.

253
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:38,900
Let's get back now.

254
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,400
Mr. Lee, the commandments.

255
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,266
I'm dizzy before it's even started.

256
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,600
I don't like getting attention.

257
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,667
I have stage fright.

258
00:14:54,734 --> 00:14:55,633
Stage fright?

259
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,500
We have so many ceremonies.

260
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,033
Why do we have so many of them?

261
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:08,934
Go on, Yu-mi.

262
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,767
Five hygiene rules!

263
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,467
One, keep it hygienic at all times.

264
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:15,734
Keep it hygienic.

265
00:15:15,834 --> 00:15:19,567
Two, wash hands as often as you can.

266
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:20,867
Wash hands.

267
00:15:20,934 --> 00:15:24,500
Three, always wear clean outfits.

268
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:25,767
Clean outfits.

269
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,033
Clean outfits.

270
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,300
Clean outfits.

271
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:33,100
Four, clean all cooking tools after work.

272
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,734
We clean tools.

273
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,367
Here, the last one.

274
00:15:36,433 --> 00:15:39,367
Five, always ask, if you are lost.

275
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:41,233
We ask.

276
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,367
We ask.

277
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,533
The end.

278
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,834
- What do we do?
- Endless.

279
00:15:52,467 --> 00:15:54,633
One, two, three.

280
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,300
Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

281
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,467
Back to where you were!

282
00:16:20,233 --> 00:16:21,200
This is a lot.

283
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,533
Let me just add it.

284
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,934
What do you want to drink?

285
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll get them.

286
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
Iced Americano.

287
00:17:36,367 --> 00:17:37,567
- All of you?
- Yes.

288
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:39,100
- You too, Woo-shik?
- Yes.

289
00:17:40,266 --> 00:17:43,000
Why would you have iced drinks
when it's cold?

290
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:45,333
- It's hot here.
- You're right.

291
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,400
Ever worked on anything this big?

292
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:38,467
No.

293
00:18:39,467 --> 00:18:41,467
- It's huge.
- Right.

294
00:18:41,767 --> 00:18:43,767
- Take your coffee.
- Thank you.

295
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,166
Thank you.

296
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,300
- Here.
- Thank you.

297
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:53,567
Thank you.

298
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,233
Thank you.

299
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,400
How about burgers for lunch?

300
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,233
- Sure.
- I'd love to.

301
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:16,166
Yeah?

302
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,500
For burgers, they have...

303
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,133
cheese, Mexican, bacon royale,
salami, and vegan.

304
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,900
Sandwiches are here.

305
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,333
I want a cheeseburger.

306
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,333
- Gosh.
- Cheese.

307
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,266
You?

308
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,900
- What do you want?
- Cheeseburger.

309
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:30,800
Here.

310
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:31,834
Cheeseburger.

311
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,133
- Is it for lunch?
- Yes.

312
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,633
- They have club sandwiches.
- Cheeseburger.

313
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,100
- A cheeseburger?
- Yes.

314
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,233
Five cheeseburgers.

315
00:19:41,767 --> 00:19:42,967
I'm so excited.

316
00:19:56,967 --> 00:19:58,433
Any song request?

317
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,467
I want one with a fast beat.

318
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,967
To speed up your work...

319
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:14,066
Aren't you playing?

320
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,800
Let's speed up as we listen to this.

321
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,066
Okay.

322
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:28,000
What's with him?

323
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,600
Let's speed up.

324
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,133
Great rhythms.

325
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:42,667
Great rhythms.

326
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Seo-jin, can you pour half of this here?

327
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:49,734
- This?
- Be careful.

328
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:50,800
Enough.

329
00:21:50,867 --> 00:21:51,767
Enough.

330
00:22:30,734 --> 00:22:33,600
Mr. Choi, you seem more relaxed
compared to yesterday.

331
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,567
What?

332
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,500
Right.

333
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,133
You're shaking your legs.

334
00:22:40,033 --> 00:22:41,300
Today,

335
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,767
there's less pressure.

336
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:45,700
You were the chef yesterday.

337
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,967
Any messages to the chef of the day?

338
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,533
Well...

339
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,533
Mike Tyson once said this...

340
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,467
I'm listening.

341
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,333
"Everyone has a plan,"

342
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,934
"'until they get punched in the mouth."

343
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:07,266
You know nothing until you get punched.

344
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,834
Yu-mi came to me yesterday.

345
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:15,133
She said the customers were waiting.

346
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,533
I said that?

347
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:21,100
The six customers are starving.

348
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,500
Mr. Park, how did Woo-shik do yesterday?

349
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,000
- Yesterday?
- Yes.

350
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,567
It was a stable debut for him.

351
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,066
His eyes were out of focus, though.

352
00:23:35,467 --> 00:23:38,567
Right. He did weird dances yesterday.

353
00:23:39,033 --> 00:23:40,900
- He did?
- Like this.

354
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:42,433
When we had a lot of orders...

355
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,533
He danced as customers kept rushing in.

356
00:23:49,633 --> 00:23:52,233
You will be shaking today too.

357
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,033
Where did you get this shiitake?

358
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,667
Why is it so huge?

359
00:24:08,767 --> 00:24:10,567
I thought it was a bun.

360
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,300
Buns for hamburgers.

361
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:16,900
It's crazy.

362
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:47,667
You working on it now?

363
00:24:47,767 --> 00:24:49,600
- Yes, vegetable fritters.
- Okay.

364
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,533
The oil is good today.

365
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,900
Just stack them.

366
00:25:18,233 --> 00:25:19,600
Like at the snack bar.

367
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,800
All right.

368
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:44,433
These guys are good.

369
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,033
Right?

370
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,934
How come everyone's so good?

371
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,467
Right?

372
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:54,166
They're so talented.

373
00:25:57,467 --> 00:25:58,633
Can't see her hands.

374
00:25:58,734 --> 00:25:59,633
I can't see.

375
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:02,633
Their jobs require them to focus.

376
00:26:02,734 --> 00:26:04,133
So they're good.

377
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,600
They focus well.

378
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:14,867
Who's chopping?

379
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,233
He's almost like Han Seok-bong's mom.

380
00:26:26,867 --> 00:26:27,767
Gosh.

381
00:26:27,867 --> 00:26:29,000
You're back.

382
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,834
Wanna eat now?

383
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,533
- Let's take a break.
- Okay.

384
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,934
Yu-mi.

385
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,900
I'll have it after this.

386
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,934
Woo-shik, let's eat
after putting the ribs on the stove.

387
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,767
We have no time.

388
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,500
- Then, Min-si.
- Yes.

389
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:54,734
- You should eat.
- Okay.

390
00:26:57,934 --> 00:27:00,066
- I'll eat first.
- Okay, enjoy.

391
00:27:00,767 --> 00:27:03,767
- Enjoy.
- Sure, enjoy.

392
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,700
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

393
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,633
Tired?

394
00:27:10,934 --> 00:27:12,767
No, I'm good.

395
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:17,467
Gosh.

396
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,133
Harder than you thought?

397
00:27:20,967 --> 00:27:21,800
Yes.

398
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:23,000
- Right?
- Yes.

399
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,867
I'm less tired today, though.

400
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,834
Human bodies are adaptable.

401
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:32,900
I think I'm used to it already.

402
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,834
I usually dream a lot.

403
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,033
But I haven't dreamed once here.

404
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:42,900
- You passed out?
- Yes.

405
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:04,767
Here.

406
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:07,633
Thank you.

407
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,066
Kids these days have it with mayonnaise.

408
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:11,934
- Right?
- Yes.

409
00:28:15,367 --> 00:28:16,667
It's delicious.

410
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:26,066
Let's go.

411
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,400
Let me just change the water.

412
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,467
- Isn't it good?
- It's good.

413
00:28:51,834 --> 00:28:53,567
You made a lot of fritters.

414
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:54,934
- Good job.
- Which one?

415
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:55,867
Fritters.

416
00:28:55,967 --> 00:28:58,100
Fritters? I made 30 pieces.

417
00:28:58,166 --> 00:28:59,600
- Like a big pile.
- Right.

418
00:29:17,367 --> 00:29:20,066
It's so much easier with this.

419
00:29:20,166 --> 00:29:21,400
I know.

420
00:29:21,667 --> 00:29:23,233
It doesn't even smell.

421
00:29:23,867 --> 00:29:24,700
Goodness.

422
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,233
We don't need this, do we?

423
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:30,133
It's much easier with this in the kitchen.

424
00:29:38,467 --> 00:29:40,033
- Is this spot okay?
- Yes.

425
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,200
You're doing great.

426
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,200
Thank you.

427
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
- What?
- Thank you.

428
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,367
No problem.

429
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:52,600
I'll get the meat first.

430
00:29:55,166 --> 00:29:57,433
I'll get it with this.

431
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:14,467
Head Chef, good luck.

432
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:16,033
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

433
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,567
See you tonight.

434
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,133
See you.

435
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
Okay.

436
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:21,567
Okay, great.

437
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:30,400
Is this for one person?

438
00:30:30,467 --> 00:30:32,333
No, two. Just in case.

439
00:30:39,033 --> 00:30:40,567
We'll open the restaurant.

440
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,000
One, two, three...

441
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:48,066
Go Jinny's Kitchen!

442
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,066
Anyone out there?

443
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,233
No.

444
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,767
We have a sign outside as well.

445
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,300
Gosh, the queue is long.

446
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,633
- There is a queue?
- Yes.

447
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,166
People are lined up.

448
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:15,200
I see about 15 people lining up.

449
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,100
Would you like to come in?

450
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:54,900
Woo-shik, someone came in, again.

451
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,000
Have you tried Korean food before?

452
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:15,133
It's my first time having
authentic Korean food.

453
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
Can you eat spicy food too?

454
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,133
Not really.

455
00:32:18,233 --> 00:32:20,266
I'll take the spicy one.

456
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:29,633
- Spicy beef galbijjim for me.
- Beef galbijjim?

457
00:33:03,033 --> 00:33:04,433
- First order.
- Okay.

458
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,967
That's one kkori-gomtang, one
dolsot-bibimbap, one spicy beef galbijjim.

459
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,100
My heart is just so full.

460
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,200
What?

461
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:57,400
We have a lot of rice.

462
00:33:57,467 --> 00:33:59,200
Because we have lots of rice?

463
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,734
Kkori-gomtang is coming first.

464
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:12,934
For Table Five.

465
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,467
Yes, this kkori-gomtang.

466
00:34:14,533 --> 00:34:15,834
- Dolsot...
- It's done.

467
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,467
- It's done? Okay.
- It's coming.

468
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:29,500
Should we add sesame oil and seeds here?

469
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,633
Yes, it's better to add them here.

470
00:34:32,066 --> 00:34:34,166
Let's bring some green onions here.

471
00:34:34,233 --> 00:34:35,467
- Okay.
- Okay.

472
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,633
- Green onions.
- Okay.

473
00:34:40,033 --> 00:34:43,200
- I'll leave red chilies here.
- Okay.

474
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,000
- And all toppings here.
- Okay.

475
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,700
- Watch your hand.
- Okay.

476
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,533
Watch your eyes.

477
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,433
Okay!

478
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:01,667
Wait, not yet.

479
00:35:05,066 --> 00:35:06,367
Is spicy galbijjim ready?

480
00:35:06,967 --> 00:35:08,333
She's working on it.

481
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,066
All dishes served for Table Five.

482
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,734
Okay, then spicy beef...

483
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:25,133
- Here.
- Okay.

484
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,734
Kkori-gomtang for Table Five is done.

485
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,633
Bibimbap and galbijjim too.

486
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
- Right?
- Yes.

487
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,100
Kkakdugi for kkori-gomtang.

488
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,500
I'll bring the mustard sauce.

489
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:26,367
Kkori-gomtang and bibimbap?

490
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,066
- Two dolsot-bibimbap?
- Yes.

491
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:39,333
Two beef galbijjim?

492
00:36:56,867 --> 00:36:57,700
Two bowls...

493
00:37:26,467 --> 00:37:28,133
- Table Three is done.
- Right.

494
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Here, fritters.

495
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,500
Green onions come first.

496
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,767
Another bowl of rice for Table Three.

497
00:37:34,533 --> 00:37:36,533
- Table Three.
- All for Table Three.

498
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,433
Okay.

499
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:03,266
I feel really stable

500
00:38:03,367 --> 00:38:05,834
working with Chef Yu-mi today.

501
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,500
I feel at ease.

502
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:09,467
You don't know what will happen.

503
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,333
I love it.

504
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,000
Make sure Woo-shik doesn't hear this.

505
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:15,900
Okay.

506
00:38:20,066 --> 00:38:22,033
They're talking behind your back.

507
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,200
Are these vegetable fritters?

508
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,900
It looks delicious.

509
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,133
Yes, it looks good.

510
00:38:47,233 --> 00:38:49,500
- Is your food good? Mine's good.
- It's good.

511
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,367
They must have prepared it since morning.

512
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,467
Of course.

513
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,100
Right, we didn't wait for long.

514
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:57,834
It came out fast.

515
00:38:57,934 --> 00:38:59,467
It took less time than I thought.

516
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:00,700
Right, that was fast.

517
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:03,066
The rice is so good.

518
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,166
Right.

519
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,633
The rice is well-cooked.

520
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:08,467
The chef must be talented.

521
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:17,900
I don't know how to eat this.

522
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,066
Take a bite.

523
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:36,200
This is really good.

524
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:42,700
I had bibimbap
and seasoned chicken before.

525
00:39:42,767 --> 00:39:45,400
I had tteokbokki and rabokki.

526
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:47,200
I made them at home.

527
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,567
I have kimchi at home.

528
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:55,000
You know bibimbap is classic.

529
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,734
Is it good?

530
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,633
It's really good.

531
00:40:14,633 --> 00:40:16,367
We make it from time to time.

532
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:17,767
I made it twice.

533
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:19,867
It sounds delicious.

534
00:40:19,934 --> 00:40:21,800
I've had some dishes before.

535
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,200
Beef galbijjim.

536
00:40:23,266 --> 00:40:25,600
Spicy...

537
00:40:25,667 --> 00:40:27,100
- Spicy?
- Spicy.

538
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,066
- Spicy.
- Right.

539
00:40:28,133 --> 00:40:30,300
Beef galbijjim, okay.

540
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,133
- Ade.
- What?

541
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,233
- I'll take spicy beef galbijjim.
- Okay.

542
00:40:49,333 --> 00:40:50,600
I'll have beef galbijjim.

543
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,533
Beef galbijjim.

544
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,767
- Omija.
- Omija ade?

545
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,000
Cheers.

546
00:41:30,066 --> 00:41:30,967
Cheers.

547
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,967
Oh, this is good.

548
00:41:36,033 --> 00:41:37,066
This tastes good.

549
00:41:52,734 --> 00:41:53,567
- Yu-mi!
- Yes.

550
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,200
- You're doing great.
- Okay.

551
00:42:27,633 --> 00:42:30,633
Spicy beef galbijjim for Table Four.

552
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:36,533
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

553
00:42:36,633 --> 00:42:37,867
- Photos?
- Photos.

554
00:42:37,934 --> 00:42:39,000
- Photos.
- Okay.

555
00:42:41,367 --> 00:42:43,266
- Give me that small piece.
- Okay.

556
00:42:43,834 --> 00:42:45,900
Yes, you can take this one.

557
00:42:48,367 --> 00:42:49,700
It will get cold.

558
00:43:02,633 --> 00:43:04,033
My food isn't here yet.

559
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:55,233
They ferment it with the seasoning.

560
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:59,900
I'll use my hand.

561
00:44:25,834 --> 00:44:28,266
Yes, little shoe. Scarpetta.

562
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,533
- Right.
- Little shoe.

563
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:44,166
It isn't so busy today.

564
00:44:44,467 --> 00:44:46,800
It isn't busy today.

565
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:41,033
We got seven people.
I'll seat them in the room.

566
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:42,166
- Seven?
- Yes.

567
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:43,567
- More people are here?
- Yes.

568
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:45,233
Bring one more of this.

569
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,266
Seo-jin, hold on.

570
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,900
- Take this. People are here.
- Okay.

571
00:46:37,767 --> 00:46:38,600
- Two people?
- Yes.

572
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:16,333
- We're in trouble.
- What happened?

573
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:17,333
- What?
- Why?

574
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,834
They ordered a lot.

575
00:48:19,734 --> 00:48:20,934
Spicy...

576
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,867
Look, Woo-shik.

577
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,166
There are people waiting.

578
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:25,433
Kkori-gomtang. Hold on.

579
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:26,834
Bibimbap...

580
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:29,266
Beef galbijjim, gosh.

581
00:48:35,667 --> 00:48:37,266
We're done with our job.

582
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:39,667
- Shall we take a break?
- We're done?

583
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,300
Great.

584
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,633
- Gosh!
- This tool...

585
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,133
- Shall we wash it?
- Wait, no.

586
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,567
What's happening?

587
00:48:49,433 --> 00:48:53,266
That's two kkori-gomtang,
two dolsot-bibimbap,

588
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:56,233
Three beef galbijjim.
We can serve them all together.

589
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:16,567
I'll finish this in a bit.

590
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:19,967
I'll heat it when bibimbap's ready.

591
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:21,867
Bibimbap's coming.

592
00:49:22,433 --> 00:49:23,467
Two bowls.

593
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:24,533
Sizzle.

594
00:49:27,266 --> 00:49:28,800
Boil all of them together.

595
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,867
- Boil.
- Boil.

596
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,467
What do I have to do?

597
00:49:43,033 --> 00:49:45,467
- Bibimbap is done.
- Right.

598
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,333
No, not yet.

599
00:49:47,433 --> 00:49:48,433
Come on.

600
00:49:48,867 --> 00:49:50,433
Why are you disturbing me?

601
00:49:58,467 --> 00:50:00,033
Min-si, add green onions.

602
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,033
Green onions.

603
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:02,934
It's over there.

604
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,834
I can serve one after another.

605
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,467
Adding green onions, and fritters now.

606
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,233
Take the fritters.

607
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:12,700
He took the rice.

608
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,166
Gomtang?

609
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,166
- Yes?
- Okay.

610
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:22,867
Okay, done.

611
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:23,800
Okay.

612
00:50:27,867 --> 00:50:29,400
I'll serve the galbijjim.

613
00:50:50,433 --> 00:50:52,133
Beef galbijjim.

614
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,166
- "Beef galbijjim".
- Yes.

615
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,400
We're done.

616
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,200
- Chef Yu-mi, we're done.
- Great!

617
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:25,633
I can drink water today.

618
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:27,367
Have you had water?

619
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:30,834
No, I don't want to go to the bathroom.

620
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,633
That didn't cross my mind.

621
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:38,433
I have to use the bathroom a lot.

622
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:47,900
What happened?

623
00:51:47,967 --> 00:51:49,900
- There are many people.
- We got more?

624
00:51:49,967 --> 00:51:51,367
There are many people.

625
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:53,400
Gosh, I thought more people came.

626
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,667
Gosh, this tastes amazing.

627
00:52:03,266 --> 00:52:04,467
It's so refreshing.

628
00:52:22,567 --> 00:52:23,967
It's slippery here.

629
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,266
They're making dessert now.

630
00:53:07,867 --> 00:53:08,767
It's good.

631
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,834
Rice crispy is nice.

632
00:54:18,834 --> 00:54:22,433
- Did you take more customers?
- No, we have to get ready first.

633
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:26,767
Seo-jun. Here's what.

634
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:28,533
The customers with a baby...

635
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,934
Let them sit here.

636
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:30,867
Okay.

637
00:54:40,166 --> 00:54:42,934
Let me get a new bucket of yakgochujang.

638
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,533
You're ordering that?

639
00:55:45,033 --> 00:55:46,667
Bibimbap and kkori-gomtang.

640
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:48,233
- One each?
- Yes, one each.

641
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,567
Bibimbap and gomtang?

642
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:50,800
Finally!

643
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:53,333
- Kkori-gomtang.
- Finally.

644
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,633
These three dishes can go together.

645
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,200
Okay.

646
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:14,800
I'll turn off the heat.

647
00:56:28,033 --> 00:56:30,367
This is well-cooked. Look.

648
00:56:31,233 --> 00:56:32,333
Goodness.

649
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,033
Speed up.

650
00:56:34,133 --> 00:56:35,600
- Speed up.
- I'm done.

651
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:36,600
Speed up.

652
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:50,300
Yu-mi. You're doing great.

653
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,934
She's the best.

654
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,967
Goodness.

655
00:56:54,433 --> 00:56:56,367
She surely is experienced.

656
00:56:57,266 --> 00:56:58,600
We're done.

657
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:00,734
Bibimbap is coming.

658
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,000
It comes with kkori-gomtang.

659
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,166
Why do you cook so fast?

660
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:08,867
Take your time.

661
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,467
How are we doing?

662
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:12,367
You guys are amazing.

663
00:57:18,166 --> 00:57:19,066
It's hot.

664
00:57:20,467 --> 00:57:21,400
Go outside.

665
00:57:22,533 --> 00:57:23,633
You should go out.

666
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:25,333
- Like this?
- No, you go out.

667
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,333
- Me?
- Yes.

668
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:27,700
Give them this.

669
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:29,700
Go!

670
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:31,033
Go, Min-si.

671
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,333
Go, Min-si.

672
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:41,333
What? You want to serve?

673
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,800
You two can serve together.

674
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,433
- You okay?
- Okay. Let's go.

675
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,066
Go, go.

676
00:57:46,133 --> 00:57:47,133
Oh, gosh.

677
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:56,533
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

678
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,700
The space isn't enough...

679
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
A baby is here?

680
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,200
- Yes.
- What did they order?

681
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:42,834
They just sat.

682
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,433
- They ordered.
- Ordered what?

683
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,533
Kkori-gomtang.

684
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:56,734
I can't believe this.

685
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,867
The baby is so cute.

686
00:58:59,934 --> 00:59:02,133
She's so cute. She's in a big...

687
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:05,533
She can't have kkori-gomtang.

688
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:10,300
It's savory.

689
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:20,667
It's softly boiled.

690
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:23,200
I love it. It's very soft.

691
00:59:29,867 --> 00:59:31,667
The oxtail is soft.

692
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:37,300
Look, you perfectly deboned it.

693
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,800
It's perfectly deboned.

694
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,166
It's boiled for a long time.

695
01:00:02,567 --> 01:00:03,867
I'm mixing it.

696
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:04,767
Mix it.

697
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:06,367
Hurry, I want to eat.

698
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:08,667
The rice is already mixed.

699
01:00:08,734 --> 01:00:09,667
Is it?

700
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:11,900
It's mixed with gochujang.

701
01:00:16,233 --> 01:00:18,800
This is all meat.

702
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:25,600
It's well-seasoned.

703
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:33,533
- Isn't it spicy?
- It's spicy.

704
01:00:34,867 --> 01:00:36,200
That's why it's tasty.

705
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,834
We finished everything.

706
01:00:43,633 --> 01:00:45,033
Isn't the baby so cute?

707
01:00:45,834 --> 01:00:46,934
She's like a doll.

708
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:48,500
She's so cute.

709
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,834
Just like a doll.

710
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,967
Your baby is so cute.

711
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,600
Assa. Say, "Hi."

712
01:01:42,533 --> 01:01:43,867
She's so cute.

713
01:01:46,934 --> 01:01:49,100
The baby is so cute.

714
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:51,767
- The five-year-old?
- Yes.

715
01:01:52,433 --> 01:01:55,000
A five-year-old? I saw an infant.

716
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,333
- I haven't seen a five-year-old.
- Five months.

717
01:01:57,900 --> 01:01:59,166
Seven months old.

718
01:01:59,233 --> 01:02:00,867
Right, seven months old.

719
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:05,133
She's so hungry.
Her spoon is in her mouth already.

720
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,500
Oh, that's cute.

721
01:02:12,567 --> 01:02:13,934
It's for that table.

722
01:02:14,333 --> 01:02:15,900
- Beef galbijjim?
- Here.

723
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,367
- Will it come now?
- Yes.

724
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,333
Bibimbap will be ready too.

725
01:02:23,533 --> 01:02:25,000
Bibimbap is ready.

726
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:26,333
Here, Woo-shik.

727
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:27,567
Okay.

728
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:30,600
- Scoop the rice.
- Okay.

729
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:33,100
I'll scoop it. You can do this.

730
01:02:47,367 --> 01:02:48,567
Is that for us?

731
01:02:52,867 --> 01:02:54,967
- Beef galbijjim.
- Thank you.

732
01:03:12,967 --> 01:03:14,834
Vegetable fritters are good.

733
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,533
I haven't tried them yet.

734
01:03:20,333 --> 01:03:23,767
Do you want to try?
Should I taste it to see if it's spicy?

735
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,166
It's not that spicy.

736
01:03:29,233 --> 01:03:30,300
Is it good?

737
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,400
It's a bit spicy for me.

738
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:38,667
This is good.

739
01:03:38,734 --> 01:03:39,700
Right.

740
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:44,233
- It's good.
- Tasty, yes?

741
01:03:46,834 --> 01:03:47,700
It's good.

742
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:48,900
I'll have a piece.

743
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,667
Do you want it?

744
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:07,700
No, you have it.

745
01:05:28,533 --> 01:05:29,834
Best birthday ever?

746
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,567
Best birthday ever.

747
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:27,934
I forgot to charge one kkori-gomtang.

748
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:29,533
I missed it from the group.

749
01:06:30,166 --> 01:06:31,734
You can't do that.

750
01:06:32,834 --> 01:06:34,367
It's really confusing.

751
01:06:36,333 --> 01:06:38,300
You can't do that, Seo-jin.

752
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,266
- It's really confusing.
- Gosh.

753
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:42,100
You can't do this.

754
01:06:42,734 --> 01:06:43,567
My gosh.

755
01:06:43,667 --> 01:06:45,000
He missed one payment.

756
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:46,266
It's just like...

757
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,467
- Like 2,000 won.
- What?

758
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,333
About 23,000 won.

759
01:06:56,934 --> 01:06:58,467
Why? Because of the split?

760
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:00,166
Yes. It's really confusing.

761
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:02,066
I missed that one payment.

762
01:07:03,066 --> 01:07:04,533
Do I have to press this?

763
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:10,600
- Did you hear?
- What?

764
01:07:10,667 --> 01:07:12,467
- The group.
- Yes?

765
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:14,100
We missed about 20,000 won.

766
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,667
- Oh, no.
- It's all because of Seo-jin.

767
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:17,967
This is annoying.

768
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:19,867
We've been working since morning.

769
01:07:21,533 --> 01:07:24,433
I only got the half of the payment
for kkori-gomtang.

770
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,200
They don't leave food at all.

771
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,200
Goodness!

772
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,367
They finished it all.

773
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:39,467
There's none here.

774
01:07:39,567 --> 01:07:41,934
- They finished kimchi too.
- That's good.

775
01:07:43,066 --> 01:07:43,900
I mean...

776
01:07:47,233 --> 01:07:48,700
What did he mix it with?

777
01:07:48,767 --> 01:07:50,433
I have no idea what he had.

778
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't know what he had.

779
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:55,066
There's nothing to wash today.

780
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:02,734
She can't see up.

781
01:08:25,133 --> 01:08:27,333
We're running out of bibimbap ingredients.

782
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:30,700
We're running out of carrots and all.

783
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:33,934
We have to cook more rice too.

784
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,567
I cooked a lot of rice though.

785
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,967
We have about four portions.

786
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:39,633
No potatoes either.

787
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:43,266
We should go buy groceries.

788
01:08:43,934 --> 01:08:44,934
Will you two go?

789
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,033
- Sure.
- Okay.

790
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:48,000
Want to see snowy mountains?

791
01:08:51,533 --> 01:08:52,633
We have to go now.

792
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:53,800
I know. Go.

793
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,700
It's pretty here.

794
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:04,166
Now it feels like I'm in Iceland.

795
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:09,266
I see a lot of people inside.

796
01:10:10,166 --> 01:10:13,133
It's amazing to see so many people here.

797
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,300
That's 20 kilos.

798
01:10:28,867 --> 01:10:30,367
This is the perfect meat.

799
01:10:31,033 --> 01:10:32,967
- What about ribs?
- At the bottom.

800
01:10:33,233 --> 01:10:35,033
- What?
- Ribs are at the bottom.

801
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:38,633
You're right.

802
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,867
We should take the whole box.

803
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,100
Put them over there.

804
01:11:38,533 --> 01:11:40,900
Is he opening the pear juice again?

805
01:11:56,367 --> 01:11:57,433
Garlic and onions.

806
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:35,767
It's starting to boil.

807
01:12:35,834 --> 01:12:37,133
It is hot.

808
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,367
I'll leave it for ten minutes.

809
01:13:04,734 --> 01:13:06,200
We have a lot of zucchinis.

810
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:09,066
One, two, three, four.

811
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,533
We should make
40 vegetable fritters this time.

812
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:15,734
Forty pieces, okay.

813
01:14:09,633 --> 01:14:11,967
Ms. Jung, do I use all of these onions?

814
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,300
- You can use them all.
- Okay.

815
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,633
- That sounded natural.
- I know.

816
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:20,700
I was wondering who Ms. Jung was.

817
01:14:21,266 --> 01:14:23,900
I knew she was talking to me.

818
01:14:24,633 --> 01:14:26,266
I call her Yu-mi outside.

819
01:14:26,333 --> 01:14:28,400
She's Ms. Jung in the kitchen.

820
01:14:28,967 --> 01:14:31,166
Because the kitchen is a work place.

821
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,400
I'll stir-fry them now.

822
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,133
- You done peeling onions?
- What?

823
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,467
You done with onions?

824
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:11,700
Seo-jin.

825
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:25,834
Should I chop these?

826
01:15:26,033 --> 01:15:27,467
Yes, like this.

827
01:15:41,133 --> 01:15:42,066
Seo-jin.

828
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:43,800
He's crying.

829
01:15:43,867 --> 01:15:45,600
I'll set up the room.

830
01:15:45,667 --> 01:15:46,900
Okay.

831
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:53,200
Two pairs of chopsticks.

832
01:15:53,266 --> 01:15:54,100
Two pairs?

833
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:55,033
Yes.

834
01:16:06,533 --> 01:16:08,867
We can use them tomorrow.

835
01:16:13,567 --> 01:16:14,700
We're ready.

836
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:16,767
It has to boil.

837
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,400
Please remove these impurities.

838
01:16:31,867 --> 01:16:33,300
- Can anyone help?
- I can.

839
01:16:33,367 --> 01:16:35,266
- Yes, this.
- You can help?

840
01:16:35,333 --> 01:16:36,367
Yes.

841
01:16:36,433 --> 01:16:39,600
You see the pink foam on top?

842
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:40,867
- Yes.
- You do this.

843
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,533
Remove the pink foam.

844
01:16:43,934 --> 01:16:45,467
- You see this?
- Yes.

845
01:16:45,533 --> 01:16:47,500
Okay, I'll leave now.

846
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,767
Yes. But one person can't make it.

847
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:38,600
- Seo-jun.
- Yes?

848
01:19:38,667 --> 01:19:40,200
- We need you outside.
- Why?

849
01:19:40,533 --> 01:19:43,567
- I think you should get the customers.
- What?

850
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:44,467
I'll cut it.

851
01:19:45,066 --> 01:19:46,800
We have too many customers.

852
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:48,533
Too many...

853
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:50,500
Too many customers.

854
01:19:50,567 --> 01:19:51,734
- Too many?
- Yes.

855
01:19:54,467 --> 01:19:57,600
We have two people who walked in.

856
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,166
- Two people walked in?
- Yes.

857
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:06,633
And next?

858
01:20:13,867 --> 01:20:15,233
What's going on?

859
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,500
- I'm going to Barcelona tomorrow.
- Right.

860
01:21:22,567 --> 01:21:26,433
I'm here with my in-laws

861
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:28,400
- and my boyfriend.
- Right.

862
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:29,700
We're going to wait.

863
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,400
How can they all rush in at six?

864
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:45,100
How many are here?

865
01:21:48,266 --> 01:21:49,633
We shouldn't take reservations.

866
01:21:50,433 --> 01:21:52,767
I have to return my mom if she's here.

867
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:24,033
Oh, gosh.

868
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,800
There are so many people!

869
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:31,300
What do we do now?

870
01:22:34,967 --> 01:22:36,700
I took the four people to their seats.

871
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:38,500
- You did?
- Yes.

872
01:22:38,567 --> 01:22:39,467
I told them.

873
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,767
Four people are seated?

874
01:22:42,467 --> 01:22:43,934
I have to work on bibimbap then.

875
01:22:44,834 --> 01:22:46,433
Why does the foam keep coming up?

876
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,967
- That's the seasoning.
- I see.

877
01:22:49,033 --> 01:22:51,066
I'll work on bibimbap now then.

878
01:22:51,133 --> 01:22:52,500
Should I cover the lid?

879
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:54,367
- Cover it half.
- Half would do.

880
01:22:57,867 --> 01:22:58,900
Gosh.

881
01:23:04,533 --> 01:23:05,367
The rice...

882
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:08,633
It's so deep down there.

883
01:23:09,467 --> 01:23:10,367
- Seo-jun.
- Yes?

884
01:23:10,433 --> 01:23:12,333
- Help Min-si.
- With what?

885
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:20,800
My elbow actually hurts.

886
01:23:23,667 --> 01:23:25,066
I'll do it. What is it?

887
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:27,967
I have to mix it once.
But the rice is so much.

888
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:32,066
I used the scissors so much,

889
01:23:32,467 --> 01:23:34,000
my arm hurts too.

890
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:38,533
This rice...

891
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:40,633
Give me a shovel.

892
01:23:42,633 --> 01:23:44,367
- Should I take it out?
- Yes.

893
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:45,934
For about...

894
01:23:46,467 --> 01:23:48,066
For three portions.

895
01:23:50,133 --> 01:23:51,367
- Three portions.
- Thanks.

896
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:52,800
- Okay.
- Great.

897
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:54,433
- Great.
- Nice.

898
01:24:18,433 --> 01:24:19,800
I'm removing the potatoes.

899
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:23,767
Galbijjim is ready.

900
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,567
Look. I was worried yesterday.

901
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,467
I couldn't even sleep.

902
01:24:29,033 --> 01:24:29,867
I told Min-si,

903
01:24:29,934 --> 01:24:32,667
"It's going to be morning
when I open my eyes."

904
01:24:32,867 --> 01:24:35,233
- That's what I said.
- You're doing great.

905
01:24:52,734 --> 01:24:54,400
Let's go. We can do this.

906
01:24:54,734 --> 01:24:55,567
It's tiring.

907
01:24:55,934 --> 01:24:56,767
But I love it.

908
01:24:57,867 --> 01:24:59,700
- What time is it?
- It's 6:00 pm.

909
01:24:59,767 --> 01:25:01,500
6:00 pm? Okay.

910
01:25:15,367 --> 01:25:17,266
- We're lucky we got seats.
- Right.

911
01:25:17,333 --> 01:25:19,533
We were the last ones to be seated.

912
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:24,767
I didn't know people queued up here.

913
01:25:25,934 --> 01:25:27,200
I can't believe this.

914
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,834
- I've never been here.
- Me neither.

915
01:25:32,166 --> 01:25:33,333
It's really cozy.

916
01:25:35,066 --> 01:25:37,300
- You should use this.
- What?

917
01:25:37,367 --> 01:25:38,433
Use this glass.

918
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,867
Do you want to change it?

919
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,433
I have to use that glass.

920
01:25:41,533 --> 01:25:43,300
I want a normal one.

921
01:25:46,533 --> 01:25:47,734
Matching colors.

922
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:51,000
Pink and blue.

923
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:53,767
I should have taken drinks first.

924
01:25:53,834 --> 01:25:54,900
- What?
- Drinks.

925
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:56,600
Should I get the drinks?

926
01:26:22,633 --> 01:26:24,100
I'll just get beer.

927
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:29,400
- Has anyone taken yours?
- What?

928
01:26:29,467 --> 01:26:31,433
Has anyone taken your order?

929
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:32,633
No, not yet.

930
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:33,934
You haven't ordered yet.

931
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
No, not yet.

932
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,266
One omija tea.

933
01:26:40,333 --> 01:26:41,834
- One omija tea.
- Yes.

934
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,633
They have soju here.

935
01:26:55,367 --> 01:26:58,900
I'll order soju and beer. I'll mix them.

936
01:26:59,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Please take that off.

937
01:27:01,567 --> 01:27:02,600
Take off?

938
01:27:03,233 --> 01:27:05,433
It's not polite to wear a hat inside.

939
01:28:10,066 --> 01:28:10,900
What did they order?

940
01:28:10,967 --> 01:28:14,266
One yuzu tea, two omija teas,
and one beer.

941
01:28:21,734 --> 01:28:24,567
OMIJA TEA

942
01:28:29,266 --> 01:28:31,900
YUZU TEA

943
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,667
- For the waiting team?
- Yes.

944
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:45,867
What's this good for?

945
01:28:45,967 --> 01:28:48,066
It's invigorating and helps digest.

946
01:28:55,867 --> 01:28:56,967
This is good.

947
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,233
- Tea?
- Thank you.

948
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:19,633
Enjoy.

949
01:29:24,467 --> 01:29:25,500
Gosh.

950
01:29:29,533 --> 01:29:31,700
In Iceland? Just until Monday.

951
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,300
But why Iceland?

952
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:08,934
I'm worried about my allergy.

953
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:12,433
I like...

954
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:16,834
I like how they have vegan options.

955
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:20,834
I wish I could have that.

956
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,333
The rest of the menu has beef.

957
01:31:44,767 --> 01:31:46,500
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

958
01:31:59,133 --> 01:32:01,900
I want one dolsot-bibimbap.

959
01:33:30,734 --> 01:33:32,433
Bibimbap is done.

960
01:33:32,533 --> 01:33:33,400
Ta-da.

961
01:33:34,433 --> 01:33:36,000
The first meal for dinner.

962
01:33:37,033 --> 01:33:38,066
I'll wash the dishes.

963
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,667
Actually, no.

964
01:33:39,767 --> 01:33:40,834
Not the dishes.

965
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:45,266
I'll get ready with rice.

966
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,500
I got red chilies and green chilies.

967
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:48,567
Done, done.

968
01:33:48,633 --> 01:33:49,700
Yakgochujang is ready.

969
01:33:49,767 --> 01:33:51,266
I'll put rice here.

970
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:52,734
This is beef galbijjim.

971
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:54,934
Spicy one on the white plate.

972
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:57,033
I'll wash the dishes now.

973
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,500
Dolsot.

974
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:00,700
- Dolsot?
- One dolsot.

975
01:34:00,767 --> 01:34:01,834
- One bibimbap?
- Yes.

976
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:06,567
It's just one customer. Serve right away.

977
01:34:06,633 --> 01:34:07,600
Okay.

978
01:34:08,033 --> 01:34:09,667
I'll turn on the heat.

979
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,700
Where did the little chair go?

980
01:34:29,967 --> 01:34:30,967
- Yu-mi.
- Yes?

981
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:37,033
So...

982
01:34:38,433 --> 01:34:39,734
One with no spice.

983
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,100
- Right.
- One with little spice.

984
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:46,800
Beef galbijjim.

985
01:34:47,734 --> 01:34:49,200
I can do that.

986
01:35:08,367 --> 01:35:09,500
Dolsot on the way.

987
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:17,467
This is for that one lady.

988
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:19,033
We can keep going.

989
01:35:19,100 --> 01:35:20,000
Okay.

990
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,800
I'll re-fry these.

991
01:36:06,667 --> 01:36:08,033
For Table One.

992
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:11,266
- Okay.
- Okay.

993
01:36:25,967 --> 01:36:27,400
I can't wait any longer.

994
01:36:28,734 --> 01:36:29,667
Cheers.

995
01:36:53,967 --> 01:36:55,100
Are you ready?

996
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,166
I see.

997
01:39:32,533 --> 01:39:33,600
It looks good.

998
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:36,934
The sound...

999
01:40:49,433 --> 01:40:50,433
Is it good?

1000
01:40:51,433 --> 01:40:53,166
It's so good.

1001
01:40:53,233 --> 01:40:54,266
Right.

1002
01:41:03,066 --> 01:41:04,667
Is it good?

1003
01:41:14,033 --> 01:41:15,400
Isn't it good?

1004
01:41:17,834 --> 01:41:18,800
More.

1005
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:19,934
I want more.

1006
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,900
Seo-jun. Give them forks and knives.

1007
01:41:39,667 --> 01:41:41,567
Thank you for not saying a word.

1008
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,834
Sorry, I didn't know.

1009
01:41:57,967 --> 01:41:59,033
Do you...

1010
01:41:59,100 --> 01:42:00,433
Do you want a drink?

1011
01:42:01,734 --> 01:42:03,567
Wait. I need to put this again.

1012
01:42:32,734 --> 01:42:34,100
Skal.

1013
01:42:34,166 --> 01:42:35,800
- Skal?
- Skal.

1014
01:42:42,867 --> 01:42:45,033
- I'll remove it for Table One.
- Okay.

1015
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:48,000
- And...
- You can keep making bibimbap.

1016
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,266
We should serve three of them together.

1017
01:42:55,333 --> 01:42:57,266
- One with less spice.
- Yes.

1018
01:42:57,333 --> 01:42:58,867
You need to make four bibimbap.

1019
01:42:59,367 --> 01:43:01,934
I'll make the original ones first.

1020
01:43:07,033 --> 01:43:08,867
This is all done.

1021
01:43:08,934 --> 01:43:10,333
This is original.

1022
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:14,133
These are all original ones.

1023
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:16,500
I can make one with less spice.

1024
01:43:33,467 --> 01:43:35,867
I can make the one with less spice.

1025
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,400
The one with less spice is done.

1026
01:43:49,867 --> 01:43:51,367
The order is different.

1027
01:43:51,433 --> 01:43:53,100
This has mushroom in the middle.

1028
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:08,400
- These can go together.
- Okay.

1029
01:44:10,867 --> 01:44:12,166
- It's done.
- Okay.

1030
01:44:15,834 --> 01:44:17,667
- This is really good.
- Good.

1031
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:22,834
- It's all here.
- Nice.

1032
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:25,000
- All at once.
- Yes.

1033
01:44:25,066 --> 01:44:27,800
- All coming together.
- Okay.

1034
01:44:28,233 --> 01:44:29,667
They were all prepared quickly.

1035
01:44:44,633 --> 01:44:46,066
What's the percentage?

1036
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:48,533
Yes, it's 20.1 percent.

1037
01:44:48,600 --> 01:44:51,133
He wanted to tell us
that it has no fragrance.

1038
01:44:53,767 --> 01:44:55,700
- Isn't it regular soju?
- It is.

1039
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:01,900
This glass is cute.

1040
01:45:03,667 --> 01:45:05,433
The face is red.

1041
01:45:07,133 --> 01:45:09,567
It has colors on the face.

1042
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:17,834
This is fun.

1043
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:00,333
Your rice is so white.

1044
01:46:03,767 --> 01:46:05,700
It's sizzling.

1045
01:46:11,633 --> 01:46:14,033
This is really good.

1046
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:16,533
Your rice is so white.

1047
01:46:17,266 --> 01:46:19,200
I mean...

1048
01:46:19,266 --> 01:46:22,700
They gave me white rice and soy sauce.

1049
01:46:36,767 --> 01:46:38,500
I've never had kimchi before.

1050
01:46:38,734 --> 01:46:40,200
No kimchi?

1051
01:46:40,266 --> 01:46:41,767
Do you put this here too?

1052
01:46:48,433 --> 01:46:49,734
This kimchi is really good.

1053
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:51,700
Kimchi is the best.

1054
01:46:51,767 --> 01:46:53,100
My goodness.

1055
01:46:53,166 --> 01:46:55,066
I didn't know it tasted so good.

1056
01:47:02,600 --> 01:47:04,000
Kimchi is tasty.

1057
01:47:04,100 --> 01:47:05,066
It's good.

1058
01:47:05,967 --> 01:47:07,300
It's a bit spicy.

1059
01:47:11,900 --> 01:47:13,400
But it still tastes good.

1060
01:47:13,467 --> 01:47:14,900
My makeup is coming off.

1061
01:47:26,934 --> 01:47:30,467
I thought kimchi fried rice I made
at home was good.

1062
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,500
It's a bit disappointing.

1063
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:39,467
I can't have this delicious food again.

1064
01:48:37,300 --> 01:48:39,066
All I care about is money now.

1065
01:48:39,166 --> 01:48:40,133
We have more orders.

1066
01:48:40,200 --> 01:48:41,734
Two more orders.

1067
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:43,200
We can take time.

1068
01:48:43,734 --> 01:48:45,900
Use a ladle. It's how I stir it.

1069
01:48:45,967 --> 01:48:47,667
I don't care about anything else.

1070
01:48:53,033 --> 01:48:55,166
The dishes are served quickly.

1071
01:48:55,233 --> 01:48:56,100
Oh, fritters.

1072
01:48:56,166 --> 01:48:58,033
Vegetable fritters coming.

1073
01:48:58,734 --> 01:49:00,367
That girl...

1074
01:49:00,734 --> 01:49:03,066
I finally met a talented intern
after four years.

1075
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,266
- Min-si.
- Yes?

1076
01:49:05,367 --> 01:49:07,200
Should we stay here one more week?

1077
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,667
It's all in one shot. You only live once.

1078
01:49:22,834 --> 01:49:25,867
I didn't have time to fix my hair.

1079
01:49:28,233 --> 01:49:30,600
We're backed up by drinks.

1080
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:36,533
- We need ice cream.
- Again?

1081
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,800
Hurry.

1082
01:49:39,233 --> 01:49:40,834
Four desserts for Table Three.

1083
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:41,900
Gosh, what's going on?

1084
01:49:41,967 --> 01:49:45,266
Nobody taking orders,
nobody serving drinks...

1085
01:49:45,333 --> 01:49:46,934
What is this? Table Two?

1086
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:48,300
I'll make it.

1087
01:49:48,367 --> 01:49:49,500
How come they're eating?

1088
01:49:49,567 --> 01:49:51,433
I said it was for Table Three.

1089
01:49:52,066 --> 01:49:53,734
- Seo-jin, wait.
- What?

1090
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:55,233
- We need to clarify things.
- What?

1091
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,233
You served the wrong drinks for Table Two.

1092
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,800
I'm sorry, my bad.

1093
01:49:58,867 --> 01:50:00,333
Please forgive me.

1094
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:01,600
It's all mixed up now.

1095
01:50:02,700 --> 01:50:04,533
We better change it to "Closed."

1096
01:50:07,033 --> 01:50:09,400
You can all get licenses in Korea now.

1097
01:50:10,533 --> 01:50:11,600
Right?

1098
01:50:11,667 --> 01:50:13,367
- You know...
- Is it hard?

1099
01:50:13,433 --> 01:50:15,633
You have to make time for it.

1100
01:50:15,700 --> 01:50:16,967
It takes a few weeks.

1101
01:50:17,033 --> 01:50:19,333
You have to take a class for it.

1102
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:21,033
Starting with basic things,

1103
