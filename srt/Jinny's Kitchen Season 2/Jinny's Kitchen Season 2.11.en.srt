00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,200
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,467 --> 00:00:20,367
Let's open it now.

3
00:00:20,433 --> 00:00:21,667
- Okay.
- Okay.

4
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:31,200
Just trust me, okay?

5
00:00:31,266 --> 00:00:33,600
- Min-si, gomtang can go first.
- Gomtang, okay.

6
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,133
"The customer is king."

7
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,500
Oh, it's here. It's right here.

8
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:46,400
Amazing.

9
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:49,467
Are you okay?

10
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:50,500
I'm good.

11
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,367
- Goodness.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:58,533 --> 00:01:00,333
Let's go, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,233
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

14
00:01:12,734 --> 00:01:14,400
Ttukbaegi bulgogi is ready.

15
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,567
- I'll leave it here.
- Okay.

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,533
They'll come in like a train.

17
00:01:38,834 --> 00:01:40,000
Cheer up.

18
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,867
It's arginine.

19
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:43,867
Thank you, ma'am.

20
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,834
- Did you have the arginine?
- Yes.

21
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,033
The train will come.

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,500
- You can leave it here. Train?
- Yes, the train.

23
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,400
- Part-timer.
- Give them to me.

24
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,033
So it's really like a train.

25
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,667
- Here.
- Yes.

26
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,133
- Extra clean, please.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:02:20,567 --> 00:02:22,967
- Please have these cleaned too.
- Yes!

28
00:02:23,033 --> 00:02:24,166
I'll put them here.

29
00:02:35,233 --> 00:02:36,300
All right, Ms. Ko.

30
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,533
- Thank you.
- Here.

31
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,533
It's shiny.

32
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,000
- Your wok.
- Thank you so much.

33
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:44,934
Where's the kimchi container?

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,300
Here you go.

35
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,533
Oh, thank you.

36
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:53,300
Where's the kimchi container?

37
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,934
Here you go.

38
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,500
Oh, thank you.

39
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,800
Yu-mi, be careful what you say.

40
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,166
I was telling Woo-shik.

41
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,467
Because Mr. Lee is here,

42
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:12,200
it's very lively here.

43
00:03:22,734 --> 00:03:24,633
I'll sit on this red chair.

44
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,266
This is my favorite color.

45
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,400
- Okay.
- I'll sit with you.

46
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:02,000
You know something?

47
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:07,767
I was looking for Korean food
at the airport when I arrived here.

48
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,266
But I couldn't find any.

49
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,800
But we are here now.

50
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:14,500
They serve real Korean food
cooked by real Koreans.

51
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,600
Oh, zucchini...

52
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,633
I have to work on more zucchinis.

53
00:04:35,767 --> 00:04:38,266
Wait, I have to prep... Hold on.

54
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
Unbelievable.

55
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,800
I have to work on the zucchinis again.

56
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:55,133
I really don't see any.

57
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,533
I really don't.

58
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,066
We have to stir-fry them too.

59
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,100
Right.

60
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,600
But it won't take long.

61
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:22,433
I think three should be enough.

62
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,333
Yes.

63
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,700
What? I want to have this.

64
00:06:29,066 --> 00:06:30,767
What? It's soju.

65
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:32,567
Are you having soju?

66
00:06:32,633 --> 00:06:33,834
Yes, let's drink it.

67
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,633
I'll get drunk tonight.

68
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,967
Let's call them when they're not busy.

69
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:41,100
- What?
- They seem very busy now.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,133
They are busy.

71
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:48,066
They are.

72
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:50,400
Let's order.

73
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,567
Oh, not yet...

74
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,900
- Is he making your drink?
- I think so.

75
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,533
Look, those are our drinks.

76
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,834
You are getting juice.

77
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:41,667
Great, we're getting juice.

78
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,600
The color is so pretty.

79
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:45,467
Are you ready to look at it?

80
00:08:05,734 --> 00:08:07,300
Can I stir it?

81
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,500
Do you want to try mine?

82
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:16,433
Yes.

83
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:18,700
This isn't sweet.

84
00:08:22,633 --> 00:08:24,133
And try this too.

85
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,233
- Which one is better?
- This is better.

86
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,567
This is better? Okay.

87
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,734
It's the same color as your nails.

88
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:49,133
This is the same color as my nail polish.

89
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,567
- This is my favorite color.
- Okay.

90
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:12,967
I think this color changes every time.

91
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,066
- Oh, really?
- At different temperatures.

92
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,867
That's what I heard.

93
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:19,533
I don't know.

94
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,467
Let me try it.

95
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,567
That's a cute glass.

96
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,433
What?

97
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:27,033
Look at the face.

98
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,934
Right?

99
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,133
Orders.

100
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,600
Orders.

101
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,367
Here, orders.

102
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:37,600
Orders.

103
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:41,800
One sundubu and one yukjeon bibim-guksu.

104
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,266
One ttukbaegi bulgogi.

105
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,533
New order. One kkori-gomtang.

106
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,533
One bibimbap and one sundubu.

107
00:09:49,934 --> 00:09:51,633
Okay, previous orders first.

108
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,734
Table One first.

109
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,400
- Mr. Lee.
- Yes.

110
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,767
We're out of bowls.

111
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:52,967
They are coming.

112
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,066
- Thank you for your service.
- My pleasure.

113
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,967
Are you doing okay over there?

114
00:11:00,867 --> 00:11:01,934
It's so busy here.

115
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,834
Yes, right.

116
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,734
They are ordering so many bowls
of gomtang.

117
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,166
Ttukbaegi!

118
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,767
Yes, it's coming.

119
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,033
Sundubu is ready.

120
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,467
It'll be ready soon.

121
00:11:29,533 --> 00:11:30,934
Gomtang for Table Three.

122
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,467
- Table One.
- Okay.

123
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,333
- This is for Table Two.
- What?

124
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,867
All dishes for Table Two are done.

125
00:11:46,934 --> 00:11:48,367
- Did they order three?
- Yes.

126
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:51,033
- Please help me with Table One.
- What?

127
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,800
The baby and his toy...

128
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,934
- That's the kid's.
- Is it?

129
00:12:09,033 --> 00:12:10,033
It's really hot.

130
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,633
It looks good. It smells good too.

131
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:26,934
Woo-shik, this too.

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,834
It's hot.

133
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,133
It's very nice.

134
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,600
I should let it cool.

135
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,900
You can eat the meat with rice.

136
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:48,500
Oh, there are glass noodles at the bottom.

137
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,266
Wow! Goodness.

138
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,600
The noodles are amazing.

139
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,000
This is very tasty too.
The meat is grilled with eggs.

140
00:13:07,934 --> 00:13:09,133
Can I try one?

141
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,033
Sure.

142
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,533
These noodles are cold.

143
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:13,100
They are?

144
00:13:13,867 --> 00:13:15,367
But it's delicious.

145
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,233
- Is this good?
- It's really good.

146
00:13:24,066 --> 00:13:26,400
This tofu is great.

147
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,600
Can I try your tofu?

148
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,867
It's so good.

149
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,333
I like having food like this.

150
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:42,700
- This must be some sort of tofu.
- Right.

151
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:49,433
- It's not that spicy.
- Right.

152
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,834
I think it has some fish broth.

153
00:13:52,934 --> 00:13:54,767
- Right.
- Is that fish broth?

154
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,133
It's time to have a bite.

155
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:09,100
Is it good?

156
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,500
It's really good.

157
00:14:10,567 --> 00:14:12,000
Is it really good? Okay.

158
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:23,600
It's good.

159
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,700
Were you hungry?

160
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
We were out for quite long.

161
00:14:30,266 --> 00:14:31,166
It's delicious!

162
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,834
Want some soup on the rice?

163
00:14:35,367 --> 00:14:38,033
Yes, please put some here.

164
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,767
Put some more. More!

165
00:14:41,734 --> 00:14:43,400
That must be very delicious.

166
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,800
Try it.

167
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:49,667
This is a lot of rice.

168
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,600
Try using chopsticks.

169
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,033
Look.

170
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:10,433
Okay.

171
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:15,000
I can use chopsticks like this.

172
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:16,734
What?

173
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:28,100
Well done. You're good with chopsticks.

174
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:29,000
Right.

175
00:15:29,433 --> 00:15:32,200
Are you actually using the chopsticks?
Like Mom and Dad?

176
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,667
That's cool.

177
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,333
Do you want to try this meat
grilled with eggs?

178
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,066
I'm having my food.

179
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,533
Yes, you are.

180
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,567
I'm working on it.

181
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,834
Right.

182
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:49,600
Well done.

183
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,033
These noodles are great.

184
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,934
Right.

185
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,633
Should we buy these noodles?

186
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,533
Sure!

187
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,200
It has a lot of seafood.

188
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,400
Gosh, this is so good.

189
00:16:31,066 --> 00:16:32,200
It's delicious.

190
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,834
Let's toast. Drink.

191
00:16:38,066 --> 00:16:39,734
I'd like to have a bite.

192
00:16:45,033 --> 00:16:46,500
This is so good.

193
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,867
This is great.

194
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,934
Stop eating my meat.

195
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,133
I haven't had any.

196
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,100
I only had the soup.

197
00:17:30,867 --> 00:17:32,066
Let's finish this.

198
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:33,967
Are you crazy, I mean, drunk?

199
00:17:34,033 --> 00:17:36,233
- Do you know what you do with this?
- What?

200
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,133
Like this.

201
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,734
What's that?

202
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,533
It means you finished it.

203
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:42,600
I mean...

204
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,934
You have to do it on your head.

205
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:48,367
Like this?

206
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,200
With your glass too.

207
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,333
Let's finish the glasses together.

208
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,467
I don't have soju.

209
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,333
Just act like you have it.

210
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:03,967
You spilled so much.

211
00:18:04,033 --> 00:18:05,166
My goodness...

212
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:23,066
So what are you getting?

213
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,367
You know sundubu?

214
00:18:25,433 --> 00:18:27,900
Yes, sundubu-jjigae!

215
00:18:28,567 --> 00:18:29,400
What?

216
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:30,800
This looks good.

217
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,467
Bibimbap.

218
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,600
Bibimbap.

219
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:32,867
I fell in love with this.

220
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,967
You can get them in Korea.

221
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:40,000
Yes, I'm definitely getting them.
I know what I'm going to buy.

222
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,433
The first thing I'm getting is this set.

223
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:44,567
It's very special.

224
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:49,000
Is the hall full
or have they cleaned up the tables?

225
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,967
- Is the room full?
- It's full again.

226
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,000
- It is?
- Yes.

227
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:59,066
- How many in the group room?
- In the room... Seven.

228
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,400
There are seven people in the room.

229
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:04,033
Seven in the...

230
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:12,200
The weather is still good.

231
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:52,133
Orders for the group.

232
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,200
Orders for the group.

233
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,133
Three bibimbap.

234
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,834
One dakgalbi and one bulgogi.
One gomtang and one sundubu.

235
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,767
They ordered every dish.

236
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:27,467
What should I start with?

237
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:38,400
I should finish one fast
to make space for the next dish.

238
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,066
- I'll remove it for you.
- Thank you.

239
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,700
- These are for the hall, yes?
- Yes.

240
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:00,433
I'll bring them out.

241
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
That's three bibimbap and one dakgalbi.

242
00:23:09,867 --> 00:23:11,734
And one bulgogi, one gomtang,
and one sundubu.

243
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,300
That's four and three.

244
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:14,867
Three dishes.

245
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
That's three seaweed and three kimchi.

246
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,100
- This is ready to go.
- Okay.

247
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,834
- Dakgalbi and...
- Dakgalbi.

248
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,200
- Bulgogi.
- Bulgogi.

249
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,967
- Woo-shik, these are for the room.
- For the group.

250
00:23:55,967 --> 00:23:57,600
This is the second bowl.

251
00:23:58,967 --> 00:24:01,633
Gomtang is ready to go.
That's the third one.

252
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,066
Need to put green and red chilies.

253
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,834
Wait. Hold on. Green chili and red chili.

254
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:11,467
Okay, it's done.

255
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,400
- Yu-mi prepared them all.
- Right, much thanks to her.

256
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:29,400
Bibimbap.

257
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:45,767
Do you think they have forks?

258
00:24:45,834 --> 00:24:47,400
- What?
- Forks.

259
00:24:48,033 --> 00:24:49,667
How about you just use a spoon?

260
00:25:19,734 --> 00:25:20,767
Three, two, one.

261
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,300
Let me take another one.

262
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,667
Could you share the photos?

263
00:25:24,734 --> 00:25:25,867
- Yes.
- Okay.

264
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:27,133
Three, two, one.

265
00:25:30,166 --> 00:25:31,400
Thank you.

266
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,767
I got it. Okay, nice.

267
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,867
These noodles are very nice.

268
00:26:16,734 --> 00:26:18,133
I want to try them too.

269
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,767
She gave me so much noodles.

270
00:26:22,333 --> 00:26:23,834
- She's very kind.
- Right.

271
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:27,000
- I wanted to try these noodles.
- They're delicious.

272
00:26:27,734 --> 00:26:29,266
Did she also give you chicken?

273
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,066
Yes, here.

274
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:48,867
"Annyeonghasaeyo", is that...

275
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:49,800
"Annyeonghasaeyo?"

276
00:26:49,867 --> 00:26:50,967
It means "Thank you"?

277
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,300
That's "Hi."

278
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,734
"Gamsahamnida."

279
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,266
"Thank you" is "Gamsahamnida."

280
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:56,600
Thank you.

281
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,700
Takk.

282
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:03,633
Takk. Yep.

283
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,000
- Do you see her face?
- Yeah.

284
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,433
Did you guys see the aurora?

285
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:02,934
Very lucky.

286
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You deserve it.

287
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:29,467
Let me carry them.

288
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:31,266
- Thank you.
- Sure.

289
00:29:31,333 --> 00:29:33,166
- I'll clean up the table.
- Okay.

290
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,467
So these six are all strangers?

291
00:29:46,533 --> 00:29:47,633
Three pairs.

292
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,133
Then we should give each pair some space.

293
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,800
- So all dishes are done?
- Yes.

294
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:05,533
Let's take a break.

295
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,900
Let's rest for a second.

296
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:09,867
Mr. Lee, are you okay?

297
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,133
I was just checking on you.

298
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:21,233
What?

299
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,900
His hands are all swollen.

300
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:25,333
His fingers are all swollen.

301
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,600
His fingers are swollen.

302
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:35,233
Why aren't you wearing gloves?

303
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:39,000
No. I should be wearing them
to know if the dishes are clean.

304
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,900
I'm sorry.

305
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:45,967
- All right.
- Here.

306
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:47,867
Stop saying you're sorry.

307
00:30:47,934 --> 00:30:49,200
I'll leave them here.

308
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:50,300
- Okay.
- All right.

309
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:51,300
You know what?

310
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,567
Mr. Lee's hands...

311
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,633
They turned purple.

312
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,633
Somebody help him.

313
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:02,467
What?

314
00:31:02,567 --> 00:31:04,567
Mr. Lee, you should take a break.

315
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:08,133
She's warm-hearted.

316
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,567
Ms. Jung is a warm person.

317
00:31:13,066 --> 00:31:15,800
She's not just my boss.
She's the board member.

318
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:03,200
- So they're this?
- Yes, the last customers.

319
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:05,166
Enough, right?

320
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:13,266
We'll flip the sign.

321
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,900
Orders.

322
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,967
Orders from the group.

323
00:32:53,066 --> 00:32:54,934
This is the last order.

324
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,166
- Gosh, that's a lot.
- This is the last order.

325
00:32:58,233 --> 00:32:59,166
Last one!

326
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:04,200
That's two gomtang, two bibimbap,
and two sundubu.

327
00:33:04,266 --> 00:33:06,367
This is my last bibimbap.

328
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:09,400
That's two gomtang, two bibimbap,
and two sundubu.

329
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,567
We're such a popular restaurant.

330
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:16,367
I should put gomtang on the stove.

331
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:19,633
I think the gomtang will be finished too.

332
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,233
Yes, it's my last bibimbap.

333
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,200
I'll serve a lot.

334
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,000
This is nonstop, my goodness.

335
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,333
It's like making a round.

336
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,633
We're almost out of rice.

337
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:04,233
What are the ingredients that are left?

338
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,767
This is the last bibimbap.

339
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,266
- Last bibimbap...
- Right.

340
00:34:07,333 --> 00:34:10,667
Let's strike the iron while it's hot.

341
00:34:10,734 --> 00:34:11,967
Right, Mr. Lee?

342
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,467
- He has too many dishes to wash.
- Right.

343
00:34:15,567 --> 00:34:18,900
His hands turned as purple
as red sweet potatoes.

344
00:34:21,533 --> 00:34:24,800
Yakgochujang, thanks a lot.

345
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,367
Just enough for one last dish.

346
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,734
Do we have more to cook beside these four?

347
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,734
No.

348
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:35,667
So are these the last ones?

349
00:34:35,734 --> 00:34:36,734
- Yes.
- Nice.

350
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,700
Ramyeon is done.

351
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:41,233
The noodles are ready. Get ready to serve.

352
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,700
Imagine if we didn't have
this portable gas stoves.

353
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:02,333
This show couldn't have lasted this long.

354
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:16,667
I can't believe this moment has come.

355
00:35:26,133 --> 00:35:27,800
This is the last gomtang.

356
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,333
Last gomtang?

357
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,567
I'm so sad.

358
00:35:37,033 --> 00:35:38,233
Last gomtang.

359
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,367
Last gomtang.

360
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:43,133
Did you all say goodbye?

361
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:46,600
- Bye.
- Here's the last gomtang.

362
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:48,367
Goodbye.

363
00:35:51,066 --> 00:35:52,000
Which table?

364
00:35:57,867 --> 00:35:59,900
This is the last dakgalbi.

365
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:02,867
Bye.

366
00:36:02,934 --> 00:36:04,967
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

367
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,567
Last dakgalbi.

368
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,467
- Bye.
- Gosh, it's hot.

369
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,834
Bye.

370
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,166
Did you all say goodbye?

371
00:36:13,867 --> 00:36:16,367
This is the last ttuk...

372
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,300
Here, bulgogi.

373
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:25,567
- Right, bye.
- Tables One and Three.

374
00:36:25,667 --> 00:36:27,266
- Last one?
- Yes.

375
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,500
My goodness.

376
00:36:30,066 --> 00:36:31,633
We did an excellent job.

377
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:35,600
- Bye.
- Here, bye.

378
00:36:35,667 --> 00:36:36,600
Bye.

379
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:38,266
Goodbye.

380
00:36:38,333 --> 00:36:40,100
- Bye.
- This is the last dish.

381
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,400
Bye.

382
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:32,233
I've never had such good cold noodles.

383
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:33,934
Never.

384
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,367
You know, Korean food in Texas
doesn't taste like this.

385
00:37:46,033 --> 00:37:47,300
It's worth it.

386
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,767
Absolutely worth it.

387
00:40:24,734 --> 00:40:26,400
You don't have to do it anymore.

388
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,033
- I'm done.
- Good job, Mr. Lee.

389
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,033
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

390
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,300
- Do you want some gomtang?
- Gomtang.

391
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,266
Have some gomtang.

392
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:36,100
- Really?
- I'll make you one bowl.

393
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,467
You should have it.

394
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,533
I'll give you a lot of meat.

395
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,467
Really?

396
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,734
- He doesn't have to wash them now.
- Now?

397
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,266
- You can stop now.
- We have to wash them anyway.

398
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,767
- Somebody has to wash them anyway.
- We'll do it.

399
00:41:02,834 --> 00:41:03,700
Come on, no.

400
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,734
I mean it.

401
00:41:06,867 --> 00:41:08,200
It's my job.

402
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,367
We're making gomtang for you.

403
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:12,100
I'll do it after eating it.

404
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,800
My gosh.

405
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,266
Passion. I get that you're passionate.

406
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,734
- What's this?
- Put it up here.

407
00:41:27,834 --> 00:41:29,033
This is for Mr. Lee.

408
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:29,934
I see.

409
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:38,967
Mr. Lee, stop.

410
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:39,867
Okay.

411
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,400
Let me set a table for you here.

412
00:41:49,734 --> 00:41:50,800
This way.

413
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:52,800
I can eat here.

414
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:54,000
It's fine.

415
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:55,033
You know...

416
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,934
You'll eat it there?

417
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,533
Eating next to the fridge is the best.

418
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,000
Mr. Lee, enjoy.

419
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,266
Kkakdugi is so good.

420
00:42:36,333 --> 00:42:37,967
- Really?
- Yes.

421
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:39,166
That's good.

422
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,567
Is the soup okay? Do you want some salt?

423
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:43,734
No, it's fine.

424
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,400
I got one thumbs up.

425
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:22,033
This is so good.

426
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:27,100
- I'm sorry. I should've done it.
- No.

427
00:43:33,567 --> 00:43:34,533
My gosh.

428
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:37,967
My goodness.

429
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:39,500
- Really?
- The kkakdugi is amazing.

430
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:41,000
Thank you.

431
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:43,133
Thank you so much for this meal.

432
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:48,033
We will never forget your help.

433
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,700
We won't forget your help.

434
00:43:53,533 --> 00:43:55,033
Goodbye!

435
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:13,767
Good job, Min-si.

436
00:44:13,867 --> 00:44:16,166
Seo-jun, it's finally over.

437
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,033
- I know.
- I thought it'd never end.

438
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,433
It's really over.

439
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,600
This is finally over.

440
00:44:44,734 --> 00:44:45,633
Good job.

441
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:48,433
Why are you making yukjeon?

442
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,734
These are leftovers.

443
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,834
- Leftovers. We should have them.
- You should rest.

444
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:56,633
- I'll just grill these two pieces.
- Right.

445
00:44:57,133 --> 00:44:59,867
I almost cried earlier.
And I'm tearing up now.

446
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,367
We are both crying.

447
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,967
- This is touching.
- Don't cry.

448
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:10,900
- Don't cry.
- I'm not crying.

449
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,400
Yu-mi, that's enough.

450
00:45:14,133 --> 00:45:16,734
- Stop cooking yukjeon.
- I'm done now.

451
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:19,266
The yukjeon is so big.

452
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:21,066
Why don't we share this?

453
00:45:21,133 --> 00:45:22,066
I'd love that.

454
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:23,967
We can eat it, right?

455
00:45:24,467 --> 00:45:25,400
Of course.

456
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:50,900
In Iceland...

457
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,133
it's been a hit.

458
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,200
Working at a restaurant
for more than 15 hours

459
00:45:56,266 --> 00:45:59,233
with customers lining up...

460
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,000
It's incredible.

461
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:02,500
Over 15 hours, indeed.

462
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,567
This is incredible.

463
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:12,533
And I heard that today's profit
was eight million won.

464
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:18,233
But I'm sad
it didn't reach ten million won.

465
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,600
Like, "We worked so hard,
but less than ten million won?"

466
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,734
- You're one greedy intern.
- Right.

467
00:46:26,166 --> 00:46:28,533
It's the opposite of what I was expecting.

468
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,200
I didn't know I'd be crying.
Why am I crying?

469
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,767
Intern Ko, I heard you cried.

470
00:46:39,834 --> 00:46:40,967
No I didn't.

471
00:46:42,367 --> 00:46:44,367
I didn't cry.

472
00:46:44,433 --> 00:46:47,867
I cried because it was funny.

473
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:50,400
I was just happy.

474
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,500
Now, whenever I see dolsot-bibimbap,
I'll think of this place.

475
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:56,533
Seriously.

476
00:46:57,467 --> 00:46:59,700
Even these vegetables will remind me

477
00:46:59,767 --> 00:47:02,767
of Iceland for the rest of my life.

478
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:48,033
Party tonight!

479
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,633
- Good work, all of you.
- Good job.

480
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,867
Well done.

481
00:47:52,233 --> 00:47:54,600
To you all...

482
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:57,266
I'd like to give you a big hand.

483
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,433
We did well.

484
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:03,667
Good work.

485
00:48:03,767 --> 00:48:05,033
- I'm moved.
- Good job.

486
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,900
- Well done.
- Good work.

487
00:48:09,367 --> 00:48:11,100
Please step out.

488
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,834
We are out of tune.

489
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,734
Crazy, is he the only one up there?

490
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,233
What's with him?

491
00:48:50,467 --> 00:48:51,533
I'll pull it down.

492
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:53,700
How do I do it?

493
00:48:54,533 --> 00:48:56,433
It's one touching moment.

494
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,233
Gosh, this is funny.

495
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:02,333
- Here it is.
- It's coming down.

496
00:49:02,433 --> 00:49:04,000
It's coming down.

497
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:06,100
- Bye.
- Bye.

498
00:49:06,166 --> 00:49:08,266
Bye, Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

499
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,467
- Bye.
- Bye.

500
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:11,800
Bye, gomtang.

501
00:49:19,867 --> 00:49:21,633
Seo-jin's not crying, is he?

502
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,033
Good job, everyone.

503
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,066
- Good job.
- Well done.

504
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,433
- Good work.
- Nice job.

505
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,467
- Good work.
- Well done.

506
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:41,700
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

507
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:08,367
GOOD WORK, DEAR COLLEAGUES

508
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:13,166
JINNY'S KITCHEN 2 CLOSING CEREMONY
JULY 22, 2024

509
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:16,767
I should sit here.

510
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:18,667
The five of them will sit here.

511
00:50:21,867 --> 00:50:23,700
Oh, hello.

512
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,066
- Hi.
- Hello.

513
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:26,633
- Hi, wear those slippers.
- Hello.

514
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,533
Hello.

515
00:50:27,633 --> 00:50:28,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

516
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:29,533
Wow.

517
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,633
- Hello.
- Welcome.

518
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,033
Hello.

519
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,100
Hello.

520
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,667
Hello.

521
00:50:40,734 --> 00:50:41,900
Hello!

522
00:50:43,066 --> 00:50:44,300
What's that?

523
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,667
- "Dear colleagues."
- What?

524
00:50:47,867 --> 00:50:49,100
A closing ceremony.

525
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:56,900
- It's Yu-mi.
- Yu-mi.

526
00:50:57,367 --> 00:50:59,800
Ms. Jung. Gosh, Mr. Lee, you're barefoot.

527
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:01,600
Why are you barefoot?

528
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:03,033
- Hello.
- Hey, Yu-mi.

529
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,400
Gosh, you look...

530
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,834
You're dressed up today.

531
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,333
- I didn't have anything else.
- You look so pretty.

532
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,400
- A princess is here.
- Ms. Jung.

533
00:51:11,467 --> 00:51:14,266
The way she dresses...

534
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:16,667
Yu-mi looks like

535
00:51:16,734 --> 00:51:18,400
someone in authority.

536
00:51:18,467 --> 00:51:19,767
No, it's not that.

537
00:51:19,834 --> 00:51:22,300
I was going to dress like Seo-jun.

538
00:51:22,367 --> 00:51:23,934
But I had nothing to wear.

539
00:51:24,033 --> 00:51:25,367
- What?
- Sorry?

540
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:27,266
- Is that yours?
- Yes.

541
00:51:27,367 --> 00:51:30,100
I had nothing to wear.
What's with your hair?

542
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,333
- It's nice.
- It looks good.

543
00:51:32,433 --> 00:51:34,000
What is with your hair?

544
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,433
- What about you?
- I mean...

545
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:36,700
What's wrong with your hair?

546
00:51:36,767 --> 00:51:38,500
You tried so hard to style it.

547
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,700
Why are you wearing a princess dress?

548
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,467
I have nothing else for summer.

549
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,600
Nice vibe.

550
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,934
Since it's a closing ceremony,

551
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,233
- there's no hierarchy.
- This is great.

552
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,633
I thought white would be better
than black.

553
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,867
- That's why I'm wearing white.
- It's great like a reflector.

554
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,533
You got more handsome.

555
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,133
- What?
- You look great.

556
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,767
I mean, I've been seeing you
on the show, and...

557
00:52:01,834 --> 00:52:03,800
I didn't look good in Iceland.

558
00:52:03,867 --> 00:52:08,266
- I've only seen him on TV recently.
- Right.

559
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:10,834
Even to me, my face looked so washed out.

560
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:14,233
I'm looking at you right now.
You are so good looking.

561
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,100
You're good looking. I forgot about it.

562
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:26,133
We'll now start the closing ceremony
of Jinny's Kitchen.

563
00:52:29,934 --> 00:52:30,800
Dear colleagues,

564
00:52:30,867 --> 00:52:33,100
it's been four months
since our last shooting.

565
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:38,667
Thanks to all your hard work,
the show has received a great response.

566
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,000
I thank you for all of your hard work.

567
00:52:45,066 --> 00:52:47,433
The first on the list of the ceremony...

568
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:49,500
- Ta-da.
- Mr. Lee's speech.

569
00:52:49,567 --> 00:52:50,900
Let's hear him.

570
00:52:55,233 --> 00:52:58,767
Mr. Lee's speech.
Let's hear what he has to say.

571
00:52:58,834 --> 00:52:59,934
Let's go.

572
00:53:01,934 --> 00:53:03,233
What do I have to say?

573
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,100
Mr. Lee, please get up.

574
00:53:08,934 --> 00:53:10,867
Well, everyone did a great job.

575
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,166
You all worked so hard.

576
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,900
- Right.
- Well...

577
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,066
Please point out each person.

578
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:20,266
Well...

579
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:23,433
I watched the show,
and I think Min-si worked the hardest.

580
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,700
Well done.

581
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,867
Thank you.

582
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,166
And Woo-shik...

583
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,433
I don't think you did much. Right?

584
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:32,567
- Thank you.
- Right.

585
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:37,367
- He's your right-hand man.
- And Seo-jun, as I'd expected,

586
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,200
he took good care of the kitchen.

587
00:53:42,367 --> 00:53:43,767
And Yu-mi, you too...

588
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,033
Good job.

589
00:53:53,367 --> 00:53:55,133
- Well, that's it.
- Yes.

590
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,567
That was a speech by Mr. Lee,
the founder of the restaurant.

591
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:05,133
Secondly, Mr. Rhee Myung Han,
our CEO will give a speech!

592
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:06,333
Let's hear it.

593
00:54:11,333 --> 00:54:12,433
Let's hear it!

594
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:13,600
My gosh.

595
00:54:17,633 --> 00:54:19,100
What's going on?

596
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:23,166
- This way.
- Ms. Jung.

597
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:24,934
Come back, Dishwashing Man!

598
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,800
He represents the headquarters.

599
00:54:29,867 --> 00:54:32,300
- But he's a dishwashing man to us.
- Right.

600
00:54:32,367 --> 00:54:34,000
He did two jobs.

601
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:36,200
Let's hear his speech.

602
00:54:36,266 --> 00:54:37,800
He has been wearing a mic.

603
00:54:41,233 --> 00:54:42,734
So he was waiting for us.

604
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:46,300
It's been a while
since I saw you in the kitchen.

605
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,100
- How have you all been?
- Great.

606
00:54:49,166 --> 00:54:50,066
Thanks to you all,

607
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:56,133
Jinny's Kitchen 2 has been successful.
The viewer's ratings have been great.

608
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,800
And more importantly, the content
and quality of the show was well received.

609
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:03,333
So, I was so proud.

610
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,934
Jinny's Kitchen 2 has lifted up
the second half of Eggiscoming.

611
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,600
Thank you all so much!

612
00:55:13,967 --> 00:55:15,600
Do we get incentives?

613
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,300
Another bottle of good liquor?

614
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,000
- If you need it, tell me.
- All right.

615
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:23,500
- Good liquor.
- All right.

616
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,300
- That was a speech by the CEO.
- Thank you.

617
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,900
The closing ceremony is virtually over.

618
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:41,734
So what's the dish that has sold the most
during this season?

619
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,133
- I know.
- I know.

620
00:55:43,433 --> 00:55:44,900
Woo-shik and Min-si were fast.

621
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,400
Bibimbap, 138 bowls.

622
00:55:46,467 --> 00:55:47,734
- Wrong!
- It's not?

623
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:48,633
It's not?

624
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,967
Wasn't it 138 bowls?

625
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,433
- Hold on.
- Wasn't it 138 bowls?

626
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:54,834
- How did you know it was 138?
- On the last day...

627
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,667
- We talked about this.
- Right, we did.

628
00:55:56,734 --> 00:55:58,800
- Bibimbap sold the most.
- Wasn't it bibimbap?

629
00:55:58,867 --> 00:55:59,934
- I know.
- Woo-shik?

630
00:56:00,066 --> 00:56:01,000
Kkori-gomtang.

631
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,367
- No.
- Not kkori-gomtang.

632
00:56:02,433 --> 00:56:03,967
- It was about 50 something.
- I know.

633
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:05,667
- Seo-jun.
- Dessert.

634
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:06,934
Right!

635
00:56:07,033 --> 00:56:08,233
What's the name?

636
00:56:08,333 --> 00:56:09,800
- Hey!
- The name?

637
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,300
- Hey!
- I got it.

638
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:13,000
Min-si, say it.

639
00:56:13,066 --> 00:56:14,667
- Twibap ice cream.
- Correct.

640
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,300
- Yes!
- I couldn't hear it.

641
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:17,533
She screamed.

642
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,333
- What about the name of the dessert?
- "I know!"

643
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,200
It's twibap ice cream.

644
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,667
- There is no prize.
- No prize?

645
00:56:23,734 --> 00:56:25,533
- Right.
- It's just a warmup quiz.

646
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,567
Unexpectedly,
the top-seller was the dessert.

647
00:56:28,633 --> 00:56:30,100
- How many?
- Well...

648
00:56:31,133 --> 00:56:32,467
It says 176 here.

649
00:56:32,533 --> 00:56:33,700
What?

650
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,467
- The next...
- So,

651
00:56:35,533 --> 00:56:39,000
it means Yu-mi and Woo-shik
made it 170 times.

652
00:56:39,066 --> 00:56:39,900
Right.

653
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:42,800
- Unbelievable.
- So we did.

654
00:56:43,367 --> 00:56:46,467
The second, as Min-si said,
was bibimbap, 138 bowls.

655
00:56:46,567 --> 00:56:48,367
So it's 138 bowls, right?

656
00:56:48,433 --> 00:56:50,400
- How does she remember?
- She is smart.

657
00:56:50,467 --> 00:56:52,100
We must have told her.

658
00:56:52,166 --> 00:56:53,700
- Then...
- We told her.

659
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:55,266
...how many galbijjim?

660
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:57,834
- Galbijjim.
- Beef galbijjim.

661
00:56:57,934 --> 00:57:00,567
So you remembered it
because you made bibimbap.

662
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:02,934
I also know gomtang is the second most.

663
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:04,133
- Second?
- Yes, gomtang.

664
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:05,734
- Right.
- The next one is gomtang.

665
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:07,400
- Right.
- Not galbijjim?

666
00:57:08,033 --> 00:57:10,100
- It had two different versions.
- Right.

667
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,900
Surprisingly, 70 bowls of gomtang
have been sold.

668
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,934
It comes in third place as a single dish.

669
00:57:18,467 --> 00:57:19,433
Well, that is...

670
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:26,600
Let's hear Mr. Lee's speech.

671
00:57:27,266 --> 00:57:28,567
Come on.

672
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:30,300
- Next question.
- This is hilarious.

673
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,600
So shall we ask this too?

674
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:34,934
- The total sales.
- Right.

675
00:57:35,033 --> 00:57:36,767
Jinny's Ttukbaegi was open

676
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,633
- for quite a while.
- The total?

677
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,266
What's the total sales?

678
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:42,300
- I got it.
- How much is it?

679
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,767
Woo-shik.

680
00:57:43,867 --> 00:57:45,000
It's 350 million won.

681
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,734
Hey!

682
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,300
Then I wouldn't have come here.

683
00:57:51,233 --> 00:57:52,300
I wouldn't have.

684
00:57:53,033 --> 00:57:54,567
Isn't it about 35 million won?

685
00:57:55,567 --> 00:57:59,100
You have to give me specific numbers.

686
00:57:59,166 --> 00:58:01,367
It's more than 30 million won, right?

687
00:58:01,467 --> 00:58:03,233
- No, it's not.
- More than that?

688
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,367
It's close.

689
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,300
- About 40 million?
- It was more than 3 million won each day.

690
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:09,300
I think it was like 5 to 7 million won.

691
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:11,533
The first day, it was 3 million won.

692
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,333
It's 28 million won.

693
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,800
You are so close!

694
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,834
- I got it.
- Ms. Jung.

695
00:58:16,934 --> 00:58:18,033
It's 25 million won.

696
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,967
That was close.

697
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:20,567
I got it, 26 million won.

698
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,233
- No.
- It's 29 million won?

699
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,533
- You have to raise your hand.
- It's 27 million won.

700
00:58:24,867 --> 00:58:26,133
What, 27 million won?

701
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,233
No.

702
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:29,834
- I don't know.
- What did you say?

703
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:32,533
- What did I say?
- Did you say 28 million won?

704
00:58:32,734 --> 00:58:33,600
I think it was...

705
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:35,600
- What else do we have left?
- I got it.

706
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:37,066
- Yes.
- It's 28.5 million won.

707
00:58:37,133 --> 00:58:40,800
Gosh. That's your problem.
I said how many million won.

708
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,133
Right.

709
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,300
It's 29 million won.

710
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,333
That is correct.

711
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,467
- So it's 29 million won.
- It should've been 30 million.

712
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:52,867
It's 2,942,100 krona.

713
00:58:53,667 --> 00:58:54,867
About 30 million won.

714
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,934
It's about 30 million won.

715
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,734
- It's still brilliant.
- Yes, in just ten days...

716
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,700
So the official ceremony is over.

717
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:16,400
We'll now look back on our time there.

718
00:59:16,467 --> 00:59:19,467
Please get ready to cry.
Yu-mi's tearing up already.

719
00:59:19,533 --> 00:59:20,500
- What?
- Oh, no.

720
00:59:20,567 --> 00:59:21,533
What is this?

721
00:59:21,633 --> 00:59:24,800
- You didn't mention this.
- Gosh, Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

722
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,266
This is so sudden.

723
00:59:26,333 --> 00:59:28,834
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi.
- While you were working...

724
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,000
- Well, this is a first.
- I know.

725
00:59:31,066 --> 00:59:33,800
- Oh, my.
- This is the photo book.

726
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,033
Let's take a moment to look back.

727
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,300
Wow, this...

728
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:42,400
This makes me cry.

729
00:59:42,467 --> 00:59:44,834
What is this? My face isn't here.

730
00:59:46,533 --> 00:59:47,800
From the first day...

731
01:00:09,934 --> 01:00:12,367
- This is amazing.
- When did you take these photos?

732
01:00:12,433 --> 01:00:14,300
My gosh, you look great here.

733
01:00:15,567 --> 01:00:17,734
My gosh.

734
01:00:17,834 --> 01:00:19,567
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

735
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:23,066
- Look at this.
- What?

736
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:28,066
- You remember it all, yes?
- Yes, amazing.

737
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:30,333
My goodness.

738
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:32,500
Goodness.

739
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,600
Gosh, we do look worn out here.

740
01:00:35,667 --> 01:00:37,834
See? He looks different here.

741
01:00:39,367 --> 01:00:41,333
We didn't smile much then.

742
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,400
Why does it feel like so long ago?

743
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,633
Who is this?

744
01:01:08,934 --> 01:01:10,433
I don't know who this is.

745
01:01:11,066 --> 01:01:12,767
And who is this?

746
01:01:13,433 --> 01:01:14,567
The one below.

747
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,467
- Let's compare.
- Min-si looks like

748
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:25,433
- Sadness in Inside Out.
- Yes, Sadness.

749
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:28,433
- She looks like it.
- She really looks like Sadness.

750
01:01:28,533 --> 01:01:30,734
She looks the happiest
when she's shopping.

751
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,233
- Where? Where am I?
- Right?

752
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:33,533
- You look...
- Where is it?

753
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,734
- ...so happy then.
- Where?

754
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,233
- Goodness.
- Look at Min-si.

755
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:39,266
- I mean...
- It's like a lookbook.

756
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:40,700
Where?

757
01:01:45,734 --> 01:01:48,166
She's just there to shop.

758
01:01:48,233 --> 01:01:49,233
I worked hard

759
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,200
- and earned money.
- She's there to shop.

760
01:01:52,567 --> 01:01:53,667
I was so happy.

761
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:57,066
I worked hard and earned money to spend.
I loved it.

762
01:01:57,533 --> 01:02:01,266
To show the viewers
how you worked to run a restaurant,

763
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,834
we're airing the scenes where you worked.

764
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,300
But in between those days,
you had some days off.

765
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:09,734
Including Min-si's shopping days.

766
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,934
Woo-shik and Seo-jun,

767
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,367
any impressive spots in Iceland?

768
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:18,233
It's when we drove around
and stopped at a spot.

769
01:02:19,834 --> 01:02:22,000
I still remember it so clearly.

770
01:02:22,066 --> 01:02:24,100
It wasn't some tourist spot.

771
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:25,200
- No.
- Right.

772
01:02:25,266 --> 01:02:27,166
We were on some road.

773
01:02:27,266 --> 01:02:29,333
That's the charm of Iceland.

774
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,133
- It had nothing.
- It was so amazing.

775
01:02:32,233 --> 01:02:35,767
It felt like I was
at the tip of the globe.

776
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,900
Gosh, it's so cold.

777
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:39,900
It's cold!

778
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:46,567
It's snowing a lot.

779
01:03:12,767 --> 01:03:16,300
Seo-jin, they're lining up
around the building.

780
01:03:16,367 --> 01:03:17,967
There are so many!

781
01:03:19,033 --> 01:03:21,667
I can't tell whether
I'm in Iceland or not.

782
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,433
I didn't expect this.

783
01:03:26,467 --> 01:03:28,467
Did you see the snowy mountains?

784
01:03:28,567 --> 01:03:29,934
There are mountains?

785
01:04:21,433 --> 01:04:22,867
Two hours away.

786
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,633
It must be nature itself.

787
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:30,800
Let's go.

788
01:04:32,467 --> 01:04:34,734
When would we get a chance if not now?

789
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,633
Right. When would we?

790
01:04:49,967 --> 01:04:51,400
Amazing.

791
01:04:52,367 --> 01:04:55,166
- Oh, my.
- Incredible.

792
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,266
Look at the mountains on your left.

793
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:09,600
It looks like some beef rib fat.

794
01:05:11,967 --> 01:05:13,800
I have to trim all that out.

795
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,834
Do I take an exit on the right?

796
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:19,800
Yes.

797
01:05:19,867 --> 01:05:22,033
Gosh, this is so pretty.

798
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:25,734
These horses are just there outside.

799
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:37,000
They aren't so big.

800
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:38,100
Are they ponies?

801
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,433
It's even cooler here.

802
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,767
- My gosh.
- What is it?

803
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:05,767
This is so cool.

804
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,800
- This is the real Iceland.
- My gosh.

805
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,467
This is like a ski resort.

806
01:06:25,033 --> 01:06:25,900
Gosh.

807
01:06:46,633 --> 01:06:47,533
Gosh.

808
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,333
- Hey.
- My feet go into the snow.

809
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,500
- Do you want a photo together?
- Yes.

810
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,667
This is Iceland.

811
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,000
One, two, three.

812
01:07:04,066 --> 01:07:05,033
Stay still.

813
01:07:08,133 --> 01:07:10,266
How far have you been?

814
01:07:10,333 --> 01:07:11,767
Iceland.

815
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:13,433
How far have you been?

816
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:14,433
Goodness.

817
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:16,400
It's cold.

818
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:17,433
One, two, three.

819
01:07:18,066 --> 01:07:19,333
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

820
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:26,100
This is amazing.

821
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:27,934
My gosh.

822
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:43,333
Let's go!

823
01:08:15,667 --> 01:08:16,667
About 15 minutes to go.

824
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:20,800
Here it is.

825
01:08:21,934 --> 01:08:22,967
Geyser.

826
01:08:24,233 --> 01:08:26,767
I see some warm things coming up.

827
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,500
Did anyone fart just now?

828
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:46,800
Gosh, this is rich.

829
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:49,233
Somebody ate a lot of eggs.

830
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,834
Gosh, the sky is beautiful.

831
01:08:52,900 --> 01:08:53,867
Let's see.

832
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:00,233
Look from here.

833
01:09:00,867 --> 01:09:02,734
Hello, we are in Iceland.

834
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,000
Nice to meet you.

835
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,433
I'll cover you.

836
01:09:10,967 --> 01:09:13,633
You know what?

837
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,700
I want to check the temperature.

838
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:25,233
- So this is where it's from.
- This must be...

839
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:32,433
Wow, look.

840
01:09:33,133 --> 01:09:34,700
The view is...

841
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,033
The view is spectacular.

842
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:44,667
Where's the crater? There it is.

843
01:09:44,767 --> 01:09:46,467
Something is gathering up.

844
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,633
Lift your arms later. They will ache.

845
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:54,967
We don't know when it'd come up again.

846
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:58,567
- It's gathered up in the middle.
- Hey.

847
01:10:06,834 --> 01:10:07,734
Do you see it?

848
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,767
No, not yet.

849
01:10:09,367 --> 01:10:11,900
It'll come up if we put our arms down.

850
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,166
I think we'll have it soon.

851
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:19,367
Hey! Look!

852
01:10:20,967 --> 01:10:22,667
Hey, look!

853
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,700
Hey, look!

854
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,467
We'll miss another one looking at this.
Give it to me.

855
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,200
Why do I get so scared?

856
01:10:59,166 --> 01:11:01,166
- That scared me.
- That scared me.

857
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:12,266
That was huge!

858
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:13,900
My gosh.

859
01:11:21,667 --> 01:11:23,734
- It goes that far...
- Right.

860
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,567
So this is...

861
01:11:26,734 --> 01:11:28,667
It's magnificent.

862
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:33,700
It's cool.

863
01:11:34,266 --> 01:11:36,700
Humans are as small as a bit of dust.

864
01:11:36,767 --> 01:11:38,500
We are nothing but dust.

865
01:11:39,834 --> 01:11:40,800
Wow.

866
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:43,200
This is just amazing.

867
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:45,200
Mother Nature.

868
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:48,066
We saw everything.

869
01:11:48,133 --> 01:11:49,467
We did see everything.

870
01:12:02,433 --> 01:12:05,200
The weather is so great today.
It's not so cold.

871
01:12:14,667 --> 01:12:15,633
My gosh.

872
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,433
Dolls!

873
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,300
They're connecting.

874
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,800
That's so funny.

875
01:13:03,834 --> 01:13:05,567
How cute.

876
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:08,800
I can see the snowy mountains from here.

877
01:13:13,033 --> 01:13:15,367
Can I take photos here?

878
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,734
- Your bag.
- My bag.

879
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:25,066
This is so pretty.

880
01:13:29,734 --> 01:13:31,133
- Is this the place?
- Gosh.

881
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,200
What should I get?

882
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:41,967
Gosh, what do I do?

883
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:46,333
What's the one that's running low?

884
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,767
This is almost empty.

885
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,500
- Should I take a look?
- Right.

886
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,400
Yes.

887
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,266
This must be the most popular fragrance.

888
01:13:53,867 --> 01:13:54,800
Goodness.

889
01:13:56,367 --> 01:13:57,233
This is good.

890
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:00,767
The number 2. The color is a bit...

891
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:08,066
Okay, I'll get this.

892
01:14:08,166 --> 01:14:09,400
And the number 4.

893
01:14:11,700 --> 01:14:13,867
These sunglasses are amazing.

894
01:14:16,467 --> 01:14:18,133
These feel great on my face.

895
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:20,567
- I want these.
- Are you torn?

896
01:14:20,633 --> 01:14:22,000
- Yes.
- When you're torn?

897
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:24,400
- When you are torn?
- I should just go for it.

898
01:14:25,734 --> 01:14:28,533
Will I wear them a lot?
They're a bit flashy.

899
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,900
Would I wear them a lot? On hold for now.

900
01:14:33,533 --> 01:14:36,433
I want to buy so many things.
What do I do?

901
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:44,266
This is so cute!

902
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,867
Isn't this cute?

903
01:14:49,767 --> 01:14:51,000
It's cute!

904
01:14:51,066 --> 01:14:53,400
All right, I'll get this.

905
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:55,066
I'll take this.

906
01:14:55,133 --> 01:14:57,867
- This is mine.
- You don't have to try it on?

907
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,433
No, I'll select first.

908
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,333
I'll try them on all at once.

909
01:15:04,233 --> 01:15:08,200
This is what I wear to cover my neck.

910
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:09,667
I don't know the name.

911
01:15:09,734 --> 01:15:11,700
- A balaclava.
- Right, a balaclava.

912
01:15:11,867 --> 01:15:14,600
- She majored in fashion.
- Right.

913
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:27,133
My gosh. Now that I'm here,
these all look so cute.

914
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
How cute.

915
01:15:30,066 --> 01:15:31,400
This is also cute.

916
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,900
There it is.

917
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,333
Maybe not this.

918
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,367
- This is...
- Not this.

919
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:39,900
- Not this?
- No, not this.

920
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:41,400
Why do you say that?

921
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:45,166
I have to see if the color suits me.

922
01:15:48,467 --> 01:15:49,300
Great.

923
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,867
Let me try them on.

924
01:15:53,934 --> 01:15:55,567
I'll make a fashion show here.

925
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:02,734
This is hilarious.

926
01:16:04,533 --> 01:16:05,633
It looks good on you.

927
01:16:08,734 --> 01:16:09,767
It's pretty.

928
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:11,567
I like it.

929
01:16:11,633 --> 01:16:13,300
- Is this a pass or no?
- It's a pass.

930
01:16:13,367 --> 01:16:14,800
I'll take this.

931
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:18,800
I feel like I can wear it anytime.

932
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:20,200
I'll take this.

933
01:16:22,266 --> 01:16:23,700
Is this how I wear it?

934
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,633
This is not what I...

935
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:29,834
This is not...

936
01:16:29,934 --> 01:16:31,133
How do I wear this?

937
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,934
How do I wear it?

938
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:37,367
Where does this balaclava...

939
01:16:41,333 --> 01:16:42,333
It's pretty.

940
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:47,500
Well...

941
01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:52,633
That was fatal.

942
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:55,667
Is this a pass?

943
01:16:55,734 --> 01:16:58,000
Yes, it's a pass. It's great.

944
01:17:15,133 --> 01:17:16,200
This is funny.

945
01:17:16,700 --> 01:17:18,467
I think this is funny.

946
01:17:21,633 --> 01:17:24,967
This is too big.
And it's dragging on the floor.

947
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,133
I've made my decision.

948
01:17:28,233 --> 01:17:31,333
I'll get this and this.

949
01:17:31,433 --> 01:17:33,900
- Which one should I wear?
- You'll buy them all?

950
01:17:33,967 --> 01:17:35,433
These? Okay.

951
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,200
Great.

952
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,300
Those who work hard, go for shopping.

953
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:52,266
Yes!

954
01:17:55,667 --> 01:17:58,266
It's not cold in this outfit.

955
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,834
I have to go there now.

956
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,667
- You're going there too?
- Yes.

957
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:09,266
I just think it'd be great
for outdoor shooting.

958
01:18:09,367 --> 01:18:10,200
Isn't it too thin?

959
01:18:10,266 --> 01:18:11,533
It's very light.

960
01:18:16,066 --> 01:18:17,667
I should try on some beanies.

961
01:18:22,266 --> 01:18:25,767
Didn't idol singers wear things like this
in the old days?

962
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,133
This is it.

963
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,100
This is it.

964
01:18:39,834 --> 01:18:41,066
This must be it.

965
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:43,433
The cute and kitsch style...

966
01:18:47,734 --> 01:18:48,934
My gosh!

967
01:18:49,033 --> 01:18:51,333
This is so cute.

968
01:18:54,934 --> 01:18:56,667
I love this.

969
01:18:57,767 --> 01:19:00,433
I love this one.

970
01:19:01,133 --> 01:19:05,266
Oh, no. I'm in love with Iceland.
There are so many things to buy.

971
01:19:05,367 --> 01:19:08,834
This is so cute. I'm getting these socks.
I have to.

972
01:19:09,734 --> 01:19:12,066
Cute. I'll get all of these.

973
01:19:12,166 --> 01:19:14,667
I'll get the same design
for all the staff.

974
01:19:14,734 --> 01:19:17,333
And another set that suits
each one of them.

975
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:24,100
Will they like them?

976
01:19:24,834 --> 01:19:26,633
They will love these for sure.

977
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:29,166
Really? I should work even harder.

978
01:19:37,934 --> 01:19:41,133
Carrying all these bags reminds me
of those girls in TV series.

979
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:54,133
Everyone is out.

980
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,133
I'm here at the grocery store by myself.

981
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:58,700
The grocery store.

982
01:20:02,033 --> 01:20:03,533
I can't find that yogurt.

983
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:08,100
Oh, here it is!

984
01:20:08,967 --> 01:20:09,900
Here it is.

985
01:20:09,967 --> 01:20:11,533
I heard this is famous.

986
01:20:17,734 --> 01:20:19,600
Since it's famous.

987
01:20:20,734 --> 01:20:21,900
Blueberry juice.

988
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,700
Blueberry is famous here.

989
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,467
I see pineapple juice.

990
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,934
I'll just look around.

991
01:21:00,433 --> 01:21:02,100
I'm back!

992
01:21:02,166 --> 01:21:03,633
I bought a lot of stuff.

993
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,800
- Everyone's talking about you.
- Why?

994
01:21:05,867 --> 01:21:09,200
- People say you're a shopaholic.
- But there are too many nice things.

995
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,300
I got this jacket and the pants.

996
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,967
I got this hat from another store.

997
01:21:22,266 --> 01:21:24,500
And this jacket is amazing.

998
01:21:25,233 --> 01:21:29,033
This is very long, but light.

999
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:31,467
So I got this. Hello, there!

1000
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:34,100
I bought a lot of stuff.

1001
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:35,667
I got you some gifts.

1002
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:37,433
Socks.

1003
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,934
- Our matching socks.
- It's a sort of bribery.

1004
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:45,767
Try this.

1005
01:21:46,533 --> 01:21:47,867
Try them on.

1006
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:50,700
Try them on. They're from the same brand.

1007
01:21:56,033 --> 01:21:57,433
Are those 3D glasses?

1008
01:21:59,900 --> 01:22:01,133
Is this a movie theater?

1009
01:22:02,700 --> 01:22:05,133
I don't go shopping a lot. But when I do,

1010
01:22:05,433 --> 01:22:07,300
- I buy a lot.
- What earrings did you get?

1011
01:22:07,367 --> 01:22:08,400
Earrings?

1012
01:22:09,700 --> 01:22:13,066
- He might take them away from you.
- No, Mr. Lee can't wear these.

1013
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:14,533
What is it?

1014
01:22:14,600 --> 01:22:16,166
He has holes in his ears.

1015
01:22:17,066 --> 01:22:19,400
"He has holes in his ears."

1016
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,600
What was that?

1017
01:22:21,667 --> 01:22:23,367
He'll wear them right away.

1018
01:22:27,033 --> 01:22:28,700
Look at him.

1019
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,100
- What?
- I got these too.

1020
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,200
Just one piece.

1021
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:35,133
I like this one.

1022
01:22:38,934 --> 01:22:39,800
- Oh!
- Hi.

1023
01:22:39,867 --> 01:22:41,100
Hello.

1024
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:42,633
We just filmed a movie.

1025
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,700
I don't know what this is.

1026
01:22:47,934 --> 01:22:49,567
- You got all these today?
- Yes.

1027
01:22:49,633 --> 01:22:51,333
This will look good on me.

1028
01:22:54,433 --> 01:22:56,100
I think she got this for me.

1029
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,066
- Does it fit?
- Thank you.

1030
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:06,734
She even got us socks.

1031
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:08,367
She got socks for you all.

1032
01:23:08,433 --> 01:23:09,800
- This?
- No.

1033
01:23:10,133 --> 01:23:11,467
She gave me a pair.

1034
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:17,233
- Goodness.
- Is this mine too?

1035
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:18,433
Even got me a perfume.

1036
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:23,333
You two would be horrible older brothers.
Seriously.

1037
01:23:23,433 --> 01:23:25,300
Thank you so much.

1038
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:28,066
- Thank you, Min-si.
- Thank you.

1039
01:23:28,967 --> 01:23:31,967
Min-si, your hats...
They are taking your hats.

1040
01:23:32,033 --> 01:23:33,133
What? Which one?

1041
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:34,200
This one.

1042
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,266
How did you know I like this kind of hats?

1043
01:23:37,367 --> 01:23:39,633
But I got you socks.

1044
01:23:39,734 --> 01:23:42,100
No, I don't want socks.

1045
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:43,934
- I got you socks.
- I want this hat.

1046
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,333
I got you socks.

1047
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,133
- What is this?
- Min-si got them all.

1048
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:51,867
How did she know
I like this kind of stuff?

1049
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,500
That's very expensive.

1050
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,800
- Oh, no. Min-si...
- That's expensive.

1051
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,934
A monkey on a tree

1052
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,533
That looks great on you.

1053
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:04,400
Looks good.

1054
01:24:04,467 --> 01:24:06,367
- Goodness.
- What?

1055
01:24:06,433 --> 01:24:07,834
I mean, Min-si...

1056
01:24:07,934 --> 01:24:11,133
Are these for Halloween?

1057
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:23,533
The highlight of the closing ceremony...

1058
01:24:24,233 --> 01:24:25,767
We're having a game time.

1059
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,934
All right, the recreation time.

1060
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,166
What's the prize?

1061
01:24:36,233 --> 01:24:37,834
- The prize...
- The prize first.

1062
01:24:37,934 --> 01:24:39,700
- Goodness.
- You have a prize?

1063
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,233
- What is it?
- Goodness!

1064
01:24:43,033 --> 01:24:45,100
- That's huge.
- I think it's a trap.

1065
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:47,800
Don't tell me the box is empty.

1066
01:24:47,867 --> 01:24:49,166
No way...

1067
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:52,233
From the side...

1068
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:54,233
We don't know what's inside.

1069
01:24:54,333 --> 01:24:59,400
But these are all valuable prizes
that would remind you of the show.

1070
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:00,900
How do you win the prize?

1071
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,767
It will be a 2-2-2 match.

1072
01:25:02,834 --> 01:25:03,734
A 2-2-2 match?

1073
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:07,200
But we're five.

1074
01:25:07,266 --> 01:25:08,700
- One person short.
- Somebody is joining.

1075
01:25:08,767 --> 01:25:09,600
So...

1076
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:10,734
- Who?
- Well, here.

1077
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,166
Help, Dishwashing Man!

1078
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,500
Help, Dishwashing Man!

1079
01:25:18,133 --> 01:25:20,166
Help, Dishwashing Man!

1080
01:25:27,233 --> 01:25:28,567
Do you remember this jacket?

1081
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,166
- The gloves.
- The dishwashing clothes.

1082
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:34,367
That's six of you, all together.

1083
01:25:34,934 --> 01:25:37,000
Pick one each.

1084
01:25:40,300 --> 01:25:41,900
It will say "1", "2"
and "3" on the spoons.

1085
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:47,266
I can't wait to see it.

1086
01:25:48,467 --> 01:25:49,600
What's your number?

1087
01:25:49,967 --> 01:25:51,567
- Number 1.
- I'm with you!

1088
01:25:53,367 --> 01:25:54,400
Mr. Park.

1089
01:25:55,967 --> 01:25:57,834
- Great.
- Please...

1090
01:25:57,934 --> 01:25:58,867
- Please...
- Three.

1091
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,133
- Number 3.
- No!

1092
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:04,367
Great!

1093
01:26:04,433 --> 01:26:05,934
It looks like you hate it.

1094
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,967
No, I like it. I do.

1095
01:26:13,066 --> 01:26:15,133
You two are like a match made in heaven.

1096
01:26:15,233 --> 01:26:16,066
I mean...

1097
01:26:17,834 --> 01:26:19,667
I can't believe this.

1098
01:26:22,934 --> 01:26:26,433
It will be a speed quiz.
One explains and the other guesses.

1099
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:27,967
- Oh, gosh.
- And...

1100
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:28,900
I'll try my best.

1101
01:26:28,967 --> 01:26:30,800
The team that scores the most...

1102
01:26:31,300 --> 01:26:34,967
You can pick two prizes each.
One team can win four prizes in total.

1103
01:26:35,066 --> 01:26:38,100
The second place can get one prize each.

1104
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:41,166
And the third place
will get whatever is left.

1105
01:26:41,233 --> 01:26:43,333
- And why are you looking at us?
- Then...

1106
01:26:43,433 --> 01:26:45,767
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

1107
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:48,867
I didn't mean to.
So that's how third place gets it.

1108
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:50,467
Shall we start?

1109
01:26:50,567 --> 01:26:52,400
Let's do a Rock Paper Scissors
to decide the order.

1110
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:53,767
- Min-si.
- Woo-shik.

1111
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:56,266
- I'm very bad at this.
- I'm bad at it too.

1112
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,767
You should do this.

1113
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,066
You do it.

1114
01:27:03,133 --> 01:27:05,567
- Rock Paper Scissors.
- This isn't that kind of dress.

1115
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,000
- Do it.
- Rock, paper, scissors!

1116
01:27:08,433 --> 01:27:09,667
Well done.

1117
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:10,633
Rock, paper, scissors!

1118
01:27:10,734 --> 01:27:11,567
- Great!
- Yes!

1119
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:12,767
- So you can choose.
- Yes!

1120
01:27:12,834 --> 01:27:14,367
Want to go first or last?

1121
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,333
What should we do?

1122
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,266
- You should go first.
- Go first?

1123
01:27:18,567 --> 01:27:19,867
- Let's go last.
- Okay.

1124
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:21,533
- Let's go last.
- Going last?

1125
01:27:23,867 --> 01:27:24,800
Shall we go second?

1126
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,734
- Yes.
- Go second.

1127
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,367
Then the first one...
Mr. Lee and Ms. Jung are going first.

1128
01:27:31,266 --> 01:27:33,133
Choose now. That's 1, 2 or 3.

1129
01:27:33,867 --> 01:27:35,166
- I'll pick 2.
- Two.

1130
01:27:35,867 --> 01:27:37,066
The second one is...

1131
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,367
- What?
- This isn't easy.

1132
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,367
Terms related to work.

1133
01:27:41,467 --> 01:27:44,000
I'm better with those words
related to work.

1134
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:45,400
You are better.

1135
01:27:45,467 --> 01:27:46,967
- Right?
- Can I guess them right?

1136
01:27:47,066 --> 01:27:48,433
No, you describe the words.

1137
01:27:48,500 --> 01:27:49,867
- Me?
- No? Should I do it?

1138
01:27:49,934 --> 01:27:51,133
I don't know.

1139
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,300
- You two decide on that.
- What if I don't know the words...

1140
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,834
- And if he guesses...
- Come on, let's play!

1141
01:28:01,533 --> 01:28:03,867
I think it's better if Yu-mi explains it.

1142
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:05,233
I'll do it.

1143
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:07,300
I'll describe and you guess.

1144
01:28:07,367 --> 01:28:09,700
I feel like you will get it right.

1145
01:28:09,767 --> 01:28:11,567
So Yu-mi describes the words.

1146
01:28:11,633 --> 01:28:12,967
- Okay.
- You can stand there.

1147
01:28:13,033 --> 01:28:14,700
Min-si, can you flip the cards?

1148
01:28:14,767 --> 01:28:16,266
- Sure.
- So we can see the words.

1149
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:17,700
You'll the first question here.

1150
01:28:17,767 --> 01:28:20,567
You have four minutes.
There are 15 words to guess.

1151
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,266
- Gosh.
- What's your team name?

1152
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:24,734
Yu-mi's.

1153
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:25,967
Yu-mi's.

1154
01:28:26,700 --> 01:28:27,834
All right, Yu-mi's.

1155
01:28:28,300 --> 01:28:31,133
They have been working together
for eight years.

1156
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:33,567
Let's see how far they can go with this.

1157
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:37,033
Get ready!

1158
01:28:37,834 --> 01:28:38,734
Ready...

1159
01:28:39,734 --> 01:28:40,633
Start.

1160
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:42,233
Start.

1161
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:43,700
You know that thing.

1162
01:28:44,533 --> 01:28:46,700
In addition to your salary...

1163
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:48,500
- A bonus?
- If you work hard...

1164
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:51,133
Another word for it. Something extra.

1165
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:54,066
- Extra pay?
- Yes, in English.

1166
01:28:54,133 --> 01:28:55,066
- In English?
- Yes.

1167
01:28:55,834 --> 01:28:58,266
- Incentive?
- Correct. And next...

1168
01:29:00,367 --> 01:29:03,533
And... What's it called? The kitchen here.

1169
01:29:03,633 --> 01:29:05,066
- What?
- What do you call that?

1170
01:29:05,133 --> 01:29:06,800
The room around the corner.

1171
01:29:06,867 --> 01:29:07,900
- In a company.
- Right.

1172
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:10,767
- Not the CEO Office.
- So she knows.

1173
01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:12,400
There is this room.

1174
01:29:12,734 --> 01:29:13,867
- What room?
- That...

1175
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:16,166
- In this room...
- Yes.

1176
01:29:16,233 --> 01:29:18,633
...there's a fridge and a table.
You can rest here.

1177
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:20,300
- What's it called?
- I don't know.

1178
01:29:20,367 --> 01:29:21,333
I mean...

1179
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:22,300
A kitchen?

1180
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:24,834
Yes, it's like a kitchen.

1181
01:29:26,433 --> 01:29:28,033
It's correct. She knows it well.

1182
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:29,400
- I don't know this one.
- Let's skip it.

1183
01:29:29,467 --> 01:29:30,800
- Pass.
- Pass.

1184
01:29:30,867 --> 01:29:32,633
That...

1185
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:35,367
- You know, at your company...
- Yes.

1186
01:29:35,433 --> 01:29:36,667
Let's say you quit.

1187
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:39,266
It's the money you get.

1188
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:40,567
- The money?
- Yes.

1189
01:29:40,633 --> 01:29:42,500
- Severance pay?
- Correct.

1190
01:29:42,567 --> 01:29:44,400
And... How do I put it?

1191
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:45,934
Outside the work time...

1192
01:29:46,033 --> 01:29:46,867
At night.

1193
01:29:46,967 --> 01:29:48,734
- Extra pay.
- You work at night.

1194
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,700
Night overtime.

1195
01:29:49,767 --> 01:29:50,600
Correct.

1196
01:29:52,633 --> 01:29:53,767
- Woo-shik.
- Yes.

1197
01:29:53,834 --> 01:29:55,266
What happened to him?

1198
01:29:55,367 --> 01:29:57,033
- Recently?
- From an intern...

1199
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,967
- Promotion?
- Yes, promotion.

1200
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,767
But in another word.

1201
01:30:00,834 --> 01:30:02,600
- Promoted?
- No, not that.

1202
01:30:02,667 --> 01:30:03,967
How do I describe it?

1203
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:05,767
- Right! I was...
- Yes?

1204
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:07,600
I was in Jinny's Kitchen.

1205
01:30:07,667 --> 01:30:08,500
Right.

1206
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:10,100
- Then I moved to the HQ.
- Right.

1207
01:30:10,934 --> 01:30:12,767
- That's a good description.
- She's good.

1208
01:30:12,834 --> 01:30:13,800
A transfer?

1209
01:30:15,300 --> 01:30:18,500
That's an old term.

1210
01:30:18,567 --> 01:30:19,433
- Pass.
- Pass.

1211
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,433
Oh, no.

1212
01:30:20,533 --> 01:30:22,166
What are you on our show?

1213
01:30:22,266 --> 01:30:23,734
- The boss.
- No, not that.

1214
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,967
- Director?
- In English.

1215
01:30:25,734 --> 01:30:26,767
- In English?
- Yes.

1216
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,000
President?

1217
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:33,367
All right.

1218
01:30:33,467 --> 01:30:35,667
Mr. President!

1219
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:37,200
- What?
- In English.

1220
01:30:37,266 --> 01:30:39,033
- What?
- That word...

1221
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,266
- Owner?
- We are here...

1222
01:30:40,333 --> 01:30:42,133
- Owner?
- The one that owns this place.

1223
01:30:43,433 --> 01:30:45,967
- No, forget it.
- What?

1224
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,667
- Pass.
- That was close.

1225
01:30:49,734 --> 01:30:52,133
You just said it.

1226
01:30:52,233 --> 01:30:54,333
What happened to him? From an intern...

1227
01:30:54,433 --> 01:30:55,300
- Promotion?
- Right.

1228
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:56,233
Correct!

1229
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:57,767
Now. Jeez...

1230
01:30:58,433 --> 01:30:59,533
What is this?

1231
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:01,233
- I can't describe it.
- It's hard.

1232
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,433
I'll pass. He won't be able to get it.

1233
01:31:03,533 --> 01:31:06,500
- Pass.
- What do we do after this?

1234
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:07,633
- Company dinner?
- Yes.

1235
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:08,667
Correct.

1236
01:31:09,333 --> 01:31:10,900
That was the fastest.

1237
01:31:10,967 --> 01:31:13,033
We're having company dinner today?

1238
01:31:14,433 --> 01:31:16,867
So there is a company.

1239
01:31:16,934 --> 01:31:18,266
- Right.
- All the staff gather together.

1240
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:19,800
You also have this in college.

1241
01:31:19,867 --> 01:31:21,867
When you all first meet, what do you do?

1242
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:23,734
- Orientation?
- Yes.

1243
01:31:25,133 --> 01:31:27,900
And you know... What am I?

1244
01:31:27,967 --> 01:31:30,934
- You are an actress.
- No, you keep quiet. Pass.

1245
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,667
- Pass.
- All right.

1246
01:31:32,734 --> 01:31:33,967
Not a closing ceremony.

1247
01:31:34,033 --> 01:31:34,867
Opening ceremony?

1248
01:31:36,266 --> 01:31:38,166
What am I at Jinny's Kitchen?

1249
01:31:38,233 --> 01:31:40,500
- Director?
- Full name.

1250
01:31:40,567 --> 01:31:42,433
- Executive director?
- That is correct.

1251
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:45,600
We started what a few years ago?

1252
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:46,633
- Uniform?
- Correct.

1253
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:48,800
- Nice!
- How did he...

1254
01:31:48,867 --> 01:31:50,133
How did he know?

1255
01:31:50,200 --> 01:31:53,200
- All right. Flip it.
- Eight, seven,

1256
01:31:53,266 --> 01:31:54,667
- six...
- What? No more?

1257
01:31:54,767 --> 01:31:55,600
...five,

1258
01:31:56,233 --> 01:31:57,100
four...

1259
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,867
Time's up. It's over.

1260
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:03,767
They did well.

1261
01:32:03,834 --> 01:32:05,400
- They did.
- How many did they get?

1262
01:32:05,467 --> 01:32:06,767
Quite a lot. They got...

1263
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:08,900
nine correct.

1264
01:32:12,033 --> 01:32:13,133
It was "CEO."

1265
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:14,667
- CEO.
- CEO.

1266
01:32:14,734 --> 01:32:15,767
Not "president."

1267
01:32:15,834 --> 01:32:17,500
President...

1268
01:32:17,934 --> 01:32:20,166
I'm not a CEO. I'm the president here.

1269
01:32:20,233 --> 01:32:21,133
Really?

1270
01:32:21,233 --> 01:32:24,333
- We thought you were a CEO.
- CEO is a management specialist.

1271
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,033
- Is that so?
- But I own the place.

1272
01:32:27,767 --> 01:32:29,467
He couldn't get it
because he knew it too well.

1273
01:32:29,533 --> 01:32:31,100
- He's the owner.
- He knew too well.

1274
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:32,800
That was the toughest question.

1275
01:32:33,467 --> 01:32:34,367
He did a great job.

1276
01:32:34,467 --> 01:32:35,900
What's that moving thing called?

1277
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,200
Personnel transfer.

1278
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:38,934
That was tough.

1279
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,834
- Right?
- That was hard.

1280
01:32:43,133 --> 01:32:45,100
- So we have to pick.
- And this is...

1281
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,533
- It's random anyway.
- Which one should I pick?

1282
01:32:48,066 --> 01:32:49,200
It's either 1 or 3.

1283
01:32:49,266 --> 01:32:50,266
Either 1 or 3?

1284
01:32:50,834 --> 01:32:52,967
- Three?
- Do you want to go for 3?

1285
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,533
Whatever suits you.

1286
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,934
Let's pick 1 because we have to win.
Number 1, okay.

1287
01:32:59,033 --> 01:33:00,300
- Number 1.
- Number 1.

1288
01:33:01,133 --> 01:33:05,066
These are terms related to food.

1289
01:33:05,166 --> 01:33:06,700
You mean names of food?

1290
01:33:06,767 --> 01:33:09,066
It could be that or ingredients.

1291
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:11,233
- Names related to food.
- This is tougher.

1292
01:33:11,300 --> 01:33:15,600
I think if Mr. Lee monitored our show...

1293
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:19,033
If he watched our show thoroughly,

1294
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:20,834
he would know.

1295
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:25,333
- That could be iffy.
- Please be honest.

1296
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:26,934
How many episodes did you watch?

1297
01:33:27,033 --> 01:33:29,734
Until the fourth one.
Then I stopped watching.

1298
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:31,900
So he watched them all.

1299
01:33:32,467 --> 01:33:36,133
Did you concentrate? Or did you watch it
while washing dishes at home?

1300
01:33:40,467 --> 01:33:41,467
Let's do it now.

1301
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:42,500
Shall we start?

1302
01:33:42,567 --> 01:33:43,500
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

1303
01:33:43,567 --> 01:33:44,533
We'll begin.

1304
01:33:46,867 --> 01:33:48,367
Gosh, I'm nervous.

1305
01:33:51,133 --> 01:33:52,633
Why am I getting nervous?

1306
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:54,767
Ready?

1307
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:58,066
Start!

1308
01:33:58,800 --> 01:33:59,767
Start!

1309
01:34:01,433 --> 01:34:04,767
You coat fruit with sugar.
It's a popular snack...

1310
01:34:04,834 --> 01:34:05,800
Tanghulu.

1311
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:15,967
This is commonly sold in Iceland.

1312
01:34:16,033 --> 01:34:18,266
It's a type of soup.

1313
01:34:18,333 --> 01:34:19,700
- The type of meat...
- Soup?

1314
01:34:19,767 --> 01:34:20,867
- Right.
- Lamb stew.

1315
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:25,834
My goodness.

1316
01:34:25,934 --> 01:34:27,600
My goodness.

1317
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:28,967
- This is...
- It's recent.

1318
01:34:29,033 --> 01:34:32,567
I don't know what this is either.
It's a type of sweet dessert.

1319
01:34:32,633 --> 01:34:35,700
- I don't know it either.
- It's in trend these days.

1320
01:34:35,767 --> 01:34:38,667
- It has the name of a region. Well...
- A region?

1321
01:34:38,734 --> 01:34:41,834
It's a city in the Middle East.

1322
01:34:42,834 --> 01:34:44,734
You might not get the full name.

1323
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:45,767
Pass.

1324
01:34:49,233 --> 01:34:51,600
When we made galbijjim,

1325
01:34:51,667 --> 01:34:54,767
we added a lot of this juice.

1326
01:34:55,967 --> 01:34:57,800
- Pear juice.
- Correct!

1327
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,333
Correct!

1328
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:03,033
It was sold a lot in bakeries
back in the day.

1329
01:35:03,133 --> 01:35:05,567
- In bakeries?
- Yes, bakeries sold this a lot.

1330
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:10,867
This is a huge type of...

1331
01:35:10,967 --> 01:35:11,867
Mammoth bread?

1332
01:35:11,967 --> 01:35:13,233
Yes!

1333
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:14,133
- All right.
- What?

1334
01:35:14,233 --> 01:35:15,433
No!

1335
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:16,500
How did he know?

1336
01:35:16,567 --> 01:35:18,166
- What?
- No.

1337
01:35:18,233 --> 01:35:20,600
It's well known as a very bland dish.

1338
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,867
My favorite restaurant for this is...

1339
01:35:23,934 --> 01:35:25,166
They sell...

1340
01:35:25,233 --> 01:35:26,100
Hold on.

1341
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:28,033
- There's...
- Naengmyeon!

1342
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,000
- Pyeongyang naengmyeon.
- Correct!

1343
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:32,133
What? Well...

1344
01:35:32,233 --> 01:35:34,834
It's the same thing as the previous one.

1345
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:36,100
But this is...

1346
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:40,467
What was the name of the director
of Youn's Kitchen 2?

1347
01:35:40,567 --> 01:35:41,767
- Youn's Kitchen 2?
- Yes.

1348
01:35:41,834 --> 01:35:43,700
- Let me see. Jin-ju?
- What comes next?

1349
01:35:43,767 --> 01:35:44,600
Jinju naengmyeon?

1350
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:45,700
Correct.

1351
01:35:50,066 --> 01:35:52,567
This is unbelievable!

1352
01:35:54,533 --> 01:35:56,500
The next one is...

1353
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:58,500
- a dairy product.
- Dairy product.

1354
01:35:58,567 --> 01:36:01,900
It's dairy and it's usually frozen.

1355
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:03,767
- Frozen.
- You eat it like dessert.

1356
01:36:03,834 --> 01:36:05,533
- Yogurt?
- Yes, yogurt...

1357
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,967
What comes after yogurt?

1358
01:36:07,033 --> 01:36:08,033
Yogurt...

1359
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:10,066
Not hard.

1360
01:36:11,200 --> 01:36:12,567
Not hard like an ice pop.

1361
01:36:12,633 --> 01:36:13,867
- Not hard.
- An ice pop?

1362
01:36:13,967 --> 01:36:16,133
I'm sure you have it in the freezer.

1363
01:36:16,233 --> 01:36:18,767
No, he doesn't.

1364
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,367
- Pass.
- Pass.

1365
01:36:20,433 --> 01:36:22,033
- That was close.
- He almost got it.

1366
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,800
I made this on the first day in Iceland.

1367
01:36:24,867 --> 01:36:26,700
I made it for nine hours.

1368
01:36:26,767 --> 01:36:28,800
I worked on bell peppers all day...

1369
01:36:28,867 --> 01:36:30,467
- Yakgochujang?
- Correct!

1370
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:34,800
They eat it in their own style
in each region.

1371
01:36:34,867 --> 01:36:37,667
Some add salt and some add sugar.

1372
01:36:37,734 --> 01:36:38,934
Kong-guksu?

1373
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:40,266
- Yes.
- Correct.

1374
01:36:40,367 --> 01:36:41,700
I don't know what this is.

1375
01:36:41,767 --> 01:36:43,066
- Pass.
- What is this?

1376
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:45,800
- Pass.
- Ten, nine,

1377
01:36:46,367 --> 01:36:48,967
eight, seven,

1378
01:36:49,033 --> 01:36:52,033
- six, five...
- Pass.

1379
01:36:52,967 --> 01:36:54,834
- ...four...
- Just now...

1380
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:56,433
- ...three...
- Can he?

1381
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:58,333
- ...two, one.
- I don't know.

1382
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,834
- It's over!
- It's over!

1383
01:36:59,934 --> 01:37:01,233
How many did he get?

1384
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:02,133
All right.

1385
01:37:02,767 --> 01:37:06,233
Mr. Park and Mr. Rhee's score is...

1386
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:10,133
eight.

1387
01:37:10,233 --> 01:37:12,333
We won!

1388
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:14,133
- Yogurt ice cream.
- Yogurt ice cream.

1389
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:15,667
Yogurt ice cream?

1390
01:37:15,767 --> 01:37:17,033
Wow, we won!

1391
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,033
It's all right. Well done.

1392
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:22,333
We did a great job.

1393
01:37:24,500 --> 01:37:25,767
- What do we do?
- My gosh.

1394
01:37:25,834 --> 01:37:28,166
- How are we doing this?
- Which one is better?

1395
01:37:28,233 --> 01:37:29,367
How should we do this?

1396
01:37:29,433 --> 01:37:30,900
- What is this?
- What's the theme?

1397
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:33,133
- What's left?
- Luckily, it's something easy.

1398
01:37:33,233 --> 01:37:34,767
The last theme is...

1399
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:36,767
words related to Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

1400
01:37:36,834 --> 01:37:38,333
You describe and I guess?

1401
01:37:38,934 --> 01:37:40,767
- I don't know.
- Can you do that?

1402
01:37:41,266 --> 01:37:43,133
Which one works for you better?

1403
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:44,433
I'm not confident.

1404
01:37:45,533 --> 01:37:47,333
I don't know. Do whatever suits you.

1405
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:48,433
Then I'll guess.

1406
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,834
- Okay.
- I'll guess then.

1407
01:37:51,734 --> 01:37:53,934
Can I tell her the number of letters?

1408
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,500
- No.
- I see.

1409
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:58,500
- My gosh.
- This is the easiest one.

1410
01:37:58,567 --> 01:37:59,767
This is the easiest.

1411
01:37:59,834 --> 01:38:01,767
We can do this!

1412
01:38:01,867 --> 01:38:04,633
- I think they'll win.
- Yes, I agree.

1413
01:38:04,734 --> 01:38:05,667
I'm sorry.

1414
01:38:05,734 --> 01:38:06,700
You can do this.

1415
01:38:06,767 --> 01:38:07,667
Shall we start?

1416
01:38:07,767 --> 01:38:10,100
- All right.
- Shall we? Ready.

1417
01:38:11,033 --> 01:38:12,233
Start!

1418
01:38:12,333 --> 01:38:13,233
Start!

1419
01:38:13,934 --> 01:38:15,400
What is this?

1420
01:38:15,467 --> 01:38:18,567
We said this out loud before we started.

1421
01:38:18,767 --> 01:38:20,266
- What was...
- Five hygiene rules.

1422
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:21,567
There you go.

1423
01:38:21,633 --> 01:38:22,900
There you go.

1424
01:38:22,967 --> 01:38:26,300
We put on this hot thing.
What is this called?

1425
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:28,734
- Stove?
- Yes, that.

1426
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:29,967
But it's electric.

1427
01:38:30,033 --> 01:38:31,166
- English.
- Induction?

1428
01:38:31,233 --> 01:38:32,233
- Correct.
- You got it.

1429
01:38:32,333 --> 01:38:34,934
When we made yakgochujang...

1430
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,133
- Bell peppers.
- Correct.

1431
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,333
And when customers entered, I did this.

1432
01:38:39,433 --> 01:38:42,800
We couldn't take reservations.
So I gave them this.

1433
01:38:42,867 --> 01:38:43,700
Waiting...

1434
01:38:43,800 --> 01:38:45,667
Yes, that.

1435
01:38:45,734 --> 01:38:47,166
You have to write it.

1436
01:38:47,233 --> 01:38:48,266
- Waiting?
- I mean...

1437
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:49,867
- Waiting ticket?
- No, yes.

1438
01:38:49,934 --> 01:38:51,000
- Waiting?
- It's this...

1439
01:38:51,066 --> 01:38:52,367
- Waiting ticket?
- I said it.

1440
01:38:52,433 --> 01:38:53,300
Pass.

1441
01:38:53,367 --> 01:38:55,934
No, you were so close.

1442
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,433
No, you were so close.

1443
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,667
This country...

1444
01:39:01,734 --> 01:39:04,133
- Reykjavik.
- No, people in this country...

1445
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,233
"We are this, so it's okay.
Give me more drinks."

1446
01:39:07,300 --> 01:39:09,433
- We are this. We can drink more?
- We are this.

1447
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,633
We are the Vikings!

1448
01:39:10,700 --> 01:39:11,934
Yes!

1449
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,166
The dish that was sold the most.

1450
01:39:15,633 --> 01:39:16,567
Dolsot-bibimbap!

1451
01:39:16,633 --> 01:39:18,867
- No.
- Twibap ice cream.

1452
01:39:18,967 --> 01:39:20,100
Yes, but...

1453
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,033
- Twibap.
- Correct.

1454
01:39:21,100 --> 01:39:22,133
- Correct.
- Twibap.

1455
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:23,266
- Right.
- Correct.

1456
01:39:23,767 --> 01:39:25,600
Hey. What is this?

1457
01:39:26,667 --> 01:39:29,033
- Baseball.
- And what do you call this?

1458
01:39:29,133 --> 01:39:30,000
- We did this.
- This?

1459
01:39:30,066 --> 01:39:32,967
We did this. Why did we do it? What for?

1460
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:35,333
- To get promoted?
- No.

1461
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,467
That's right.

1462
01:39:36,533 --> 01:39:37,533
Seo-jin said, "Hey..."

1463
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,667
- Today's chef.
- Yes.

1464
01:39:39,734 --> 01:39:42,100
He compared it to this baseball term.

1465
01:39:42,834 --> 01:39:44,066
Pitcher, tryout.

1466
01:39:44,166 --> 01:39:46,200
Yes. Combine those two words.

1467
01:39:46,300 --> 01:39:47,867
- Pitcher tryout.
- No, combine those two.

1468
01:39:47,934 --> 01:39:48,867
Tryout pitcher.

1469
01:39:48,934 --> 01:39:51,166
Remove one of the letters.

1470
01:39:51,266 --> 01:39:52,800
- Select pitcher.
- No!

1471
01:39:52,867 --> 01:39:54,600
- Starting pitcher.
- There you go!

1472
01:39:54,667 --> 01:39:55,834
- No!
- Starting pitcher.

1473
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:56,800
There you go!

1474
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,934
- We saw this green thing there.
- The aurora.

1475
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:03,834
- Right.
- Correct.

1476
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,033
- She's good.
- This is...

1477
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,900
This is what Min-si likes.

1478
01:40:06,967 --> 01:40:08,900
You had this every morning.

1479
01:40:08,967 --> 01:40:11,800
- In the evening too?
- Red ginseng concentrate?

1480
01:40:11,867 --> 01:40:13,667
What? Did you have it alone?

1481
01:40:14,834 --> 01:40:16,900
- You drink this fruit.
- Blueberry, juice!

1482
01:40:16,967 --> 01:40:18,900
- There you go.
- Correct.

1483
01:40:18,967 --> 01:40:20,000
Well...

1484
01:40:20,100 --> 01:40:21,266
Well...

1485
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:23,500
As soon as we open... I'll pass this.

1486
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:28,066
This is you.

1487
01:40:28,133 --> 01:40:29,033
- Slicer.
- Yes!

1488
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:29,934
Correct!

1489
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,100
Where did we do this?

1490
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:32,133
- Reykjavik.
- Yes.

1491
01:40:33,066 --> 01:40:34,100
This is hard.

1492
01:40:34,166 --> 01:40:35,867
- What is this?
- You can do it.

1493
01:40:35,934 --> 01:40:37,767
- You can do it.
- What is this?

1494
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,433
Pass.

1495
01:40:39,533 --> 01:40:40,767
Pass.

1496
01:40:40,834 --> 01:40:42,333
This is...

1497
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,066
- We brought this.
- A sign?

1498
01:40:46,133 --> 01:40:47,066
No.

1499
01:40:47,133 --> 01:40:48,300
That thing.

1500
01:40:48,367 --> 01:40:50,900
I know! Dishwasher.

1501
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:55,000
We were working hard.

1502
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:57,100
- We had to take a break.
- A break.

1503
01:40:57,166 --> 01:40:58,433
No.

1504
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,967
- Morning and afternoon.
- Waiting time? Break time?

1505
01:41:01,033 --> 01:41:02,166
- There you go.
- Correct!

1506
01:41:02,266 --> 01:41:03,233
- Break time.
- Right.

1507
01:41:04,367 --> 01:41:05,633
Done.

1508
01:41:05,734 --> 01:41:06,934
Done.

1509
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:07,967
What? Is that it?

1510
01:41:08,033 --> 01:41:09,000
Yes!

1511
01:41:09,066 --> 01:41:11,000
They got everything except for one or two.

1512
01:41:11,066 --> 01:41:12,700
In two and a half minutes...

1513
01:41:12,767 --> 01:41:14,867
- They got everything.
- They got everything.

1514
01:41:14,934 --> 01:41:15,934
They're in first place.

1515
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,367
- It was hilarious.
- Eleven correct. You win!

1516
01:41:22,834 --> 01:41:24,533
You are so good at guessing.

1517
01:41:24,633 --> 01:41:26,200
You're good at explaining.

1518
01:41:27,066 --> 01:41:29,200
Woo-shik and Min-si are in first place.

1519
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:32,133
We also did a great job.

1520
01:41:32,233 --> 01:41:34,300
We're in second place. That's amazing.

1521
01:41:45,767 --> 01:41:48,934
Woo-shik and Min-si can choose two each.
Woo-shik first?

1522
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:49,900
I'll take...

1523
01:41:50,700 --> 01:41:52,467
the one on the left. The biggest box.

1524
01:41:52,533 --> 01:41:53,433
That's 101.

1525
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:56,433
Then I'll take that.

1526
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:58,066
That small one on the far side.

1527
01:41:58,133 --> 01:42:00,200
That small one on the far side. Okay.

1528
01:42:00,300 --> 01:42:01,967
Let me get this one for you first.

1529
01:42:02,033 --> 01:42:03,266
Next...

1530
01:42:03,367 --> 01:42:04,967
- Here.
- It's quite heavy.

1531
01:42:05,033 --> 01:42:06,533
- What's next?
- Don't touch it.

1532
01:42:06,600 --> 01:42:08,700
Don't touch it.
You get two, please open them.

1533
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,200
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1534
01:42:10,266 --> 01:42:11,467
I'll work hard.

1535
01:42:11,533 --> 01:42:14,767
I worked really hard.

1536
01:42:15,834 --> 01:42:17,033
Woo-shik's prizes...

1537
01:42:17,133 --> 01:42:18,433
The first one is...

1538
01:42:18,533 --> 01:42:19,834
What would it be?

1539
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:21,133
Here!

1540
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:22,300
- What is it?
- What's that?

1541
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:23,233
- What is it?
- A sticker?

1542
01:42:24,066 --> 01:42:24,900
What is it?

1543
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:26,934
What's an ending fairy coupon?

1544
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,300
Congratulations!

1545
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:33,700
AN ENDING FAIRY COUPON

1546
01:42:33,767 --> 01:42:36,266
So the last scene of director's edit

1547
01:42:36,333 --> 01:42:40,166
will end with Woo-shik's
most handsome face.

1548
01:42:42,767 --> 01:42:45,533
But your dance doesn't look that happy.

1549
01:42:47,066 --> 01:42:48,000
Right.

1550
01:42:49,633 --> 01:42:51,367
Okay, thank you.

1551
01:42:51,433 --> 01:42:53,967
That was just to entertain you.
The real prize is...

1552
01:42:54,033 --> 01:42:55,033
This one.

1553
01:42:57,033 --> 01:42:58,633
We got valuable stuff for prizes.

1554
01:42:58,734 --> 01:43:00,233
- What is it?
- What can it be?

1555
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:01,233
Be careful.

1556
01:43:02,233 --> 01:43:03,500
It's a bit heavy.

1557
01:43:03,567 --> 01:43:04,834
The size of it is...

1558
01:43:05,633 --> 01:43:06,533
What can it be?

1559
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:09,200
- What?
- What?

1560
01:43:09,266 --> 01:43:10,700
- What is it?
- What is it?

1561
01:43:11,967 --> 01:43:12,934
What is it?

1562
01:43:14,533 --> 01:43:15,734
My gosh!

1563
01:43:20,934 --> 01:43:22,100
My gosh.

1564
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,100
It's a stockpot.

1565
01:43:29,533 --> 01:43:31,934
You would need it at your place.

1566
01:43:34,033 --> 01:43:35,667
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1567
01:43:35,734 --> 01:43:37,300
Now, you can make

1568
01:43:37,767 --> 01:43:40,033
gomtang or galbijjim at home.

1569
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:41,333
- I see.
- A steamer.

1570
01:43:43,300 --> 01:43:46,700
I really needed one. Thank you.

1571
01:43:46,767 --> 01:43:48,166
Gosh...

1572
01:43:55,367 --> 01:43:56,433
My gosh.

1573
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:58,000
I'm so jealous, Woo-shik.

1574
01:43:58,066 --> 01:43:59,567
I really needed this.

1575
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:03,400
Congratulations. Next, Min-si.
Pick two boxes.

1576
01:44:03,467 --> 01:44:05,633
Aren't these all the same? I hope not...

1577
01:44:05,700 --> 01:44:08,734
I'll take the one at the bottom.

1578
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:11,533
- The bottom one.
- And the small one.

1579
01:44:11,600 --> 01:44:13,734
Min-si, big boxes are not good.

1580
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:16,066
They can't be the same.

1581
01:44:16,133 --> 01:44:17,367
- Of course not.
- Right.

1582
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,867
- This feels like a good one.
- The small one on top.

1583
01:44:20,934 --> 01:44:22,133
I feel like they're something good.

1584
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:23,533
Isn't it like a gift voucher?

1585
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:27,066
Funny prizes have all been opened.

1586
01:44:27,633 --> 01:44:30,266
Woo-shik took them all.

1587
01:44:30,367 --> 01:44:31,934
Funny prizes are all gone.

1588
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,900
Goodness.

1589
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,300
- Goodness.
- What is it?

1590
01:44:36,834 --> 01:44:37,667
- What?
- What?

1591
01:44:39,133 --> 01:44:40,433
It's a flag!

1592
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,467
I really wanted that.

1593
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:47,934
Wow. I really wanted it.

1594
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,367
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

1595
01:44:52,467 --> 01:44:54,900
- That's a nice one.
- Is it that flag?

1596
01:44:54,967 --> 01:44:56,033
Yes, it's that flag.

1597
01:44:56,133 --> 01:44:57,767
I thought it was a designer scarf.

1598
01:44:57,867 --> 01:44:59,500
Thank you.

1599
01:44:59,567 --> 01:45:02,166
- I'm sorry. You don't look so happy.
- No! I love it.

1600
01:45:02,266 --> 01:45:03,767
I love it.

1601
01:45:03,834 --> 01:45:04,934
Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

1602
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,266
And what could this be?

1603
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:08,867
This one must be nice.

1604
01:45:08,934 --> 01:45:10,433
This looks like a nice prize.

1605
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,367
It can't be another stockpot.

1606
01:45:12,433 --> 01:45:14,900
What?

1607
01:45:16,033 --> 01:45:16,867
Nice.

1608
01:45:16,967 --> 01:45:18,433
It's a summer blanket.

1609
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:24,400
It's a summer blanket set.
Congratulations.

1610
01:45:25,934 --> 01:45:27,200
Nice!

1611
01:45:32,367 --> 01:45:35,000
But I feel anxious that Min-si got that.

1612
01:45:35,066 --> 01:45:38,133
Seo-jin's eyes are shaking.

1613
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:39,600
A summer blanket!

1614
01:45:44,467 --> 01:45:45,433
Now, Yu-mi.

1615
01:45:45,500 --> 01:45:47,233
- Open it.
- Please open it.

1616
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:49,633
- Well, this is...
- What is it?

1617
01:45:50,033 --> 01:45:51,000
Don't tell me...

1618
01:45:52,367 --> 01:45:53,700
- What is it?
- What?

1619
01:45:53,767 --> 01:45:55,867
It's gold!

1620
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:57,300
What?

1621
01:45:57,367 --> 01:45:58,400
- Is it gold?
- My gosh.

1622
01:45:58,867 --> 01:46:01,133
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

1623
01:46:04,700 --> 01:46:06,433
So this is a good thing.

1624
01:46:06,500 --> 01:46:07,633
Real gold.

1625
01:46:07,734 --> 01:46:09,333
Take the warranty. Keep it.

1626
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:10,600
I see it.

1627
01:46:11,567 --> 01:46:13,266
Is this pure silver?

1628
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:15,867
That's stainless.

1629
01:46:17,934 --> 01:46:18,900
This isn't silver?

1630
01:46:18,967 --> 01:46:19,934
This makes...

1631
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,300
- So the best prize is...
- Goodness.

1632
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:23,233
You can't change it.

1633
01:46:23,867 --> 01:46:25,300
What is it?

1634
01:46:25,367 --> 01:46:26,667
This is so heavy.

1635
01:46:26,734 --> 01:46:27,767
What is it?

1636
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:33,667
A food processor.

1637
01:46:35,367 --> 01:46:37,533
It's heavy. It's really heavy.

1638
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:39,633
Congratulations.

1639
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:44,033
You got a food waste composter!

1640
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:46,667
- We picked the nicest ones.
- Right, that's great.

1641
01:46:51,633 --> 01:46:52,633
Last one.

1642
01:46:52,967 --> 01:46:54,233
- Should I take one?
- Sure.

1643
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:55,433
Gosh.

1644
01:46:55,500 --> 01:46:57,967
You open it and see if you can divide it.

1645
01:46:58,066 --> 01:46:59,200
You can split it.

1646
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:00,600
We can split it?

1647
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:03,000
It's the last prize. What would it be?

1648
01:47:03,066 --> 01:47:04,066
What is it?

1649
01:47:11,033 --> 01:47:13,734
Mr. Park should keep it. Show it to us.

1650
01:47:13,834 --> 01:47:15,767
- Gosh, it's just...
- What is it?

1651
01:47:15,834 --> 01:47:16,800
What is it?

1652
01:47:17,166 --> 01:47:18,567
Congratulations.

1653
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,033
This is very nice to grab hot stuff.

1654
01:47:24,867 --> 01:47:28,934
- Not many people have this at home.
- I know. I don't have it either.

1655
01:47:29,633 --> 01:47:33,066
You can use it when you cook something
with your ttukbaegi.

1656
01:47:33,133 --> 01:47:34,500
It'll come in handy.

1657
01:47:35,266 --> 01:47:38,200
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1658
01:48:24,300 --> 01:48:27,033
- You are working overtime.
- Let's do it one more time.

1659
01:48:33,533 --> 01:48:34,367
All right.

1660
01:48:35,967 --> 01:48:36,934
Ten.

1661
01:48:37,834 --> 01:48:38,834
Nine.

1662
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:41,066
Eight.

1663
01:48:42,066 --> 01:48:42,967
Seven.

1664
01:48:43,633 --> 01:48:44,700
Six.

1665
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,400
Five.

1666
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,200
Four.

1667
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:49,834
Three.

1668
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,467
Two.

1669
01:48:52,233 --> 01:48:53,133
One.

1670
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:04,700
- That's it.
- Thank you.
