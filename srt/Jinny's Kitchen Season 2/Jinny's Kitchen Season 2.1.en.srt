00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,433
This is amazing.

3
00:00:46,233 --> 00:00:48,667
It tastes even better than H***.

4
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:50,100
Hey, did you hear him?

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,734
He said it's better than H***.
You heard him.

6
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,700
Right.

7
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:57,467
Should I open up
a gomtang restaurant here?

8
00:00:57,533 --> 00:00:58,400
What?

9
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,633
Be safe, Tae-hyung.

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,467
- Okay.
- The military and all.

11
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,533
I have a dream to fulfill when I return.

12
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:29,266
I want my daily routine to be healthier.

13
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,400
I want to be physically healthier too.

14
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:34,200
I want my mind to be clear too.

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,734
I want everything to change

16
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,200
when I return.

17
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,200
You have a healthy mindset.

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,800
So I told him

19
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,867
that it'll last for only a month.

20
00:01:47,867 --> 00:01:49,834
Still, I'm really excited for it.

21
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,700
Jinny's Kitchen Season 2.

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,767
Thinking of having a junior chef.

23
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,000
All right.

24
00:01:57,066 --> 00:01:59,000
Some words to his junior.

25
00:01:59,066 --> 00:02:00,800
- Can I cross my arms?
- Of course.

26
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,300
They're your junior, whoever they may be.

27
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:06,133
- Give an encouraging word.
- First of all,

28
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:08,200
you can't be too slow.

29
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,433
You have to be faster.

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,600
Move quickly

31
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,400
and fulfill your duty as the youngest.

32
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,734
And when I return,

33
00:02:18,834 --> 00:02:21,767
I hope you'll be adjusted here.

34
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,834
Whoever you may be,

35
00:02:26,934 --> 00:02:28,066
I'll see you then.

36
00:02:30,767 --> 00:02:32,133
That'd cheer him up.

37
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,266
I can't wait
to see this message being aired.

38
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,033
- Hello.
- Hello.

39
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,734
What on earth is Egg Music Festival?

40
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:02,934
- Huh?
- Would you like to join it?

41
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:05,734
- Seriously.
- Lee Juck is the judge.

42
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:08,800
Aren't you guys doing things
with no standards?

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
Our YouTube channel...

44
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,367
Gosh, what is Egg Music Festival?

45
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:14,367
Try it.

46
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:16,567
Gosh, seriously.

47
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:18,400
How many of us are here?

48
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,700
How many of us are here?

49
00:03:19,767 --> 00:03:20,767
Four.

50
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,567
Since Tae-hyung is in the military.

51
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:24,900
You can sit in the middle.

52
00:03:30,934 --> 00:03:32,066
- Hello.
- Oh, hi.

53
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,066
- Hello.
- You cut your hair.

54
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,367
Well, to keep it clean.

55
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,567
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:41,433
Hello.

57
00:03:41,533 --> 00:03:44,166
Hello. Gosh, I come here too often now.

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,200
- Gosh, Woo-shik.
- Oh, hello.

59
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,734
Why wouldn't you come faster, Woo-shik?

60
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:50,133
- I'm sorry.
- Okay?

61
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:54,600
Woo-shik is dressed like a hotel manager.

62
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,133
What is this?

63
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,567
There are quite a lot of chairs.

64
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:03,000
How many chairs are there?

65
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,266
Why are you in such a good mood?

66
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:08,200
Do you have good news?

67
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,200
No, not at all.

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,166
Woo-shik, you seem way too dressed.

69
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,967
- Come on. No.
- Woo-shik, are you expecting someone?

70
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,033
Hello. Oh, hello, Director Na.

71
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,533
You look so formally dressed.

72
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:19,400
Right. I thought today
was the only chance.

73
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,567
- Our director is here.
- Hello.

74
00:04:21,633 --> 00:04:22,867
- Hello.
- Hey, Yu-mi.

75
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,200
- Hello.
- What? You're wearing a skirt.

76
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,200
But the weather is...

77
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:28,967
- But Yu-mi,
- Why do I look so hot?

78
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:30,400
I think your skirt won't really show.

79
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:31,567
It's okay.

80
00:04:31,633 --> 00:04:32,600
He's right.

81
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,834
When the show airs, it'll be hot.

82
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,300
Someone must be coming to
fill up this seat, right?

83
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,367
By the way, why is your shirt so glittery?

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,033
Mr. Lee.

85
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,667
- The diamonds...
- It must be expensive.

86
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,567
Don't pay attention to me.
What's wrong with you?

87
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,834
Let's talk about
what everyone is expecting.

88
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,166
What do you want us to talk about?

89
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,934
Well, right here...

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,166
The most important part...

91
00:04:57,133 --> 00:04:58,100
Right now...

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,400
Why is this chair empty?

93
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,166
- Is that what you're curious about?
- Yes.

94
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:04,667
They need to be here
so we can start altogether.

95
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:11,066
I mean like, who they are,
and whom we'd like to have.

96
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,867
Woo-shik, who would you prefer
to have on our team?

97
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:15,233
Do you have any standards
for our new youngest member?

98
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,567
Well, instead of that,

99
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:19,100
I'm more curious

100
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:20,700
about my new position.

101
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,000
Like, are they my junior,

102
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,533
- or around my level?
- You're curious about that.

103
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:24,633
You're so selfish.

104
00:05:24,734 --> 00:05:25,867
Well, it's because

105
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,667
I want to know if I can kick them around.

106
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,166
- Kick them around?
- I mean...

107
00:05:30,266 --> 00:05:31,734
If someone joins us...

108
00:05:31,834 --> 00:05:32,900
I mean, in this day and age,

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,433
you can kick a newbie around?

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,166
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Careful what you say.

111
00:05:36,266 --> 00:05:39,600
Will they be working in the kitchen?

112
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,900
Or will they be waiting tables?

113
00:05:41,367 --> 00:05:43,500
Because if they work in the kitchen,

114
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:44,533
they wouldn't run into me...

115
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,700
But then again, I may work
in the kitchen this time.

116
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
That's right.

117
00:05:49,333 --> 00:05:51,633
Why would you decide where you work?

118
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,433
My gosh.

119
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:55,166
He's one funny guy.

120
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:56,867
Why would you decide where you work?

121
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,533
- I take that back.
- That's hilarious.

122
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,266
- Okay?
- He's right.

123
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:01,600
Right.

124
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,934
So I... actually...

125
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,633
He's right.

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,000
Still, share us what you've thought of.

127
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,133
What do you want to do this time?

128
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,200
Whether I work in the kitchen
or elsewhere,

129
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,667
I want to share the experience

130
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:17,000
of working on difficult things with them.

131
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,200
So I think they should be

132
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,667
younger than me.

133
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:25,266
So in the previous season,

134
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:27,133
you held it back

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,166
even when it was difficult
because you were the youngest?

136
00:06:29,233 --> 00:06:30,066
So if someone joins us...

137
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,066
He wants someone younger than him,
it's obvious.

138
00:06:33,734 --> 00:06:35,633
He doesn't need anything else.

139
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,600
He just wants to be comfortable.

140
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,233
How do you feel?

141
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,200
I couldn't sleep a wink last night

142
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,400
because I was so nervous.

143
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
No one knows I'm coming, right?

144
00:06:58,767 --> 00:06:59,900
- They're here?
- Yes.

145
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,066
All right, then.

146
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,400
Think of it as an interview
for a new recruit.

147
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,567
Ask a lot of questions if you have any.

148
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,934
Gosh, this tension.

149
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:09,533
I know this feeling so well.

150
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
It's because...

151
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,166
They must be really nervous.

152
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,233
Why am I getting nervous?

153
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:16,633
You should take good care of them.

154
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,700
- Whoever it is...
- Hold on.

155
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,700
- I'll bring them in.
- we're the older ones.

156
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,300
Seo-jun came in like this.

157
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,467
- Right. When Seo-jun entered...
- Gosh, seriously.

158
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:28,667
- Back then, yes.
- That tension...

159
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,000
I was really nervous
when he turned around.

160
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,233
I was really nervous.

161
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:42,867
She's really nervous right now.

162
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:45,066
The newbie is here.

163
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,734
Oh, my...

164
00:07:50,734 --> 00:07:51,600
Oh, my.

165
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:52,667
The newbie.

166
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,700
- Ko Min-si.
- Hello.

167
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,233
Hello.

168
00:07:57,734 --> 00:08:00,133
- Ko Min-si.
- Hello.

169
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:04,333
- Ko Min-si.
- Hello.

170
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,800
- What?
- Hello.

171
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:10,367
Hello.

172
00:08:10,467 --> 00:08:11,367
Who is it?

173
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,033
- Who is that?
- Hello.

174
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,266
Ko Min-si!

175
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,233
- What?
- Ko Min-si!

176
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,433
Hello.

177
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:18,867
Hello.

178
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,000
Hello.

179
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,967
- Hello.
- Min-si.

180
00:08:23,066 --> 00:08:24,367
Hello, everyone.

181
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,300
It's nice to meet you.

182
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,433
Hello.

183
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,433
- Mr. Lee. Guess who this is.
- It's been a while.

184
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,667
She said she's Ko Min-si.

185
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:34,300
We did <i>The Witch </i>together.

186
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,433
- He didn't recognize her.
- Hello, Seo-jin.

187
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:38,133
Which works was she in?

188
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:39,500
- <i>The Witch</i>.
- <i>The Witch</i>.

189
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
- What?
- <i>The Witch</i>. We did it together.

190
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,567
- Weren't you in that one?
- I was off the mark.

191
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,300
We were both in <i>The Witch</i>.

192
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,700
- When you did <i>The Witch</i>?
- Yes.

193
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:50,033
- I did a drama with you too.
- Yes.

194
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:51,400
Which drama?

195
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:53,767
We did a drama called <i>Live</i>.

196
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,700
- Where you played a cop?
- Yes.

197
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,467
- I see. Okay.
- Yes, I was a cop.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,500
- Before that, we did <i>The Witch </i>together.
- The Witch. Yes.

199
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,333
Yes, we were in <i>The Witch</i>.

200
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,033
Before you joined us,
we were talking about who'd join us.

201
00:09:05,133 --> 00:09:06,934
We talked a lot about it.

202
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:11,000
But Woo-shik is the one
who has the strictest conditions.

203
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,233
Me?

204
00:09:13,066 --> 00:09:14,233
What do you think...

205
00:09:14,734 --> 00:09:16,166
Woo-shik is really...

206
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:17,233
He's such a stick in the mud.

207
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,333
That's not true.

208
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you happy with her, Woo-shik?

209
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,900
Well, should I leave?

210
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,467
You were being so picky.
So do you like her?

211
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,400
No.

212
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,033
But as far as I remember,

213
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:34,033
even when we were shooting <i>The Witch</i>,

214
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I was never...

215
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
How do you put it?

216
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,066
You're stuttering a lot.

217
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:44,767
Should I leave?

218
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,200
What I'm saying is,

219
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:50,700
I was criticized a lot on set.

220
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:52,066
- Yes.
- Right.

221
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,333
So I can't dare to say...

222
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Who criticized whom?
Oh, she criticized you?

223
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,633
- Yes, on set.
- My character did

224
00:09:57,734 --> 00:09:59,500
- in the scenes.
- Oh, I see. Her character did.

225
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,166
My character was a murderer.

226
00:10:03,266 --> 00:10:05,100
But she was an ordinary citizen.

227
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:09,033
But my character runs from her
because he can't stand against her.

228
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:11,967
Right. I played a high schooler.

229
00:10:12,033 --> 00:10:12,867
That character was you?

230
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:13,767
That's right.

231
00:10:13,834 --> 00:10:15,200
- Yes.
- She played Da-mi's friend.

232
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:17,900
- Da-mi's friend? I see.
- Yes, that's right.

233
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,400
- You know her.
- She was...

234
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,767
She is delinquent, right?

235
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,600
- Yes.
- She is, right?

236
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:23,700
Yes, that's right.

237
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,200
Yes, she is. You're right.

238
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:26,166
She isn't exactly delinquent.

239
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:28,500
- She's outgoing.
- Yes, yes.

240
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,033
With a hair roller.

241
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:32,767
Yes.

242
00:10:32,834 --> 00:10:34,133
<i>Smugglers</i>.

243
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,734
Right. <i>Smugglers</i>.

244
00:10:35,834 --> 00:10:36,800
Oh, right.

245
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,500
- <i>Smugglers </i>with Yum Jung-ah?
- She is one of the hottest

246
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,633
- among the fourth-generation actors.
- Goodness. Thank you so much.

247
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,967
It feels exactly like
when Seo-jun first joined us.

248
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
Seo-jun, is this your first time
seeing her?

249
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,066
I've never met her before.

250
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,066
- Really?
- Yes.

251
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,900
Min-si. Is it your first time
seeing Seo-jun?

252
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,800
Back when we shot <i>The Witch</i>...

253
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,467
He joined our after party
since he's close to Woo-shik.

254
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,667
- At Mapo.
- Yes, back then.

255
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:05,767
I said hello to him once back then.

256
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:09,533
Min-si knew who was on our team.

257
00:11:09,633 --> 00:11:12,500
She said that she admires Yu-mi the most.

258
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,967
She's admired her since long time ago.

259
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:15,500
At the Blue Dragon Awards...

260
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,333
- Right. I sat right next to her.
- She was next to me.

261
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,900
- She mentioned that.
- She won Best Actress.

262
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,967
<i>Sleep</i>. Jung Yu-mi.

263
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Congratulations, Yu-mi.

264
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,000
- Congratulations.
- Where are you?

265
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,300
In <i>Sleep</i>, Actress Jung Yu-mi...

266
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,900
BEST NEW ACTRESS

267
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,700
<i>Smugglers</i>. Congratulations, Ko Min-si.

268
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,066
She won Best Actress.

269
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,467
They have a connection.

270
00:11:56,567 --> 00:11:57,934
We both won in Blue Dragon Film Awards.

271
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:00,834
Shall we start the interview?

272
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,200
I'm getting interviewed?

273
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:05,834
You're not willing to accept her
without conditions?

274
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,433
I'm just kidding. It was a joke.

275
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:09,433
Have you ever had these thoughts?

276
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,000
"I think I'd do well if I were there."

277
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,967
Thoughts like this.

278
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,467
"I should join this company."

279
00:12:15,233 --> 00:12:16,734
The reason you had such thoughts.

280
00:12:17,367 --> 00:12:21,367
Something like, "I can wait tables well."

281
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:23,200
Or "I can be quite good in the kitchen."

282
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,433
Oh, actually,

283
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,467
I think I did think
that I'd be able to do well.

284
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:27,867
Which one?

285
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:28,800
Waiting tables.

286
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,867
- Waiting tables?
- Yes.

287
00:12:29,967 --> 00:12:31,333
I think I can wait tables really well.

288
00:12:31,433 --> 00:12:32,400
I can do dishes well.

289
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:33,333
How come?

290
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,967
I did a part-time job
at a barbecue restaurant.

291
00:12:35,066 --> 00:12:37,333
I also did a part-time job at a cafe too.

292
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,200
Before I made my debut,

293
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:42,233
I worked at a cafe
as I took acting classes.

294
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,100
She actually worked at a company

295
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:46,166
- before working as an actor.
- Right.

296
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,467
What company?

297
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,333
- I worked as a wedding planner.
- She's suitable

298
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,834
to work in an organization.

299
00:12:51,934 --> 00:12:54,200
On top of that, she was the quickest one

300
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,133
to get promoted in that company.

301
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:57,967
She moves up to the top fast.

302
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:00,567
Did you cast her after knowing all these?

303
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:02,367
Of course. We did our research.

304
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,266
Gosh, Eggiscoming is quite good.

305
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,033
You did a background check on her?

306
00:13:09,834 --> 00:13:10,934
Do you cook?

307
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,166
As for cooking,

308
00:13:14,233 --> 00:13:17,033
I've been practicing.

309
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,433
You don't know what our menus are.

310
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,333
I may not know the menus, but...

311
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,100
I didn't think you would make me

312
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,767
cook anything difficult.

313
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:30,033
I thought Ms. Jung and Mr. Park
would be the main chefs.

314
00:13:30,133 --> 00:13:31,767
- She's smooth.
- He looks so happy.

315
00:13:31,867 --> 00:13:33,333
She has great social skills.

316
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:39,300
Look at his face.

317
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,567
He brightened up at once.

318
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,433
Isn't this the most cordial atmosphere
we've ever had?

319
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:50,266
- It's the most cordial ever.
- Goodness.

320
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:53,033
I thought it'd be better
to experience working in the kitchen

321
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,734
instead of not experiencing it at all.

322
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,033
So I've been practicing a little.

323
00:13:58,133 --> 00:14:00,667
Gosh, Seo-jin.
He approved of her right away.

324
00:14:00,734 --> 00:14:02,967
Woo-shik, why are you losing a smile?

325
00:14:03,767 --> 00:14:04,633
What happened?

326
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,834
She was the quickest

327
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,667
to get promoted in that company.

328
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,867
Gosh, what should I do?

329
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,900
He's the slowest to get promoted
in our company.

330
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:21,066
Actually, that's why
I'm curious about Woo-shik's promotion.

331
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:22,600
- Whether he'll be promoted or not?
- Yes.

332
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:23,967
What should we do?

333
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:26,600
It hasn't been decided, right?

334
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,800
It hasn't been decided, right?

335
00:14:33,533 --> 00:14:35,033
So then

336
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,266
we have the newbie onboard, right?

337
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:38,834
Welcome!

338
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,166
Yes. Thank you in advance.

339
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:46,033
Now, I can't wait to find out
where we'll go.

340
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,800
But our menus...

341
00:14:47,867 --> 00:14:49,867
Shouldn't we find out
where we're going first?

342
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:51,166
Yes, let's do that first.

343
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,166
In season one, we went to Mexico.

344
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,500
So it was Mexico.

345
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:57,700
Since then,
we've been continuously talking about

346
00:14:57,767 --> 00:15:00,233
selling gomtang in a cold country one day.

347
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,233
- Gosh.
- Really?

348
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,100
The second country we're going to

349
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:06,533
is Iceland.

350
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,066
Goodness.

351
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,000
Amazing.

352
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,367
We're going to Iceland.

353
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:13,834
Wow.

354
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,767
No way.

355
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:19,033
Kkori-gomtang will be served first.

356
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,533
All right.

357
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,900
It's very hot, so don't touch it.

358
00:16:35,266 --> 00:16:38,133
That bowl is really hot, so be careful.

359
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,433
- Okay.
- Okay. thank you.

360
00:16:43,934 --> 00:16:45,100
Thank you. Enjoy.

361
00:16:46,934 --> 00:16:48,767
- Do I mix it here?
- Yes.

362
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:52,200
This is kkakdugi.

363
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,266
Into the soup?

364
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,500
No.

365
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,767
If you want, yes.

366
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,233
It's so good.

367
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:20,967
Oh, my gosh.

368
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:24,867
Can I come here every single day?

369
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,066
- They cleared it.
- Oh, my.

370
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,100
It's clear.

371
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,433
It's all clear.

372
00:17:31,033 --> 00:17:33,800
One, two, three. Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

373
00:17:53,767 --> 00:17:54,834
I'll show you.

374
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,333
Here, right here!

375
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,633
Where?

376
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,266
- Here. It's right here.
- Gosh.

377
00:18:01,367 --> 00:18:02,200
This is incredible.

378
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:05,433
Goodness. What is that?

379
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,500
Gosh.

380
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,166
- Gosh, this way.
- I can see it now.

381
00:18:14,033 --> 00:18:15,066
Gosh!

382
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:16,767
This is amazing.

383
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,266
I finally feel like we're in Iceland.

384
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:21,900
Gosh.

385
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,333
Gosh, what is this place.

386
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:27,667
Has anyone been to Iceland?

387
00:18:27,734 --> 00:18:28,600
No.

388
00:18:29,533 --> 00:18:30,767
- I hear it's really cold.
- Right.

389
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:31,967
What's the temperature like there?

390
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:33,934
I think we can see the Northern Lights.

391
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:35,700
- Or maybe not?
- We can see them until April.

392
00:18:35,767 --> 00:18:38,400
We can see the Northern Lights
while we're there.

393
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,667
They have the Northern Light tour
up until March.

394
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,433
So many people visit that country.

395
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,400
- I hope we can see them too.
- That's how it is.

396
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,200
What's the capital city of Iceland?

397
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:50,667
- Their capital is Reykjavik.
- Reykjavik.

398
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,934
So we're going to Reykjavik?

399
00:18:52,033 --> 00:18:53,600
- Yes.
- We'll run our restaurant there?

400
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes, in the middle of the capital.

401
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,467
Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland,

402
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,166
has never had
any proper Korean restaurant.

403
00:19:01,233 --> 00:19:02,133
- No?
- No.

404
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,233
So when we get there,

405
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,133
it'll be the first Korean restaurant

406
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:07,934
- ran by Koreans.
- Goodness.

407
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,633
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI
KOREAN RESTAURANT

408
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,500
By the way,

409
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,500
you've been making kkori-gomtang, right?

410
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:25,934
If there isn't any oxtail,
I mix all sorts of bones.

411
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,867
Right.

412
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,033
Gomtang should be kkori-gomtang.

413
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:32,633
Kkori-gomtang is the best.

414
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,200
Seo-jin makes great kkori-gomtang.

415
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,600
Right, he and his oxtail.

416
00:19:37,667 --> 00:19:39,900
Gosh, he'll be joining
the kitchen this time.

417
00:19:44,066 --> 00:19:46,200
It'll be so nice if we serve
gomtang with galbijjim.

418
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,433
Galbijjim! Director Na.

419
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,166
- They'll love galbijjim.
- They'll be crazy about it.

420
00:19:57,233 --> 00:19:58,300
Since it's a cold country,

421
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:00,700
warm dishes are quite popular.

422
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,500
Winds are realy strong there.

423
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:03,767
Then we can sell that.

424
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:05,166
- It snows a lot there too.
- Which one?

425
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:06,700
- Kites.
- Kites?

426
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:13,533
You should hold such promotions.

427
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,900
Right. I'll be like,
"Hi, this is Korean..."

428
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,700
You should open a separate shop.

429
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,333
Right, Woo-shik?

430
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:22,333
You can sell kites, sundae,
and corn dogs.

431
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Open a separate shop.

432
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,467
How about Woo-shik's Stationery Store?

433
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,867
Shouldn't we make galbijjim in advance?

434
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,967
You can just heat it up when you serve it.

435
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:13,967
- Right?
- The same goes for soups.

436
00:21:14,033 --> 00:21:15,667
So if we make them in advance...

437
00:21:15,734 --> 00:21:17,934
I think we need to make
every dish in advance.

438
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,100
There are many dishes like that.

439
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:26,934
The menus we chose

440
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,767
are not the ones
that need to be cooked on the spot.

441
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,000
We can prepare everything together
in advance.

442
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,767
And Seo-jun or Yu-mi could serve them.

443
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:36,266
That's how it should be done.

444
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,200
The ones who used to wait tables

445
00:21:38,266 --> 00:21:39,367
- could join the kitchen.
- Of course.

446
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,266
And the other way around, too.

447
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,900
But we'll have to practice it altogether.

448
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:46,900
Then can Woo-shik cook now?

449
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,700
- We all should practice.
- He'd be flying kites.

450
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,166
This is really hard.

451
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,033
Will Woo-shik stay as an intern?

452
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,967
Or will he be promoted as a regular staff?

453
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,433
But Woo-shik has been an intern
for quite a while.

454
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,600
He's done it for a while.

455
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,066
Well, then...

456
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,166
I'll manage it well.

457
00:22:18,233 --> 00:22:20,233
Then what's his title?

458
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,734
- Staff?
- An assistant manager?

459
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:24,633
But what are their positions?

460
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,133
- CEO, director.
- This company is extreme.

461
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,133
Seo-jun is a director too now.

462
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,066
- A shocking promotion.
- What?

463
00:22:31,133 --> 00:22:32,166
Seo-jin, this is...

464
00:22:32,266 --> 00:22:34,233
What kind of a company does that?

465
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,166
But the next in line is director
after senior manager.

466
00:22:37,266 --> 00:22:39,500
- Then what about Yu-mi?
- There are so many executives.

467
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,834
Yu-mi will continue to be a director.

468
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,433
Being a director...

469
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,133
You know how there are different
executive directors?

470
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,633
There's an ordinary director.

471
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,767
Yu-mi is an executive director now?

472
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,266
Of course, she's an executive director.

473
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,934
She'll have to retire as an advisor.

474
00:22:56,033 --> 00:22:57,300
Then Seo-jun is
a senior managing director?

475
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,200
That's right.

476
00:22:58,266 --> 00:22:59,266
That means they're all directors.

477
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,266
That's shocking.

478
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:02,533
Then we have three directors
and two staff members.

479
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,133
- We have two directors.
- It's the worst.

480
00:23:04,233 --> 00:23:05,533
What kind of company is this?

481
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:07,100
Who'll do the work?

482
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,734
Then Woo-shik is an assistant manager.

483
00:23:09,834 --> 00:23:11,400
Since we're promoting,
let them make you the head.

484
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,834
- Or a section chief?
- I could become a chief,

485
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,700
but not a department head. I couldn't.

486
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,633
- A department head is higher.
- Assistant manager has a better nuance

487
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,033
- than department head.
- Are you at ease now?

488
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,700
Department Head Choi,
Assistant Manager Choi.

489
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,767
You can't be a department head anyway.

490
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:25,934
You can't be it anyway.

491
00:23:26,033 --> 00:23:27,166
Why are you choosing one of the two?

492
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,967
- My goodness.
- Assistant manager sounds...

493
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,500
An assistant manager. Yes.

494
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,834
- It sounds younger, right?
- Intern.

495
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,700
Then Incheon... No, I didn't mean Incheon.

496
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,934
What?

497
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:37,767
So I've been an intern,
and got promoted, right?

498
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,400
Yes, you're our regular staff now.

499
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

500
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,567
He's the executive chef

501
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:09,600
at Soseoul Hannam.
We invited an incredible chef.

502
00:24:09,867 --> 00:24:11,800
I had no idea
that tteokgalbi was this complicated.

503
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,266
- The efforts.
- Sorry?

504
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,567
It's filled with efforts, right?

505
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,467
What's the menu
we're going to learn today?

506
00:24:23,533 --> 00:24:26,934
Today, we're going to learn
how to make kkori-gomtang.

507
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,500
- The main dish.
- Yes, the main dish.

508
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,633
We're going to make kkori-gomtang.

509
00:24:33,834 --> 00:24:35,433
When you first get the meat,

510
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,367
you need to draw out its blood.

511
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:40,133
An hour
or an hour and a half should be enough.

512
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:41,166
You need to blanch them.

513
00:24:41,233 --> 00:24:42,700
- Blanch them?
- Yes, you have to blanch them.

514
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,033
You're nodding as if you know.

515
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,633
Well, as for kkori-gomtang,

516
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,000
I blanched the meat when I made it.

517
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,800
I blanched it and threw out the water.

518
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,767
Do you see this yellow thing?
Get rid of it like this.

519
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,400
You like labor like this.

520
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,533
Why would I like this?

521
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,567
You look like a master.

522
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:12,200
I should stick to my original intention
when I make this.

523
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:17,166
Even when the time's up,
I must keep boiling, right?

524
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:18,266
- Yes. Now,
- On low heat.

525
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:19,900
And boil it
for over an hour or two.

526
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,200
- For over two hours?
- Yes.

527
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,500
- It's a race against time.
- Yes, it is.

528
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,300
Then season it a bit.

529
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,233
Using soy sauce?

530
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:30,767
I don't think you need to add soy sauce.

531
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,934
But let's add it to make it savory.

532
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,266
We're making it too exclusive this time.

533
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,367
It's perfectly to my liking.

534
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,467
- Gosh, great work.
- Great work.

535
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,767
Did you guys go to the same school?

536
00:25:48,834 --> 00:25:50,867
Please train my staff hard tomorrow.

537
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:51,900
All right.

538
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,100
So they can get their acts together.

539
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,600
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

540
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:05,400
This time, we'll make clean galbijjim.

541
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,967
- Clean galbijjim?
- Yes.

542
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:10,433
We'll add only potatoes
and shiitake mushrooms in galbijjim.

543
00:26:11,567 --> 00:26:12,600
Make it a bite size.

544
00:26:13,467 --> 00:26:15,000
We need to cut the potatoes.

545
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:16,600
If you add them as is,

546
00:26:16,667 --> 00:26:20,033
the sharp parts get mushed.

547
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,133
So what you can do is to cut the edges

548
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,734
in a round and pretty way.

549
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:35,567
Seo-jun, I don't think
we can ever leave the kitchen.

550
00:26:37,066 --> 00:26:38,967
Now, add the meat, broth, and seasoning

551
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:41,533
and boil it for another hour.

552
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,500
- You can put on the lid.
- Yes.

553
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,300
Or you can

554
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,300
cover the top with a paper foil

555
00:26:48,367 --> 00:26:50,266
so that even the meat that float up

556
00:26:50,333 --> 00:26:52,967
can be cooked thoroughly as well.

557
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:55,900
Gosh, I've never seen anything like this.

558
00:26:56,567 --> 00:26:57,400
Oh, my.

559
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,166
Put it on top and cover it.

560
00:27:00,567 --> 00:27:02,100
When you add vegetables

561
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:04,934
to braising dishes,
the vegetables get mushed,

562
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:07,667
- and the texture gets too soft.
- Right.

563
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:08,633
Some people don't like it,

564
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:10,734
so we'll take out the vegetables

565
00:27:10,834 --> 00:27:13,633
and replace them with vegetable fritters.

566
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,333
So you'll serve galbijjim

567
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:20,600
with vegetable fritters.

568
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,834
When I was in Mexico,

569
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:25,200
I fried chickens

570
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,266
the whole time.

571
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,700
Does that mean...

572
00:27:28,767 --> 00:27:30,400
Does that mean that I'll have to
keep frying vegetables?

573
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,433
Yes, just like then.

574
00:27:31,533 --> 00:27:34,967
Use about 60g
of onions, zucchinis, and carrots.

575
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,100
Mix them, and season them a bit
before cooking.

576
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,367
With salt.

577
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:43,667
After adding salt thoroughly...

578
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:45,433
- It's at 170°C right now.
- Okay.

579
00:27:46,066 --> 00:27:47,633
It's impossible for it to taste bad.

580
00:27:50,834 --> 00:27:52,767
- It looks much softer.
- Right.

581
00:27:53,266 --> 00:27:54,433
Shall we add the potatoes?

582
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:55,633
- Shall we add them now?
- Yes.

583
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:59,000
Add them 20 minutes before wrapping it up.

584
00:27:59,066 --> 00:28:01,266
This is the end of menu preparation.

585
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,700
When a guest places an order,
you'll need to prepare the dish.

586
00:28:04,767 --> 00:28:06,133
This is when you add mushrooms.

587
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,633
Mushrooms get cooked pretty fast too.

588
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,300
It's galbijjim made with love.

589
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:17,734
And the potatoes

590
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,567
- are really pretty in it.
- Right.

591
00:28:20,033 --> 00:28:21,233
Are you proud of them?

592
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,567
So it's worth shaping them?

593
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,433
The new intern is in big grouble.

594
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,266
She might be talking with galbitang
toward the end.

595
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,166
Thank you in advance.

596
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:38,100
Sure.

597
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,667
The intern brought this.
Is it okay to use that?

598
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,567
Yes, you can use a slicer like this.

599
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:50,834
Oh, my.

600
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,133
Now, there are six kinds, right?

601
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,400
Mung bean sprouts, spinach, carrots,
zucchinis, onions, shiitake mushrooms.

602
00:28:56,467 --> 00:28:59,000
Let's blanch spinach first.

603
00:28:59,066 --> 00:29:01,834
We'll blanch
mung bean sprouts a little too.

604
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:04,700
Slice onions, zucchinis, and carrots
into thin strips,

605
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,300
season them with salt,

606
00:29:06,367 --> 00:29:08,567
and stir-fry them.

607
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,066
I find using a knife more convenient.

608
00:29:11,767 --> 00:29:13,066
I find a knife easier too.

609
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,133
There are many ways to slice them.

610
00:29:17,266 --> 00:29:19,266
- Into halves?
- Yes, that'd be easier.

611
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,233
- In thin slices?
- Yes, make them thin.

612
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,266
Should I slice the onions?

613
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:29,367
Make them into thin slices.

614
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,567
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

615
00:29:38,834 --> 00:29:39,934
The onions are a bit...

616
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,033
You're really good at it.

617
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,800
I can see hope now.

618
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,533
That's cute.

619
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:55,567
We can put this on the nose.

620
00:29:58,266 --> 00:30:00,400
When you have bibimbap,

621
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,467
gochujang is usually served separately.

622
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,200
- Yes.
- I think it'll be hard for them.

623
00:30:04,266 --> 00:30:06,367
So we can mix the rice

624
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:07,400
with gochujang in advance

625
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,600
- I see.
- and place it in the bowl.

626
00:30:10,233 --> 00:30:12,400
The gochujang you tried earlier.

627
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,800
Is this paprika I see?

628
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:16,433
That's right. The texture of paprika...

629
00:30:16,533 --> 00:30:17,600
Gosh.

630
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,934
...is quite nice too.

631
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:24,200
I'll try placing them in a row.

632
00:30:24,266 --> 00:30:26,133
We usually place them in a circle,

633
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,433
but let's add a unique touch,
and place them in rows.

634
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,967
Wait. I smell something savory.

635
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,500
What? We should remove it.

636
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:35,734
- Shall I remove it?
- Yes.

637
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:38,133
It looks really good.

638
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,900
That popping sound

639
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,266
and the savory smell.

640
00:30:42,333 --> 00:30:43,600
- Scorched rice.
- Scorched rice.

641
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,400
- Scorched rice.
- Gosh!

642
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,734
Gosh, it's really good.

643
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,867
I can feel each ingredient's texture.

644
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,533
Chef, will we be able to make this?

645
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,100
Of course. You made it yourself today.

646
00:31:05,033 --> 00:31:06,633
The water is boiling away.

647
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,133
I can take it out
when it floats up, right?

648
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,100
Slicing, slicing.

649
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:13,367
Great.

650
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,100
I practiced a bit.

651
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:17,934
Min-si is quite...

652
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,467
She's fast.

653
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:21,066
You don't want to lose to her.

654
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:23,266
I heard she's incredibly quick.

655
00:31:23,834 --> 00:31:25,233
Where did you learn that from?

656
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,433
I saw a YouTube video.

657
00:31:26,533 --> 00:31:27,834
- Really?
- Yes.

658
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:31,033
I looked up "How to slice vegetables."

659
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,266
Gosh, this will make me tear up.

660
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,600
Like this...

661
00:31:35,166 --> 00:31:36,133
Gosh.

662
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,033
So many details are hidden.

663
00:31:43,734 --> 00:31:46,300
Today, we'll make kkakdugi.

664
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:49,333
I thought it'd be nice

665
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,066
to practice making kkakdugi
before going to Iceland.

666
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,400
- Gosh, it's good.
- It is?

667
00:31:59,767 --> 00:32:03,467
Green onion, radish, radish.

668
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:06,233
I'll do my best to make it.

669
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:07,600
Wish me luck!

670
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,266
Goodness.

671
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:16,900
I'll turn them into this shape.

672
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,500
I'm going to add yogurt.

673
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,467
I prepared a dessert, and it's yogurt.

674
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:32,667
Here's why I'm adding yogurt.
It has probiotics.

675
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,767
It's going to help the fermentation

676
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:37,166
for the kkakdugi.

677
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:38,700
It also tastes a little sour.

678
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:39,934
I want to make it taste

679
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,967
like aged kimchi.

680
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:43,300
And this time,

681
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:45,900
we're going to make it vegan.

682
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:47,433
We'll replace the fish sauce

683
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:50,000
with soy sauce.

684
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,033
Ta-da.

685
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:23,233
- Gosh, it's going to be really cold.
- Wow, we're in Iceland.

686
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,767
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

687
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,166
Gosh, it's cold.

688
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,467
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

689
00:33:29,567 --> 00:33:30,567
Gosh, it's cold.

690
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,834
Gosh, look at those houses. It's cold!

691
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,300
It's really cold.

692
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,734
It's cold!

693
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,300
It's so cold.

694
00:34:04,934 --> 00:34:06,500
Let's go.

695
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,166
Gosh!

696
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,834
We... Gosh!

697
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:20,767
No!

698
00:34:20,834 --> 00:34:23,367
No!

699
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,500
Gosh, this is crazy, Seo-jun.

700
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,467
We should put this on top.

701
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,734
Gosh!

702
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:30,266
Seo-jun, put that horizontally.

703
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:31,734
Put that horizontally,
and put this on top.

704
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,700
Put yours horizontallly.

705
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:34,567
- Get in.
- You can't put it horizontally?

706
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,700
Gosh, is this finally starting?

707
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,033
Seo-jin.

708
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:45,533
What a way to start.

709
00:34:45,633 --> 00:34:47,066
During the two weeks,

710
00:34:47,166 --> 00:34:48,600
what's going to happen to us?

711
00:34:48,667 --> 00:34:49,667
Be quiet now.

712
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,600
This is crazy.

713
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,467
My brain is numb all of a sudden.

714
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,100
But this is so...

715
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:00,967
I mean the weather...

716
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:03,967
Look around the city now.
We won't get to go out much.

717
00:35:08,834 --> 00:35:10,233
It says it'll take 44 minutes.

718
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,500
By the way,

719
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,166
it must be because of the weather,

720
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:19,100
no one is saying that it's pretty.

721
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,567
It's a little different from last time.

722
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:23,166
We were taken aback as soon as we got out.

723
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:24,300
Is it raining?

724
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,533
It looks like snow. Is it sleet?

725
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:30,233
Gosh, we've come so far, though.

726
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,834
20 hours.

727
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,367
It feels so unreal.

728
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:35,533
It does.

729
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,133
I feel like getting dragged to some farm
based on this view alone.

730
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,233
It looks like
we're in the middle of nowhere.

731
00:35:41,333 --> 00:35:42,934
It must feel like this
if you get taken to Siberia.

732
00:35:43,033 --> 00:35:44,133
- Yes.
- Right?

733
00:35:47,834 --> 00:35:49,734
Gosh, it's amazing.

734
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,333
Don't you lie!

735
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:52,500
Gosh...

736
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:56,834
Aren't we being too quiet?

737
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,900
Gosh, the ocean is beautiful too.

738
00:36:03,266 --> 00:36:04,233
Stop with the lies.

739
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,667
You should stop lying!

740
00:36:05,734 --> 00:36:08,500
This is when they need the inserts.

741
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,033
They insert them until the line,
"Don't you lie."

742
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,867
Then, there will be drone shots.

743
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,333
Beautiful ocean.

744
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,033
But it's too cloudy to see it.

745
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,166
It's too cloudy for that.

746
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:37,934
There's a lot to see here. On both sides.

747
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,233
Seo-jin, there's a lot happening
near our restaurant.

748
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,133
Then are they all our competition?

749
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,667
- They are our competition.
- There's a lot.

750
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:47,934
Just wait and see.

751
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,066
I'm going to make sure

752
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,900
- we get a Michelin star.
- There's a Vietnamese restaurant too.

753
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,100
We're checking out
our restaurant first, right?

754
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,200
- We're here.
- There.

755
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,500
- It's right in front!
- Where?

756
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,233
- No way!
- No way!

757
00:38:03,133 --> 00:38:04,133
Jinny's Ttukbaegi?

758
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,300
They actually named it Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

759
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,767
Isn't it so pretty?

760
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:10,400
Gosh, it's beautiful.

761
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,767
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI
KOREAN RESTAURANT

762
00:38:29,834 --> 00:38:32,934
- Oh, my.
- It's beautiful!

763
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:35,133
- Let's get out first.
- Okay!

764
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,000
Shall we go inside?

765
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,433
- Gosh!
- Oh, my!

766
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,667
Gosh.

767
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,433
Gosh, it's beautiful.

768
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,133
What is this place?

769
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:47,533
It's huge.

770
00:38:50,767 --> 00:38:53,600
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

771
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:01,633
Gosh!

772
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,934
They have a separate room too?

773
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:05,500
There's a huge room over here.

774
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,633
Gosh, it's so pretty.

775
00:39:23,567 --> 00:39:24,800
A waiting room.

776
00:39:32,266 --> 00:39:35,000
Is this restaurant bigger
than the one in Spain?

777
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,266
- Yes.
- Way bigger.

778
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:35,166
There's a huge room too.

779
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:39,033
How are we going to handle all the patrons
and manage everything?

780
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:42,000
Is it bigger than the restaurant in Spain?

781
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,400
- Yes.
- Way bigger.

782
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,433
Really?

783
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,333
How are we supposed to manage it?

784
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:48,633
Gosh, what is this?

785
00:40:50,767 --> 00:40:53,133
What? It's the kitchen.

786
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,000
Everyone, this is the kitchen.

787
00:40:57,934 --> 00:41:00,133
- Hey, there aren't that many tables.
- What is this?

788
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,200
- The kitchen.
- Hello.

789
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,633
Hello.

790
00:41:06,734 --> 00:41:09,200
Hello.

791
00:41:11,767 --> 00:41:12,667
Oh, my.

792
00:41:12,734 --> 00:41:13,800
This is bad.

793
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,233
I mean...

794
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,166
What?

795
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:36,200
It is indeed huge.

796
00:41:36,266 --> 00:41:37,300
What?

797
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
- It's huge.
- There's a lot of storage space.

798
00:41:44,166 --> 00:41:45,400
This is really bad.

799
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,700
What do we do?

800
00:41:49,266 --> 00:41:51,300
This is the biggest... No.

801
00:41:57,834 --> 00:41:59,867
- What is this, Woo-shik?
- What? This?

802
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:02,233
This is a dishwasher.
If you pull it up like this...

803
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,000
- Oh, my.
- And then... What's it called?

804
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,633
Hey, pull it up! Goodness!

805
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:13,967
- A dishwasher.
- A dishwasher.

806
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,100
This is where Woo-shik will stay hidden.

807
00:42:22,266 --> 00:42:23,400
Why so many fridges?

808
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:26,100
It's because we need a lot of ingredients.

809
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:29,967
It is indeed huge.

810
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:31,734
It's huge, right?

811
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:47,567
Come and try these on.

812
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,367
The color is pretty.

813
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:52,900
Gosh, what is this?

814
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,767
What is this?

815
00:42:54,834 --> 00:42:56,000
Seriously.

816
00:42:56,066 --> 00:42:59,500
By the way,
it looks like the features of your face

817
00:42:59,567 --> 00:43:02,333
look more defined than before.

818
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,233
What?

819
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,367
The dimples are...

820
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:07,633
They stand out more.

821
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,133
Gosh, this looks quite cool.

822
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,300
Seoul, Bacalar. And here's Reykjavik.

823
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,734
Seoul, Bacalar, and Reykjavik.

824
00:43:26,834 --> 00:43:28,967
- We're adding more locations.
- Right.

825
00:43:29,033 --> 00:43:30,767
- So cool!
- The list would reach here.

826
00:43:30,867 --> 00:43:33,100
But if it does,

827
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,100
we'll be around 50.

828
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,367
I could be dead by the time you turn 50.

829
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,433
I know. That's why I thought,

830
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,100
"Wait. Then Seo-jin will be..."

831
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,533
I'm not sure if I'll be alive until then.

832
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
It'd look a bit weird.

833
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,166
Anyway, the restaurant

834
00:43:58,266 --> 00:44:01,934
needs to open at noon and close at 3.

835
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,066
Then we need time
to prepare for dinner.

836
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,767
So we need three hours.

837
00:44:07,333 --> 00:44:11,166
We'll open at 6 and close at 9.

838
00:44:11,967 --> 00:44:13,066
Three hours each.

839
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:16,233
And to open the restaurant at noon
the next day,

840
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,934
we need to start working at least by 9.

841
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,500
I think we'll have a lot of patrons.

842
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,500
That's 9 at the latest.

843
00:44:22,066 --> 00:44:24,734
Those who get up early
should come fast and start prepping.

844
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:30,433
I think Min-si might have to sleep here.

845
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:35,100
Should we get a sleeping bag?

846
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,967
How big is the second floor?

847
00:44:37,033 --> 00:44:39,000
She might find it more convenient

848
00:44:39,066 --> 00:44:40,900
to stay on the second floor.

849
00:44:40,967 --> 00:44:43,000
I need to slice radishes,

850
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:45,300
make kkakdugi, cut vegetables, and...

851
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,233
Min-si!

852
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,333
When we

853
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,600
open the restaurant tomorrow,

854
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,967
just look at me.

855
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:54,300
- Just look at you?
- Yes, just look at me.

856
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,600
- Just at you?
- Yes.

857
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:58,200
Just look at me and listen to me only.

858
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,333
- Okay.
- Right.

859
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:02,500
Then everything will be fine.

860
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:08,300
But I'll keep going to the restroom.

861
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,900
So when you can't find me,
you know where I am.

862
00:45:12,533 --> 00:45:14,200
Aren't your shoulders too high?

863
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,000
Just look at me only, okay?

864
00:45:17,066 --> 00:45:17,900
Okay.

865
00:45:22,767 --> 00:45:24,767
After having coffee, at around 12:20,

866
00:45:24,834 --> 00:45:27,200
let's do a little celebration
and go to lunch.

867
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,734
What's the little celebration?

868
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,800
Oh, are we sprinkling some makgeolli?

869
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,033
- What?
- So our restaurant does well?

870
00:45:33,133 --> 00:45:34,367
- You want to hold a ritual ceremony?
- Yes.

871
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:35,300
A ritual ceremony?

872
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,166
Now that we're here,

873
00:45:37,233 --> 00:45:39,867
we'll have a flag hoisting ceremony.

874
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,700
- A flag?
- A flag hoisting ceremony?

875
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:55,633
- Gosh.
- We'll announce that from today,

876
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:58,100
this restaurant is ours.

877
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,133
Is it okay to get sentimental
because of the weather

878
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,767
and stay in this country forever?

879
00:46:08,633 --> 00:46:11,000
- Are we really doing it?
- Hurry up! It's cold.

880
00:46:13,967 --> 00:46:15,033
The charisma of the CEO.

881
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:16,967
Gosh, it's even colder here.

882
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,266
We should hurry up and take photos.

883
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,500
Take photos for him.

884
00:46:28,133 --> 00:46:29,667
Gosh, it's hilarious!

885
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,567
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

886
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,500
Gosh.

887
00:46:51,467 --> 00:46:52,867
This is ridiculous.

888
00:46:58,567 --> 00:46:59,934
Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

889
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,233
Clap.

890
00:47:07,433 --> 00:47:08,767
Gosh, it's really cold.

891
00:47:09,233 --> 00:47:10,734
- Gosh, I...
- The wind is seriously...

892
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,867
You didn't bring gloves, right?

893
00:47:13,066 --> 00:47:15,200
Gosh, the wind!

894
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:20,033
The Chinese restaurant is right there!

895
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,400
We can go there the day after tomorrow.

896
00:47:23,533 --> 00:47:25,934
There's an English pub
and an American pub too.

897
00:47:26,633 --> 00:47:28,266
Let's go wherever you feel like.

898
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:31,133
Gosh, they must've had
a lot of events here.

899
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:55,700
Thank you.

900
00:48:08,266 --> 00:48:09,800
Oh, there are other customers too.

901
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,000
There are so many menus.

902
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:20,867
Hold on.

903
00:48:20,934 --> 00:48:23,000
A burger costs 45,000 won?

904
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:28,934
Gosh, a lamb steak is 80,000 won?

905
00:49:16,066 --> 00:49:17,400
- Add an extra 0 at the end?
- Yes.

906
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,233
That means a chicken salad
costs 50,000 won.

907
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,200
Yes.

908
00:49:20,767 --> 00:49:22,033
My goodness.

909
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:23,867
Thank you.

910
00:49:25,467 --> 00:49:27,300
This is huge.

911
00:49:27,367 --> 00:49:28,567
It's like the States.

912
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:31,700
It costs about 50,000 won.

913
00:49:31,767 --> 00:49:32,934
Right.

914
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,333
This is 30,000 won.
Isn't this too expensive?

915
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:37,734
How much is this?

916
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,300
This is 40,000 won?

917
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,066
What is this?

918
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:42,900
- Chicken tenders.
- I see.

919
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:46,767
Right, I'm going to try them.

920
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,767
Gosh, how much is this?

921
00:49:49,834 --> 00:49:53,667
- It's 88,900 won.
- Wow!

922
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,300
Gosh, it's delicious.

923
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,633
Really? Is it good?

924
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:01,667
- It's delicious.
- It's soft, isn't it?

925
00:50:01,734 --> 00:50:03,100
It doesn't smell gamey at all.

926
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,500
The lamb is so good.

927
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:05,734
- May I try it?
- Sure.

928
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:08,266
Clearly,

929
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:13,133
the expensive dishes are well-decorated.

930
00:50:13,233 --> 00:50:14,166
Well...

931
00:50:19,834 --> 00:50:21,400
We should go with 30, 40, and 50.

932
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,834
Somewhere around 40,000 won?

933
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,433
Ours aren't expensive
if they're 30, 40, and 50.

934
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,400
They're not.

935
00:50:47,567 --> 00:50:48,400
Thank you.

936
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:50,533
Thank you.

937
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:53,400
The concept of our restaurant

938
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,266
is to serve our customers.

939
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,400
It should be,
"The customer is always right."

940
00:50:57,467 --> 00:50:58,834
We have been following that all along.

941
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:00,667
No. It's supposed to be,
"The profit is always right."

942
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,266
- The profit is always right.
- You're all mature now.

943
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,767
However,

944
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:08,100
let's change our concept this time.

945
00:51:08,834 --> 00:51:10,266
The customer is always right?

946
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:11,400
That's right.

947
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:12,433
- For instance?
- Seo-jin.

948
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,000
This time, our dishes are exclusive.

949
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:16,967
We're open for both lunch and dinner.

950
00:51:17,066 --> 00:51:19,300
Let's do our best
for each single customer.

951
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,433
That would be great.

952
00:51:20,767 --> 00:51:22,333
This time, it should be different.

953
00:51:23,233 --> 00:51:26,300
It should be like
what they serve to the royal family.

954
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,834
Are we going that far? The royal family?

955
00:51:28,934 --> 00:51:30,900
Like you see in the TV shows?

956
00:51:32,567 --> 00:51:34,800
Should we do the trumphet ceremony?

957
00:51:36,033 --> 00:51:38,300
"There comes our customer!"

958
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,667
Clap, clap.

959
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:47,500
Mr. Lee has come.

960
00:51:48,367 --> 00:51:49,800
Clap, clap.

961
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:55,934
Today's chef.

962
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,166
Our concept has to do
with chef's responsibility.

963
00:51:58,233 --> 00:52:00,433
Chef of the day

964
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,233
is the chief.

965
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,333
We will put an image

966
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:04,633
of the chef at the entrance.

967
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,734
- That's embarrassing.
- Today's chef.

968
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,633
Can't we put Yu-mi's drawing
instead of Yu-mi?

969
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,433
- What drawing?
- We didn't bring it.

970
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:24,800
Well...

971
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,367
We can print it.

972
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:29,667
Wasn't it in the movie, <i>Exhuma</i>?

973
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,166
Who's that next to her? Is that me?

974
00:52:35,266 --> 00:52:37,333
- This...
- It's unbeatable, right?

975
00:52:37,433 --> 00:52:40,500
Nobody can beat Yu-mi's portrait.

976
00:52:41,433 --> 00:52:42,567
It's like announcing the starter.

977
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:43,734
Right.

978
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,266
Head chef.

979
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:47,533
- That's so cool.
- No!

980
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,266
You have to be the supporter
no matter what.

981
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,533
- Like a relief pitcher.
- A reliever?

982
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,066
You are the relief pitcher no matter what.

983
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,667
- If it doesn't go well...
- Okay.

984
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:54,967
If it doesn't go well for them,

985
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:56,567
- you have to support them.
- So disappointing.

986
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:58,200
- What?
- You think we won't make it?

987
00:52:59,266 --> 00:53:01,233
I mean... I know it won't happen...

988
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:03,633
Of course, I want you two
to be the main chefs.

989
00:53:03,734 --> 00:53:05,200
- This is disappointing.
- No.

990
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,967
I want you two to lead everything.

991
00:53:07,033 --> 00:53:08,233
Don't insult my cooking skills.

992
00:53:08,333 --> 00:53:09,934
If you two get sick...

993
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,567
- He'll support.
- I won't show that I'm sick.

994
00:53:11,633 --> 00:53:13,000
- What?
- I won't show that I'm sick.

995
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:14,667
I won't be able to stop you if you insist.

996
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,533
- I'll do it like Shohei Ohtani.
- Right.

997
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,033
I'll be Kim Sung-keun then.

998
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:21,000
Does that mean you would come

999
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,867
- and ask her, "Will you be okay?"
- Yes, I'll ask her!

1000
00:53:22,934 --> 00:53:25,066
I'd ask, "You can do it?"
If she says she can, I'd...

1001
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:26,633
You can't compare me to Mr. Choi.

1002
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,900
- That's not fair.
- No, it's not.

1003
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,133
There is a high chance that he gets
substituted during the fourth inning.

1004
00:53:35,033 --> 00:53:39,967
He might get substituted
in the 2nd or 3rd inning.

1005
00:53:40,066 --> 00:53:41,967
We will take a video of you
like those baseball players.

1006
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:44,000
- To present the players?
- Like how the players do it.

1007
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:51,467
I'm not good at posing like that.

1008
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:52,633
We should take it in slo-mo.

1009
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:54,567
He should cry when the sales drop.

1010
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,633
JUNG YU-MI

1011
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:35,533
Do it all now when you can.

1012
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:44,934
Are we too quiet?

1013
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,266
No, it's fine.

1014
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:50,867
We are going to buy
all the meat today, yes?

1015
00:54:50,934 --> 00:54:51,967
We have to buy a lot.

1016
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:00,767
This must be it.

1017
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,133
Hi.

1018
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:04,834
Goodness!

1019
00:55:20,533 --> 00:55:21,500
This is the oxtail.

1020
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:22,800
Don't we have to buy all of these?

1021
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,200
How much of it do you have?

1022
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,667
I have 8kg of it.

1023
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,500
8kg? I'll take them all.

1024
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,066
These are short ribs.

1025
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:31,900
Do you have more short ribs?

1026
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,066
I have 5kg of it.

1027
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,166
- 5kg.
- 5kg.

1028
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:35,166
We have to buy them all.

1029
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:36,500
Yes. 5kg, please.

1030
00:55:37,533 --> 00:55:40,467
Could you cut the ribs in 3cm?

1031
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:41,500
3cm, yes.

1032
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,600
Thank you.

1033
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,567
We're not cutting those?

1034
00:55:45,667 --> 00:55:46,500
Look.

1035
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:48,233
- But I think...
- Yes?

1036
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,433
- It will be fine.
- I think it's okay.

1037
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,033
Thank you.

1038
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:52,967
Very good.

1039
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:57,700
- Gosh, it's huge.
- It's so cold!

1040
00:55:58,233 --> 00:56:00,433
Get the fattest radish.

1041
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,433
Gosh, what is this?

1042
00:56:03,166 --> 00:56:05,066
It's like it's just pulled out
from the ground.

1043
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,734
How many paprikas should we get?

1044
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,100
Get a lot of them.

1045
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:09,333
Get everything from here.

1046
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:10,700
We should get a lot of these, right?

1047
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,200
Yes, these are the ingredients
for yakgochujang.

1048
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,133
I know.

1049
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,100
What we got today...

1050
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:23,867
It's much more than
what we need for tomorrow.

1051
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:25,800
If we make a lot today,

1052
00:56:25,867 --> 00:56:27,734
our day would be smoother tomorrow.

1053
00:56:34,066 --> 00:56:35,700
Good work, goodness.

1054
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,567
Put all the green onions here.

1055
00:56:46,667 --> 00:56:47,934
These go to the fridge.

1056
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,333
I think you can leaven them outside.

1057
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,800
- Okay.
- Look.

1058
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:52,633
This is huge.

1059
00:57:01,166 --> 00:57:03,200
Hey, we have to use that cup.

1060
00:57:03,734 --> 00:57:05,133
We should keep it outside.

1061
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:09,300
Is there anything refreshing?

1062
00:57:10,066 --> 00:57:11,767
Have you tried kombucha before?

1063
00:57:11,834 --> 00:57:12,967
No, I've never tried it.

1064
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:14,500
Here.

1065
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,867
It's a low-calorie drink, nice.

1066
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,934
I've been calculating calories these days.

1067
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,633
So it gets mixed as it creates bubbles.

1068
00:57:28,066 --> 00:57:29,100
Oh, this tastes good.

1069
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,266
This is refreshing.

1070
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:34,433
Yes. Korean plum and kombucha?

1071
00:57:34,533 --> 00:57:37,033
You are funny.

1072
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,800
- Min-si.
- Yes?

1073
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,333
Could you slice up this?

1074
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,367
- Sure.
- Okay.

1075
00:57:58,533 --> 00:57:59,500
- Min-si.
- Yes?

1076
00:57:59,567 --> 00:58:01,633
- You don't have to do it here.
- Where should I do it?

1077
00:58:01,734 --> 00:58:02,900
What? You can do it here.

1078
00:58:02,967 --> 00:58:04,700
- Here? Okay.
- Isn't it better here?

1079
00:58:04,767 --> 00:58:06,433
- Yes.
- Okay. here.

1080
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,967
Watch your head.

1081
00:58:12,033 --> 00:58:13,266
You fit perfectly in that seat.

1082
00:58:14,266 --> 00:58:15,100
All right.

1083
00:58:16,133 --> 00:58:18,100
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1084
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,867
You will have to slice the whole day.

1085
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:27,767
You slice them...

1086
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:53,934
Gosh, she sliced a lot of zucchinis.

1087
00:58:54,033 --> 00:58:55,633
Goodness. You sliced a lot, Min-si.

1088
00:58:56,166 --> 00:58:57,000
Right?

1089
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,233
- Goodness.
- I did slice a lot.

1090
00:59:00,066 --> 00:59:01,166
Look at the sliced vegetables!

1091
00:59:01,667 --> 00:59:03,333
She works so hard!

1092
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:05,333
Woo-shik and Tae-hyung have been

1093
00:59:05,867 --> 00:59:07,600
some sloppy interns.

1094
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,567
They only wanted to take shortcuts.

1095
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,133
They lied too.

1096
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,166
Such a hardworking intern.

1097
00:59:15,934 --> 00:59:18,300
I'll slice the mushroom
and onions

1098
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:20,166
for dolsot-bibimbap.

1099
00:59:20,233 --> 00:59:21,734
- With a knife?
- Yes, that's the best tool.

1100
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,333
Yu-mi, you can chop very well.

1101
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:32,867
Gosh, my eyes are burning.

1102
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:42,567
- Are you slicing onions?
- Yes.

1103
00:59:42,633 --> 00:59:43,800
I should slice vegetables

1104
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,734
for bibimbaps as well.

1105
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,567
Watch your hand. The blade is slippery.

1106
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:47,500
Okay.

1107
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,333
- I washed all these.
- Thank you.

1108
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:05,033
Oh...

1109
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,166
Oh, no.

1110
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,100
Isn't this a slicing competition,
not for a restaurant?

1111
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:13,600
I should wear a wrist band tomorrow.

1112
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:37,400
Gosh, let's open the window.

1113
01:01:38,166 --> 01:01:39,700
Please open the window.

1114
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,000
Hey, you're sweating.

1115
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,100
Gosh, congratulations.

1116
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:10,834
You are free!

1117
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:12,767
Why is your face so red?

1118
01:02:50,734 --> 01:02:52,333
I'm going to make enough seasoning

1119
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,000
we can use until we leave.

1120
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,600
I'll make yakgochujang.

1121
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,800
You will be doing that for the whole day.

1122
01:03:27,867 --> 01:03:29,400
I know, this is taking me too long.

1123
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,767
I think I'll be doing this
for the whole day.

1124
01:03:49,333 --> 01:03:50,467
Let's do it together.

1125
01:03:51,767 --> 01:03:53,266
It will be better if we do it together.

1126
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,600
- Goodness!
- Oh, no.

1127
01:04:02,266 --> 01:04:03,300
Are you okay?

1128
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,333
This?

1129
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:15,433
Is the burn bad?

1130
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,433
Are you okay or not?

1131
01:04:20,233 --> 01:04:21,066
Hey.

1132
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:22,633
I think I'm fine.

1133
01:04:24,133 --> 01:04:25,400
Goodness.

1134
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:31,700
I was too careless.

1135
01:04:31,767 --> 01:04:32,867
You should have worn gloves.

1136
01:04:36,433 --> 01:04:37,567
You will get a blister.

1137
01:04:37,667 --> 01:04:40,266
A blister? It means you burned yourself.

1138
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,700
- Right?
- What?

1139
01:04:43,233 --> 01:04:44,066
Where did you get burned?

1140
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,400
Oh...

1141
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,300
- Just there?
- Yes.

1142
01:04:52,967 --> 01:04:55,033
You should take a break.

1143
01:04:55,867 --> 01:04:57,033
Put an ice on it.

1144
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:06,800
It has been a while since I had a burn.

1145
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:08,700
I touched without thinking.

1146
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,133
- You are back.
- Right.

1147
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,367
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

1148
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:49,500
Gosh, I'm massaging the bell peppers.

1149
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:51,467
Is he still working on paprikas?

1150
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:53,400
Are you still working on paprikas?

1151
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,767
- It's driving me crazy.
- What?

1152
01:06:08,100 --> 01:06:10,567
Gosh, I'm done. I'm free!

1153
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:14,400
Goodness.

1154
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,667
Paprikas take longer than kkori-gomtang.

1155
01:06:25,266 --> 01:06:26,500
Min-si, are you doing okay?

1156
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:27,433
Yes.

1157
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:28,934
I'm doing okay too.

1158
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:30,967
Woo-shik isn't okay.

1159
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:33,667
You can't get hurt.

1160
01:06:34,233 --> 01:06:36,500
I didn't realize how important
my thumb was until now.

1161
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:38,266
Gosh, this chopping...

1162
01:06:38,767 --> 01:06:41,433
I've been practicing at home.
But I can't chop because of my thumb.

1163
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:43,300
What am I doing?

1164
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,100
I got a burn when I was filming
for <i>Youn's Kitchen </i>as well.

1165
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,266
I was opening the heated pot lid.

1166
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,700
What did you do with your burn?

1167
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:52,266
I just kept going.

1168
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:53,433
No, I mean...

1169
01:06:56,166 --> 01:06:58,567
Thumb, you think you can stop me?

1170
01:06:59,467 --> 01:07:01,066
Please take a close shot of my eyes.

1171
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,467
So it doesn't hurt anymore?

1172
01:07:08,967 --> 01:07:10,867
How long do I have to blanch these?

1173
01:07:10,934 --> 01:07:11,767
Just for a bit.

1174
01:07:18,867 --> 01:07:20,000
Four liters...

1175
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:31,633
Look at these cans.

1176
01:07:33,533 --> 01:07:34,600
- Seo-jun.
- Yes.

1177
01:07:35,266 --> 01:07:38,233
Seo-jun.

1178
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,367
Look at this gochujang.

1179
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:43,967
This is a lot of gochujang.

1180
01:07:44,033 --> 01:07:45,567
Are we here to sell it or something?

1181
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:48,934
Is this right?

1182
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:50,400
Really?

1183
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,533
Keep going.

1184
01:07:55,867 --> 01:07:56,834
I mean, look at this.

1185
01:07:57,667 --> 01:07:58,633
This gochujang...

1186
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:01,266
It won't even fit the pot now.

1187
01:08:02,066 --> 01:08:02,934
Just keep going.

1188
01:08:03,033 --> 01:08:04,633
Are you still on paprikas?

1189
01:08:04,734 --> 01:08:05,633
Yes.

1190
01:08:06,133 --> 01:08:07,467
Let's take a break.

1191
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,567
What is that?

1192
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:11,900
What is it?

1193
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,700
It's gochujang.

1194
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:15,667
Gochujang.

1195
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:21,767
Is this for gochujang too?

1196
01:08:21,834 --> 01:08:22,767
Yes.

1197
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:26,000
This is endless.

1198
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:32,600
Bye.

1199
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:35,333
- This is a lot.
- Bye.

1200
01:08:41,066 --> 01:08:42,400
Can you even stir-fry it?

1201
01:08:48,934 --> 01:08:50,200
Are you adding that all?

1202
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:51,633
I have to add even more.

1203
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:54,967
Great.

1204
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:02,834
I worked so hard,
we shouldn't burn them.

1205
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,033
If it goes bad...

1206
01:09:04,133 --> 01:09:05,000
I'm going back to Korea.

1207
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:10,266
Then I'll mix it with this.

1208
01:09:10,367 --> 01:09:11,433
I just have to keep boiling it down.

1209
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,266
Isn't this amazing?

1210
01:09:19,367 --> 01:09:20,800
Hey, look.

1211
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:24,367
This radish is huge.

1212
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,266
I can make kkakdugi, I mean it.

1213
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,100
The radish is huge.

1214
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:33,333
We can get 100 servings of kkakdugi.

1215
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,367
That alone can give us
100 servings of kkakdugi.

1216
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,500
This is it.

1217
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,100
Wow.

1218
01:10:34,266 --> 01:10:35,200
This is it.

1219
01:10:38,433 --> 01:10:40,467
Gosh, this soup is rich.

1220
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,100
Goodness.

1221
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:44,767
Gosh, people will love it.

1222
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,667
Woo-shik, come and sit here.

1223
01:11:29,433 --> 01:11:31,700
I want you to work
for the first shift tomorrow.

1224
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,000
What do you think?

1225
01:11:33,834 --> 01:11:35,133
- You mean in the kitchen?
- Yes.

1226
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:39,400
I would have chosen you to start
the restaurant in the morning,

1227
01:11:39,934 --> 01:11:41,066
only if your finger was fine.

1228
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,033
Oh, come on.

1229
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:47,500
Let me take a look at it again.

1230
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:49,600
It's swollen already.

1231
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:50,867
Your blister is just this big, right?

1232
01:11:50,934 --> 01:11:52,100
No, no.

1233
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,166
- Yes.
- This is a blister too.

1234
01:11:55,967 --> 01:11:57,667
Your blister isn't that big.

1235
01:11:57,767 --> 01:11:59,700
Your blister is just this.

1236
01:12:01,934 --> 01:12:04,800
I had a blister this big before.

1237
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:06,800
I held that tray

1238
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,333
like this.

1239
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:09,500
I did that too.

1240
01:12:09,567 --> 01:12:11,533
My blister was this big.

1241
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,633
Mine is this long, look.

1242
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,300
This part is just whiter.

1243
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:16,333
It's fine.

1244
01:12:17,133 --> 01:12:18,133
There's no strength.

1245
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:21,834
It has nothing to do with strength.

1246
01:12:21,934 --> 01:12:23,467
- I think I have a fever.
- And...

1247
01:12:23,567 --> 01:12:24,500
After one day,

1248
01:12:24,567 --> 01:12:25,767
it will get better.

1249
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:27,467
I know it.

1250
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:31,600
Tomorrow, I will...

1251
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:33,767
I'll announce it later.

1252
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:36,233
But I'm just asking for your thoughts.

1253
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:38,300
So I work only once in the kitchen?

1254
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,333
No.

1255
01:12:39,433 --> 01:12:40,266
Maybe three times.

1256
01:12:40,367 --> 01:12:41,433
What?

1257
01:12:41,533 --> 01:12:44,166
There are days you have to cook
your own menu.

1258
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:45,133
Right.

1259
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:46,967
Those days, you have to work
in the kitchen.

1260
01:12:47,066 --> 01:12:49,100
Then Yu-mi and Seo-jun take turns.

1261
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,867
Then it's your turn again.
That's how it works.

1262
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,066
Don't tell the others yet.

1263
01:12:56,667 --> 01:12:58,734
This isn't a small blister.

1264
01:12:58,834 --> 01:13:01,700
I know. You will be fine.

1265
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,834
I'll get back to work.

1266
01:13:17,433 --> 01:13:18,266
It's done.

1267
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,667
Will 30 minutes be enough
for beef galbijjim?

1268
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,166
Another 20 minutes from now.

1269
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:46,100
Taste it together whenever a dish is done.

1270
01:13:55,367 --> 01:13:56,233
- Min-si.
- Yes.

1271
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,400
- Can you set up for bibimbap?
- Sure.

1272
01:13:59,533 --> 01:14:01,066
- Woo-shik.
- Yes.

1273
01:14:01,133 --> 01:14:02,800
Set up the table for kkori-gomtang.

1274
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:18,934
Make sure it looks like a hearty meal.

1275
01:14:22,734 --> 01:14:23,800
This much?

1276
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:26,000
I think you should add more soup.

1277
01:14:26,633 --> 01:14:28,000
- Isn't it about that much?
- This much?

1278
01:14:37,934 --> 01:14:39,600
Oh, it's done very fast
because it's only a small amount.

1279
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:46,633
You can mix it with this much first.

1280
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:48,633
Then try it.

1281
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:58,900
- I'll taste it first.
- Okay.

1282
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,433
Try it.

1283
01:15:08,367 --> 01:15:09,467
- I think it's okay now.
- Is it?

1284
01:15:09,533 --> 01:15:10,900
- Yes.
- Where did the mustard go?

1285
01:15:11,567 --> 01:15:13,066
Oh, I kept it in the fridge.

1286
01:15:13,133 --> 01:15:13,967
I see. Where is it?

1287
01:15:14,066 --> 01:15:15,200
Oh, I kept it right here. It's here.

1288
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:16,467
You kept it here.

1289
01:15:36,233 --> 01:15:37,667
Hello.

1290
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:38,567
Hello.

1291
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:39,834
What?

1292
01:15:39,934 --> 01:15:40,834
What?

1293
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:45,200
We have a guest who isn't welcomed.

1294
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,400
I don't know how many years
I've been doing this.

1295
01:15:53,033 --> 01:15:54,367
Hello.

1296
01:15:55,033 --> 01:15:56,567
We aren't ready yet.

1297
01:15:56,633 --> 01:15:57,467
Hey.

1298
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,934
You can speak in Korean.

1299
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,567
- Hi.
- Hi.

1300
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:03,066
- Water, please.
- Yes.

1301
01:16:03,166 --> 01:16:04,333
And menu.

1302
01:16:05,533 --> 01:16:06,900
Do you know beef galbijjim?

1303
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,967
Yes, I'm Korean.

1304
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,166
- I'll have dolsot-bibimbap.
- Okay.

1305
01:16:16,233 --> 01:16:17,633
Beef galbijjim.

1306
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:19,567
Oxtail soup?

1307
01:16:19,633 --> 01:16:21,100
To share.

1308
01:16:21,467 --> 01:16:22,700
We have new orders.

1309
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,767
Dolsot-bibimbap, beef galbijjim,

1310
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,100
and kkori-gomtang.

1311
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:33,100
Kkori-gomtang to go first.

1312
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,133
It's boiling.

1313
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,533
Yu-mi, you can serve this.

1314
01:16:52,433 --> 01:16:53,934
Hold on. It should go together.

1315
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,133
Goodness.

1316
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,266
That was so fast.

1317
01:16:57,066 --> 01:16:58,033
Very fast.

1318
01:17:00,233 --> 01:17:03,934
Watch the pot. It's hot.

1319
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:04,867
Thank you.

1320
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,033
Oh, my gosh.

1321
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:11,033
Wow.

1322
01:17:11,867 --> 01:17:12,834
Is it good?

1323
01:17:15,467 --> 01:17:16,533
Wow...

1324
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:19,300
You did a good job.

1325
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,633
Kkori-gomtang got good responses.

1326
01:17:35,133 --> 01:17:35,967
Min-si,

1327
01:17:36,033 --> 01:17:38,033
it's easier if you put them
with your hands with gloves on.

1328
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,700
- With my hand?
- It will be much better.

1329
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:51,533
Right, put it up.

1330
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:52,433
Put it up.

1331
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:08,166
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1332
01:18:08,633 --> 01:18:09,734
It just hit three minutes.

1333
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:22,500
- It's hot.
- Okay.

1334
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,266
Aren't you proud?

1335
01:18:28,333 --> 01:18:29,166
I am.

1336
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:33,300
Well, this is...

1337
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,500
It's beautiful.

1338
01:18:34,567 --> 01:18:35,633
Well done.

1339
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:42,967
It's beautiful.

1340
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:44,834
Gosh, how do I eat this?

1341
01:18:44,934 --> 01:18:46,467
You can mix them all together.

1342
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:48,867
There is rice underneath the vegetables.

1343
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,734
Goodness.

1344
01:18:59,467 --> 01:19:00,433
It's very delicious.

1345
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:01,800
It's well seasoned

1346
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:02,767
- as I mix them.
- It's so good.

1347
01:19:03,133 --> 01:19:04,600
- That's good to know.
- It's not bland at all.

1348
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,033
This is very delicious.

1349
01:19:07,133 --> 01:19:08,767
But is the rice crispy?

1350
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:10,800
I think you should cook it a little more.

1351
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:11,867
Right, a bit more.

1352
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:44,100
Woo-shik, this is very delicious.

1353
01:19:45,333 --> 01:19:46,567
Where is my beef galbijjim?

1354
01:19:46,667 --> 01:19:48,300
It's coming.

1355
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:50,500
I'm angry. I'm getting angry.

1356
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,066
It's coming.

1357
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:54,333
Min-si, customers are mad now.

1358
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:55,667
- Okay.
- You need to hurry.

1359
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:05,533
I should just serve them.

1360
01:20:10,033 --> 01:20:13,734
Why would she hit the bell
and serve it herself?

1361
01:20:13,834 --> 01:20:15,533
My beef galbijjim.

1362
01:20:19,367 --> 01:20:20,734
Beautiful.

1363
01:20:24,767 --> 01:20:26,200
The meat is too tough.

1364
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:28,166
Gosh, it's too tough. What do we do now?

1365
01:20:28,266 --> 01:20:29,667
Your teeth might break.

1366
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:31,433
Is the meat tough?

1367
01:20:33,734 --> 01:20:35,166
I will sue you.

1368
01:20:35,233 --> 01:20:36,400
What?

1369
01:20:36,934 --> 01:20:37,867
He'd take legal actions.

1370
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:40,633
I will sue you.

1371
01:20:40,734 --> 01:20:42,266
The meat isn't all that tough.

1372
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,934
But the ones on the bones are too chewy.

1373
01:20:45,033 --> 01:20:48,667
I think I know why.

1374
01:20:48,767 --> 01:20:50,834
When we practiced cooking,

1375
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:52,734
we had the meat
completely covered with boiling water.

1376
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,467
- Then we boiled it hard.
- Right.

1377
01:20:54,567 --> 01:20:58,967
But the water boiled down
too quickly today.

1378
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:00,100
That could be why.

1379
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:02,367
Or the meat could be tougher here.

1380
01:21:03,433 --> 01:21:05,367
- Hello.
- This is our table.

1381
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:14,166
Hey, the beef is too tough.

1382
01:21:14,266 --> 01:21:17,233
But it was never this tough
when we cooked before.

1383
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,800
Oh, it's tasty.

1384
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,934
This tastes very nice.

1385
01:21:24,266 --> 01:21:26,867
I think the meat is random.
Some are tough and some are not.

1386
01:21:26,934 --> 01:21:28,333
- Right?
- Yes.

1387
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,100
It's tough.

1388
01:21:33,767 --> 01:21:34,667
What?

1389
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:37,900
This part is okay.

1390
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:38,967
- It's soft.
- Right.

1391
01:21:39,033 --> 01:21:41,000
But those weird-looking ones...

1392
01:21:41,066 --> 01:21:43,400
Right, but there are too many of them.

1393
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:45,800
I think we should trim them all again.

1394
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:47,867
We should trim them all some more.

1395
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:51,033
Right. We should trim meat a lot tomorrow.

1396
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:53,834
- How does it taste for you all?
- It's delicious.

1397
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,266
- It's all right, yes?
- Yes.

1398
01:21:55,367 --> 01:21:57,400
I think we just have to pay
more attention to beef galbijjim tomorrow.

1399
01:21:58,066 --> 01:21:59,767
But they all taste good.

1400
01:22:03,233 --> 01:22:05,266
Lastly, let's talk about
the most important thing.

1401
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:07,300
Please announce
the first shift workers for tomorrow.

1402
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:35,533
Choi Woo-Shik.

1403
01:22:36,867 --> 01:22:37,700
Choi Woo-Shik.

1404
01:22:46,066 --> 01:22:48,367
Oh, it's decided? It's all set?

1405
01:22:54,767 --> 01:22:56,200
You should walk out from there.

1406
01:23:00,867 --> 01:23:02,934
Sir, I mean, Mr. Lee.

1407
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:07,266
You have such talented chefs here
like Chef Yu-mi and Chef Seo-jun.

1408
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:10,867
Don't you think these two should start
the restaurant at this stage

1409
01:23:10,934 --> 01:23:12,100
when it's not fully systemized?

1410
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,133
We have seen them being chefs.

1411
01:23:16,767 --> 01:23:19,367
But we haven't seen Woo-shik as a chef.

1412
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:20,700
So we'll start with him.

1413
01:23:20,767 --> 01:23:22,533
So this is entirely for the show.

1414
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:23,667
In a way.

1415
01:23:23,734 --> 01:23:24,967
On top of that...

1416
01:23:25,066 --> 01:23:27,266
On top of that, he's not done yet.

1417
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,033
We won't have a lot of customers tomorrow.

1418
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,266
- So he's not an ace.
- That's not what I meant.

1419
01:23:35,367 --> 01:23:39,200
So it will be a good chance
for him to make his debut.

1420
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,767
For instance,

1421
01:23:43,834 --> 01:23:45,133
if the opponent team is the Dodgers...

1422
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:46,700
We should go with our best.

1423
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,100
But tomorrow is more like...

1424
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:51,166
It's a match against a weak team.

1425
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:54,300
So it will be a good chance
for him to make a debut.

1426
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,567
It won't be that busy tomorrow for sure.

1427
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:59,533
Woo-shik can take his time.

1428
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,834
You think he can handle it?

1429
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:03,734
Right. Tomorrow is just for him
to experience the whole thing.

1430
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,967
So tomorrow is a debut day for Woo-shik.

1431
01:24:09,033 --> 01:24:10,233
Right.

1432
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,633
I was torn for a second
because he had a burn on his finger.

1433
01:24:13,734 --> 01:24:14,734
Right, he had a burn.

1434
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,166
So I had a look at it.

1435
01:24:16,266 --> 01:24:19,033
But it was really small.

1436
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:22,033
I wasn't going to put him in charge
if his blister was big.

1437
01:24:22,467 --> 01:24:24,834
But his blister is really tiny.

1438
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,233
He made a big fuss about it.

1439
01:24:26,734 --> 01:24:30,467
Mr. Lee, do you think
you can have him work for another day

1440
01:24:30,533 --> 01:24:31,767
if he does well?

1441
01:24:32,333 --> 01:24:34,300
Sure. But will he do a good job?

1442
01:24:41,333 --> 01:24:42,967
Min-si. Let's do a good job
in the kitchen tomorrow.

1443
01:24:43,066 --> 01:24:43,934
- Okay.
- Goodness.

1444
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:45,400
So charismatic.

1445
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,166
- And Mr. Choi...
- Yes, Mr. Choi.

1446
01:24:48,266 --> 01:24:51,967
He didn't get to show it today. But he's
been practicing with spicy beef ribs.

1447
01:24:52,333 --> 01:24:53,900
- Do you want to make them?
- Yes, I can make them.

1448
01:24:53,967 --> 01:24:55,900
Oh, he's got the spirit.

1449
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,867
Woo-shik, we have to make
four beef galbijjim.

1450
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,667
Woo-shik, you're doing great.
You're doing amazing.

1451
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:22,300
Oh, no I'm in trouble.

1452
01:25:23,633 --> 01:25:24,467
Cheer up.

1453
01:25:31,033 --> 01:25:32,667
You didn't bring a bag?

1454
01:25:32,734 --> 01:25:33,700
No.

1455
01:25:35,166 --> 01:25:38,133
- We should have brought raincoats.
- Gosh, it's cold.

1456
01:25:38,700 --> 01:25:39,800
Min-si, are you okay?

1457
01:25:39,867 --> 01:25:41,000
Yes, I'm good.

1458
01:25:42,633 --> 01:25:44,467
It feels like we worked really hard today.

1459
01:25:44,533 --> 01:25:45,934
What do you think of your first day?

1460
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,200
I really have no thoughts right now.

1461
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,700
Tomorrow is the actual first day.

1462
01:25:50,767 --> 01:25:51,934
Goodness.

1463
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,900
Good job, Seo-jin.

1464
01:26:13,767 --> 01:26:15,734
My hair smells.

1465
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,800
- Gosh.
- You can't help it.

1466
01:26:19,066 --> 01:26:20,867
My fingertips smell like gochujang.

1467
01:26:23,567 --> 01:26:26,633
Min-si, if you push yourself too hard...

1468
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:28,233
I think

1469
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:30,533
you will need an IV in a week.

1470
01:26:30,633 --> 01:26:32,467
You have to stay well
until you return to Korea.

1471
01:26:32,533 --> 01:26:34,567
Keep your own pace.

1472
01:26:34,633 --> 01:26:36,900
You need to take your own breaks.

1473
01:26:36,967 --> 01:26:37,934
Okay.

1474
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,567
- Sit when you can.
- Right.

1475
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:42,233
You don't have to force yourself
to sit here, Min-si.

1476
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:43,166
- Yes.
- Okay?

1477
01:26:43,233 --> 01:26:45,867
You have sleepy eyes.

1478
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:48,133
I will see you tomorrow.
Good night.

1479
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,300
- Sleep tight.
- Good work.

1480
01:26:49,367 --> 01:26:50,600
You're going to take a shower, right?

1481
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,934
- Will you wash up?
- Yes.

1482
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:57,500
My goodness.

1483
01:26:58,333 --> 01:26:59,934
I forgot to take this.

1484
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:01,066
Take what?

1485
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:02,567
Gongjindan.

1486
01:27:02,633 --> 01:27:04,367
- I see.
- Do you have one?

1487
01:27:04,433 --> 01:27:05,567
No.

1488
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:07,033
You should take one.

1489
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,066
Can I take it now?

1490
01:27:08,133 --> 01:27:10,100
- No, tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

1491
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:12,600
Tomorrow we make rice.

1492
01:27:13,266 --> 01:27:15,033
We do a meal prep.

1493
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,200
Take two of these.

1494
01:27:16,266 --> 01:27:17,100
Thank you.

1495
01:27:17,967 --> 01:27:19,567
I'll have to cook mushroom.

1496
01:27:19,633 --> 01:27:23,200
The volume shrinks when it's stir-fried.

1497
01:27:23,967 --> 01:27:25,567
You should go to bed first.
You look tired.

1498
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,500
Of course, you are tired.

1499
01:27:28,834 --> 01:27:30,433
- Good night.
- Good night.

1500
01:28:20,900 --> 01:28:22,033
Gosh, it's cold.

1501
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:27,700
- Good morning.
- Gosh, you scared me.

1502
01:28:27,767 --> 01:28:28,934
Oh, good morning.

1503
01:28:54,567 --> 01:28:56,700
- Hi.
- Hello.

1504
01:28:56,800 --> 01:28:59,000
I wish there are customers today.

1505
01:28:59,066 --> 01:29:00,367
There should be at least one customer.

1506
01:29:00,467 --> 01:29:02,500
Honestly, do you want
a lot of customers...

1507
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:04,133
Or do you want to be free
with no customers?

1508
01:29:05,367 --> 01:29:06,834
I wish it doesn't get so busy today.

1509
01:29:08,433 --> 01:29:10,333
Just today.

1510
01:29:10,433 --> 01:29:12,200
Chef Woo-shik is making his debut today.

1511
01:29:12,734 --> 01:29:14,300
So you don't trust him.

1512
01:29:14,367 --> 01:29:15,433
No, it's not that.

1513
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:18,967
It's my first time working with him too.

1514
01:29:19,033 --> 01:29:20,834
We have so many things to do today.

1515
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:24,033
We cleared a lot of tasks yesterday.
How come I still have many things to do?

1516
01:29:24,133 --> 01:29:27,367
So Ms. Jung gave me this.

1517
01:29:27,467 --> 01:29:28,433
Gongjindan.

1518
01:29:29,333 --> 01:29:30,800
She gave me gongjindan.

1519
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,333
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1520
01:29:33,433 --> 01:29:34,266
Hello.

1521
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:37,266
The pillow mark won't come off.
Gosh, what do I do?

1522
01:29:39,433 --> 01:29:41,100
This jet lag...

1523
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,433
Oh, no. Seo-jin.

1524
01:29:44,834 --> 01:29:46,734
That's my part to worry.

1525
01:29:46,834 --> 01:29:48,066
Today's main chef is here.

1526
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:51,200
Oh, the main chef.

1527
01:29:52,033 --> 01:29:53,200
His outfit is different.

1528
01:29:53,266 --> 01:29:55,100
He's very charismatic.

1529
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,734
What's with the scarf on his neck?

1530
01:29:58,900 --> 01:29:59,867
What?

1531
01:30:01,567 --> 01:30:03,367
He seems to be in a good mood today.

1532
01:30:03,467 --> 01:30:05,166
I had a good sleep.

1533
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,667
- Great.
- Nice.

1534
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,233
Woo-shik went to bed early last night.

1535
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:11,900
That's what I call responsibility.

1536
01:30:12,433 --> 01:30:13,567
How did you sleep, Min-si?

1537
01:30:13,633 --> 01:30:14,767
I had a good sleep.

1538
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:15,934
Yesterday, I...

1539
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:20,266
Min-si's role is really important today.

1540
01:30:21,033 --> 01:30:22,100
My right arm is...

1541
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:23,567
I mean I can't use my left arm...

1542
01:30:23,667 --> 01:30:25,133
- Right, your thumb.
- ...because of my thumb.

1543
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,033
Yes, chef.

1544
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,000
- Yes, Mr. Choi.
- Yes, Mr. Choi.

1545
01:30:30,133 --> 01:30:34,233
Finally, it's time for Woo-shik
to have responsibility.

1546
01:30:34,333 --> 01:30:35,333
Right. You can tell, yes?

1547
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:37,233
He hasn't been working hard.

1548
01:30:37,333 --> 01:30:39,433
He has been slacking and lying.

1549
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:41,767
He lied all the time.

1550
01:30:41,867 --> 01:30:43,867
But look at Min-si.

1551
01:30:43,934 --> 01:30:46,066
She is the first one to come to work
as an intern.

1552
01:30:46,133 --> 01:30:47,033
She's the hardest worker.

1553
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:48,333
We never had an intern like her.

1554
01:30:48,433 --> 01:30:50,000
Really? No?

1555
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:54,767
I've never seen an intern like her.

1556
01:30:54,834 --> 01:30:55,900
All interns were like...

1557
01:30:55,967 --> 01:30:57,500
Woo-shik and Tae-hyung.

1558
01:30:57,567 --> 01:30:59,000
I thought all interns are like them.

1559
01:30:59,066 --> 01:31:01,100
But she sets a great example.

1560
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:02,300
She only works hard.

1561
01:31:04,433 --> 01:31:05,333
And consistent.

1562
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,734
She works even if nobody
tells her to do so.

1563
01:31:19,734 --> 01:31:21,166
He might fall down with those glasses.

1564
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:23,333
I've been thinking...

1565
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:25,633
We have a lot who are making debuts today.

1566
01:31:25,734 --> 01:31:27,467
Woo-shik's debut as a chef.

1567
01:31:27,533 --> 01:31:28,800
Min-si's debut.

1568
01:31:28,867 --> 01:31:30,767
- The director's debut.
- It's his debut as a main director.

1569
01:31:30,834 --> 01:31:31,867
Is it his debut day?

1570
01:31:32,567 --> 01:31:35,333
He was being nonsense.
He expected 20 tables today.

1571
01:31:36,033 --> 01:31:37,066
He hasn't pulled himself together.

1572
01:31:38,266 --> 01:31:39,734
If we have 20 tables today,

1573
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:41,633
we are doomed.

1574
01:31:42,400 --> 01:31:44,033
We will be in big trouble.

1575
01:31:57,567 --> 01:32:00,734
Why would people disappear
whenever we open our restaurant?

1576
01:32:01,467 --> 01:32:04,200
Why does it rain on our first day
without any customers?

1577
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:08,166
It's driving me crazy.

1578
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:40,867
This is the camera to shoot
you on your way to work.

1579
01:32:40,934 --> 01:32:42,367
I see.

1580
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:44,600
I'll take a video of how it's like at work
or you on your way to work.

1581
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:45,500
Right.

1582
01:32:51,166 --> 01:32:52,300
Well.

1583
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:54,200
Hello.

1584
01:32:55,166 --> 01:32:57,734
I'm the head chef of today, Choi Woo-shik.

1585
01:33:00,467 --> 01:33:02,734
We are in Iceland.

1586
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,533
It's cold because it's really windy.

1587
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,133
It's windy and snowy.

1588
01:33:10,967 --> 01:33:13,333
The weather changes a lot.

1589
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:28,500
Well...

1590
01:33:31,867 --> 01:33:33,967
The special menu I'll be making today...

1591
01:33:34,033 --> 01:33:34,900
DRUM ROLLS

1592
01:33:34,967 --> 01:33:37,800
It's hot beef galbijjim.

1593
01:33:38,734 --> 01:33:40,767
Well...

1594
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,033
I wish there are many customers today.

1595
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:52,834
We...

1596
01:33:53,934 --> 01:33:56,166
We go to work at 9 a.m..

1597
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:59,300
I wish we could

1598
01:33:59,367 --> 01:34:01,467
work until midnight

1599
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:03,266
because of many customers.

1600
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:05,233
Hey, Woo-shik.

1601
01:34:05,300 --> 01:34:06,900
- Yes?
- You should have shot this.

1602
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:09,567
What is this? It's hilarious.

1603
01:34:15,133 --> 01:34:17,000
This is hilarious.

1604
01:34:18,467 --> 01:34:21,000
This is your signature menu,
spicy beef galbijjim.

1605
01:34:21,066 --> 01:34:24,834
My goodness. This photo is hilarious.

1606
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:43,367
Hey, only the chef gets the gold badge.

1607
01:34:43,433 --> 01:34:44,333
Goodness.

1608
01:34:44,433 --> 01:34:46,266
Chef Choi.

1609
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:13,333
One, we always do our best
to keep it hygienic.

1610
01:35:13,433 --> 01:35:14,300
- One.
- We keep it hygienic.

1611
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,700
Two. You wash your hands
as often as possible during work.

1612
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,734
- Wash hands.
- Wash hands.

1613
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:20,233
Three. You always wear clean outfits.

1614
01:35:20,333 --> 01:35:21,233
- Clean outfits.
- Clean outfits.

1615
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:24,433
Four. Clean all the cooking tools
when the business is over.

1616
01:35:24,533 --> 01:35:25,700
Wear clean outfits.

1617
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:26,834
- Clean outfits.
- Clean outfits.

1618
01:35:26,934 --> 01:35:30,066
Four. You clean all cooking tools
when the business is over.

1619
01:35:30,133 --> 01:35:31,300
- Clean tools.
- Clean tools.

1620
01:35:31,900 --> 01:35:35,600
Five. Always ask when you are unsure.

1621
01:35:35,667 --> 01:35:36,934
- We ask.
- We ask.

1622
01:35:37,033 --> 01:35:38,333
We have to ask!

1623
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,734
How about,
"1,2,3. 1,2,3. Jinny's Ttukbaegi?"

1624
01:35:42,834 --> 01:35:43,667
- Do we put it up?
- Yes.

1625
01:35:43,734 --> 01:35:44,600
- Okay.
- Put it up.

1626
01:35:44,667 --> 01:35:45,567
- Up.
- Up.

1627
01:35:45,633 --> 01:35:47,233
All right. 1, 2, 3.

1628
01:35:47,300 --> 01:35:48,767
1, 2, 3. 1, 2, 3.

1629
01:35:48,834 --> 01:35:50,467
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi.
- Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

1630
01:35:53,567 --> 01:35:54,500
Let's go!

1631
01:35:56,033 --> 01:35:59,100
Line up and wash your hands.

1632
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,633
I've never heard you

1633
01:36:58,700 --> 01:37:01,100
speaking in such a loud voice.

1634
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:02,633
When you read this...

1635
01:37:02,734 --> 01:37:04,300
You ask!

1636
01:37:04,767 --> 01:37:06,800
I was just supporting Woo-shik.

1637
01:37:06,867 --> 01:37:07,934
Oh, no wonder.

1638
01:37:08,033 --> 01:37:09,967
He didn't hear you.

1639
01:37:25,233 --> 01:37:27,400
I'll add vegetable broth here.

1640
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:54,300
Since Min-si joined,

1641
01:37:55,066 --> 01:37:57,166
it feels like there are two interns.

1642
01:37:58,667 --> 01:38:00,767
She is doing so much by herself.

1643
01:38:09,066 --> 01:38:10,533
Is this the only slicer for potatoes?

1644
01:38:11,066 --> 01:38:12,967
- It doesn't slice at all.
- It doesn't work well.

1645
01:38:13,066 --> 01:38:14,567
Is this the only potato slicer?

1646
01:38:15,233 --> 01:38:16,934
- It doesn't slice well.
- It doesn't work.

1647
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:32,867
I'll slice it for you.

1648
01:38:32,934 --> 01:38:34,567
Oh, this is better.

1649
01:38:51,266 --> 01:38:52,333
Do I have to slice them all?

1650
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,533
- I think five should be enough.
- Five pieces?

1651
01:39:10,266 --> 01:39:11,800
Why would you shoot this?

1652
01:39:12,767 --> 01:39:13,900
Goodness.

1653
01:39:14,667 --> 01:39:15,600
What?

1654
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,934
Five pieces?

1655
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,066
Yes, it should be enough.

1656
01:39:22,467 --> 01:39:23,934
- Min-si.
- Yes.

1657
01:39:24,033 --> 01:39:25,500
- The corners...
- I should keep them round.

1658
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:26,433
Right.

1659
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,767
Can we serve bibimbap right away?

1660
01:39:34,834 --> 01:39:35,667
Yes.

1661
01:39:59,734 --> 01:40:01,567
- What's the temperture?
- 70°C.

1662
01:40:01,633 --> 01:40:02,734
- 70°C?
- Yes.

1663
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,033
You know head chefs...

1664
01:40:05,133 --> 01:40:06,133
We don't do much.

1665
01:40:10,367 --> 01:40:11,300
This looks great.

1666
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,300
- That should be enough.
- Okay.

1667
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:18,834
That should be enough.

1668
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:26,367
That's done. We can boil this.

1669
01:40:26,433 --> 01:40:28,633
Kkori-gomtang is getting done. Great.

1670
01:40:29,967 --> 01:40:31,200
I'll be pre-frying vegetables.

1671
01:40:51,066 --> 01:40:52,600
You're good at this.

1672
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:54,133
- What?
- You're good.

1673
01:41:07,166 --> 01:41:09,033
I'm putting these potatoes.

1674
01:41:33,867 --> 01:41:36,000
Gosh, you passed.

1675
01:41:41,633 --> 01:41:43,667
It's 30 minutes
before we open the restaurant.

1676
01:41:44,233 --> 01:41:45,767
- Chef.
- Yes.

1677
01:41:45,834 --> 01:41:47,166
Please take a look at beef galbijjim.

1678
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:48,066
Sure.

1679
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:51,233
Oh...

1680
01:41:58,633 --> 01:41:59,667
Oh!

1681
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:03,900
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1682
01:42:10,734 --> 01:42:12,367
We didn't trim the meat a lot.

1683
01:42:12,433 --> 01:42:13,400
Does it all look okay?

1684
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:19,500
Oh!

1685
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:20,567
This tastes nice.

1686
01:42:23,300 --> 01:42:24,600
We can boil it down from here.

1687
01:42:33,233 --> 01:42:35,066
Gosh, this tastes so good.

1688
01:42:40,633 --> 01:42:41,834
Shall we start setting up?

1689
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:47,934
Welcome to Jinny's Ttukbaegi.

1690
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,233
I'll put the cups.

1691
01:42:57,100 --> 01:42:59,000
Be careful.

1692
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,400
Let's open the restaurant now.

1693
01:43:22,467 --> 01:43:23,600
- Okay.
- Sure.

1694
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:26,300
We have to taste it all now.

1695
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:28,767
We can taste it
after opening the restaurant.

1696
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:31,467
Salt...

1697
01:43:37,367 --> 01:43:38,934
- Hey, Woo-shik.
- Yes.

1698
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:39,867
Come out.

1699
01:43:45,066 --> 01:43:47,500
Soy sauce and salt...

1700
01:43:47,967 --> 01:43:49,133
Hey, Woo-shik!

1701
01:43:57,700 --> 01:43:59,166
Chef, Chef Choi.

1702
01:44:04,166 --> 01:44:05,133
Min-si, you do it.

1703
01:44:05,533 --> 01:44:06,500
Do what?

1704
01:44:06,567 --> 01:44:07,667
Turn the sign over.

1705
01:44:08,266 --> 01:44:09,166
Go outside.

1706
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,900
- This one.
- Oh, I got it.

1707
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:14,934
Oh, it's done.

1708
01:44:16,734 --> 01:44:18,033
Goodness.

1709
01:44:21,166 --> 01:44:22,300
You should flip the sign inside too.

1710
01:44:22,367 --> 01:44:23,867
The one inside too?

1711
01:44:26,700 --> 01:44:28,700
- Min-si. Flip this one.
- Okay.

1712
01:44:38,433 --> 01:44:39,734
What, we have a customer now?

1713
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:41,300
We can't have customers now.

1714
01:44:48,500 --> 01:44:50,834
- I think we have customers.
- We can't have customers now.

1715
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:51,767
What?

1716
01:45:01,367 --> 01:45:02,734
What, we have customers now?

1717
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:04,367
- We can't have customers now.
- We have customers.

1718
01:45:04,433 --> 01:45:05,400
What?

1719
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:20,467
We should hurry up.

1720
01:45:23,467 --> 01:45:25,433
Hello. Welcome.

1721
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:27,433
Please come in.

1722
01:45:31,633 --> 01:45:32,667
Oh, my gosh.

1723
01:45:32,734 --> 01:45:33,700
Woo-shik.

1724
01:45:41,066 --> 01:45:42,133
How many people for your table?

1725
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:43,967
- Six.
- Six?

1726
01:45:44,066 --> 01:45:45,900
You can sit in there for six people.

1727
01:45:45,967 --> 01:45:47,567
You can go to the private room inside.

1728
01:45:49,033 --> 01:45:50,066
It's a room for big groups.

1729
01:45:58,166 --> 01:45:59,333
Oh, gosh. This is crazy.

1730
01:46:22,200 --> 01:46:23,233
Oh, there's bibimbap.

1731
01:46:23,967 --> 01:46:26,166
We can order one each and share.

1732
01:46:26,567 --> 01:46:28,166
But it says it's not open.

1733
01:46:29,500 --> 01:46:31,200
It's not open yet?

1734
01:46:39,266 --> 01:46:40,100
Min-si, you do it.

1735
01:46:40,767 --> 01:46:41,734
Do what?

1736
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:42,900
You can turn over the sign.

1737
01:46:44,166 --> 01:46:45,667
Goodness.

1738
01:46:48,066 --> 01:46:49,667
Goodness.

1739
01:47:02,233 --> 01:47:03,734
Inside the room.

1740
01:47:12,066 --> 01:47:14,233
Min-si, we got a problem.

1741
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:15,700
- What happened?
- We got a problem.

1742
01:47:15,767 --> 01:47:16,800
- We don't know the menu yet.
- What?

1743
01:47:16,867 --> 01:47:18,066
But for now...

1744
01:47:18,133 --> 01:47:20,200
- I know.
- There are only three menus.

1745
01:47:20,266 --> 01:47:21,734
- We can do this.
- I'm sure they will order this.

1746
01:47:21,834 --> 01:47:24,000
- We can do this.
- Wait a second. This can't be happening.

1747
01:47:24,100 --> 01:47:25,300
Why? What happened?

1748
01:47:25,367 --> 01:47:28,133
- I can't believe we have a group of six.
- Six people?

1749
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:30,967
Gosh, that just gave me chills.

1750
01:47:31,066 --> 01:47:33,233
2, 2, 2.

1751
01:48:10,467 --> 01:48:11,400
Hi. Welcome.

1752
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:13,667
Hey, we have customers rushing in now.

1753
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:16,400
We have to cook each menu.

1754
01:48:16,467 --> 01:48:17,567
Oh, gosh.

1755
01:48:17,667 --> 01:48:19,266
- Each menu.
- Spicy beef galbijjim and galbijjim.

1756
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,900
- Spicy beef galbijjim too?
- Dolsot-bibimbap.

1757
01:48:20,967 --> 01:48:21,800
And kkori-gomtang.

1758
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:22,834
What? We have more orders?

1759
01:48:22,900 --> 01:48:24,467
Yes, one dolsot-bibimbap.

1760
01:48:24,567 --> 01:48:25,967
One beef galbijjim.

1761
01:48:26,033 --> 01:48:26,867
Another dolsot-bibimbap?

1762
01:48:26,967 --> 01:48:28,633
There will be seven more orders.

1763
01:48:28,734 --> 01:48:29,567
Gosh!

1764
01:48:29,633 --> 01:48:31,700
We have new orders.

1765
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:34,667
It's a matter of
Wook-shik throwing a strike

1766
01:48:34,734 --> 01:48:36,133
or getting a wild pitch.

1767
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:41,967
You are doing great.

1768
01:48:58,333 --> 01:48:59,567
Please cross out beef galbijjim.

1769
01:48:59,633 --> 01:49:00,533
Yes, I did.

1770
01:49:00,633 --> 01:49:02,333
- Please get the rice.
- I did.

1771
01:49:03,133 --> 01:49:04,734
You are really good at this.

1772
01:49:05,967 --> 01:49:07,467
Min-si does a good job.

1773
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:09,734
She did an excellent job.

1774
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:16,433
Okay, great.

1775
01:49:22,333 --> 01:49:24,200
Oh, no! The rice...

1776
01:49:24,266 --> 01:49:26,367
- That's all we have?
- Yes, this is all we have.

1777
01:49:28,233 --> 01:49:30,567
I told you. We can make only four servings
of beef galbijjim now.

1778
01:49:32,967 --> 01:49:34,433
- No more beef galbijjim?
- No, we're running out.

1779
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,533
- No rice too?
- We're cooking a new batch.

1780
01:49:36,633 --> 01:49:38,166
We can't do business at this rate.

1781
01:49:38,233 --> 01:49:39,266
- You are right.
- Yes.

1782
01:49:39,367 --> 01:49:40,567
You know what?

1783
01:49:40,633 --> 01:49:42,567
I think we should get more meat now.

1784
01:49:46,633 --> 01:49:48,133
I don't think it's enough.

1785
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:53,000
Working with no thoughts again.

1786
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:01,400
Gosh, we have to stir-fry onions
some more.

1787
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:02,900
What else do we have to do?

1788
01:50:02,967 --> 01:50:04,433
We can open at 6, right?

1789
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:07,867
How many?

1790
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:14,767
How many?

1791
01:50:15,367 --> 01:50:17,100
- Three people.
- Three people? Okay.

1792
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,300
How many?

1793
01:50:18,967 --> 01:50:19,800
Yes.

1794
01:50:28,500 --> 01:50:30,033
Three people? Okay.

1795
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,967
We have 14 customers now.

1796
01:50:35,700 --> 01:50:37,033
- Fourteen?
- Fourteen people?

1797
01:50:38,934 --> 01:50:41,533
Min-si. We have no time to laugh.
Hurry up.

1798
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,266
- We have to hurry.
- Yes, we have to hurry up.

1799
01:50:44,533 --> 01:50:46,433
Hey, it's Woo-shik's birthday next week.

1800
01:50:46,533 --> 01:50:48,100
- Is it?
- Yes.

1801
01:50:48,166 --> 01:50:49,633
So you're getting a year older in Iceland?

1802
01:50:49,700 --> 01:50:50,734
Yes.

1803
01:50:50,834 --> 01:50:51,834
So Woo-shik said,

1804
01:50:51,900 --> 01:50:54,967
"Don't make a fuss
about my birthday there."

1805
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:59,367
Don't prepare for anything. I mean it.

1806
01:50:59,433 --> 01:51:00,900
I'm busy.

1807
01:51:00,967 --> 01:51:02,000
It's just a week from now.

1808
01:51:02,066 --> 01:51:03,667
You think I'd make something for you?

1809
01:51:03,767 --> 01:51:06,367
- You never know.
- Seo-jin will make

1810
01:51:07,266 --> 01:51:08,734
a cake for you.

1811
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,633
Me?

1812
01:51:09,967 --> 01:51:10,934
Bake something for him.

1813
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,900
- And we will...
- I can't bake.

1814
01:51:12,967 --> 01:51:14,967
...put candles that say "I love you."

1815
01:51:16,033 --> 01:51:17,867
We're busy running the restaurant.

1816
01:51:17,934 --> 01:51:19,834
I can't be baking for Woo-shik's birthday.

1817
01:51:22,900 --> 01:51:23,967
