00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:21,000
Hello. I'm the chef of the day.

3
00:00:22,133 --> 00:00:23,533
I'm the chef of the day.

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,567
You will be nervous today.

5
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:33,400
They can go together.

6
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,700
She surely is experienced.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,734
All for Table Three.

8
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,633
Okay.

9
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:43,000
I feel reassured.

10
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm at ease.

11
00:00:44,467 --> 00:00:46,300
We don't know what will happen.

12
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,667
Yu-mi, you're good.

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,600
Guide them inside.

14
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,000
It's good to see you.

15
00:01:53,934 --> 00:01:56,000
Look. We're taking a photo.

16
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,433
I think this is...

17
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,533
So what is this show?

18
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,100
The actors work here as servers?

19
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,033
They just...

20
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,433
It's suspicious.
Something must be behind this.

21
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,934
They must be spying on us.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,800
Collecting information
on presidential election.

23
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:19,867
We went to Korea in 1996.

24
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:21,367
No, it was 1997.

25
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,700
In 1997...

26
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,934
Why did you go that far?

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,467
There was a theater festival in Seoul.

28
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,734
Didn't you go there again after that?

29
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,633
No, but he went
to the Military Demarcation Line.

30
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:37,700
During the trip?

31
00:02:37,767 --> 00:02:40,600
No, I was too busy performing.

32
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:45,800
What impressed me was...

33
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:49,867
that there were small shops
that sold luxury brands.

34
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,300
But behind that shop was nothing.

35
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:56,734
That was the true reality of Korea then.

36
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,867
It felt like I was walking
behind the stage curtains.

37
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:03,767
A whole new side was there
right behind the shop.

38
00:03:03,834 --> 00:03:05,600
It was so unique then.

39
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:07,400
I really want to go to Korea.

40
00:03:08,066 --> 00:03:09,800
We have a group of eight.

41
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,433
Just in case...

43
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,467
Gosh.

44
00:03:28,533 --> 00:03:29,900
My pants keep falling.

45
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,300
Am I losing weight?

46
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,867
I should change my gloves.

47
00:03:42,033 --> 00:03:42,867
Me too.

48
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:44,734
How come they keep getting wet?

49
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,867
- Pruney fingers?
- Like granny's hands.

50
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:49,200
We're taking an order from the group.

51
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,367
What do you think they will order?

52
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:54,233
They'll order everything.
It's eight people.

53
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,934
They'll order beef galbijjim for sure.

54
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,033
I wish they order kkori-gomtang.

55
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,700
Didn't you say it tastes extra good today?

56
00:04:14,767 --> 00:04:16,333
Delicious kkori-gomtang.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,233
I'm sure they'll order one.

58
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:44,133
Do you want to share this?

59
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,834
We'll share it, so just one bottle.

60
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,500
What's "Thank you" in Korean?

61
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,400
Gamsahamnida.

62
00:05:18,467 --> 00:05:19,667
Gamsahamnida.

63
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,767
Four galbijjim.

64
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,000
Just put half spoon of gochujang
for bibimbap.

65
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,000
Just half.

66
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,200
And one kkori-gomtang.

67
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,233
Kkori-gomtang!

68
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:04,133
I think it's still spicy.

69
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,567
It's fine, we can add more rice.

70
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,400
You can mix it with more rice.

71
00:06:26,934 --> 00:06:29,567
These, with less spice, are ready.

72
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,867
Okay.

73
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,400
Great.

74
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,300
Should I remove gomtang?

75
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:38,133
Yes, it's done.

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,533
It's done. We need a trivet.

77
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:51,000
- Are these ready?
- Yes.

78
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:51,900
Four dishes.

79
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:58,266
These bowls all come with less spice.

80
00:06:59,934 --> 00:07:01,266
For the group.

81
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:03,633
Galbijjim?

82
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:22,600
Oh, I'm nervous.

83
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,300
I almost dropped it.

84
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,767
Seo-jun, help me with this.

85
00:07:43,834 --> 00:07:45,333
It looks delicious.

86
00:07:58,467 --> 00:07:59,300
Gamsahamnida.

87
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,433
Gamsahamnida.

88
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,100
Is bibimbap spicy?

89
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:19,500
Not at all. It's mild.

90
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:23,734
Do I tear the seaweed?

91
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,600
You take one piece of seaweed.

92
00:08:27,667 --> 00:08:30,233
Then put everything together as a wrap.

93
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,834
- Okay.
- This is fun.

94
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,066
You're spilling food.

95
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:39,633
Look. You'll be sophisticated like me
if you watch a lot of TV.

96
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,133
Show me how to eat this.

97
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,767
It's good with seaweed.

98
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,734
How's bibimbap? Is it good?

99
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,400
It's delicious.

100
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,133
- How is it?
- It's really good.

101
00:09:15,233 --> 00:09:16,834
This tastes very authentic.

102
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,333
What do I do with the bone?

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,467
Well...

104
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:24,600
You just have to bite it off.
That's how Koreans eat it.

105
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,333
She's finishing the whole bottle of soju.

106
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,233
What?

107
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,734
She's drinking the soju all by herself.

108
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:51,100
She finished it.

109
00:10:05,266 --> 00:10:06,567
I'll finish this.

110
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,734
Can I order dessert?

111
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,967
- Are you done?
- Almost.

112
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Hey, he's talking to the lady.

113
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:31,667
When do you want it?

114
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,767
- You can give it to me now.
- Okay.

115
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,767
Yes, I'm almost done eating.

116
00:10:52,667 --> 00:10:54,367
- Here's your dessert.
- Okay.

117
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,133
Can I take it?

118
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,734
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

119
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,400
Sombae... Sombaek.

120
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,166
Sombaek?

121
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,400
- Somaek.
- Somaek!

122
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,533
Can I try it?

123
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,433
I'm spending 300,000 won here.

124
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,700
It's fine. It's a special experience.

125
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,734
It's all for the experience.

126
00:12:00,934 --> 00:12:02,200
Do I pay here?

127
00:12:02,266 --> 00:12:03,467
You want to pay?

128
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:04,500
Hold on.

129
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,000
One second.

130
00:12:06,066 --> 00:12:07,834
Are you paying by credit card?

131
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:09,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

132
00:12:09,266 --> 00:12:11,300
It's an honor to meet you.

133
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:12,633
Thank you.

134
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,800
This is 5,000...

135
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,867
- Here.
- Thank you.

136
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:18,333
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

137
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,500
Okay. Try this.

138
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:47,900
I just tried it.

139
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,000
You tried it already?

140
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,533
The food was great.

141
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,066
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:13:34,633 --> 00:13:36,967
That's 20,000 krona.

143
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,433
It's cozy here.

144
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,834
I'll take this.

145
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:34,967
What is that?

146
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:36,834
It's the hardest dish to make.

147
00:14:37,533 --> 00:14:40,233
- It's the one your friend told you about?
- Yes.

148
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,667
Right, that sounds delicious.

149
00:14:42,734 --> 00:14:45,333
Yes, this must be the main dish.

150
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,367
I see.

151
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,900
I'll order whatever you recommend.

152
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,967
Something that isn't so spicy.

153
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,100
- Non-spicy?
- Yes, non-spicy.

154
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,834
- We have a new order.
- Okay.

155
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,066
I'll take this one out.

156
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,867
Three beef galbijjim.

157
00:15:40,934 --> 00:15:42,967
One spicy galbijjim.

158
00:15:43,033 --> 00:15:43,867
Okay.

159
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,900
Then rice...

160
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:04,700
Min-si, slow down.

161
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,533
- You don't have to rush.
- Okay.

162
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:21,333
They finished the entire thing.

163
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,133
- They loved it.
- Nice.

164
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,367
Chef, they loved it.

165
00:17:24,433 --> 00:17:25,800
They finished it all.

166
00:17:25,867 --> 00:17:27,233
- I'm glad.
- I know.

167
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm so relieved.

168
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,133
Do you need help?

169
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:32,500
- This.
- Okay.

170
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:33,934
You can do this here.

171
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,300
Should I cook it here?

172
00:17:35,367 --> 00:17:36,867
- I'll boil it down.
- Okay.

173
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:38,934
It's just starting to boil.

174
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,734
The chili powder is in lumps.

175
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,633
Oh, okay.

176
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,033
Is this enough?

177
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,834
- Yes. And potatoes too.
- Okay.

178
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,900
- Add potatoes.
- I'll turn off the heat and add them.

179
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:13,100
Three pieces of potato.

180
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,867
- Here.
- Okay.

181
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:02,333
I just have to add the fritters on top.

182
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,533
Here.

183
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,066
All dishes are ready.

184
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,233
Who's having the spicy one?

185
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:31,400
- It looks so good.
- Yes, it looks so nice.

186
00:19:32,567 --> 00:19:33,600
What's this?

187
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:35,433
- Kimchi.
- Yes, this is kimchi.

188
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,033
Shouldn't we take pictures?

189
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,567
Should we take pictures?

190
00:19:40,633 --> 00:19:42,800
Yes, they look delicious.

191
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:49,066
Can you stand up and take a picture of
the whole ? Please send me the photo.

192
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,100
Stand on the chair.

193
00:19:57,734 --> 00:19:59,467
That looks nice.

194
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:03,000
It's great.
I'm sure one of them isn't blurry.

195
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,900
I saw this earlier. It looked delicious.

196
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:07,800
Right.

197
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,166
- It's so good.
- Yes.

198
00:20:10,433 --> 00:20:11,967
Is this traditional food?

199
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:15,100
These plates look very Scandinavian.

200
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,633
- Oh, this is...
- It's spicy.

201
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,700
Kimchi is spicy, but good.

202
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:22,600
Right.

203
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,967
This kimchi is good.

204
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:26,266
It's the best kimchi I've ever had.

205
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,266
How do I eat this?

206
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,300
I don't know.

207
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:40,433
Do I eat it with my hands?

208
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,533
People do eat it with their hands.

209
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,934
No, look. The bone comes off easily.

210
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
It gets removed easily.

211
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,367
This is really good.

212
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,500
The meat is cooked very well.

213
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:04,967
It's really good.

214
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,533
Right, it's delicious.

215
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:09,300
We should cook it like this too.

216
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,400
Is this what you liked
when you were a kid?

217
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:17,033
Tteokbokki and barbecue.

218
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,266
I see.

219
00:21:19,266 --> 00:21:21,700
Bibimbap here...

220
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,600
It looks so good.

221
00:21:26,233 --> 00:21:28,300
Do you want to try dolsot-bibimbap?

222
00:21:28,367 --> 00:21:29,367
I want to try it.

223
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:30,700
Should we share one?

224
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:42,600
We did a lot of meal preps.

225
00:21:43,734 --> 00:21:45,100
We have to do it again.

226
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,333
Goodness.

227
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,767
Can you make one bibimbap?

228
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:51,767
Bibimbap?

229
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,066
Yes, I can make it.

230
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:31,033
Can you make one bibimbap?

231
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,934
- Bibimbap?
- Yes.

232
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,066
I can make it right now.

233
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,433
- An extra order?
- Yes.

234
00:22:44,867 --> 00:22:47,033
You seem more relaxed today.

235
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,767
What's the secret?

236
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,600
I've done it all yesterday.

237
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:52,567
So I fixed yesterday's problems.

238
00:22:52,633 --> 00:22:54,200
Then I tried to speed up.

239
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,900
And also the chef...

240
00:22:56,967 --> 00:22:59,367
I tend to follow the chef's style.

241
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:03,467
That's why I am more relaxed today.

242
00:23:06,066 --> 00:23:07,233
Yesterday, he was like...

243
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,133
This is what he did...

244
00:23:12,867 --> 00:23:15,166
This is what he did...

245
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,133
- Did anyone gossip about me?
- No.

246
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,633
- Why?
- Nobody.

247
00:23:34,767 --> 00:23:35,633
What's wrong?

248
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,467
Look at your eye bags, you got skinny.

249
00:23:37,533 --> 00:23:39,033
Dolsot-bibimbap is ready.

250
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:40,967
Dolsot-bibimbap?

251
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,467
- Hold on.
- Yes.

252
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,834
- Hold on.
- Yes?

253
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,767
Hold on.

254
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,667
Why did I come here?

255
00:23:52,533 --> 00:23:53,367
- Okay.
- Sure.

256
00:23:55,266 --> 00:23:56,166
I got this.

257
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,533
We'll share it.

258
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,367
This is cute.

259
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,633
Yes, it's very pretty.

260
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,066
There is no sauce?

261
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,867
There is gochujang here.

262
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,667
I see.

263
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,867
So this is how you mix it.

264
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:27,633
You have to mix it well.

265
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,700
You're good at that.

266
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:33,333
So you will ruin it
once the pretty decoration is done.

267
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,533
"Bibim" means to mix.

268
00:24:37,333 --> 00:24:39,233
What's this menu again?

269
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,633
Bi...Bap?

270
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,500
Bibimbapi?

271
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:43,767
- Bibimbap.
- Bibimbap.

272
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,667
Bibimbap.

273
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,367
- Bibimbap?
- Yes, that's it.

274
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,934
This is really good.
It tastes very familiar.

275
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Don't you think so?

276
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,100
Isn't it because of sesame oil?

277
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:04,166
- That's what I thought.
- Right.

278
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,900
It's our second time
having Korean food together.

279
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:08,033
You are right.

280
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,600
We've been to one restaurant.

281
00:25:10,667 --> 00:25:12,033
Shall we toast to that?

282
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,800
Sure.

283
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,800
Let's make army stew soon.

284
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,867
Can we put the stone bowls
in the dishwasher?

285
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:30,500
We can, but they don't get cleaned well.

286
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,633
What?

287
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,200
Too many dishes to wash.

288
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:09,900
It isn't ending.

289
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,266
Oh, goodness.

290
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:13,767
They eat so well.

291
00:26:13,934 --> 00:26:15,734
They finished everything.

292
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,166
They can eat so well.

293
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,000
- What?
- What?

294
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,867
How did they eat it like this?

295
00:26:34,934 --> 00:26:36,066
Did they finish it?

296
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,467
Oh, that's washed.

297
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,800
- This is washed.
- Yes.

298
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:45,734
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- Me too.

299
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,500
We haven't had dinner.

300
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,834
- I thought there was no water.
- My gosh.

301
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:06,767
Sorry, Woo-shik.

302
00:27:07,266 --> 00:27:08,500
I'm sorry.

303
00:27:15,867 --> 00:27:16,834
Hey, you...

304
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:18,500
I mean...

305
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,166
Wasn't that too harsh?

306
00:27:20,233 --> 00:27:22,266
I'm so sorry.

307
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,233
I apologize.

308
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:01,367
We're old now.

309
00:29:20,433 --> 00:29:21,734
I stayed for seven to ten days.

310
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,200
It's over!

311
00:29:37,934 --> 00:29:39,633
Do you want to have gomtang?

312
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,433
Do you want to have galbijjim?

313
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,300
I'm so sick of it.

314
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,533
I just want Chapagetti.

315
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,934
Me too, Chapagetti.

316
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,834
I'll make Chapagetti with pork.

317
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,233
- That sounds nice.
- Great.

318
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,834
This tastes amazing.

319
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:57,333
That badge was getting on my nerves.

320
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,133
- It's...
- That badge belongs to Yu-mi now.

321
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,300
I thought we're collecting it.
Do we have to pass it?

322
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:07,633
We only have one.

323
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,734
Are they lining up?

324
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,633
They're lining up.

325
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,867
They are?

326
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:21,767
Is this for one portion?

327
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,600
No, for two. Just in case...

328
00:30:23,734 --> 00:30:25,500
- Is this spot okay?
- Yes. Great.

329
00:30:26,633 --> 00:30:29,300
One bibimbap and one spicy beef galbijjim.

330
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,100
I'll start with the first order.

331
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,333
- You're doing great.
- Okay.

332
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,233
I'm at ease.

333
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,867
Yu-mi, you're doing great.

334
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:46,400
She surely is experienced.

335
00:30:50,266 --> 00:30:51,567
All ready for Table Five.

336
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,200
Why rush? This is too fast.

337
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,600
Announce the chef for tomorrow.

338
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,033
Oh, right.

339
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:18,667
It's Seo-jun, of course.

340
00:31:30,367 --> 00:31:31,500
- Seo-jun.
- Yes.

341
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:33,266
- You have to decide...
- What?

342
00:31:33,333 --> 00:31:35,367
Are you making new menus tomorrow?

343
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,100
Dakgalbi is a great menu.

344
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:43,333
Let's put it on the menu.

345
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,667
We need to buy ingredients then.

346
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,734
We can start selling it tomorrow evening.

347
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,700
Let's make it dinner.

348
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:51,100
- That sounds great.
- Okay.

349
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,500
We'll make a new menu tomorrow evening.

350
00:31:53,567 --> 00:31:55,467
- Great.
- Just dakgalbi then?

351
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,066
- I'm bringing gomtang.
- How much?

352
00:32:12,133 --> 00:32:13,867
Just enough for us to eat.

353
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,133
Gosh, let's go.

354
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:19,633
This looks delicious.

355
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,633
Let's get out of here.

356
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,367
Let's go!

357
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,700
Green light!

358
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:37,000
You can go. It's cold.

359
00:32:51,033 --> 00:32:52,400
Hello.

360
00:32:52,467 --> 00:32:53,734
I'm home!

361
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,934
- It's less cold today.
- It's warmer today.

362
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,767
Yesterday was really cold.

363
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,100
Thank you.

364
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,967
Hurry up.

365
00:33:08,567 --> 00:33:09,800
Get inside.

366
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,266
Is that one piece?

367
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:19,467
- Yes.
- One piece?

368
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:20,633
This is one piece.

369
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,800
It's so good.

370
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,033
Let me take a bite.

371
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:23,934
Come on.

372
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,367
- Just one bite.
- Have yours.

373
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:27,700
But that's huge.

374
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,667
Don't eat too much.

375
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,367
You just ate the best part.

376
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,633
You really like kebab, don't you?

377
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:41,567
It's delicious.

378
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,500
Should I boil gomtang?

379
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,700
Yes, let's have it.

380
00:33:48,133 --> 00:33:49,600
Are you okay, Seo-jin?

381
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,734
I've never seen his face so blank before.

382
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:06,300
This is great.

383
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,834
It warms me up.

384
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,834
This is great. We can add more salt.

385
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:14,467
- It's a bit bland.
- Yes, but...

386
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:15,834
I like this blandness.

387
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,934
This is so good.

388
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:22,867
Goodness.

389
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,133
- Good night.
- Good night.

390
00:34:30,166 --> 00:34:32,667
I want to get a massage as soon as I land.

391
00:34:32,934 --> 00:34:34,333
Let's go get a massage.

392
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,400
Yes! I'd love to.

393
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:37,233
Let's look for a massage place.

394
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,667
Honestly, I thought I'd be...

395
00:34:39,734 --> 00:34:43,133
taking a walk in the morning.

396
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:46,066
I thought I'd have time for coffee...

397
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,533
and some apples for breakfast.

398
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,300
My gracious.

399
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,700
I didn't know waking up early
was this hard.

400
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,266
You can go to bed first.

401
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,600
Good night.

402
00:34:58,834 --> 00:35:01,066
You did a very good job today.

403
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:03,667
I'll see you tomorrow.

404
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,333
- Good night.
- Good night.

405
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,967
It's like The Phantom of the Opera.

406
00:35:25,734 --> 00:35:28,300
I was so tired cooking today.

407
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,400
But I'm relieved.

408
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,767
Oh, it's very moisturizing.

409
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,433
This is so refreshing.

410
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,867
My hands got really dry too.

411
00:37:12,834 --> 00:37:14,767
Hello.

412
00:37:14,867 --> 00:37:16,934
- You're glowing.
- You're glowing.

413
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,200
That suits you well.

414
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:19,767
Why is your skin so nice?

415
00:37:20,033 --> 00:37:21,667
Did you have a good night's sleep?

416
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,033
How can I not?

417
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,200
My goodness.

418
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,767
- Hello.
- Hello.

419
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:32,433
- Main chef.
- Main chef.

420
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:37,367
- Seo-jun, it's Saturday.
- It's the weekend.

421
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,233
Let's go!

422
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,467
He's going to rock.

423
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,133
He has been waiting for this.

424
00:37:44,033 --> 00:37:46,166
These guys work really well.

425
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,900
I was really surprised yesterday.

426
00:37:47,967 --> 00:37:48,900
It makes me wonder.

427
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,467
- What?
- How good are they?

428
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:55,300
Watching them work, I can't help but think
"Since when did they work this well?"

429
00:37:55,867 --> 00:37:58,734
I actually think they belong
to the kitchen.

430
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,734
You know?

431
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,633
They're all actors.

432
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,700
They can focus really well.

433
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,467
They're all popular actors and actresses.

434
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:10,533
They're all popular except me.

435
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,700
I can't focus well anymore.

436
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,834
You know?

437
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,367
Let me get dressed.

438
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:24,266
Okay.

439
00:38:27,367 --> 00:38:29,033
- The vlog for today...
- Okay.

440
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,800
You can flip them now.

441
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,367
I got this.

442
00:38:56,467 --> 00:38:57,300
Let's go.

443
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,433
What matters is the turnover.

444
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,133
Let's just make a lot of them.

445
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,300
I'm working at my usual speed.

446
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,433
- He's very fast.
- He is.

447
00:39:36,133 --> 00:39:38,433
What do I do next?

448
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,834
I love it.

449
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:54,967
- Gosh.
- Today is the coldest.

450
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,900
Today...

451
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:11,433
I'm the chef today.

452
00:40:15,967 --> 00:40:17,066
Gosh, it's cold.

453
00:40:18,734 --> 00:40:20,500
- Hello.
- Hello.

454
00:40:20,567 --> 00:40:22,000
It's the coldest today.

455
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,467
The weather is great.

456
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:24,567
Let me hand it to you.

457
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:33,533
Do you have a photo for dakgalbi?

458
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,633
Here.

459
00:40:43,433 --> 00:40:45,000
Goodness, it looks the best.

460
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:46,200
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

461
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:47,133
It's really tasty.

462
00:40:47,467 --> 00:40:49,000
My goodness.

463
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,567
This is my type of dish.

464
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,333
Do we have ginger?

465
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,100
Hey, Yu-mi.

466
00:41:13,533 --> 00:41:15,767
Your cooking was a huge success.

467
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,433
Congratulations.

468
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:20,300
You're not interested?

469
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:23,300
It passes on.

470
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:29,166
Thank you.

471
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:33,433
Congratulations.

472
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,433
I'll support the chef today.

473
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,834
- We should put up your photo.
- Right!

474
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,133
Hang it.

475
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,633
- Do I hang it?
- Yes.

476
00:41:58,734 --> 00:42:00,233
I'm supposed to hang it?

477
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,834
Hang it there.

478
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,600
- I don't know the second verse.
- Me neither.

479
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:26,367
Goodness!

480
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:38,100
Five hygiene rules.

481
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:41,200
So many steps, though.

482
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:42,500
We have a lot to do.

483
00:42:42,834 --> 00:42:44,133
- Min-si.
- Yes.

484
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,166
You can count the numbers for us.

485
00:42:46,467 --> 00:42:48,033
Okay, one!

486
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,767
Keep it hygienic at all times.

487
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:51,967
Keep it hygienic!

488
00:42:52,066 --> 00:42:53,500
- Two.
- Wash hands...

489
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,834
as often as you can.

490
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,800
Wash hands!

491
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:56,734
Wash hands!

492
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,633
Three!

493
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,367
Always wear clean outfits!

494
00:42:59,433 --> 00:43:00,667
Wear clean outfits!

495
00:43:00,734 --> 00:43:03,767
- Four!
- Clean all cooking tools after work.

496
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:04,767
Clean tools!

497
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:05,667
Five!

498
00:43:05,734 --> 00:43:07,633
Always ask when you're lost.

499
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,133
Always ask!

500
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,700
- Yes!
- Yes!

501
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:14,967
One, two, three. Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

502
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:17,967
Jinny's Ttukbaegi!

503
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:20,333
- Yes!
- Let's go!

504
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:23,934
Why is Seo-jin so happy?

505
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:34,300
Mr. Lee has changed a lot this time.

506
00:43:35,433 --> 00:43:36,266
Let's go!

507
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,166
Let's do this.

508
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,300
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

509
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,633
- I'll head off.
- Okay.

510
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,633
Oh, my bag.

511
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,767
It's here.

512
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,633
I'll be crushing this.

513
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,567
Soy sauce.

514
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:21,467
One liter.

515
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:25,533
Brown sugar.

516
00:45:36,367 --> 00:45:38,033
- Do I have to blend it?
- Yes.

517
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:47,166
Oh, what do I do?

518
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,667
I have to spill it for the show.

519
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,433
And...

520
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,734
Do we need peeled potatoes?

521
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,300
Yes, we should peel them.

522
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,200
Goodness.

523
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:42,567
Gosh, he's so fast.

524
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:47,834
What he's doing is hard.

525
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,300
Goodness.

526
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:24,333
I can't believe this.

527
00:47:49,133 --> 00:47:50,734
I'm done frying 40 pieces.

528
00:47:51,066 --> 00:47:52,066
- Really?
- Yes.

529
00:47:52,133 --> 00:47:53,266
It looks nice.

530
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:55,900
The meat is good today.

531
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,567
It's really good.

532
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,600
It will look so nice.

533
00:48:07,567 --> 00:48:09,033
Seo-jun is back already?

534
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:11,600
I'm back.

535
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:31,400
Can we get coffee?

536
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:32,533
Coffee.

537
00:48:32,867 --> 00:48:35,066
- Coffee.
- He's at the back.

538
00:48:35,133 --> 00:48:37,367
- Can we get coffee, Mr. Lee?
- Coffee?

539
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:38,333
- Yes.
- Right.

540
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,033
Mr. Lee, can you buy us some coffee
and bread?

541
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,300
Do they sell bread?

542
00:48:45,367 --> 00:48:47,300
- They're hungry.
- I mean breakfast...

543
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:48,400
We had very little.

544
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,734
Should I go buy them?

545
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:51,500
You should work.

546
00:48:51,567 --> 00:48:52,400
Sure.

547
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,467
Gosh, it's cold!

548
00:48:59,133 --> 00:49:00,767
Do they sell bread there?

549
00:49:58,166 --> 00:49:59,200
What is this?

550
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:00,500
- Woo-shik.
- Yes.

551
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,066
This is what you like.

552
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,567
- This is what you like.
- It looks delicious.

553
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:12,000
- Goodness.
- Let's eat.

554
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:15,567
I knew Woo-shik would like this.

555
00:50:21,533 --> 00:50:22,667
Thank you.

556
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:24,000
Thank you for this.

557
00:50:32,266 --> 00:50:33,567
Wait, let's see.

558
00:50:33,633 --> 00:50:34,867
This is delicious.

559
00:50:35,066 --> 00:50:36,800
- Here.
- Goodness!

560
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:38,934
Here, thank you.

561
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:40,734
Goodness.

562
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,266
Goodness.

563
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:54,867
I almost didn't buy it,
because I knew you'd like it.

564
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,100
Gosh, this is delicious.

565
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,300
This is so good.

566
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,033
The ribs look great today.

567
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:25,367
These ribs look great.

568
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:30,500
Gomtang is getting better each day.

569
00:51:45,633 --> 00:51:46,467
Hey, Seo-jun.

570
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:47,400
- Yes.
- Seo-jun.

571
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,700
Come here.

572
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:13,567
What's with the hat?

573
00:52:13,633 --> 00:52:15,800
- What's with the hat?
- Oh, my.

574
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,567
What's with the hat?

575
00:52:20,066 --> 00:52:21,667
What was that hat just now?

576
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:23,266
What just passed?

577
00:52:23,333 --> 00:52:24,867
When did you prepare this?

578
00:52:25,867 --> 00:52:27,166
Like a captain.

579
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:48,300
The soup is amazing.

580
00:52:59,000 --> 00:52:59,967
Dessert!

581
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,033
My gracious.

582
00:53:31,266 --> 00:53:32,100
Goodness.

583
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:33,000
What's up?

584
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:34,166
The dessert...

585
00:53:34,233 --> 00:53:36,266
Oh, we didn't prepare the dessert.

586
00:53:49,734 --> 00:53:50,633
Yes!

587
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,667
Yes!

588
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,700
- Woo-shik, four people.
- Yes.

589
00:55:10,867 --> 00:55:11,734
- Three?
- Yes.

590
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,500
Take them to a table for four.

591
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:56,834
The room is full too.

592
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,934
Okay.

593
00:55:59,533 --> 00:56:00,934
Min-si, let's do this.

594
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Yes, Seo-jun.

595
00:56:02,066 --> 00:56:02,967
Chef, let's go!

596
00:56:03,033 --> 00:56:04,600
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

597
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,000
Our monthly... I mean,
daily goal is four 4,000,000 won.

598
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:11,166
We should match the speed with bibimbap.

599
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:12,066
Yes.

600
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,667
Okay.

601
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,500
All right, let's do this.

602
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,200
Is that new?

603
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,533
It's done.

604
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,233
- What should I use for potatoes?
- Now, green onions.

605
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:34,133
In the big bowl.

606
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:37,567
This much.

607
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,834
Is there anything else I can do?

608
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,200
- Yes.
- Okay.

609
00:56:47,734 --> 00:56:49,166
I'll get the rice bowls.

610
00:56:49,734 --> 00:56:50,767
Thank you.

611
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,667
Let's just put the rice in the bowls.

612
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:55,500
- Bibimbap?
- Yes.

613
00:56:55,734 --> 00:56:57,633
I feel like people will rush in.

614
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,367
Did you set the side dishes?

615
00:57:02,433 --> 00:57:03,266
Yes, I did.

616
00:57:07,233 --> 00:57:08,934
It's crowded outside.

617
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,133
I'll get the waiting list.

618
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,700
- Waiting list?
- Yes.

619
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:45,834
Yu-mi, we have to serve the food now.

620
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,633
Hold on. I'm working on this.

621
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,166
I'm just making twibap.

622
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,700
Let them do it.

623
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,400
What is it? How do I do it?

624
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,233
Okay, I'll do it.

625
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:15,800
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

626
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,000
- Please key in for Table Two.
- Okay.

627
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:29,700
Let's go! We have our first order.

628
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:30,934
What?

629
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,700
- Bibimbap.
- Hold on. You go?

630
00:59:33,767 --> 00:59:35,700
Hold on. You go!

631
00:59:35,767 --> 00:59:36,767
- You go.
- Hold on.

632
00:59:37,266 --> 00:59:39,233
- I'll go.
- Chef, one bibimbap.

633
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,467
One spicy beef galbijjim.

634
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:42,834
Two beef galbijjim.

635
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:44,433
- One kkori-gomtang.
- Okay.

636
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,934
Two beef galbijjim.

637
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,900
- One kkori-gomtang.
- Yes.

638
00:59:48,834 --> 00:59:51,166
Six pieces of vegetable fritters.

639
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:52,834
One bibimbap only?

640
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,000
We have gomtang?

641
01:00:06,066 --> 01:00:08,533
One, two, three.

642
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,166
Five. One, two...

643
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:12,367
- We have gomtang.
- One, two...

644
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,600
- We have a new order.
- Okay.

645
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:28,900
Chef, one more spicy beef galbijjim.

646
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,100
Yes.

647
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,166
- This is for another table?
- Yes.

648
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,367
- Later...
- Bibimbap for another one.

649
01:00:34,433 --> 01:00:35,734
Okay, later.

650
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,500
- We have more orders.
- Guys.

651
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:39,567
Yes?

652
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,100
- We have more orders.
- Okay.

653
01:00:42,166 --> 01:00:44,200
I should take the order
from the big group.

654
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,066
- You can take your time.
- Okay.

655
01:00:46,166 --> 01:00:48,200
It isn't easy to serve drinks now.

656
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,100
That... Oh, it's done.

657
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:39,934
Should I remove the pot?

658
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,033
- Yes.
- Okay.

659
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,367
Bibimbap is ready.

660
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,300
Should I serve it?

661
01:01:49,367 --> 01:01:50,500
- Yes.
- Okay.

662
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:54,000
You can serve all of them together.

663
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,900
I have to wipe this.

664
01:01:58,633 --> 01:02:00,467
I'll serve them at the same time.

665
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,667
We're done with Table One, yes?

666
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,333
After kkori-gomtang.

667
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,600
- Here you go.
- Be careful.

668
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:06,500
Turn off the heat.

669
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,800
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

670
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,300
- Here...
- Hold on.

671
01:02:12,367 --> 01:02:13,367
Okay.

672
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,600
Okay, I'll just take note.

673
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,367
Okay. By the way...

674
01:02:19,433 --> 01:02:21,934
- Yes.
- All the drinks are backed up.

675
01:02:22,033 --> 01:02:22,867
All right.

676
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:55,867
This is like marmalade jam.

677
01:02:56,233 --> 01:02:57,533
Like orange marmalade.

678
01:02:57,967 --> 01:02:59,100
With honey.

679
01:03:02,533 --> 01:03:04,033
It will taste like honey.

680
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:05,600
And orange.

681
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:07,000
This is yuja.

682
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,734
Yuja is a type of fruit.

683
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:12,166
Oh, so you call this yuja.

684
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:16,967
I see!

685
01:03:17,967 --> 01:03:22,066
It looks like a...

686
01:03:22,133 --> 01:03:23,400
- Lemon?
- Lemon!

687
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:30,467
This is so good.

688
01:03:30,567 --> 01:03:32,800
This is the best tea I've ever had.

689
01:03:33,633 --> 01:03:36,400
We can drink this when we have a cold.

690
01:03:36,934 --> 01:03:39,233
This is perfect for sore throat.

691
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,533
This melts my whole body.

692
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:43,967
I can drink this every single day.

693
01:03:44,033 --> 01:03:45,166
Every day.

694
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:49,667
Two yuja tea.

695
01:04:50,767 --> 01:04:52,233
Omija ade.

696
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,400
For which table?

697
01:04:53,467 --> 01:04:54,900
These are for the group.

698
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,900
- Five?
- Yes.

699
01:05:23,567 --> 01:05:24,900
After kkori-gomtang...

700
01:05:24,967 --> 01:05:26,100
- Here.
- Be careful.

701
01:05:26,166 --> 01:05:27,400
I should turn off the heat.

702
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,300
One bibimbap and one spicy galbijjim.

703
01:05:29,367 --> 01:05:30,333
So four bibimbap.

704
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,700
Let's make four bibimbap now.

705
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:33,700
Okay.

706
01:05:34,734 --> 01:05:35,633
Okay.

707
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:40,033
The galbijjim is served.

708
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:41,266
And those too.

709
01:05:41,367 --> 01:05:42,700
Table Five is done.

710
01:05:42,767 --> 01:05:44,233
Here, kkori-gomtang.

711
01:05:44,867 --> 01:05:45,700
Rice.

712
01:05:51,633 --> 01:05:53,967
- He's fast.
- He surely is.

713
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,533
Min-si, turn on the heat.

714
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,433
- Got it.
- Yes.

715
01:06:13,934 --> 01:06:15,200
I'll quickly wash it.

716
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:39,200
I have no space for this.

717
01:06:46,233 --> 01:06:47,533
Here comes bibimbap.

718
01:06:54,533 --> 01:06:57,066
Bibimbap and spicy galbijjim
for Table One?

719
01:06:57,133 --> 01:06:58,400
- Yes!
- It's ready.

720
01:06:58,467 --> 01:07:00,066
- Yes, spicy.
- Okay.

721
01:07:00,734 --> 01:07:03,700
I'll remove the bill.
Bibimbap and spicy galbijjim.

722
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,800
This is delicious.

723
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,600
- The meat is good.
- Right? It's tasty.

724
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:36,567
It's my first time liking fries.

725
01:07:36,667 --> 01:07:39,567
- It's delicious.
- I like how it's soft.

726
01:07:39,633 --> 01:07:41,867
It's hard to eat when it's too crispy.

727
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:44,834
It's soft and chewy.

728
01:08:00,066 --> 01:08:01,867
Should we ask for more kimchi?

729
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,633
- Can we?
- I don't know.

730
01:08:06,900 --> 01:08:09,800
They give us more side dishes in Korea.

731
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:29,734
He's so nice.

732
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:31,533
Right, he's kind.

733
01:08:33,133 --> 01:08:36,934
I like how they're dressed up
in the same style.

734
01:08:37,033 --> 01:08:38,200
Their outfits.

735
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:40,233
The hair bands too.

736
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,667
- The uniforms? They're cute.
- Right.

737
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,633
One galbijjim for that table, right?

738
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,266
- One galbijjim.
- One, okay.

739
01:09:16,533 --> 01:09:17,667
Fritters.

740
01:09:17,767 --> 01:09:19,133
Fritters are here.

741
01:09:21,834 --> 01:09:22,934
That punk.

742
01:09:25,567 --> 01:09:27,333
Two, three...

743
01:09:27,433 --> 01:09:28,734
I like how you work.

744
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:32,233
Thank you.

745
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,834
I haven't had a talented
intern like this in four years.

746
01:09:47,033 --> 01:09:48,800
- Table Three.
- Okay.

747
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,934
- This is for Table Three.
- Yes.

748
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,066
When it's boiled...

749
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,166
I'll set this up.

750
01:09:57,266 --> 01:09:59,166
- Wait.
- Is it not done?

751
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,000
These two are very fast.

752
01:10:05,533 --> 01:10:06,400
- Min-si.
- Yes.

753
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:08,233
- Give me a heads-up.
- Okay.

754
01:10:12,734 --> 01:10:14,734
- They're both ready.
- Yes, bibimbap is ready.

755
01:10:16,266 --> 01:10:17,867
- For Table Two, right?
- Yes.

756
01:10:17,934 --> 01:10:20,066
- Kkori-gomtang too.
- Yes, it's ready.

757
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,166
Kkori-gomtang for Table Two.

758
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:26,467
Wait. Green onions.

759
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:33,567
I'll remove the bill.

760
01:10:33,633 --> 01:10:34,467
Okay.

761
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,533
I would eat it with a spoon.

762
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:48,567
- This?
- Yes.

763
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,100
- Do I mix it?
- Yes.

764
01:10:57,633 --> 01:10:59,000
It smells good.

765
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:02,400
I'm a bit upset.

766
01:11:02,934 --> 01:11:04,567
They made it so beautiful.

767
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:06,200
- Right.
- I have to mix it.

768
01:11:15,233 --> 01:11:16,367
Nice!

769
01:11:16,433 --> 01:11:17,834
This is so good.

770
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:19,600
This tastes so good.

771
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:26,433
The rice itself is very good.

772
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:28,734
I can see myself making this.

773
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,300
I should make something similar to this.

774
01:11:32,533 --> 01:11:36,867
Try having it with seaweed on top.

775
01:11:38,033 --> 01:11:39,533
It's really good.

776
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,734
Like this?

777
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:44,066
Yes!

778
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:50,066
Nice.

779
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:51,867
It tastes like the ocean.

780
01:11:51,934 --> 01:11:54,700
It tastes like the sea.

781
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:55,967
Like the fish taste.

782
01:11:56,033 --> 01:11:57,000
Right.

783
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:05,500
The soup is amazing.

784
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,266
I guess it was boiled down
for a long time.

785
01:12:09,133 --> 01:12:11,367
It feels like it's good for my throat.

786
01:12:11,934 --> 01:12:13,934
My throat doesn't hurt anymore.

787
01:12:14,233 --> 01:12:16,934
- Really? That's good.
- Yes, it's good.

788
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,667
It's like comfort food.

789
01:12:21,133 --> 01:12:21,967
Right.

790
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:25,266
The rice is stuck on the surface.

791
01:12:25,367 --> 01:12:27,333
Yes, you have to fight with that.

792
01:12:57,033 --> 01:12:57,934
I'm excited!

793
01:12:58,967 --> 01:13:01,533
Do they have a different menu each day?

794
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,400
Should we come every day?

795
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
Tell me if they start selling tteokbokki.

796
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,433
Okay.

797
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:10,333
We can walk past to see
if the menu is different.

798
01:13:16,567 --> 01:13:18,333
It's good.

799
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,867
Goodness, kimchi is really good.

800
01:13:30,500 --> 01:13:32,934
You made kimchi before, right?

801
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,533
I made it a long time ago.

802
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,600
I should make more.

803
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,767
This tastes so much better.

804
01:13:39,767 --> 01:13:42,633
I'm so glad you're here.
You can make me food.

805
01:13:44,834 --> 01:13:46,667
Me? Korean food?

806
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:48,667
You're the cheerleader for this.

807
01:14:00,266 --> 01:14:02,100
Sorry, I've been eating it all.

808
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:03,166
It's okay.

809
01:14:03,867 --> 01:14:05,367
I saw how well you ate.

810
01:14:05,433 --> 01:14:06,867
Here's more.

811
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,066
I've had enough.

812
01:14:08,133 --> 01:14:09,867
I've been only having kimchi.

813
01:14:09,967 --> 01:14:11,500
You're not having that?

814
01:14:11,934 --> 01:14:13,700
- No.
- I'm not having it either.

815
01:14:13,767 --> 01:14:14,600
Are you having it?

816
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,834
I'm glad there's more for me to eat.

817
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,433
I want to try it too.

818
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:29,867
What are you doing?

819
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:31,400
I'm trying to lift this.

820
01:14:31,734 --> 01:14:33,633
- Don't play with food.
- I got it.

821
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,266
This is the best I can do.

822
01:14:35,867 --> 01:14:37,000
Nobody was looking.

823
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:41,233
If I move slowly, this is what you do.

824
01:14:44,133 --> 01:14:46,300
Next, we need to make one gomtang.

825
01:14:46,367 --> 01:14:47,500
One bibimbap.

826
01:14:47,567 --> 01:14:49,400
- Let's make bibimbap now.
- Okay.

827
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:27,200
Two gomtang.
Dolsot-bibimbap, beef galbijjim.

828
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:30,633
Gomtang cooks slow.

829
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:42,233
It's sizzling. You can remove it.

830
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,000
- I'll remove it.
- Okay.

831
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:49,166
- It's done.
- Okay!

832
01:16:02,066 --> 01:16:03,667
Serve them the dishes now.

833
01:16:03,734 --> 01:16:05,166
I don't think I can...

834
01:16:08,066 --> 01:16:09,800
This is for Table Four.

835
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,300
Spicy galbijjim for Table Four.

836
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:13,567
Kkori-gomtang isn't ready?

837
01:16:14,266 --> 01:16:15,266
Well, then...

838
01:16:15,333 --> 01:16:17,467
- I turned it off.
- Help me with this.

839
01:16:17,533 --> 01:16:19,400
Help you with what?

840
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,834
The gomtang topping.

841
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,166
Right! Green onions.

842
01:16:29,200 --> 01:16:30,767
- This will be served first.
- Okay.

843
01:16:30,834 --> 01:16:31,734
Can I take my time?

844
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:33,166
Sure.

845
01:16:33,266 --> 01:16:35,133
We have a full waiting list.

846
01:16:36,233 --> 01:16:37,300
We knew that.

847
01:16:37,967 --> 01:16:39,700
What matters is the turnover.

848
01:16:40,266 --> 01:16:42,133
Gomtang gets boiled slowly.

849
01:17:07,266 --> 01:17:09,133
One bibimbap goes on the stove.

850
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,033
Okay.

851
01:17:10,533 --> 01:17:11,734
You can put it here.

852
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,834
Okay, I'll scoop the rice.

853
01:17:16,934 --> 01:17:18,266
I'm bringing gomtang.

854
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:24,867
Beef galbijjim. Spicy galbijjim.

855
01:17:28,900 --> 01:17:30,166
Chef, I'll remove it.

856
01:17:30,233 --> 01:17:31,066
Okay.

857
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,400
You both are really good at this.

858
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,667
- Two.
- You can open up restaurant.

859
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:46,367
The guy from Galaxy Express 999.
He's good.

860
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,100
- It's ready.
- Okay.

861
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,900
- It's all ready.
- We're done.

862
01:18:05,533 --> 01:18:06,500
Goodness.

863
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:08,934
Let's clean up.

864
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,200
I'll remove the bill.

865
01:18:11,266 --> 01:18:12,233
Let's clean up.

866
01:18:17,934 --> 01:18:19,834
Should we put it in the middle?

867
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:21,633
Can you put it in the middle?

868
01:18:34,367 --> 01:18:36,734
I really want to have this soup.

869
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:44,834
It's much better than the lamb soup
we had yesterday.

870
01:18:47,433 --> 01:18:48,567
My!

871
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:50,300
This soup is good.

872
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,967
Get a lot of the soup.

873
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:54,200
Try this soup.

874
01:18:57,734 --> 01:19:00,567
Is it tasty because it's boiled
for a long time?

875
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:02,700
The food is good here.

876
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,066
Let me get some rice.

877
01:19:05,133 --> 01:19:05,967
Sure.

878
01:19:23,834 --> 01:19:26,433
I'll have one more spoon.
Let's not waste it.

879
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:28,400
This is so good.

880
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:33,233
I'll have the scorched rice.

881
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:36,934
This soup...

882
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,367
You can just drink it.

883
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,166
I'll pour it here.

884
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:46,533
Empty bowl movement.

885
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:49,867
We practice empty bowl movement.

886
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,967
My guide is Icelandic.

887
01:19:58,033 --> 01:20:00,533
It's our last day. We wanted to treat him.

888
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:01,433
Is that so?

889
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:12,400
Yu-mi. Let me know
if you see people coming in.

890
01:20:12,467 --> 01:20:13,300
They're here.

891
01:20:13,367 --> 01:20:14,600
- More people?
- Yes.

892
01:21:15,266 --> 01:21:16,500
- No seat.
- No table for lunch.

893
01:21:16,567 --> 01:21:17,800
It's full for lunch.

894
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:27,133
No table for lunch.

895
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:28,633
- No table?
- No.

896
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:31,934
You can come at six.

897
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:05,100
We should just flip the sign to "Closed."

898
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:25,133
How can they wait? What time is it now?
It's only five.

899
01:22:25,834 --> 01:22:27,133
We'll make two rounds.

900
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,734
Not just two rounds.

901
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:30,266
At least five rounds.

902
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:43,200
You know what's happening there...

903
01:22:43,266 --> 01:22:45,000
They joined the table.

904
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,767
- These?
- Yes, they joined the table.

905
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:51,667
These three tables...

906
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,533
Those three tables are here.

907
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,500
Table Five is almost done.

908
01:23:05,033 --> 01:23:07,166
Is it still far away
to make the next round?

909
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:08,734
We have a lot of beef galbijjim.

910
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:09,667
All right.

911
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:11,633
We have eight portions of gomtang.

912
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,867
Kkori-gomtang is popular today.

913
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:21,567
Omija, yuja tea.

914
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:54,066
- Min-si.
- Yes?

915
01:23:54,133 --> 01:23:56,100
Should we stay for one more week?

916
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:57,500
We'll make so much money.

917
01:23:57,567 --> 01:23:59,200
- Like fifty million won.
- We'll be rich.

918
01:23:59,266 --> 01:24:01,166
It takes only one shot in life.

919
01:24:03,033 --> 01:24:04,500
Gosh, I love it.

920
01:24:19,333 --> 01:24:22,300
It will be a lot of work
if I don't wash them now.

921
01:24:33,767 --> 01:24:36,233
You know what?

922
01:24:36,867 --> 01:24:40,033
Let's give good memories
of Korean food to customers.

923
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:41,567
It's like Michelin...

924
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:43,467
- Michelin...
- Michelin One Star.

925
01:24:43,533 --> 01:24:45,367
It's that recipe.

926
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:48,800
I'd like to thank the chefs who taught us.

927
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:51,467
Thank you.

928
01:24:52,233 --> 01:24:53,467
You seem relaxed.

929
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:00,567
Yu-mi.

930
01:25:00,633 --> 01:25:02,000
We should make dessert.

931
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,834
Four desserts for Table Five.

932
01:25:51,433 --> 01:25:52,333
It's good.

933
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,266
It's not too sweet.

934
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:56,667
I forgot to take photos.

935
01:25:58,433 --> 01:26:00,166
I already finished half.

936
01:26:04,467 --> 01:26:05,500
It's good.

937
01:26:15,367 --> 01:26:16,200
- Yu-mi.
- Yes.

938
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:18,066
- Two more desserts.
- Okay.

939
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,934
Make one more ice cream.

940
01:26:25,100 --> 01:26:26,000
Yu-mi!

941
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,567
Make one ice cream now.

942
01:26:27,633 --> 01:26:28,467
Again?

943
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:31,033
Yu-mi, make it four.

944
01:26:39,667 --> 01:26:40,700
Ice...

945
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:42,934
Why is ice cream so popular?

946
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,800
That's our signature.

947
01:26:56,367 --> 01:26:58,200
Woo-shik, let's clean this up.

948
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:00,934
I'll clean up Table Five.

949
01:27:11,533 --> 01:27:12,633
Guys, sorry.

950
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:35,433
Are these done?

951
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,000
Yes, these are all washed.

952
01:27:48,667 --> 01:27:50,667
We can put them in the dishwasher.

953
01:27:50,734 --> 01:27:51,867
It doesn't work well.

954
01:27:51,967 --> 01:27:55,633
The burned rice doesn't get washed
in the dishwasher.

955
01:27:55,700 --> 01:27:57,200
I'm almost done.

956
01:28:06,433 --> 01:28:07,400
It's done.

957
01:29:11,333 --> 01:29:13,133
Are we all Taiwanese?

958
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,633
- Are we?
- Are you two Taiwanese?

959
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:18,266
- Yes.
- Really?

960
01:29:19,066 --> 01:29:21,133
Are you two from Taiwan?

961
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:22,400
I'm from Taiwan.

962
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:23,600
She's from England.

963
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:25,867
We're from England too.

964
01:29:25,934 --> 01:29:26,934
I live in London.

965
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,266
We live in Liverpool.

966
01:29:29,934 --> 01:29:31,467
How long are you here for?

967
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:32,734
- Six days.
- Six days.

968
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:33,767
Like us!

969
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:51,633
We're staying until the 28th.
How about you?

970
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,667
We are flying back tomorrow.

971
01:29:56,467 --> 01:29:57,834
Did you just arrive?

972
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,266
- It's our second day.
- It's our last day.

973
01:30:00,333 --> 01:30:01,700
How was it for you two?

974
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:04,333
Why?

975
01:30:04,433 --> 01:30:05,800
It was okay.

976
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:08,100
We just faced a storm, heavy rain,

977
01:30:08,166 --> 01:30:10,233
all sorts of weather
and the scorching sun.

978
01:30:10,333 --> 01:30:11,166
At first...

979
01:30:11,233 --> 01:30:12,667
Strong wind, heavy snow.

980
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,266
It's quite windy here.

981
01:30:15,333 --> 01:30:16,300
Was there heavy snow?

982
01:30:16,367 --> 01:30:17,633
There was heavy snow.

983
01:30:19,100 --> 01:30:20,533
What are we going to do?

984
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:23,367
It will all be fine.

985
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:25,467
We got rid of all the bad weather.

986
01:30:25,533 --> 01:30:26,367
Right.

987
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:28,533
The next few days here...

988
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,100
The weather will be nice.

989
01:30:30,333 --> 01:30:32,000
The wind is too strong here.

990
01:30:32,066 --> 01:30:33,333
When it's very windy,

991
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:34,600
it's a bit scary.

992
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:38,533
The rental car agency told us
to be careful of the wind.

993
01:30:38,633 --> 01:30:40,166
When it's really windy,

994
01:30:40,233 --> 01:30:42,967
you should grab the car handles
and not let go of them.

995
01:30:43,033 --> 01:30:44,166
Otherwise,

996
01:30:44,266 --> 01:30:46,100
the wind might break the doors.

997
01:30:46,467 --> 01:30:48,834
That's the most common thing in Iceland.

998
01:30:49,367 --> 01:30:50,867
Have you two seen the aurora?

999
01:30:50,934 --> 01:30:52,000
No.

1000
01:30:52,100 --> 01:30:53,934
It's because the weather's bad.

1001
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,834
Right.

1002
01:30:54,934 --> 01:30:57,667
l looked it up
and there will be a strong one on Sunday.

1003
01:30:57,734 --> 01:30:59,667
I'll send you photos if we get to see it.

1004
01:30:59,734 --> 01:31:00,767
Great.

1005
01:31:00,867 --> 01:31:02,567
- Tell people you saw it.
- I'll buy...

1006
01:31:02,633 --> 01:31:04,133
- the postcards later.
- Postcards.

1007
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:07,033
I'll pick the one with the aurora.

1008
01:31:09,433 --> 01:31:11,200
We saw everything but aurora.

1009
01:31:11,266 --> 01:31:12,800
It might be there tonight.

1010
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,133
Maybe we can see.

1011
01:31:14,633 --> 01:31:16,500
You will. Say that you can.

1012
01:31:16,600 --> 01:31:17,734
Yes, I can.

1013
01:31:17,834 --> 01:31:19,133
Yes, you can.

1014
01:31:19,233 --> 01:31:21,133
I'll burn all the postcards.

1015
01:31:58,700 --> 01:32:00,367
What's this? Table Two?

1016
01:32:00,433 --> 01:32:01,467
Are these served?

1017
01:32:01,533 --> 01:32:02,433
What? No.

1018
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,433
- Not yet. We should do it.
- I'm on it.

1019
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:06,100
How come they're eating already?

1020
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,266
What? I told him, it's Table Three.

1021
01:32:15,567 --> 01:32:17,233
What are they having?

1022
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,367
Whose dish is it?

1023
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:19,834
What on earth happened?

1024
01:32:26,533 --> 01:32:28,033
- Wait a second.
- Yes?

1025
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:29,600
We need to sort this out.

1026
01:32:29,667 --> 01:32:30,633
What's up?

1027
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:40,867
Table Two is eating already.

1028
01:32:40,934 --> 01:32:42,066
- Table Two?
- What?

1029
01:32:42,567 --> 01:32:43,934
- They're eating?
- What?

1030
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,734
We haven't made anything yet.

1031
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:48,000
Did Table Two get Table Five's food?

1032
01:32:48,333 --> 01:32:50,367
I said the food is for Table Three.

1033
01:32:50,433 --> 01:32:51,266
Table Three...

1034
01:32:59,266 --> 01:33:00,533
This is all twisted.

1035
01:33:04,467 --> 01:33:05,767
What really happened?

1036
01:33:05,867 --> 01:33:08,033
We served original galbijjim
instead of spicy.

1037
01:33:08,100 --> 01:33:09,667
So it was wrongly served.

1038
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,633
Who served it wrong? Woo-shik?

1039
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:14,333
I did, but it won't work.

1040
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:16,033
I don't know.

1041
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:18,133
So what were served to Table Two?

1042
01:33:18,734 --> 01:33:20,467
Check it again with Woo-shik.

1043
01:33:23,266 --> 01:33:24,800
- It's for Two.
- They're eating.

1044
01:33:24,867 --> 01:33:25,700
Eating what?

1045
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:27,600
- Min-si.
- Yes.

1046
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:29,200
- Let's go!
- We can do this.

1047
01:33:29,266 --> 01:33:31,300
- As if today is the last day.
- Yes!

1048
01:33:37,533 --> 01:33:38,934
I'll make dakgalbi.

1049
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:46,934
It looks delicious.

1050
01:33:50,266 --> 01:33:51,667
They said dakgalbi is delicious.

1051
01:33:54,066 --> 01:33:55,166
Don't you have

1052
01:33:55,233 --> 01:33:57,500
Best Restaurant Business Award on tvN?

1053
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:02,300
Three dakgalbi.

1054
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,867
Dakgalbi is so popular.

1055
01:34:03,967 --> 01:34:06,867
Gosh, there are so many people.

1056
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:16,633
Has there been any aurora
since we got here?

1057
01:34:18,367 --> 01:34:20,300
It's hard to spot the aurora.

1058
01:34:22,700 --> 01:34:24,033
My gosh!

1059
01:34:27,967 --> 01:34:29,000
We got to see it.

1060
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:30,667
Seo-jin, you can't see it?

1061
01:34:31,367 --> 01:34:32,567
Seo-jin can't see it.

1062
01:34:38,967 --> 01:34:40,700
It must be a good sign.

1063
01:34:42,166 --> 01:34:43,767
You see that horse figure?

1064
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:45,767
- That...
- The horse figure?

1065
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:47,233
Let's put that at the front.

1066
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:48,133
Why?

1067
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,633
It brings good luck.

1068
01:34:50,734 --> 01:34:52,500
Should we switch it then?

1069
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:54,233
We shouldn't put it here.

1070
01:34:54,567 --> 01:34:56,033
- Like this?
- By the door.

1071
01:34:57,133 --> 01:34:58,834
- Like this?
- No, by the door.

1072
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,066
This is the door.

1073
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:01,667
Put it here.

1074
01:35:01,734 --> 01:35:02,633
Like this?

1075
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,066
Right next to the wall.

1076
01:35:04,133 --> 01:35:06,033
- Like this?
- Yes.

1077
01:35:06,100 --> 01:35:07,533
Yes, leave it like that.

1078
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:09,734
I have one at my door back home too.

1079
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:10,633
I see.

1080
01:35:10,767 --> 01:35:12,667
I was born in the Year of the Horse.

1081
01:35:12,767 --> 01:35:14,000
- You were?
- Woo-shik.

1082
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:15,967
- I'll stand there.
- Yes, stand there.

1083
01:35:16,533 --> 01:35:17,967
- Like this.
- Your bottom,

1084
01:35:18,033 --> 01:35:19,533
put it towards the door.

1085
01:35:20,967 --> 01:35:22,900
Then take the customers in.

1086
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,100
Mommy

1087
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:28,333
My bottom is cold
