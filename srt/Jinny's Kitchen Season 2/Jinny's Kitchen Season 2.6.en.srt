00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,266
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,934
Seo-jin, there's a whole queue
around the building.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
We knew this was coming.

4
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,166
- Take your time.
- Okay.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
I have to admit the dakgalbi is amazing.

6
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:44,066
I'll take my time
since it's the first dakgalbi.

7
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,533
We can keep cooking after making dakgalbi.

8
00:00:54,734 --> 00:00:56,633
- Can you do galbijjim?
- Sure.

9
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,533
You're making bibimbap?

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,467
Yes, I'm putting it on the stove.

11
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:11,600
We can serve three gomtang together.
We served one earlier.

12
00:01:11,667 --> 00:01:12,800
- Great.
- Okay.

13
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:15,567
Haven't had a talented
intern like this in four years.

14
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,433
- He's very fast.
- He is.

15
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,467
- Table Three.
- Table Three.

16
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:21,433
For Table Two.

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,066
Removing the bill for Table One.

18
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,133
You both are really good at this.

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,066
You can open up a restaurant.

20
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,266
It's amazing.

21
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,000
Incredible.

22
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:41,800
Goodness.

23
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,100
I finally feel like I'm in Iceland.

24
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,967
I thought I wasn't going to see it
this time.

25
00:01:53,433 --> 00:01:57,033
You did a great job today too

26
00:01:58,133 --> 00:01:59,633
It's a full moon!

27
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,900
Wait, a full moon...

28
00:02:00,967 --> 00:02:03,333
- of the first lunar month?
- I don't know.

29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,700
It's just a full moon.

30
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:11,300
Since it isn't so windy tonight,

31
00:02:11,934 --> 00:02:13,266
it's not that cold.

32
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Look for the aurora.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,800
Gosh, today is...

34
00:02:25,767 --> 00:02:27,800
finally over.

35
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,033
- Thank you for the food.
- Enjoy your meal.

36
00:02:36,066 --> 00:02:37,734
What's this? Is this for me?

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,834
- Yes.
- Thank you.

38
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,967
This is so good.

39
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,967
I realized it again today.
I couldn't have done it without Min-si.

40
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,900
Now I'm curious.
You've worked with all three chefs.

41
00:03:02,467 --> 00:03:05,166
What are they like? Are they different?

42
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:06,900
- We have different styles.
- Right.

43
00:03:06,967 --> 00:03:08,233
- Really?
- Yes.

44
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,300
I just feel like I should leave.

45
00:03:23,533 --> 00:03:25,433
- For me...
- Why can't you say it?

46
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,266
They are all very different.

47
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,300
First...

48
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,834
He makes it very fun and bright.

49
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,066
He did everything at speed
on the first day.

50
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,533
- She says you're bright.
- Yes, Mr. Choi.

51
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:47,400
It was hectic but bright.

52
00:03:47,467 --> 00:03:49,367
- And he was funny.
- He was funny.

53
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:52,367
He made me laugh the most.

54
00:03:58,667 --> 00:04:00,767
As for Ms. Yu-mi...

55
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:04,100
She does everything perfectly.
It's all well-organized.

56
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,900
It makes it easy for me.
I feel very reassured.

57
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:08,867
- I'm very impatient.
- You are?

58
00:04:08,934 --> 00:04:13,200
But when I was with Chef Yu-mi,
I felt very reassured and comfortable.

59
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:17,300
So it was all very calm.
Although the kitchen was busy...

60
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,033
We were really busy...

61
00:04:19,533 --> 00:04:23,033
But I didn't feel like we were rushing.

62
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:29,200
- Funny how the chefs all left.
- Right.

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,734
Are you washing dishes now?

64
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,934
What about Seo-jun?

65
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,934
Now, it's Seo-jun's turn.

66
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:43,734
I found Chef Park scary.

67
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,900
- It's because...
- Yes?

68
00:04:44,967 --> 00:04:46,266
- I knew it.
- He was scary.

69
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:48,834
- He was rather...
- Is it because he's good?

70
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,734
Yes, he has his own system.

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,066
- With the dakgalbi...
- Making me look bad.

72
00:04:56,567 --> 00:04:58,967
- Be honest.
- For the dakgalbi...

73
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:01,867
I can't go near it.

74
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:04,834
- I asked him so many questions.
- I see.

75
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
But he helped me a lot.

76
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:10,266
He helped me set up the bowls.
He washed the dishes too.

77
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,500
Dishes too?

78
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,233
It felt like he had a 360-degree vision.

79
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:18,133
Does he know when you aren't focusing?

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,533
Yes. When I'm about to do something else,
he asks me, "Could you do this?"

81
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,967
But the tasks that
are too burdensome for me...

82
00:05:26,033 --> 00:05:27,433
He takes care of them.

83
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,734
If they tell you to join them...

84
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,567
- Yes?
- Who would you work with?

85
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:37,133
What kind of restaurant is it? Is it...

86
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,266
- A Korean restaurant?
- Yes. With the same menu.

87
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:45,066
- So...
- Moneywise,

88
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,800
I think I'll earn the most
with Chef Seo-jun.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,300
But if I want a stable environment,

90
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:54,266
Chef Yu-mi.

91
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,834
Are you dumping Woo-shik?

92
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,133
- Mr. Choi?
- Yes.

93
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,500
He and I can work together

94
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:04,300
- as assistants.
- You and he are the same level?

95
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:19,800
You do it one more time.

96
00:06:19,867 --> 00:06:21,300
You do it one more time.

97
00:06:21,367 --> 00:06:23,300
You have two dishes to cook.

98
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:25,600
Are we adding sundubu to the menu?

99
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,200
What's in a sundubu?

100
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,867
A lot of ingredients.

101
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,367
It's really good.

102
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:31,734
It tastes really good.

103
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,100
Wow, this is insane.

104
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,400
This place is...

105
00:07:18,934 --> 00:07:19,934
My goodness!

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,433
It's amazing.

107
00:07:23,633 --> 00:07:25,333
It's so beautiful.

108
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,000
Please, Jinny's Ttukbaegi...

109
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:31,033
Please let it be a success.

110
00:07:31,133 --> 00:07:32,834
Dear snowy mountains...

111
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,800
Dear all gods in the snowy mountains,

112
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,800
Jinny's Kitchen Season 2...

113
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,300
Please let it be a success.

114
00:07:46,834 --> 00:07:48,367
I should have a snack.

115
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,166
It's so refreshing.

116
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,533
I'll have another one later.

117
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,033
- It's so nice without the wind.
- Right. It's so nice.

118
00:08:10,066 --> 00:08:12,400
The view sure is amazing.

119
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,200
- Wow.
- It's unbelievable.

120
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,967
In the center of the city...

121
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,233
We need to get five uniforms.

122
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,867
I think we need to get a thin one.

123
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,500
What about this?

124
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,400
It looks comfortable.

125
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,100
What about this one?

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,266
How about this one?

127
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,400
Isn't this nice?

128
00:08:40,467 --> 00:08:41,633
I like this one.

129
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:43,367
What?

130
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,500
I like that one.

131
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:07,633
It finally feels like a restaurant.

132
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,567
- What is this?
- Team uniforms.

133
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:14,567
- What?
- You got them?

134
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes.

135
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,100
Thank you.

136
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:21,133
- The other outfits looked all too hot.
- Woo-shik, yours is a medium.

137
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,567
That's Min-si's.

138
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:24,967
Thank you so much.

139
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,033
It fits, right?

140
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,233
Woo-shik fits in a medium.

141
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,133
This size is perfect.

142
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,667
- An XS is your size, right?
- Yes, it fits.

143
00:09:36,734 --> 00:09:38,467
Then Yu-mi fits in an XS too.

144
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:40,166
It fits me perfectly too.

145
00:09:40,233 --> 00:09:41,200
Okay.

146
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:43,700
They only had one size each.

147
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,200
Let's go!

148
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,433
Min-si, did you sleep well?

149
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,834
Yes. I slept right away,
but I'm sleepy now. What about you?

150
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,767
I guess everyone's like that.

151
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,500
The weather is amazing.

152
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,133
It's very sunny.

153
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,667
We have to buy...

154
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,300
spinach, shiitake, zucchini,
carrot, onion, cabbage,

155
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,667
chicken, pork, beef, and sundubu.

156
00:10:16,734 --> 00:10:18,533
Sounds like a Lotteria commercial.

157
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,467
With onions

158
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Gosh, they have these ready-made ones.

159
00:10:26,633 --> 00:10:28,233
That's amazing.

160
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,166
They have the ones that are already cut.

161
00:10:31,533 --> 00:10:33,400
Clams.

162
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:36,033
- Shrimp.
- Shrimp.

163
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:37,934
This is huge.

164
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,467
- Should we get this?
- Yes. Nice.

165
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:40,667
- This isn't bad.
- Right.

166
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,700
Let's get three of these.

167
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,934
- That's it. Let's go.
- Let's go.

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,400
Sundubu.

169
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:49,467
How do I open this?

170
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:54,600
Enoki mushroom.

171
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:58,567
Here's the minced one.

172
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,834
I think we're all set.

173
00:11:08,066 --> 00:11:09,433
What about our lunch?

174
00:11:09,834 --> 00:11:12,033
Seo-jin is making us kimchi-jjigae.

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,166
A man who looks good in jeans

176
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,233
What are you making?

177
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,133
Kimchi-jjigae with Ms. Jung.

178
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,133
- Really?
- Yes.

179
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,300
I'm bad at making kimchi-jjigae.

180
00:11:25,367 --> 00:11:27,000
- Is this all you need?
- Even you...

181
00:11:27,066 --> 00:11:28,934
- can make it tasty.
- Really?

182
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:42,567
It's packed individually.

183
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,667
This one single tablet

184
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,533
makes the soup delicious?

185
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,066
Wow, this is like magic.

186
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:05,600
- They are here.
- They're here.

187
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:07,700
We are back!

188
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:12,900
Let's eat first.

189
00:12:17,734 --> 00:12:18,767
It's delicious.

190
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:36,433
It's delicious.

191
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,300
I didn't use this.

192
00:12:51,433 --> 00:12:52,767
What's your blood type?

193
00:12:52,834 --> 00:12:53,800
- Type AB.
- What?

194
00:12:53,867 --> 00:12:57,100
You can't share the food with me.
We can't!

195
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:59,033
- Why not?
- We can't share food.

196
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
Why?

197
00:13:00,667 --> 00:13:01,633
Why can't we?

198
00:13:01,734 --> 00:13:02,934
- Don't you know the story?
- No.

199
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,266
In elementary school,

200
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,400
when we shared food,
you'd ask, "What's your blood type?"

201
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,767
Type AB.

202
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,800
- I'm Type AB too.
- You are?

203
00:13:12,867 --> 00:13:13,967
Tae-hyung, too.

204
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,433
- He's Type AB too.
- A lot of us are Type AB.

205
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,767
It's not very common.

206
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:18,934
Yu-mi!

207
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,700
- Yes!
- What's your blood type?

208
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,767
I'm Type B.

209
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,633
I knew it!

210
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,734
What?

211
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,467
People hate it when you say, "I knew it,"
after asking their blood type.

212
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:31,633
What's your blood type?

213
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,934
- Type A.
- You are Type A?

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,133
Type A!

215
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
I knew it.

216
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:15,934
Mr. Park.

217
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,300
- Yes?
- The stove.

218
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,166
Enjoy your meal.

219
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,834
You...

220
00:14:32,867 --> 00:14:34,900
I'll get ready for sundubu-jjigae.

221
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,734
Let's go!

222
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:40,600
The seasoning...

223
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:43,233
I have to trim this.

224
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,367
Zucchini, onions...

225
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,900
I'm almost a machine.

226
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,500
And then...

227
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,533
Let's chop it.

228
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,734
Yes.

229
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,367
It's so easy like this.

230
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,233
I can't help but smile.

231
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:22,266
Why did I even chop onions?

232
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,867
Salt...

233
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:02,900
Did I bring it? It's very hectic.

234
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:04,367
- Here's the salt.
- Okay.

235
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:06,367
- Here's the salt.
- Okay.

236
00:17:07,533 --> 00:17:09,433
That was very close to my eyes.

237
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,834
It's almost dry now.

238
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,166
It looks nice, right?

239
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,867
What do we do after this?

240
00:17:31,934 --> 00:17:33,367
- After this...
- Yes.

241
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,800
Nothing much, I think.

242
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:36,934
Okay.

243
00:18:04,767 --> 00:18:06,700
Gosh, I have more to chop.

244
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,600
It's a heart.

245
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:52,867
I want to know the amount.

246
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,300
Just one spoon.

247
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,200
Okay, I can cook now.

248
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,567
Oh, gosh.

249
00:19:23,934 --> 00:19:25,033
It's pretty.

250
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,967
- You are pretty.
- It's pretty.

251
00:19:44,867 --> 00:19:46,367
This should be done.

252
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,066
Gosh.

253
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,433
Seo-jin, do you want to try it?

254
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,400
- Oh, nice.
- It looks good, right?

255
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,233
Yes. It's not too spicy?

256
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,600
It smells really good.

257
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,567
It's amazing.

258
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:11,600
Too good?

259
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,700
With the seafood, it sure is...

260
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,467
- It's refreshing?
- Yes.

261
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,600
Gosh, it's good.

262
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,166
- Is it good?
- It's very good.

263
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,667
- Okay.
- This tastes so good.

264
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,767
- You need to chop sweet potatoes?
- Yes.

265
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:56,834
But those are for the dakgalbi.

266
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,900
We're not julienning them.

267
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,433
And I'll boil these.

268
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,700
Yes, just for a bit.

269
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,900
I think this is enough.

270
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:16,400
- Yes.
- Right?

271
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:21,033
Sweet potatoes take too long to be cooked,
so I'll boil them beforehand.

272
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,333
It gets tenderized when soaked in milk.

273
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,734
This is so good. Who wants sweet potatoes?

274
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:41,967
Me.

275
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:45,266
It's hot.

276
00:21:45,333 --> 00:21:46,700
It's hot!

277
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:49,834
Did she burn her mouth?

278
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:50,967
But...

279
00:21:51,834 --> 00:21:53,133
she's very strong.

280
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:25,100
Once I put these here, it's done!

281
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,233
The kitchen is much cleaner now.

282
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,400
Great.

283
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:33,033
Slicing is done.

284
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,700
I have to stir-fry now.

285
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,834
Bibimbap prep is done.

286
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,133
Done!

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,033
- Good job.
- Yes, it's done.

288
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,900
By the way, Mr. Lee got us uniforms,

289
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:19,467
cooked for us,

290
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,967
and is washing dishes for us.

291
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:32,734
It's hot.

292
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,734
Gosh, it's hot.

293
00:24:04,166 --> 00:24:05,000
It's hot!

294
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:17,300
Should I set the tables?

295
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,834
- Yes, go ahead.
- Okay.

296
00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:29,567
- Min-si, shall we start setting?
- Yes.

297
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:34,934
I'll bring the table.

298
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,934
- Let's go!
- Let's go.

299
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,934
Let's go.

300
00:24:55,266 --> 00:24:56,333
- Woo-shik!
- Yes.

301
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,600
Help me with this.

302
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:02,533
No.

303
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,734
I'll just do it.

304
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:08,100
Gosh.

305
00:25:14,934 --> 00:25:16,133
Watch out.

306
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,133
I just have to get these out.

307
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,300
The waiting...

308
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:29,667
Seo-jun.

309
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,133
So he's been boiling gomtang here.

310
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:55,633
So from here...

311
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:03,433
Onions, carrots,

312
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:06,533
spinach, carrots, zucchini.

313
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,967
Then the mushroom in the middle.

314
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:10,934
And then wipe.

315
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
We open in 20 minutes.

316
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
- It's unbelievable.
- Really?

317
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:17,300
The queue's already so long.

318
00:27:20,467 --> 00:27:22,300
This is no joke.

319
00:27:24,533 --> 00:27:25,867
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

320
00:27:27,133 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm thinking about
getting customers in, every ten minutes.

321
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:35,100
So we take orders every ten minutes?

322
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:38,233
So, we get a table at 6:00 p.m.

323
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,433
We take the order.
After ten minutes, we take the next table.

324
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,000
- Why do we do that?
- What?

325
00:27:44,066 --> 00:27:46,133
- Why?
- Because if we take orders at once,

326
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,700
the kitchen gets hectic.

327
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:53,333
Three dakgalbi.

328
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,633
Dakgalbi is so popular.

329
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,166
Table One.

330
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,500
They ordered so much.

331
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,500
This is crazy. It's too much.

332
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,967
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

333
00:28:04,033 --> 00:28:05,200
Please key in this order.

334
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,700
Hold on. Let me do this first.

335
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:09,934
Hold on.

336
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,433
- We need noodles.
- Right.

337
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,400
- Yes.
- Hold on.

338
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,467
We don't have a moment to ourselves.

339
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,300
How are we going to make another round?

340
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:32,934
We worked so hard.

341
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,133
How can we keep up with it?

342
00:28:39,834 --> 00:28:42,000
Let's get the customers in,
every ten minutes.

343
00:28:42,066 --> 00:28:44,066
If we make a round like that,

344
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,433
the next customers...

345
00:28:46,467 --> 00:28:48,433
The table for 6:00 p.m.

346
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,266
can be used at 7:30.

347
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:54,166
Then at 7:40, 7:50, 8:00, and 8:10.

348
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,500
- We're done?
- Yes.

349
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,667
Table Three, four people.

350
00:29:41,734 --> 00:29:43,467
Table Four, one out.

351
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,934
You ready?

352
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,767
- What?
- Are you ready?

353
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:01,900
Yes.

354
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,133
Goodness.

355
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,033
So many people are lining up.

356
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:09,467
Go, Woo-shik.

357
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:11,300
Go, Woo-shik.

358
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:12,200
Am I in?

359
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,266
One, two, three.

360
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,900
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

361
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,333
- "One, two, three"?
- I mean, say it.

362
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,200
Let's go, Jinny's Kitchen!

363
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,967
Let's go, Jinny's Kitchen!

364
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,433
Let's go!

365
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,700
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

366
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,133
We boiled the sweet potatoes, right?

367
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:37,300
Onions...

368
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,667
Oh, no green onions.

369
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,166
- Min-si, look...
- Yes.

370
00:30:45,233 --> 00:30:47,133
- Can you chop these...
- We have them.

371
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,033
We do?

372
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:49,533
Like this?

373
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,700
- Yes.
- Not this?

374
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
- Can you chop these?
- The white part?

375
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:54,400
The white part, right?

376
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,333
Chive!

377
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:00,667
Seo-jun!

378
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,633
- Yes?
- Can the customers come in?

379
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:04,133
I'll let them in.

380
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,066
- Yes.
- Okay.

381
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:06,000
Okay.

382
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,834
Gosh, I still have things to do.

383
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,100
Can you take a look? In this size?
Like this?

384
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,300
- Like this.
- Okay.

385
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:37,934
What do you want?

386
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
There are so many.

387
00:31:53,767 --> 00:31:57,734
Spicy soup with sundubu,
one of Korea's popular dishes.

388
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,734
Aren't we having soju?

389
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,200
The glass is so cute.

390
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:14,266
Yes, it's cool.

391
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,867
One omija, one yuja.

392
00:33:15,934 --> 00:33:17,133
Two green plum ades.

393
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,734
Do I have to mix it?

394
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,633
Oh, this is fun!

395
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:40,166
The color is so pretty,
I don't want to mix it.

396
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,467
It's delicious and sweet.

397
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:47,500
This reminds me of gin and tonic.

398
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,867
Do you want to try it?

399
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,567
My drink is so good.

400
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,934
Mine is very nice too.

401
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,800
I didn't think it'd still be so hectic.

402
00:34:02,367 --> 00:34:03,367
My goodness.

403
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:18,000
Do we need more than this?

404
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,867
No, it's good.

405
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:24,066
- Here's the order.
- Okay.

406
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:27,633
Two bibimbaps and one dakgalbi.

407
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,033
- One sundubu.
- One sundubu.

408
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,367
- That's it.
- Okay.

409
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,800
Probably two bibimbaps and one dakgalbi.

410
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,734
Okay.

411
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
One sundubu too.

412
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:04,500
Okay.

413
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
Okay!

414
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,300
This much of cooking oil.

415
00:35:24,734 --> 00:35:26,567
Where did Woo-shik put the chicken?

416
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,800
- Where's the chicken?
- Let me get it.

417
00:35:31,133 --> 00:35:32,000
Okay, thank you.

418
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:18,800
- Here's the order bill.
- Okay.

419
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:23,834
Where are the clams?

420
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:03,166
Putting one bibimbap on the stove.

421
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,000
I'm done with two bowls.

422
00:38:16,033 --> 00:38:17,233
- Two?
- Yes.

423
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,533
Should I stir it?

424
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,667
Okay, great.

425
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:31,367
You can serve the bibimbap
when it's ready.

426
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,500
Okay. I'll turn on the heat.

427
00:38:39,133 --> 00:38:40,934
Just one dakgalbi, right, Woo-shik?

428
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,266
- Yes.
- Okay, just one.

429
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:45,100
- The second order will come soon.
- Okay.

430
00:38:45,166 --> 00:38:46,200
- Woo-shik!
- Yes?

431
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,900
Where are you, Woo-shik?

432
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,567
- Yes?
- Where is it?

433
00:38:50,633 --> 00:38:52,834
- Where is what?
- The list!

434
00:39:22,166 --> 00:39:24,300
- Yes, bibimbap is coming too.
- Okay.

435
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,600
Scoop out rice for the sundubu.

436
00:39:34,667 --> 00:39:36,300
Yes, it's done.

437
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,400
Woo-shik, you can take the sundubu.

438
00:40:00,367 --> 00:40:01,500
It's hot.

439
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,133
It looks delicious.

440
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:05,900
It looks amazing.

441
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:31,767
It's still boiling.

442
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:33,834
We should take pictures.

443
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,867
- It's still boiling.
- Look.

444
00:40:37,433 --> 00:40:39,867
It's not boiling, it's the sizzle.

445
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,066
- Shall we toast?
- Shall we toast with the soju glasses?

446
00:40:47,433 --> 00:40:49,333
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

447
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:51,133
Aren't you toasting with us?

448
00:40:51,633 --> 00:40:54,433
- Aren't you toasting with us?
- Excuse me. Hello?

449
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,200
It tastes nice.

450
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,800
- It's good.
- Not at all.

451
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,900
Is it too strong?

452
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,834
- It's good.
- It's very good.

453
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,633
Is it bad?

454
00:41:13,834 --> 00:41:15,300
Can we start eating now?

455
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:16,734
You can eat it.

456
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,967
This is good.

457
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,000
- Nice!
- It's really good.

458
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:00,467
It's very good.

459
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,433
I think we need one more bowl.

460
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,333
Is this how you do it?

461
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,667
It's very good.

462
00:42:22,734 --> 00:42:24,233
It's unbelievably good.

463
00:42:34,433 --> 00:42:36,967
You were the first one to try it.
How is it?

464
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:03,333
It's really hot.
But then, it was boiling when served.

465
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:05,133
Better than being cold.

466
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:07,166
You're right.

467
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:10,934
It's really good.

468
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:16,333
It's a wonderful birthday.

469
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,133
- Although it's a bit cold...
- It's new and fun.

470
00:43:22,667 --> 00:43:25,033
- We won't get drunk with this.
- We won't.

471
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:27,500
People drink it when they eat in Korea.

472
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,667
This system gives us more time.

473
00:44:02,734 --> 00:44:03,567
Right?

474
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,600
- We have a new order.
- Okay.

475
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:11,166
One bibimbap and two dakgalbi.

476
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,867
One kkori-gomtang as well.

477
00:44:13,934 --> 00:44:14,767
Okay.

478
00:44:14,867 --> 00:44:16,600
Two dakgalbi.

479
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,100
Dakgalbi...

480
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,367
That's one, two, three, four, five.

481
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:34,000
Six.

482
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,900
Isn't it smooth like this?

483
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,467
- It's very smooth.
- Right.

484
00:45:40,166 --> 00:45:42,367
- Let's lower the heat.
- Okay.

485
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:44,400
- Lower the heat.
- Keep the lid on.

486
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,266
- Okay.
- Goodness.

487
00:45:46,333 --> 00:45:50,500
Min-si, you get to learn new techniques.

488
00:45:50,567 --> 00:45:51,667
Of course.

489
00:45:51,734 --> 00:45:53,367
You can be a chef too.

490
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:57,100
Put it here when you lower the heat.

491
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,500
- Okay.
- Yes.

492
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,700
- Yes.
- Okay.

493
00:46:02,533 --> 00:46:03,533
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

494
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,900
- Shall we get the next customers?
- Sure.

495
00:46:24,567 --> 00:46:26,400
They have soup.

496
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,433
Having a warm soup is nice.

497
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,467
Yuja tea?

498
00:47:00,233 --> 00:47:01,400
Yuja ade.

499
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:02,667
Boil some water.

500
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,600
I boiled it earlier.

501
00:47:04,667 --> 00:47:06,266
- What?
- I boiled it earlier.

502
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,600
Should I serve it first?

503
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,900
This is so good.

504
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,233
I have a question.

505
00:47:58,633 --> 00:48:00,300
He's being so considerate.

506
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:04,100
This is really cool. Thank you.

507
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:23,233
Can I have your soup?

508
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,166
Sure.

509
00:48:24,233 --> 00:48:27,233
Does it have clams?

510
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,033
- Yes.
- It's really good.

511
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,633
I finished the whole bowl.

512
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,567
- It's very good.
- All of the dishes are so good.

513
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:35,834
- You finished the tofu too?
- Yes.

514
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,300
Was that the best part?

515
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:40,367
That's the main ingredient of the soup.

516
00:48:48,033 --> 00:48:51,133
Son, are you going to lick my plate too?

517
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,266
No, I'm good. I should finish mine.

518
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,934
I hope this restaurant stays here.

519
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:59,300
It will be great if they open here
at the same spot.

520
00:48:59,367 --> 00:49:01,867
- How come there was nothing here?
- Right.

521
00:49:01,934 --> 00:49:03,300
I don't get it either.

522
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:08,400
Aren't we going to drink more soju?

523
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:11,000
Please pour me half a glass
if that's okay.

524
00:49:11,066 --> 00:49:13,000
- Give me a little.
- Half a glass?

525
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:14,200
Just a bit.

526
00:49:14,266 --> 00:49:16,734
- Okay, let me pour you some.
- That's enough.

527
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,033
It's your birthday.

528
00:49:18,133 --> 00:49:19,567
This is too much.

529
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:21,867
Cheers to you.

530
00:49:21,967 --> 00:49:22,967
Bottoms up?

531
00:49:23,066 --> 00:49:25,433
Yes. I'm a year older now. I can do it.

532
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,066
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

533
00:49:58,133 --> 00:50:00,266
She learned about the culture first.

534
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:43,000
Hold on. This is warm.

535
00:50:47,934 --> 00:50:49,266
This is really good.

536
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:54,633
It's like a pancake.

537
00:50:57,734 --> 00:51:00,467
You're right.
It reminds me of a mini pancake.

538
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,967
- This is good.
- It's like a mini pancake.

539
00:51:03,433 --> 00:51:04,533
It's very tasty.

540
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,533
It's like cereal, at the bottom.

541
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,600
Right, it tastes like cereal.

542
00:51:21,734 --> 00:51:23,500
Delicious dessert is the best.

543
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,533
Are you done already?

544
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:32,567
Yes, I am.

545
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:36,467
- Did you inhale it or what?
- You know I eat quite fast.

546
00:51:36,533 --> 00:51:39,700
You know,
there's a black hole in his stomach.

547
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,000
The service here is really good.

548
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,600
The food is amazing as well.

549
00:51:49,266 --> 00:51:51,166
Dolsot, dolsot, dolsot.

550
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,433
Dolsot.

551
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,600
It's ready.

552
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,467
- For Table Four.
- Table Four

553
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,867
The sesame seed is different.

554
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:05,533
Kkori-gomtang is ready.

555
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,400
That's one kkori-gomtang for Table One.

556
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,133
I'll add the green onions.

557
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,400
One, two, three.

558
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,200
Dakgalbi will be ready soon.

559
00:52:19,266 --> 00:52:20,500
Okay.

560
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:25,767
A crisis or not,
I just hope it all gets sold out.

561
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,066
We've faced enough crises.

562
00:52:39,266 --> 00:52:40,667
It's really easy.

563
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,834
Are all tables full?

564
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:47,300
- Every ten minutes, we're...
- Oh, right.

565
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,867
That's making it so much easier.

566
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:52,100
- I can do this for a month.
- I agree.

567
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:54,767
We can make five rounds a day
at this rate.

568
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:56,767
- Easily five rounds.
- I know.

569
00:52:57,567 --> 00:52:58,700
He's good.

570
00:53:01,066 --> 00:53:03,066
He surely is a NYU business major.

571
00:53:04,934 --> 00:53:06,000
Right.

572
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,900
- Great.
- You see,

573
00:53:09,967 --> 00:53:11,867
we're getting better day by day.

574
00:53:12,767 --> 00:53:14,367
It's like those TV shows.

575
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:28,433
Dakgalbi for Table Four.

576
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,700
Min-si.

577
00:53:35,533 --> 00:53:36,834
One dolsot-bibimbap.

578
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,767
We served all dishes for Table Four.

579
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,200
Two kkori-gomtang.

580
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:28,266
Seriously, at this rate,
I can keep doing this.

581
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,934
We finally have a system.

582
00:54:41,367 --> 00:54:44,367
- Finally.
- Funny that it's getting better every day.

583
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,533
I'm a taffy seller.

584
00:55:23,233 --> 00:55:25,533
This makes me smile.

585
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,066
It was this easy.

586
00:55:31,133 --> 00:55:32,133
Seriously.

587
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,633
I hope they order a lot of sundubu today.

588
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,000
Right, sundubu.

589
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:42,700
Min-si, does it have to sizzle more?
This should be okay, right?

590
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,633
Yes, it should be enough.

591
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,433
- For which table?
- Table Five.

592
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,967
- What? Table Five?
- Table Five.

593
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,934
Let me add sesame oil and seed.

594
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,600
Green onions.

595
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,100
These are for Table Five.
This is for Table Two.

596
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,066
Okay.

597
00:56:00,567 --> 00:56:02,400
Where does this go? There's one here.

598
00:56:02,467 --> 00:56:03,567
That's for Table Five too.

599
00:56:03,633 --> 00:56:05,367
- Two gomtang for Table Five?
- Yes.

600
00:56:05,834 --> 00:56:08,333
- One yuja sauce.
- No, that's mustard sauce.

601
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,266
Right, mustard sauce.

602
00:56:12,367 --> 00:56:14,000
Done. It's all set, right?

603
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,433
- What did you order?
- Bibimbap.

604
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,400
Bibimbap, okay.

605
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:27,367
It's very hot. Don't touch it.

606
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,800
For Instagram.

607
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,900
Our first meal we have in Iceland
is Korean.

608
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,433
Look at that bibimbap.

609
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,700
It looks so good.

610
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:30,600
Is it sour?

611
00:57:31,233 --> 00:57:32,400
- It's spicy.
- Is it?

612
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,433
Not very spicy. Just a bit.

613
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:55,867
The sauce is a bit sour.

614
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:57,367
It's perfectly seasoned.

615
00:57:58,266 --> 00:57:59,433
Can I try your soup?

616
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,433
Sure!

617
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,800
Oxtail soup.

618
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,333
- It's the last table, right?
- Yes.

619
00:59:34,667 --> 00:59:36,934
Rose and Jane.

620
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,633
Oh, it's "nei."

621
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,967
I thought you said "yes" in Korean.

622
01:00:34,066 --> 01:00:35,100
TOTALLY SOUNDS LIKE "NE"

623
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:47,533
It's done.

624
01:00:50,266 --> 01:00:53,400
Should we help them in the hall?
This is too relaxing.

625
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:55,300
How about we go shopping?

626
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:57,967
This is so relaxing.

627
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,033
Should we check out the hall?

628
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:32,033
It was you?

629
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,533
I was surprised too.

630
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,200
We don't have any more orders?

631
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:40,166
- No.
- No.

632
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:41,066
All served.

633
01:01:41,166 --> 01:01:42,900
- Yes.
- Did customers go in the room?

634
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:47,066
They're in the room.

635
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,200
- They are?
- He's taking their order.

636
01:01:54,100 --> 01:01:55,734
Did she really go shopping?

637
01:01:56,266 --> 01:01:57,333
Gosh.

638
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:02,567
I got some fresh air.

639
01:02:02,967 --> 01:02:04,700
They're ordering in the room.

640
01:02:04,767 --> 01:02:06,500
I'll get ready for the group.

641
01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:11,700
I love it.

642
01:02:13,266 --> 01:02:15,600
It feels really refreshing now.

643
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,200
As I cook.

644
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:22,333
One dolsot-bibimbap.

645
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,500
Three sundubu and two dakgalbi.

646
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:12,467
Three.

647
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,233
Dolsot-bibimbap on the stove.

648
01:03:31,433 --> 01:03:33,166
- How many bibimbap?
- Just one.

649
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,934
Sundubu! Sundubu!

650
01:03:47,467 --> 01:03:49,433
It'll take some time for the sundubu.

651
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,500
Are you zoning out?

652
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,266
Should I serve the bibimbap now?

653
01:04:07,367 --> 01:04:08,734
Let's serve it with the dakgalbi.

654
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,200
- With dakgalbi?
- Yes.

655
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:12,166
Let the three bowls of sundubu
go together.

656
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:15,200
After three bowls of sundubu,
we'll serve the dakgalbi.

657
01:04:37,934 --> 01:04:40,734
Sundubu-jjigae... It looks so delicious.

658
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:42,767
It's a hearty meal.

659
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:52,000
Oh, it's boiling hard.

660
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:55,700
What are you working on?

661
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,233
Rice and then dakgalbi.

662
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:58,166
Okay.

663
01:04:58,233 --> 01:04:59,667
You look much brighter.

664
01:04:59,767 --> 01:05:02,033
- What?
- Than when you worked with me.

665
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,066
I'm having fun.

666
01:05:03,133 --> 01:05:04,166
- You are?
- Yes.

667
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,266
Then I'll give you hell on Wednesday.

668
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:13,100
- Let's plate the dakgalbi now.
- Okay.

669
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,033
Dakgalbi...

670
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:17,400
How many pieces each?

671
01:05:17,867 --> 01:05:19,367
Just divide it into half.

672
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:21,767
- Estimate roughly.
- One, two, three.

673
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,633
Can Min-si estimate roughly now?

674
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:45,767
Okay, here we go.

675
01:05:45,834 --> 01:05:48,166
Yes, come.

676
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:51,100
Let me scoop rice for you.

677
01:05:51,166 --> 01:05:52,633
- Three.
- Rice is ready.

678
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:54,433
Bibimbap is coming soon too.

679
01:05:55,367 --> 01:05:57,867
I'll take one bibimbap. You can take that.

680
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,100
Let's go shopping now.

681
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,300
We can go shopping.

682
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,700
Sundubu?

683
01:06:11,767 --> 01:06:12,734
Bibimbap?

684
01:06:20,066 --> 01:06:22,033
It looks great.

685
01:06:23,767 --> 01:06:25,133
I see clam meat here.

686
01:06:28,633 --> 01:06:29,934
Nice.

687
01:06:45,567 --> 01:06:46,934
The chicken is good.

688
01:06:49,133 --> 01:06:50,700
What's this? Is it kimchi?

689
01:06:50,767 --> 01:06:52,066
Yes, that's kimchi.

690
01:06:52,667 --> 01:06:54,066
The kimchi is really good.

691
01:06:54,467 --> 01:06:56,433
Is the kimchi good?

692
01:07:05,233 --> 01:07:06,800
The tofu is high-quality.

693
01:07:27,934 --> 01:07:29,433
I'll pay for all of us.

694
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,333
- No.
- No.

695
01:07:30,433 --> 01:07:32,066
Let me treat. I have money.

696
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:39,400
I don't need the receipt.

697
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,433
It was crazy delicious.

698
01:07:54,467 --> 01:07:57,767
There are two other girls,
but they went somewhere to heat up.

699
01:08:30,667 --> 01:08:32,667
- This is complimentary.
- Thank you.

700
01:08:59,433 --> 01:09:01,567
So the room is done too, right?

701
01:09:06,233 --> 01:09:09,100
Let me do it first.

702
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:12,200
You're doing great.

703
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:13,300
- Great.
- Great.

704
01:09:13,367 --> 01:09:16,734
- Is it relaxing in the hall too?
- Yes, it's very relaxing.

705
01:09:19,967 --> 01:09:21,066
Oh, gosh.

706
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,166
They finished the whole thing.

707
01:09:30,233 --> 01:09:32,467
Seo-jin. Wait. Not there.

708
01:09:32,533 --> 01:09:33,467
Hold on.

709
01:09:34,166 --> 01:09:36,500
- Are you putting the dishes there?
- Yes.

710
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:38,133
- I'm trying something new.
- Okay.

711
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,700
Woo-shik, how do we do this?

712
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,533
- Where do I put these?
- Yes?

713
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:08,066
Put them in here after throwing the rice.

714
01:10:08,633 --> 01:10:10,400
- And then...
- Do I just put it in?

715
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:12,133
Yes, you can do that.

716
01:10:13,066 --> 01:10:15,333
This is nice. With the soapy water...

717
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,467
- Whose idea was it?
- Hey, Woo-shik.

718
01:10:28,934 --> 01:10:30,533
Why did they leave so much?

719
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:37,233
- Is it too spicy?
- It could be too spicy.

720
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,266
Is it not cooked?

721
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:47,567
They usually finish it.

722
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,066
Is it too much?

723
01:10:51,633 --> 01:10:53,433
What? Did they leave the food?

724
01:10:53,967 --> 01:10:55,700
They left a lot of noodles.

725
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:56,834
Is that so?

726
01:10:58,333 --> 01:10:59,400
Is it too much?

727
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,500
- It could be.
- I think it's a lot.

728
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,133
- That's one whole bag of noodles.
- Right.

729
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:08,467
Should I reduce the amount?

730
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,233
Why do you look so happy today?

731
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:30,800
I don't know.
I'm happy because it isn't hectic.

732
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:32,967
I'm very happy today.

733
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:43,166
That's one bibimbap, one dakgalbi.

734
01:13:09,033 --> 01:13:10,767
Bibimbap is ready.

735
01:13:27,367 --> 01:13:28,567
We have new orders.

736
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,834
Dakgalbi and bibimbap.

737
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,633
One dolsot-bibimbap.

738
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,800
Bibimbap is done.

739
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:50,533
Boil it down.

740
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:54,467
Boil it down a little more.

741
01:14:08,233 --> 01:14:09,834
Get ready for the insert image.

742
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:11,000
Okay.

743
01:14:19,867 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm not done.

744
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:36,300
Bibimbap for Table Three is done.

745
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:37,600
One, two, three.

746
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:42,633
It's here.

747
01:14:44,266 --> 01:14:45,934
Dishes for Table Three are done.

748
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,133
- This is done?
- Yes.

749
01:14:57,233 --> 01:14:58,667
Please bring it.

750
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:27,867
It's good.

751
01:15:38,266 --> 01:15:43,066
When the food came,
the bowl was like flaming hot.

752
01:15:43,133 --> 01:15:44,367
It was sizzling.

753
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:46,300
- So it gets warm.
- It gets warm.

754
01:15:46,734 --> 01:15:49,600
It's good because it's freezing outside.

755
01:15:52,967 --> 01:15:56,033
Can I take pictures with you guys?

756
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:57,700
Sure.

757
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:03,233
- Can I follow your social media account?
- Yes, good.

758
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:25,467
He probably was wondering,
"What are they doing?"

759
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,800
It was worth the wait.

760
01:16:37,266 --> 01:16:39,934
What shall we have? What do you want?

761
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:40,967
I don't know.

762
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:42,734
I'm excited.

763
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,333
I'll just have that.

764
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:46,233
What?

765
01:16:46,300 --> 01:16:48,266
The first one. I'll have sundubu.

766
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:50,266
Sundubu-jjigae.

767
01:16:51,734 --> 01:16:53,367
Wait. What's this?

768
01:16:53,433 --> 01:16:54,467
What is it?

769
01:16:57,033 --> 01:16:58,700
Bibimbap.

770
01:16:58,767 --> 01:17:00,233
Where does it say?

771
01:17:04,066 --> 01:17:06,934
Dolsot-bibimbap.

772
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,867
Then I'll order...

773
01:17:14,633 --> 01:17:15,967
Well...

774
01:17:16,033 --> 01:17:17,133
Chicken!

775
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:19,700
How do you say it?

776
01:17:23,266 --> 01:17:24,200
Dak...

777
01:17:26,066 --> 01:17:28,700
- Let's just show them this.
- I agree.

778
01:17:28,834 --> 01:17:30,567
I don't dare to pronounce it.

779
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,400
- No spinach for me.
- Okay.

780
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,633
Dakgalbi.

781
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,100
Dakgalbi.

782
01:18:23,166 --> 01:18:25,667
- Dakgalbi.
- Dakgalbi.

783
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:45,300
I hope the kkakdugi we have is enough.

784
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,500
But I think we do have to make it.

785
01:18:47,567 --> 01:18:49,133
I have to get more radish.

786
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:52,834
I was going to get it earlier.
But I didn't get it in the end.

787
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:58,700
I should get it tomorrow.

788
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,934
Mr. Choi, what do you think of Intern Ko?

789
01:19:02,033 --> 01:19:04,100
Well, she's excellent.

790
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,600
I should learn from her.

791
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:11,700
We'll probably have a lot of orders soon.

792
01:19:11,767 --> 01:19:14,000
- Really?
- Yes, we just accepted three tables.

793
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:16,800
I was waiting for that.

794
01:19:16,867 --> 01:19:18,033
I was waiting for that.

795
01:19:21,033 --> 01:19:22,166
Min-si is a fool.

796
01:19:29,967 --> 01:19:31,667
- Orders.
- Orders.

797
01:19:31,734 --> 01:19:33,200
Gosh, that's a lot.

798
01:19:33,266 --> 01:19:35,700
One gomtang and one bibimbap.

799
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:38,300
One dakgalbi and one sundubu.

800
01:19:38,367 --> 01:19:40,333
- I'll leave it here.
- Goodness.

801
01:19:40,433 --> 01:19:44,433
Seo-jun, we have more orders.
One more sundubu jjigae.

802
01:19:44,533 --> 01:19:46,800
One dakgalbi and one bibimbap.

803
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:49,133
- More orders.
- We have more orders.

804
01:19:49,233 --> 01:19:51,233
- Another one.
- More orders.

805
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,433
What is it?

806
01:19:53,367 --> 01:19:56,000
We have to make two sundubu,

807
01:19:56,066 --> 01:19:57,633
and two dakgalbi.

808
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,567
Two sundubu and two dakgalbi.

809
01:19:59,633 --> 01:20:01,333
Yes, they ordered one each.

810
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,900
Kkori, dolsot, dakgalbi, sundubu.

811
01:20:08,567 --> 01:20:10,800
Kkori, dolsot, dakgalbi, sundubu.

812
01:20:54,834 --> 01:20:56,266
- Oh...
- It looks good.

813
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:58,166
I'm so into this.

814
01:21:03,333 --> 01:21:05,433
I'll go for Table Five.
You go for Table One.

815
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,633
Table One it is.

816
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:17,000
This much?

817
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:17,934
Yes.

818
01:21:59,433 --> 01:22:00,767
Do you want a glass?

819
01:22:01,834 --> 01:22:03,000
Just have a sip.

820
01:22:05,867 --> 01:22:07,166
The bottle is mine.

821
01:22:18,367 --> 01:22:22,400
It's amazing. They keep having shots.

822
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:26,934
- They keep having shots.
- Let's try it too.

823
01:22:27,633 --> 01:22:30,500
I don't want to get drunk.

824
01:22:33,467 --> 01:22:36,667
- Okay. We'll try it one day.
- Do you want to do it now?

825
01:22:36,934 --> 01:22:39,333
I'm afraid it might be like Brennivín.

826
01:22:44,266 --> 01:22:47,066
We should do it in Korea.

827
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:55,500
It's so warm.

828
01:22:55,567 --> 01:22:58,200
This green plum tea is
exactly what I wanted.

829
01:22:58,266 --> 01:22:59,667
So how does that taste?

830
01:22:59,734 --> 01:23:01,266
- Try it.
- Try it.

831
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:04,967
Nice.

832
01:23:05,433 --> 01:23:07,667
It tastes a bit like mulberry, right?

833
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:10,734
Yes, mulberry.
I've never had anything like this.

834
01:23:10,867 --> 01:23:14,700
What kind of Korean food
have you tried in Malaysia?

835
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,033
The one I had the most was kimchi-jjigae.

836
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:21,500
There are many Korean restaurants
in Taiwan too.

837
01:23:21,567 --> 01:23:28,233
We go to Korean restaurants
when we crave Korean food.

838
01:23:28,367 --> 01:23:31,066
But it makes me want to go to Korea more.

839
01:24:02,533 --> 01:24:03,767
Sundubu is ready.

840
01:24:03,834 --> 01:24:05,633
- Can it be served?
- Yes.

841
01:24:18,967 --> 01:24:22,433
That's one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine.

842
01:24:23,133 --> 01:24:26,367
How many cameras are present here?

843
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:29,800
- You see what's around you now.
- I know.

844
01:24:29,867 --> 01:24:33,233
I can see there are cameras here now.

845
01:24:34,633 --> 01:24:37,133
- Should we serve kkori-gomtang?
- Yes.

846
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:57,900
It should be cleaned.

847
01:24:59,834 --> 01:25:02,767
- Gomtang for Table Four.
- These are all for Table Four.

848
01:25:05,333 --> 01:25:06,400
Food is ready.

849
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,667
It looks good in this bowl.

850
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:28,266
This is a lot! It's a huge spread.

851
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:33,567
Oh, I remember it now.

852
01:25:33,633 --> 01:25:38,200
They made this gomtang on Youn's Stay.

853
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:42,233
They had a garden in that restaurant.

854
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:46,166
They boiled these oxtails there.

855
01:25:46,233 --> 01:25:51,166
Right! They boiled it in a huge pot.

856
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,934
The soup is getting infused already.

857
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,500
Take one oxtail.

858
01:26:05,567 --> 01:26:06,967
Okay. Thank you.

859
01:26:13,934 --> 01:26:15,734
- Nice.
- It's so soft.

860
01:26:16,266 --> 01:26:20,066
I can feel it. They must've
gone through a lot to make this.

861
01:26:22,934 --> 01:26:25,734
This bibimbap is really nice too.

862
01:26:25,800 --> 01:26:26,834
Right?

863
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,367
I tried gochujang before.
It didn't suit my taste.

864
01:26:33,433 --> 01:26:35,100
But this one is really good.

865
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:39,867
Nice.

866
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:41,467
This is so good.

867
01:26:42,133 --> 01:26:43,400
The tofu here

868
01:26:43,467 --> 01:26:46,734
is just like the tofu I have in Malaysia.

869
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,367
Is this what Koreans have
as hangover food?

870
01:26:54,433 --> 01:26:56,633
Hangover food? That's right.

871
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:59,834
I haven't seen him
enjoying my food like this.

872
01:26:59,934 --> 01:27:02,100
- No, It's different.
- She's jealous.

873
01:27:02,166 --> 01:27:03,600
It's different.

874
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:05,166
I was just kidding.

875
01:27:06,200 --> 01:27:09,700
I didn't even imagine
coming to a place like this with you.

876
01:27:10,367 --> 01:27:14,533
Many of the miracles in life are
unexpected. Just like the northern lights.

877
01:27:56,967 --> 01:27:58,500
It's quite heavy.

878
01:27:58,667 --> 01:28:01,100
- What?
- These chopsticks are a bit heavy.

879
01:28:01,266 --> 01:28:03,533
They're thin yet heavy.

880
01:28:09,934 --> 01:28:13,834
Is the soju classic or with flavors?

881
01:28:13,934 --> 01:28:18,200
This soju is with a red cap.

882
01:28:18,266 --> 01:28:19,767
So it's a bit strong.

883
01:28:19,867 --> 01:28:21,800
- It is about 20 percent.
- Okay.

884
01:28:21,867 --> 01:28:24,100
- So two bottles.
- Two bottles of soju?

885
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:26,000
- Bottle or...?
- It comes in a bottle.

886
01:28:26,066 --> 01:28:27,867
So one bottle with two glasses.

887
01:28:41,266 --> 01:28:46,066
I would be upset
if I don't look good on TV.

888
01:28:48,734 --> 01:28:50,000
My face is burned.

889
01:28:51,033 --> 01:28:52,734
Can you tell?

890
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,166
No, I can't tell.

891
01:28:55,433 --> 01:28:56,767
You can tell a little.

892
01:28:56,867 --> 01:28:58,400
No, I can't see it at all.

893
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:01,033
It's like you got a tan.

894
01:29:03,433 --> 01:29:05,700
- Come here.
- Look.

895
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,500
- I don't want to upset you.
- No, I'm not burned.

896
01:29:11,133 --> 01:29:13,233
I have a natural tan.

897
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:18,934
I'm not burned more than you.
I'm going to write about this.

898
01:29:19,266 --> 01:29:20,533
In my diary.

899
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,867
- There are customers in the room.
- Group customers.

900
01:29:27,967 --> 01:29:32,200
That's three sundubu, two dakgalbi,
two bibimbap, and one gomtang.

901
01:29:32,300 --> 01:29:35,734
You can take your time.
Their drinks aren't served yet.

902
01:29:35,800 --> 01:29:38,367
So we have to make two sundubu-jjigae.

903
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:39,800
And two dakgalbi.

904
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:42,333
And two dolsot-bibimbap.

905
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:44,367
Two sundubus, two dakgalbis.

906
01:29:44,433 --> 01:29:46,300
Yes, they ordered one each.

907
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:50,633
One, two.

908
01:30:22,467 --> 01:30:23,300
What?

909
01:30:26,266 --> 01:30:27,667
- What?
- Did you call me?

910
01:30:27,767 --> 01:30:28,600
No.

911
01:30:29,467 --> 01:30:30,900
I pressed it by mistake.

912
01:30:30,967 --> 01:30:32,400
What do they call this?

913
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,667
Pavlov's Dogs?

914
01:30:34,734 --> 01:30:36,467
We're becoming one of those.

915
01:30:56,433 --> 01:30:57,767
I'm so sorry, but...

916
01:30:57,834 --> 01:30:58,700
Yes?

917
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,600
Is that bibimbap for Table Five?

918
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:01,900
Yes, why?

919
01:31:02,333 --> 01:31:04,066
- Can we remove this?
- Spinach?

920
01:31:04,133 --> 01:31:04,967
- Yes.
- Sure.

921
01:31:05,066 --> 01:31:06,700
She doesn't want spinach.

922
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,467
- I have to make one anyway.
- Okay.

923
01:31:08,567 --> 01:31:10,533
- Thank you.
- Sure.

924
01:31:10,633 --> 01:31:12,934
No spinach for Table Five. Then I'll...

925
01:31:13,567 --> 01:31:14,800
just leave it here.

926
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:42,166
Bibimbap without spinach for Table Five.

927
01:32:01,533 --> 01:32:03,467
- Sundubu is ready.
- Okay.

928
01:32:04,300 --> 01:32:05,600
Sundubu for Table One.

929
01:32:05,667 --> 01:32:07,667
- Sundubu for Table Five.
- For Table Five.

930
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,767
One for Table One and Table Five.

931
01:32:09,867 --> 01:32:11,100
For Table Two.

932
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:12,533
Dakgalbi and sundubu.

933
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:15,834
This bibimbap without spinach
is for Table Five.

934
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:16,867
Table Five?

935
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:54,300
You go ahead. I'll use the restroom.

936
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,800
- I'll be quick.
- The tofu is huge.

937
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,400
- I'll mix it.
- Okay.

938
01:33:39,066 --> 01:33:40,166
Dakgalbi?

939
01:33:53,233 --> 01:33:54,100
Cheers.

940
01:34:00,867 --> 01:34:02,533
I think I need to mix it.

941
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:03,467
Yes.

942
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:10,800
It's great.

943
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:12,800
Is it?

944
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:14,400
Oh, it's nice.

945
01:34:20,033 --> 01:34:21,433
- It's delicious.
- Right.

946
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:23,667
This is the best.

947
01:34:36,734 --> 01:34:38,734
Should we mix the rice with this?

948
01:34:39,133 --> 01:34:40,800
The sauce is so good.

949
01:34:40,900 --> 01:34:42,000
I'll add the rice.

950
01:34:42,867 --> 01:34:44,066
Yes, mix it.

951
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:49,934
You're an expert.

952
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,700
I'm good, right? I'm Cooking Master.

953
01:34:53,033 --> 01:34:56,633
The camera started filming you
as soon as you added the rice.

954
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:57,533
No way.

955
01:34:57,633 --> 01:34:59,133
- It's true.
- Did it move?

956
01:34:59,233 --> 01:35:00,133
Yes!

957
01:35:03,767 --> 01:35:06,400
- I know how to eat it properly.
- You do.

958
01:35:10,467 --> 01:35:11,900
I'll eat it all.

959
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,867
It's delicious.

960
01:35:23,367 --> 01:35:24,367
Thank you.

961
01:36:02,467 --> 01:36:04,467
Wow, they finished it all.

962
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,333
- Look.
- How did they finish the whole thing?

963
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:10,600
Goodness!

964
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:14,367
Aren't these washed already?

965
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,867
They finished the whole thing.

966
01:36:20,367 --> 01:36:21,667
This looks great.

967
01:36:23,033 --> 01:36:25,166
There's soft tofu inside.

968
01:36:26,367 --> 01:36:28,033
I haven't tried tofu before.

969
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:31,300
- Have you tried tofu?
- Yes, it'll be fine.

970
01:36:37,567 --> 01:36:38,800
Nice.

971
01:36:44,066 --> 01:36:45,300
How is it?

972
01:36:45,367 --> 01:36:47,000
It's good!

973
01:37:07,066 --> 01:37:10,567
We are not supposed to use chopsticks
when we have soup.

974
01:37:11,300 --> 01:37:13,300
You're supposed to use the spoon.

975
01:37:14,967 --> 01:37:19,033
You're having the rice, you know.

976
01:37:22,166 --> 01:37:24,533
Put the rice in the soup,

977
01:37:25,266 --> 01:37:31,567
scoop it,
and then put tofu or meat on top.

978
01:37:31,667 --> 01:37:33,867
That's how you eat it.

979
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:39,467
How is it?

980
01:37:40,033 --> 01:37:42,867
It's a bit spicy, but it's very good.

981
01:37:42,967 --> 01:37:43,867
Is this kimchi?

982
01:37:43,934 --> 01:37:44,934
I think so.

983
01:37:45,567 --> 01:37:46,867
I'll ask them later.

984
01:37:46,934 --> 01:37:47,834
Okay.

985
01:37:48,233 --> 01:37:49,567
If I'm brave enough.

986
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:51,266
You can do it.

987
01:37:53,567 --> 01:37:54,700
Nice.

988
01:38:06,834 --> 01:38:08,700
I've never tried any of this.

989
01:38:14,700 --> 01:38:17,934
I don't know how to eat this.
Do I put it like this?

990
01:38:32,734 --> 01:38:34,300
- It's really good.
- I know.

991
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:37,066
Should I do this?

992
01:38:42,767 --> 01:38:44,000
Look at this!

993
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:45,500
I'm a professional.

994
01:38:46,233 --> 01:38:47,500
You're professional.

995
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,333
- We're trying many new things.
- That's right.

996
01:39:06,033 --> 01:39:06,967
It's good!

997
01:39:07,033 --> 01:39:08,133
It's really good.

998
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,533
It's so good that I want everything.

999
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:12,700
I should keep having this soup.

1000
01:39:18,567 --> 01:39:20,367
Adding sesame salt...

1001
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,700
Next is three sundubu and two dakgalbi.

1002
01:39:46,233 --> 01:39:47,066
What?

1003
01:40:01,133 --> 01:40:02,433
Gosh, it's hot.

1004
01:40:46,133 --> 01:40:48,266
I'll serve the food for the group.

1005
01:40:48,333 --> 01:40:50,166
- There's an order for it.
- Okay.

1006
01:40:51,367 --> 01:40:53,100
Will it be ready all at once?

1007
01:40:53,166 --> 01:40:55,934
- Not exactly at the same time.
- Okay.

1008
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,033
Just one by one.

1009
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:58,300
I see.

1010
01:40:58,367 --> 01:41:00,166
Are you too busy, Seo-jun?

1011
01:41:00,266 --> 01:41:02,000
No. Why do you ask?

1012
01:41:02,066 --> 01:41:03,767
- The group...
- This...

1013
01:41:03,834 --> 01:41:05,967
- Mix it after adding five spoons.
- Okay.

1014
01:41:06,033 --> 01:41:07,100
Four spoons.

1015
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,467
What about the group?

1016
01:41:08,533 --> 01:41:12,200
Will the same type of dish be ready
all at once? Or all types?

1017
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:13,633
- All types.
- Okay.

1018
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:14,867
That's better.

1019
01:41:14,967 --> 01:41:17,467
That's better for me too.
Do you like me too?

1020
01:41:17,533 --> 01:41:18,500
I like you.

1021
01:41:49,266 --> 01:41:50,233
- Woo-shik.
- Yes?

1022
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:52,533
- Sundubu will be ready shortly.
- Okay.

1023
01:41:55,867 --> 01:41:58,233
Two sundubu and one gomtang first.

1024
01:42:04,734 --> 01:42:06,000
Another's coming too.

1025
01:42:06,734 --> 01:42:08,433
How long will bibimbap take?

1026
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,967
- When it starts to sizzle...
- Soon.

1027
01:42:11,066 --> 01:42:13,066
Chicken, sundubu, kkori-gomtang...

1028
01:42:13,133 --> 01:42:14,800
If only bibimbap were ready.

1029
01:42:14,867 --> 01:42:16,800
- Bibimbap's ready.
- Okay.

1030
01:42:16,867 --> 01:42:17,967
Okay, let's go.

1031
01:42:27,233 --> 01:42:29,033
So these are the last ones?

1032
01:42:29,867 --> 01:42:31,667
Maybe the aurora's here?

1033
01:42:32,467 --> 01:42:34,033
- I'll serve them.
- Okay.

1034
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:40,934
They're all served.

1035
01:42:55,734 --> 01:42:58,100
We're done. All dishes have been served.

1036
01:42:58,166 --> 01:42:59,000
Okay.

1037
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:01,934
- Well done.
- Good job.

1038
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,667
I'll take your photo.

1039
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:22,533
Come on.

1040
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:29,233
You must be relieved
that I'm back to happy mood.

1041
01:43:37,367 --> 01:43:39,800
This kimchi is amazing. It's delicious.

1042
01:43:39,900 --> 01:43:41,600
I'll try everything.

1043
01:43:51,567 --> 01:43:53,667
We should have it with soju.

1044
01:44:15,467 --> 01:44:17,567
It's so good. I want to eat more.

1045
01:44:17,934 --> 01:44:20,600
I don't want to finish it.
It's too delicious.

1046
01:44:30,967 --> 01:44:32,767
You don't want me to eat it?

1047
01:44:34,033 --> 01:44:35,567
Too late.

1048
01:44:43,133 --> 01:44:44,200
It's good.

1049
01:44:57,200 --> 01:44:59,100
How do you say cheers in Korean?

1050
01:45:00,166 --> 01:45:02,767
I don't know how they say it exactly.

1051
01:45:02,867 --> 01:45:04,967
Let's ask the staff later.

1052
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,367
- There's something on your face.
- Really?

1053
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:13,033
A string of your hair is there.

1054
01:45:13,934 --> 01:45:15,200
Here, in the middle.

1055
01:45:15,300 --> 01:45:16,734
Are you going to fix it?

1056
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:19,300
Sure, of course.

1057
01:45:22,533 --> 01:45:23,533
Come here.

1058
01:45:24,266 --> 01:45:28,000
Let me turn it into a 70s style.
What's that style called again?

1059
01:45:28,066 --> 01:45:29,233
Oh, the 90s.

1060
01:45:30,533 --> 01:45:31,667
Look at me.

1061
01:45:44,033 --> 01:45:45,500
I look so aggressive.

1062
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:48,333
No, you look very handsome.

1063
01:45:50,133 --> 01:45:52,433
I did a good job with your hair style.

1064
01:45:59,100 --> 01:46:01,233
Let me take your photo now.

1065
01:46:02,867 --> 01:46:04,300
Is this better?

1066
01:46:18,166 --> 01:46:20,633
You didn't even think
about taking my photos?

1067
01:46:20,734 --> 01:46:22,367
I didn't want to use a phone.

1068
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,900
Aren't you going to Poland soon?

1069
01:47:21,967 --> 01:47:22,867
Yes.

1070
01:47:22,934 --> 01:47:26,500
I'm going to Warsaw and Krakow.

1071
01:47:28,667 --> 01:47:31,133
- Yes, for about a week.
- Yes.

1072
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,333
It sounds fun.

1073
01:47:32,433 --> 01:47:36,066
Please recommend me
some good places to visit.

1074
01:47:36,166 --> 01:47:40,567
I always get something like pierogi.

1075
01:47:44,467 --> 01:47:48,033
Dumplings are usually round on top.

1076
01:47:48,100 --> 01:47:50,867
But this one is like a croissant.

1077
01:47:50,967 --> 01:47:57,900
It could get a bit cold
between 5:00 and 8:00 p.m.

1078
01:47:58,700 --> 01:48:01,100
It's good to have a hoodie.

1079
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,934
The food here was very good.

1080
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,467
Right.

1081
01:48:05,533 --> 01:48:09,400
I'm very happy
that this happened in Iceland.

1082
01:48:09,467 --> 01:48:12,967
I know what twibap is.
It's fried rice grains.

1083
01:48:13,066 --> 01:48:14,500
- It's delicious.
- Really?

1084
01:48:17,533 --> 01:48:18,367
Good.

1085
01:48:18,433 --> 01:48:19,867
I'm so full.

1086
01:48:19,934 --> 01:48:22,233
I should go back and get digested.

1087
01:48:25,433 --> 01:48:26,533
How was it today?

1088
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:28,800
- Today?
- It wasn't that busy, right?

1089
01:48:28,867 --> 01:48:30,033
- No.
- Right.

1090
01:48:30,667 --> 01:48:31,533
This is...

1091
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,600
what you call, "easy peasy"?

1092
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:36,400
Easy peasy. We need to work harder.

1093
01:48:37,834 --> 01:48:39,367
Like the racing horses.

1094
01:48:40,867 --> 01:48:41,700
Right?

1095
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:44,533
What?

1096
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:46,900
It wasn't too busy today.

1097
01:48:48,166 --> 01:48:49,066
Right.

1098
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:52,667
It was great to divide the time table.

1099
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,867
They're still eating in the room.

1100
01:49:32,934 --> 01:49:34,367
- Let's not go there yet.
- Sure.

1101
01:49:35,600 --> 01:49:39,333
Seo-jin, they're still eating in the room.
We'll clean up later.

1102
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:48,266
I think they'll close soon.
Are there more customers?

1103
01:49:48,367 --> 01:49:50,100
I think we're the last ones.

1104
01:49:58,734 --> 01:50:00,867
Why are you looking at me like that?

1105
01:50:00,934 --> 01:50:02,367
Because you're beautiful.

1106
01:50:12,633 --> 01:50:15,500
God, you're so beautiful.

1107
01:50:16,333 --> 01:50:17,934
Look at me.

1108
01:50:38,967 --> 01:50:39,967
"Skal."

1109
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:42,567
In Korean, you say...

1110
01:50:42,633 --> 01:50:43,967
- "Geonbae."
- "Geonbae."

1111
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:46,000
- Geonbae.
- Geonbae.

1112
01:50:53,233 --> 01:50:54,834
It's my birthday today.

1113
01:50:54,934 --> 01:50:56,900
No need to get a cake or anything.

1114
01:50:56,967 --> 01:50:59,266
It's your birthday. Make a birthday meal.

1115
01:50:59,367 --> 01:51:00,667
Can't you make japchae?

1116
01:51:00,734 --> 01:51:01,633
- What?
- Japchae.

1117
01:51:02,333 --> 01:51:04,967
I'm okay.

1118
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:14,166
I heard yesterday that he turned 34.

1119
01:51:14,266 --> 01:51:15,800
Don't we have to run?

1120
01:51:15,867 --> 01:51:17,400
It's Woo-shik's birthday.

1121
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:20,667
I made seaweed soup.

1122
01:51:22,967 --> 01:51:24,333
Let's go!

1123
01:51:29,600 --> 01:51:31,967
I told you not to do this.

1124
01:51:32,066 --> 01:51:34,800
- Let's get this.
- Let's work hard today.

1125
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,700
First day of yukjeon bibim-guksu.

1126
01:51:39,200 --> 01:51:40,967
The meat is so fresh.

1127
01:51:41,934 --> 01:51:43,700
It looks delicious.

1128
01:51:44,266 --> 01:51:45,767
Cucumbers, please be nice today.

1129
01:51:45,900 --> 01:51:47,633
That's for one, two portions.

1130
01:51:57,934 --> 01:51:59,734
How do you like your eggs, Min-si?

1131
01:52:00,233 --> 01:52:02,166
- Soft-cooked.
- Soft-cooked?

1132
01:52:04,467 --> 01:52:06,100
You know your taste.

1133
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:08,700
You surely are a Gen MZ.

1134
01:52:08,767 --> 01:52:10,266
You are a Gen MZ too.

1135
01:52:10,333 --> 01:52:12,533
- You are.
- Isn't Seo-jin an MZ too?

1136
01:52:12,633 --> 01:52:13,467
No.

1137
01:52:13,533 --> 01:52:14,900
I am in Generation X.

1138
01:52:16,934 --> 01:52:18,433
Like Tesla.

1139
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,467
Tesla...

1140
01:52:22,767 --> 01:52:24,100
You mean like Model X?

1141
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:29,533
He's like the best one in Generation X.

1142
01:52:31,367 --> 01:52:33,100
Isn't he one of the Orange Group kids?

1143
01:52:33,166 --> 01:52:34,834
- Orange Group?
- Orange Group?

1144
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:36,500
My gosh. The Orange Group.

1145
01:52:37,233 --> 01:52:38,300
JINNY'S TTUKBAEGI

1146
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:42,800
