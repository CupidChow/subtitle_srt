How are you gonna deal with the debt?

68
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,720
First of all, I must make it clear

69
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:01,440
that I'm not the borrower,

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
but I... I'm willing to pay the debt.

71
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,390
I won't deny it.

72
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,270
That being said, I ask for two things.

73
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,260
Firstly,

74
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,820
the debt is fixed at 800,000 yuan,

75
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,550
with no more accrued interest.

76
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,590
Secondly,

77
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,980
don't come to my home to collect the debt.

78
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,300
Come on. The debt payment is long overdue,

79
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
and you're asking me not to charge interest.

80
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,590
How am I supposed to keep my business going?

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,590

82

You have made lots of money

83
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,800
from the interest arisen from the loan.

84
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,640
With the 800,000 yuan I'm gonna pay you,

85
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,440
you'll make a big enough profit.

I'll figure out a way to get you the money,

90
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,710

91
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,470

00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,710
Actually, I came here

189
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,110
just to consult about the price.

190
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,750
Yeah.

191
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:39,090
Hello, Lanlan.

192
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,350
Hello, Yingzi.

193
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,550
What?

194
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,270
That old harridan is here!

195
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,620
Don't open the door.

196
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,630
I'm on my way home.

197
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,160
Just don't open the door. Do you hear me?

198
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,690
Alright.

199
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,680
Open the door right now,

200
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,620
or I'll call the police!

201
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,630
I'll have the police arrest you!

202
00:10:59,290 --> 00:10:59,930
Open up!

203
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,610
What's going on here?

204
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,450
My child's doing homework at home.

205
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,710
You've gotta stop yelling.

206
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,900
I'm trying to catch a thief here.

207
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,880
Haven't you seen people catch a thief?

208
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,380
Go to the police if you wanna catch a thief.

209
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,250
Yelling won't help you with anything.

210
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,690
Are you gonna open the door or what?

211
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,110
I'll be waiting here.

212
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,550
Sooner or later, you'll have to come out!

213
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,350
Open the door!

214
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,710
What are you doing?

215
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,620
What are you doing outside my home?

216
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,250
Look at her!

217
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:34,810
Lanlan,

218
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:35,660
you're a thief!

219
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,310
You stole the deed to our house!

220
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:39,010
Where do you keep it? Give it back to me!

221
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,140
Otherwise, I'll...

222
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,670
You're hurting me!

223
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:43,270
What is this about?

224
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,520
Help!

225
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,070
You can't hit her!

226
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,090
No one hits her!

227
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,470
Whatever it is, you can't use violence!

228
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:49,900
The two of you gang up on a young girl.

229
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,810
Don't you feel ashamed?

230
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,770
No one hits her!

231
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,450
Let go of me!

232
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,650
What happened? What happened?

233
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,430
Let go!

234
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,360
Who called the police?

235
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,810
They beat me up!

236
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:58,830
That's not true.

237
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,130
No one. No one beats her.

238
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:00,870
No one!

239
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,260
Look at these scratches!

240
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,770
-I…
-Listen!

241
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:06,960
Whatever the conflict is, just talk it out.

242
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,590
Don't you know physical assault is illegal?

243
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,560
Officers,

244
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,830
I've seen people with no shame,

245
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,110
and she's the most shameless of all!

246
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,990
She did it to herself!

247
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,520
We never hurt her!

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,510
You must have surveillance cameras around.

249
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,950
Check the footage out!

250
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,510
Am I right?

251
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,040
-We never hit her!
-Lanlan.

252
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,460
Yingzi!

253
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,600
They attacked me!

254
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,530
Don't be afraid. Here I am.

255
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,330
Luo Yingzi.

256
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,730
You're sneakier than I thought.

257
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,910
You abetted her in stealing from us.

258
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:34,790
Officers,

259
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,390
this woman was our nanny. She stole from us.

260
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,870
Did you steal from them?

261
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,560
What did she steal?

262
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,310
She stole the deed to our house!

263
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,570
The deed to your house?

264
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,480
Whose name is it on the deed?

265
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,700
It's...

266
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,350
Officers, I'm so sorry.

267
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,330
This is a family matter. I'll handle it.

268
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,190
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

269
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:59,520
You shouldn't have let a family issue

270
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,800
escalate to the state of disorder.

271
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,570
For you two,

272
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,910
no matter what happens,

273
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,380
you shouldn't physically assault others.

274
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,050
Keep that in mind.

275
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,440
We didn't assault anyone.

276
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:06,990
It's true!

277
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,310
You called the police, didn't you?

278
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:09,840
I need your signature here.

279
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,370
Thank you.

280
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,430
I should get back to my child.

281
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,260
Lanlan did what she did

282
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,550
at my command.

283
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,590
What she took from you

284
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,050
originally belongs to me.

285
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,460
If you want to pick a fight, come to me.

286
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,940
Today the police officers have stopped by.

287
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,230
This little incident is already on record.

288
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,630
If the same thing happens again,

289
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,910
believe it or not, I'll make you suffer.

290
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,000
Now get out!

291
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:43,630
You...

292
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,120
Does... Does justice no longer exist?

293
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,390
Let's go.

294
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,110
I told you so.

295
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,230
It's no use coming here.

296
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,850
Why?

297
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,930
That's unreasonable!

298
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,730
-Let's get your wound dressed.
-Luo Ying Zi!

299
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,730
I'm telling you,

300
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,440
it makes no difference though you have the deed.

301
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,120
Let's go.

302
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,540
Wait and see!

303
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,990
No more quibbling.

304
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,810
Let's see! It's not over yet!

305
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,200
What did I tell you?

306
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,350
When I'm not around,

307
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,750
you must not open the door for them.

308
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,750
I didn't expect her to really hit me.

309
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,000
It's gonna hurt. Bear with it.

310
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,530
Neither did I think she'd attack you.

311
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,470
Anyway,

312
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,560
don't open the door for them anymore.

313
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,630
You'll stay at home,

314
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,100
while I go out.

315
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,560
Are you going out again?

316
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,220
Today you've been bullied.

317
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,800
I'm gonna get it even.

318
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,350
It's time to teach the bullies a lesson.

319
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,210
I've decided.

320
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll sell this apartment.

321
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,880
Ms. Luo, I know you're in need of money.

322
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,120
As what I've told you,

323
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,940
apartments near good schools sell better

324
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,710
and faster.

325
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,260
Listen, I'm selling this one.

326
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,590
Didn't you say

327
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,910
it would be quickly sold at 6.6 million?

328
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,880
I'll accept a lower offer.

329
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,350
6.2 or 6.3 million.

330
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,390
That'll do.

331
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,330
Ms. Luo,

332
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,020
the apartment is worth much more than that.

333
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,800
The market value of it is 7 million.

334
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
You're charging 700,000 yuan less.

335
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:05,080
I'm trying to sell an apartment.

336
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,310
Why must it be so hard?

337
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:09,100
Let me tell you something, Mr. Li.

338
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,060
This apartment

339
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,720
is in an awkward situation.

340
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,320
The new owner may have some difficulties

341
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
moving in.

342
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,810
But it shouldn't be a problem.

343
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,210
Just put it on the market.

344
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,390
I'll be there when the new owner moves in.

345
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,390
I'll mark the apartment at 6.6 million.

346
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,710
When buyers appear,

347
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,160
you'll decide everything

348
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:27,620
about the transaction and price. Is it okay?

349
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:35,910
Stop the car.

350
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:43,680
-Just go. Bye!
-Don't forget your coffee!

351
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,610
-Bye.
-Bye.

352
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,060
What's up?

353
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:55,960
Yingzi.

354
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,440
I heard that you and Qiu Hua

355
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,120
are investigating a murder case.

356
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,000
It's pro bono work.

357
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,280
So what if it's pro bono?

358
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,830
It should be taken seriously just the same.

359
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,790
Can I join you?

360
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,980
Well,

361
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,670
our job is to write a defense and check

362
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:11,150
if the facts align with the allegations.

363
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,520
You shouldn't be bothered with that.

364
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,840
Aren't you on Mr. Tao's team?

365
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,090
You should talk to him instead.

366
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,140
Mr. Tao's cases are so boring.

367
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,060
Besides, I can't stand

368
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,660
those calculating lawyers.

369
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:22,280
Please let me join you.

370
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,120
Ms. Qiu.

371
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:26,910
Welcome back.

372
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,220
You must be exhausted.

373
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,570
How's it going?

374
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,940
I plan to sell an apartment.

375
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,000
Do you want coffee?

376
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,290
No. I'll have some milk later.

377
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,470
Well,

378
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,710
I haven't figured out

379
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,410
if there are other loaners.

380
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,540
Is selling an apartment good enough to pay the debt?

381
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,790
It's more complicated than that.

382
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,830
Haven't I told you

383
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:52,050
I own two apartments?

384
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,290
One was bought after I married my husband.

385
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,000
And,

386
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,560
the one I'm selling now

387
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,640
was bought before I married him.

388
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,970
It's paid by my parents.

389
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:07,170
You should sell everything you both owned.

390
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,890
Keep the cash to yourself.

391
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,420
There might be debts you haven't discovered.

392
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,420
I just hope he has some mercy on me.

393
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,349
Do you have any clues

394
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,630
about the case?

395
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,170
I didn't talk to Wang Dafu's wife.

396
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,170
I interviewed the people in their village

397
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,730
and the nearby area.

398
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:28,079
But I couldn't find anything useful.

399
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,900
Ms. Luo,

400
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,720
I don't think

401
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,510
we can pull this off.

402
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,100
We won't find anything.

403
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,320
Now you're in deep trouble.

404
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,770
You don't need one more distraction.

405
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,500
We've done everything we could.

406
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,100
Just call me Yingzi.

407
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:47,710
You've missed a few days' work.

408
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,710
Mr. Han is quite dissatisfied with you.

409
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,010
He went around our department,

410
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,600
asking what you were doing.

411
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,550
You should come up with an explanation.

412
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,640
I'm going back to work then.

413
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:04,710
By the way,

414
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,820
I looked into Wang Dafu's story

415
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,300
about getting a ride home.

416
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,230
I found there's no surveillance camera

417
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,990
in the illegally operated vans there.

418
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,020
I also asked the people

419
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,990
working in the vans along that route.

420
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:19,720
The ticket sellers said they never saw Wang Dafu.

421
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:20,790
However, I found something.

422
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,950
They only focus on selling tickets,

423
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,450
and pay no attention to the passengers.

424
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
I stayed in one of those vans for some time.

425
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,590
Then I asked the ticket seller again.

426
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,340
Guess what?

427
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,500
The seller didn't remember you at all.

428
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:33,790
I get it.

429
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,150
I'm leaving then.

430
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,280
Don't forget to explain to Mr. Han.

431
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:45,790
Come in.

432
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,560
Mr. Han.

433
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,990
In recent days,

434
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:05,050
are you still working on Wang Dafu's case?

435
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:05,470
Yes.

436
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,780
Isn't Qiu Hua doing it for you?

437
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,420
I have asked her for a favor.

438
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,810
Have you found what you wanted?

439
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:18,190
You were right in the first place, Mr. Han.

440
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,650
I couldn't find anything.

441
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,050
What did I tell you?

442
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,990
In order to survive,

443
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,540
those people wouldn't loathe to do anything.

444
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,950
Now there's only 3 days left.

445
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,750
Write a defense and turn it in.

446
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,550
Yes.

447
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,020
Thank you for this.

448
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,010
No problem.

449
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,120
[Statement of Defense]

450
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
5 to 6 hours...

451
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,070
A time slot of 5 to 6 hours...

452
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,070
A lot of things could happen

453
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,610
in 5 to 6 hours.

454
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,670
Isn't it a reasonable doubt?

455
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,210
Who do you think you are, Yingzi?

456
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,190
You don't know if you can save yourself,

457
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,230
let alone others.

458
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,140
Do you fancy yourself as a heroine?

459
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,260
Just write a defense and hand it over.

460
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:25,660
Ms. Qiu.

461
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,880
What's up?

462
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,050
It's about the case.

463
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,720
I still

464
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,330
can't let it go.

465
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,150
Suppose Wang Dafu did lie,

466
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,800
how was it possible for him to make up so many details?

467
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,060
So I don't think he fabricated the story.

468
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,140
I can't

469
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:49,100
persuade myself

470
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,370
not to do something about it.

471
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,430
I keep working on it

472
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,870
not just for Wang Dafu,

473
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,790
but also for myself.

474
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,810
My family is a mess now.

475
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,730
I'm in hot water.

476
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,540
I haven't delivered good performance at work.

477
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:07,040
What kind of law firm

478
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,950
will ever hire me in the future?

479
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,060
Ms. Qiu,

480
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:12,800
can you

481
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,900
be with me again as I make another attempt?

482
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,220
Wait a second.

483
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,670
Mr. Han,

484
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,890
I want to ask for a leave and go out.

485
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,130
Go ahead.

486
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:28,870
Okay.

487
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,970
Do you want to use my car?

488
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,490
No, no.

489
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:34,550
Thank you.

490
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,360
Qiu Hua.

491
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,640
No need to drive your car. Let's use mine.

492
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,750
I don't have a car.

493
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:44,660
You don't?

494
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,790
How did you travel there in the past 3 days?

495
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,790
I rode a shared bike.

496
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,790
I took a bus, too.

497
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,270
It would only cost a few yuan each day.

498
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,670
Come on. Let's use my car.

499
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,680
Why didn't you tell me

500
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,080
you rode all the way to such a distant place?

501
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
Telling you wouldn't make any difference.

502
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,310
Yingzi,

503
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,190
are you leaving to work on the murder case?

504
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:12,900
Take me with you.

505
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,700
No, we aren't.

506
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,910
Then where are you going?

507
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,680
We're going to the court to get subpoenas.

508
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,100
Are you coming along?

509
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,760
No.

510
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,660
Bye bye!

511
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,470
What's wrong with her?

512
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,050
Maybe she's too bored.

513
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,930
Knowing that we have a murder case,

514
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,190
she wants to tag along.

515
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,960
She finds her comfortable life quite plain,

516
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,080
so she wants to spice it up.

517
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,480
We'd better stay away from her.

518
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,230
She is the golden girl

519
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,470
that several departments try to get hold of.

520
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,550
If we get too close to her,

521
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,870
people will read into that.

522
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,750
Don't worry.

523
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,760
We are not kindergarten teachers.

524
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:50,780
Let's go.

525
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,970
Your husband borrowed money from others

526
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,700
and you didn't know about that?

527
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,520
I didn't.

528
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,510
But I can see from this loan of 800,000 yuan

529
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,710
that he kept paying the interest

530
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,070
until he didn't.

531
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:10,070
That's why the debt collectors showed up.

532
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,210
If there are other debts,

533
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,270
I guess those are similar to this one.

534
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,870
In that case,

535
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,680
more debt collectors will come to me.

536
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,240
That's annoying.

537
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,870
I'm not judging you.

538
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,390
You're a legal practitioner.

539
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,900
Your husband deceived you and ran away.

540
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,660
He even transferred your shared properties.

541
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,190
Then he left you a load of debts.

542
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,740
And now you're telling me you knew nothing.

543
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,700
I really didn't.

544
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,100
I never thought of that.

545
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,670
I was too silly.

546
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,830
To be honest, over these days,

547
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,720
I feel my life has become such an ordeal.

548
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,190
My world is turned upside down.

549
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:49,510
I never thought

550
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,780
that he would cheat on me.

551
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,790
What's worse,

552
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,850
he cheated on me with my best friend.

553
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,290
On top of that,

554
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,430
he even secretly transferred

555
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,830
our shared properties.

556
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,360
Adding to that,

557
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,020
unexpectedly,

558
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,170
he owed so many debts.

559
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,850
I lived with my husband under the same roof.

560
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:11,300
I saved my best friend from crisis.

561
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,650
Then they decided to turn against me.

562
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,710
That's why people say

563
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,520
human nature is unpredictable like an ocean.

564
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,470
If you have met Liu Ming,

565
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,230
you would think of him

566
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,850
as a simple and honest person,

567
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,630
you know.

568
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,480
Ha-ha.

569
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,140
I know what you mean.

570
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,430
That is, I'm tricked by a regular guy.

571
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,420
That's what I don't understand.

572
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,780
I've gotta see him in person,

573
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,180
and hear what he says.

574
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,040
Otherwise,

575
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,470
this puzzle will stick forever in my head.

576
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,990
Let me tell you something funny.

577
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,420
Do you know

578
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,830
how that woman met my husband?

579
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,250
How?

580
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,550
I introduced them to each other.

581
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:06,180
Now I feel like

582
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,040
punching myself in the face.

583
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,320
I keep telling myself,

584
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,590
sooner or later,

585
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:14,040
I'll find them out

586
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,150
and make them

587
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,540
pay for all my losses.

588
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,010
Madam,

589
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,760
can I ask you something?

590
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,720
In July last year,

591
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,780
was there any wedding in the village?

592
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,130
It's been over a year.

593
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,880
How am I supposed to remember that?

594
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,270
Now young people

595
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:39,670
don't hold weddings in rural places.

596
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,660
Thank you.

597
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,740
You're welcome.

598
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:44,550
Sir, do you recall anything?

599
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,030
No.

600
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,000
I'll ask the people ahead.

601
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,450
Okay.

602
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,740
Hello. Can I ask you something?

603
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,180
In July last year, did any young people

604
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,340
hold weddings in the village?

605
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,240
Now only old people like us

606
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,900
choose to stay in the village.

607
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,380
There aren't young people around.

608
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,420
-No.
-Thank you.

609
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,040
No one.

610
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,980
There are two more villages to go.

611
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,300
We'll continue interviewing the villagers.

612
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,810
I'll give up if there's no result.

613
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,560
I've asked the people in those two villages.

614
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,620
Their answer is no.

615
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,730
Ms. Qiu,

616
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,570
are you hungry?

617
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:12,590
Let's have lunch.

618
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:14,540
Ms. Qiu,

619
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,790
how long have you worked for the firm?

620
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,230
Two years.

621
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,130
I thought you graduated several years ago.

622
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,030
I did graduate several years ago.

623
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,290
I worked elsewhere before I got this job.

624
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,150
It was a two-bit law firm

625
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,270
near the city train station.

626
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,950
I worked there for a year.

627
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,960
That small law firm gave away fliers

628
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,270
in front of courthouses and snatched cases.

629
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:42,860
One time, I competed against Mr. Han.

630
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:46,230
But instead of holding a grudge,

631
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,340
he took me in.

632
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,050
He's got a good eye for talented people.

633
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,250
He treats you so well.

634
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,460
I...

635
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,980
I always think of you

636
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,610
as a competent lawyer.

637
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,570
You're smart,

638
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,110
and better than many others in our firm.

639
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,680
This line of work

640
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,840
isn't something poor people like me should dabble in.

641
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
Don't sell yourself short.

642
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,490
Aren't you already in this line of work?

643
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,950
Plus, you're doing great.

644
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,950
Do you think being a lawyer is just about

645
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,330
being skillful and literate in law?

646
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,070
Lawyers must have their own resources,

647
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,670
and the ability to get cases.

648
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,660
What's more, a lawyer can't appear shabby.

649
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,750
A lawyer must have a nice car,

650
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,760
and nice outfits,

651
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,670
not to mention paying the tab after eating with a client.

652
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,470
I wouldn't mind

653
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,920
telling you that I ride shared bikes.

654
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,480
But if clients know that,

655
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,230
they wouldn't hire me at all.

656
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,550
What's not good about bikes?

657
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,410
It's just like any other vehicle.

658
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,990
Hello.

659
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,120
This is Luo Yingzi.

660
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,110
What?

661
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,070
You must be tired.

662
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,110
Eat something.

663
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,130
I know. I know.

664
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,890
Thank you.

665
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,610
That's quite fast.

666
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,240
What's up?

667
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,900
It's a call from my realtor.

668
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,170
As you know, I'm selling an apartment to pay the debt.

669
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,300
The realtor has helped me find a buyer.

670
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,400
But we've got two more villagers to visit.

671
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,510
How am I supposed to meet the buyer?

672
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,990
This is maddening.

673
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,900
Yingzi, a new idea just popped into my head.

674
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,390
Funerals and weddings are important events.

675
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:32,850
We've forgotten about the funerals, right?

676
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,760
Usually, for old people's funerals,

677
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,940
there would be musical instrument players.

678
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,780
Ms. Qiu,

679
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,380
you're so smart. Let's go.

680
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,110
Bear with me.

681
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:44,700
Hello, I'm on my way to meet the buyer,

682
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,560
but there's a traffic jam.

683
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:48,690
I'll be two hours late, at least.

684
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:50,810
Can you ask the buyer to wait for a bit?

685
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:53,280
I'll be there as soon as possible.

686
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,550
Alright. Let's eat.

687
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,810
We'll continue with the work after this.

688
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,480
You can leave if you have to.

689
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,570
I can visit those villages by myself.

690
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,320
It's okay.

691
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,630
True buyers wouldn't mind waiting a while.

692
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:05,410
He can wait.

693
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,490
Yingzi, you just don't care much, do you?

694
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,110
Sir,

695
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,470
how much for the noodles?

696
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,540
What a lousy driver!

697
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,470
He knew he couldn't get through.

698
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,280
Why didn't he stop?

699
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
771.

700
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,630
Here comes my nemesis.

701
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,630
Ms. Qiu, give me a minute.

702
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,130
Okay.

703
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,790
Look, we meet up again.

704
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,340
We bump into each other so often.

705
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,230
It makes me wonder if you're wooing me.

706
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,150
How come you appear everywhere I go,

707
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:46,620
Ms. Luo?

708
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,450
I was just about to ask you, 771.

709
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,030
Tell me,

710
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,760
are you stalking me, pervert?

711
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,530
If that's true,

712
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,820
my aesthetic perspective must be crooked.

713
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,300
Right.

714
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,880
Greedy men like you can't appreciate beauty.

715
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,670
Anyway,

716
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,390
why must you stand in my way?

717
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,540
Did someone drop a penny there?

718
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:02,270
Couldn't you let me go first?

719
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,890
Why couldn't I be the one to go

720
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,840
before you?

721
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:07,430
What are you here for?

722
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,120
For your client. That's what.

723
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,680
Now I'm trying hard

724
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,300
to persuade the victim's family

725
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,700
to withdraw the request of a death penalty.

726
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:16,240
I didn't know that's a way to practice law.

727
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,790
You represent the plaintiff,

728
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:20,150
but you care about the defendant's interest.

729
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:21,280
I have a conscience.

730
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,090
You should be glad that no one else hears it

731
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,600
so I'm the only one to be disgusted by you.

732
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,330
I don't care if you believe it or not.

733
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,900
What about you? What are you doing here?

734
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,120
Are you really looking for evidence?

735
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,380
No. I'm looking for monkeys.

736
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,190
There's one right before my eyes.

737
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,530
You've seen the monkey you want.

738
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:36,670
What about the evidence you seek for?

739
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,270
It has nothing to do with you.

740
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,230
Come on. Move your car and let me go.

741
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,330
Just one more thing.

742
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,190
You really should give up.

743
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,610
The trial will begin soon.

744
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,180
You can't find any evidence.

745
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,760
Save that trash talk for yourself.

746
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,230
Reverse your car, now.

747
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,120
What a smug!

748
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,810
He still has to reverse his car in the end.

749
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,570
He and Mr. Han

750
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,720
will make two arch rivals, won't they?

751
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,970
What do you think will happen

752
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,970
if they meet up?

753
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,090
Who's gonna be a worse villain?

754
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,430
They were opposing counsels in two trials.

755
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,430
How did those end?

756
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,870
Mr. Han lost both trials.

757
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,470
Even Mr. Han has lost to this guy?

758
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,800
It means this guy's a worse villain.

759
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:22,390
Good.

760
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,310
Later in court, I'll see what's he got.

761
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,770
Crazy woman.

762
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:03,560
Mr. Qin.

763
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,620
Mr. Chen.

764
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,970
How's my sister's case going?

765
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,220
Not quite satisfactory.

766
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,730
God knows why I hired you.

767
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:15,710
Look,

768
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,820
you ask for 500,000 yuan.

769
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,300
But the truth is you can barely get 400,000.

770
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,160
How about this?

771
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,780
Let's lower it to 200,000.

772
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,040
If they give us 200,000, we'll write them

773
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,280
a letter of understanding. How's that?

774
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,550
200,000?

775
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,160
Is a living soul only worth 200,000 yuan?

776
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,050
Mr. Qin,

777
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:35,310
if you did love your little sister,

778
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,330
you wouldn't have made her drop out

779
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,650
of middle school and sent her to work.

780
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:40,540
[Family of the victim Mr. Qin]

781
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,740
Plus,

782
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,820
look at this nice front yard

783
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,960
and the beautiful house.

784
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,990
I guess

785
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:46,830
she bought you all these nice things, right?

786
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:47,810
Mr. Chen,

787
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,870
what do you mean by that?

788
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,700
Her parents died when she was little.

789
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,890
The two of us raised her up.

790
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,880
[Family of the victim Mrs. Qin]

791
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,170
Then she grew up and started making money.

792
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,000
Shouldn't she give us some every year?

793
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,240
She should, for sure.

794
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,770
Besides,

795
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,110
when she was alive,

796
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,990
every year she sent home more money

797
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,930
than what you suggest us settle for.

798
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:08,090
200,000 won't do.

799
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,390
Shut up!

800
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,980
Mr. Chen, is the defendant

801
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,980
trying to deny us of what we deserve?

802
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,220
They pretend to be poor, don't they?

803
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,680
I used to think they were lying about it.

804
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
But they weren't.

805
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,230
The defendant may be sentenced to death.

806
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,640
He couldn't afford an attorney.

807
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,500
So the court assigned one for him.

808
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,910
We want 300,000, at minimum.

809
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,040
250,000.

810
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,820
What about 250,000?

811
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,520
You alone will retain 20,000.

812
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,680
The total number is as small as 250,000.

813
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,310
I'm not taking a lot from you. It's just 8%.

814
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,310
I'm telling you, with this tight budget,

815
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,110
I'm the best lawyer you can find.

816
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,070
Fine. 250,000 it is.

817
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,960
Let me make it clear:

818
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,390
I won't accept anything less than that.

819
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,360
If they offer lower than 250,000,

820
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,060
I'll refuse it,

821
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:45,720
and only aim for his life!

822
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,280
Okay. I'll talk to him.

823
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:50,610
Mrs. Qin,

824
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:52,040
when your sister lived in the city,

825
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,690
besides working for a restaurant,

826
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,150
did she take on other jobs?

827
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:57,890
No.

828
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,010
Do you have a photo of her? I wanna see it.

829
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:02,530
Yes.

830
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,640
Why do you want to see her photo?

831
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,720
I can explain it.

832
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,930
Before taking on a task,

833
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,000
people need to find a motivation.

834
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,060
When I know what she used to look like,

835
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,520
I'll feel sorry for her,

836
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,290
and encourage myself to fight harder. See?

837
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:14,830
I'm gonna...

838
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:16,370
Come on. Look at this.

839
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,750
She was beautiful.

840
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,690
Is 250,000 all that she's worth?

841
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,239
Mrs. Qin, those are two different things.

842
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,949
As for the amount of damages, 250,000 yuan

843
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:26,150
is the best we can get.

844
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,909
[Victim of Wang Dafu's case Qin Ailin]

845
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:35,070
What did she do to earn over 200,000 a year?

846
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,429
She's very pretty,

847
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,090
but she fell in love with Wang Dafu.

848
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,270
That's confusing.

849
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,420
Sir, can I ask you something?

850
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,250
Was there a funeral in July last year

851
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:53,889
in the village?

852
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:54,630
No.

853
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,719
That's odd.

854
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,900
Would someone get bored

855
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,130
and go out

856
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:03,210
to play the woodwinds?

857
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,690
There's another possibility.

858
00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:07,300
No one played those at all.

859
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,640
Wang Dafu made it up.

860
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,470
But I have a hunch

861
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,200
that he's telling the truth.

862
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,190
Shall we go to another village

863
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,030
and interview some more people?

864
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,570
Okay.

865
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,310

869
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,070
Where have you gone?

870
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,590
What did I tell you?

871
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,490
Come back to the office now.

872
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,350

Mr. Han,

874
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,230
I can't go back to the office now.

875

The investigation isn't completed yet.

876
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,430
What is there to investigate?

877
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,600
How do you prove something that never happened?

878
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,690
Come back right now!

00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,390
If this pro bono case goes south,

880
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,460
the law association will admonish me!

881
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,050
Mr. Han, I can explain it.

882
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:51,490
Come back now!

883
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,180

884
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,780
You must be back in two hours.

885
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,030
What?

886
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,740
Mr. Han, are you trying

887
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,490
to obstruct my efforts to find the truth?

888
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,810
The law association may not admonish you,

889
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,870
but I'll definitely lodge a complaint

890
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:05,030
that you neglect your duty in pro bono cases.

891
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,060
I'm telling you

892
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,560
that I can't go back right now.

893
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,960
You do whatever you want!

894
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,430
Yingzi,

895
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,180
you have a really bad temper.

896
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,450
It's bold of you to talk to him like that.

897
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,890
No one in the department dares to do so.

898
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,900
I couldn't help it.

899
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:25,490
You see,

900
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,530
he was rude on the phone.

901
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,120
I don't care.

902
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,760
I don't rely on him for financial support.

903
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,290
Let's go.

904
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:39,740
Sir, your wife passed away last year, right?

905
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,820
Yes. In mid July, last year.

906
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:46,030
Did you hire instrument players?

907
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,060
Yes.

908
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,870
Did one of them play the woodwinds?

909
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,630
Yes. He was good.

910
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,630
Is he

911
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,430
a villager here?

912
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,240
No, he's not.

913
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,010
He's from a nearby village.

914
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,460
Everyone here knows about him.

915
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,670
He's an outstanding player.

916
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,110
What's his name?

917
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:02,510
Who is it?

918
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,310
Hello!

919
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,530
I'm getting the door!

920
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,500
Hello.

921
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:09,860
Are you Mr. Liang,

00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,150
leader of an instrument players' group?

923
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,020
Yes.

924
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,200
I finally found you.

925
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,090
Mr. Liang, we are...

926
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,640
On that day, after the funeral,

927
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,430
the employer treated us to a meal.

928
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,430
When we were done eating,

929
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,420
I guess it was over 3 o'clock.

930
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:26,620
Between Dawang Village and this place,

931
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,970
there's a hill, right?

932
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,270
On the hill there's an orchard.

933
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,830
Did you take the path at the foot of the hill?

934
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,320
We sure did.

935
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:38,380
Do you remember

936
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,280
when you arrived at the foot of the hill?

937
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,390
We set out from Dawang Village at about 3.

938
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:45,650
I guess

939
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,450
it was over 4 o'clock

940
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,810
when we got there.

941
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,410
Slightly over 4 o'clock.

942
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,050
When you got to the foot of the hill,

943
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:54,730
did you play the woodwinds?

944
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,170
How... How do you know that?

945
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,490
You did play the woodwinds, right?

946
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,390
Yes, I did.

947
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,830
Shall we play?

948
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:04,350
Sure thing!

949
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:05,320
Do you remember

950
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,000
what song you played?

951
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,470
Our hard work has finally paid off.

952
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,060
We found a witness.

953
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,770
The credit is yours, Ms. Qiu.

954
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
The first time I saw you,

955
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,250
I knew you were no ordinary lawyer.

956
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,220
Why?

957
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,980
A dog that bites doesn't bark.

958
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,110
I'm the opposite.

959
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,680
If someone hurts me with a needle,

960
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,480
I'll yell, jump and fight back with a knife.

961
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:36,010
Do you know the other half of that proverb?

962
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,810
A dog that barks doesn't bite. That's me.

963
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:42,720
Yingzi,

964
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,270
do you really not worry?

965
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,550
What's to worry about?

966
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,380
You're in deep trouble.

967
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,690
I can spend my day crying or smiling.

968
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
I choose to smile as long as I can.

969
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,430
Oh. Look.

970
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,210
This is what wipes the smile off my face.

971
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,260
Hello.

972
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,440
Ms. Luo, where are you?

973
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,410
Sorry. I'm still stuck in the traffic.

974
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,790
Is someone gonna buy it already?

975
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:22,170
Doesn't the buyer want to take a look?

976
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:23,700
Ms. Qiu.

977
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:24,740
Well,

978
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:26,450
he said if you come here now,

979
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,200
he would finish the transaction right away.

980
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,250
That's great.

981
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,190
Have you told him

982
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,160
the details about the department?

983
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:36,720
Not yet.

984
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,190
Ms. Luo,

985
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,610
do I have to tell him now?

986
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:41,640
You can't conceal the truth from him.

987
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,590
Can you give the phone to the buyer?

988
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,430
I'll talk to him.

989
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,120
Sir,

990
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,950
the seller would like to tell you

991
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,000
some information about the apartment.

992
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,060
Such an honest seller is rarely seen.

993
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,640
Why is buying an apartment so complicated?

994
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,420
What's with your apartment?

995
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,820
Wait. Your voice

996
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,000
sounds familiar.

997
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,990
Do I know you?

998
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,170
Is your family name Zhou?

999
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,270
Who are you?

1000
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,080
Have you forgotten me?

1001
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,430
A loan of 800,000, remember?

1002
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,890
I met you at your company the day before.

1003
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,840
We had a talk.

1004
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,410
I'm Ms. Luo.

1005
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:24,990
Ms. Luo from Lingnan?

1006
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:25,720
Yes.

1007
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:29,790
Are you really selling your apartment?

1008
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,080
Mr. Zhou,

1009
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,590
I've made you a promise,

1010
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,530
and I'll keep it.

1011
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:37,740
Mr. Zhou, I bet now you wouldn't worry

1012
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,700
about the debt I owe you, would you?

1013
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,730
Mr. Zhou, it's such a pleasant surprise

1014
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,860
that you're the buyer of my apartment.

1015
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:46,440
Why don't you wait a little longer?

1016
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:48,210
I'm on my way back.

1017
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:49,510
There's a traffic jam.

1018
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,340
Is it okay?

1019
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,650
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

1020
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,430
Bye.

1021
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,850
Have you put the apartment on the market?

1022
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:56,530
Yes.

1023
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,110
What a coincidence it is!

1024
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,100
The buyer

1025
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,590
happens to be my creditor.

1026
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,950
Come on. Get in the car.

1027
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,740
We need to go now.

1028
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,420
I've got a meeting.

1029
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,010
When you were on the phone,

1030
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,850
a truck went by.

1031
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,480
Somewhere nearby must be under construction.

1032
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,740
That's probably where the truck is used.

1033
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,430
This case has been going on for a year.

1034
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,410
Even if the construction's done,

1035
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,680
it's still easy to find out what vehicles were used.

1036
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,970
You should go and handle your thing.

1037
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,580
I'll go up there and ask around.

1038
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,580
Where did the truck go?

1039
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,930
It turned right at the intersection.

1040
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,730
But...

1041
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,920
There's no car,

1042
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:30,030
or a shared bike.

1043
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,160
How do you get there?

1044
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,610
I guess I can find a bus stop over there.

1045
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,490
Don't worry about me.

1046
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:35,520
Get back to your own thing.

1047
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,720
It's more important.

1048
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,080
Ms. Qiu, thank you.

1049
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,350
I'm really sorry.

1050
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,700
I've got an urgent matter to attend to.

1051
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,940
No worries.

1052
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,350
I know you're running out of time.

1053
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:43,990
Mr. Han

1054
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,550
wants a statement of defense right now.

1055
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,680
You should go.

1056
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,410
Drive safe. I'm leaving.

1057
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,300
Take care.

1058
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:50,880
Okay.

1059
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,770
Is the bus stop over there?

1060
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:54,170
Yes.

1061
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:54,800
Thank you.

1062
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,950
I didn't kill her.

1063
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,360
I'm innocent.

1064
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,470
Wait. Don't go away, counsel!

1065
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,160
Hello, Mr. Li?

1066
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,780
Can you put Mr. Zhou on the phone?

1067
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,480
I have something to say to him.

1068
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,650
Why are you still here?

1069
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:40,900
Go and do your thing. I'm all good.

1070
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,160
It's okay. This is more urgent than mine.

1071
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,840
We're trying to rescue a life here.

1072
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,710
It's okay. I'll be fine no matter what.

1073
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:47,600
Get in the car.

1074
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,550
Hurry up!

1075
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:50,510
We'gotta catch up with the truck. Hurry!

1076
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:51,540
Fasten your seat belt.
