[Episode 24]

4
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,300
Why are you back so early?

5
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,740
What are you doing?

6
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,060
Well...

7
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,310
My boyfriend is here.

8
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,140
Why don't you...

9
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,539
Come back later!

[Zhang Quanquan]

11
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,630
Hello?

12
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:35,829
Qiu Hua.

13
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,300
I called you several times,

14
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,520
but you didn't answer any one of them.

15
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:43,520
I just started to take cases recently.

16
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,650
I was a little busy at work, so I seldom checked my phone.

17
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,550
What's up?

18
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,740
Where are you?

19
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,590
Your mom just called me.

20
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,510
Can we meet?

21
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,170
Qiu Hua.

22
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,530
I didn't mean anything.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,390
Since we're both fellow townsmen

24
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,340
from Jingbei,

25
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,270
I'd like to have a chat with you.

26
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,540
And we can take care of each other.

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,160
Where are you?

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,240
Here.

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,840
The dishes are getting cold.

30
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,660
Come on.

31
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,210
Why did you order so many dishes?

32
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,740
Didn't I tell you I've had my meal?

33
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,340
Have some more!

34
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,260
-It's too many. -You can leave them there if you've had your meal.

35
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,790
I can't eat them all anyway.

36
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,090
It's a waste.

37
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,910
Did you really have your meal?

38
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,010
Yes.

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,380
I had it with my friends at the food stall.

40
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,630
I remember our childhood.

41
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,829
Every time I brought you food from my home,

42
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,270
you said you had had your meal.

43
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,829
You always said you did.

44
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,270
I don't know if you did

45
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,110
or did not.

46
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,560
We were still in middle school

47
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:55,990
in our town back then.

48
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,030
You were the focus

49
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,460
in the school.

50
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,990
Forget about it.

51
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,790
They liked to flatter me.

52
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,170
I didn't care about them at all.

53
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,440
I only cared about you.

54
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,610
There you go again. Eat up.

55
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,240
The dishes are getting cold.

56
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,990
Qiu Hua.

57
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,150
How's your work?

58
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,760
Good. How about you?

59
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,720
Me too.

60
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,520
Are you going to work in Jingbei alone?

61
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,030
Yeah.

62
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,600
Do you like Jingbei?

63
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,470
It's not about liking it or not.

64
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,240
We've studied so hard for so many years

65
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,550
just to come here.

66
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,070
Why?

67
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,080
I don't like this place.

68
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,470
I think people here

69
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,730
are too snobbish.

70
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,390
The word may not be accurate.

71
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,350
It's...

72
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,710
I think this place lacks the human touch.

73
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,110
Unlike our neighborhood,

74
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,170
the people there know each other and take care of each other.

75
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,430
I always feel that being alone in Jingbei

76
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,910
stresses me out.

77
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,350
It makes me homesick.

78
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,170
Then you should go back.

79
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,830
Let's go back together.

80
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,250
You know, I came to Jingbei

81
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,310
because of you.

82
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,350
And my dad said

83
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,700
as long as we go back together,

84
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,140
he'll find us a job.

85
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,480
I won't go back.

86
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,070
I don't need your dad to arrange a job for me.

87
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,560
Instead,

88
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,050
I think you need it.

89
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,900
Since your dad hasn't retired,

90
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,470
you can have more chances to get promoted if you're back in your hometown, right?

91
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,280
You know I'm not doing this for work.

92
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,930
-It's because of us... -I understood. I understood.

93
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,470
I know what you mean.

94
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,030
I don't think it's necessary for you to do this for me.

95
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,910
And I think, in the case of our personalities,

96
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,470
since we were young...

97
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,110
Enough.

98
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,190
Stop.

99
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,400
If you don't go back,

100
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,460
I'll stay with you.

101
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,560
Here, have another shrimp.

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,490
You should take it.

103
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,820
Have some French fries.

104
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:20,350
By the way, my dad asked me to tell you

105
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,790
that your little brother got a job.

106
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,070
Your dad arranged a job for my brother?

107
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:28,580
You didn't know?

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,110
I didn't.

109
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,850
What job did he find?

110
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,260
When did that happen?

111
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,710
A job as a security guard at the county government.

112
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,040
I need to use the bathroom.

113
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:55,750
Over there.

114
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,650
Over there.

115
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,580
Hello, Mom.

116
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,470
County Mayor Zhang arranged a job for my brother?

117
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,790
Why did you ask him for help

118
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,710
without telling me about it?

119
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,470
He's a county mayor.

120
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,390
Why should he help us?

121
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,850
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

122
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,870
Now that you've accepted his help,

123
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,530
how are you going to repay him?

124
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,790
Hua,

125
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,320
you did something, didn't you?

126
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,550
You did something,

127
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,010
so you don't care about your family anymore?

128
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,480
You're alone outside,

129
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,030
living a good life.

130
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,790
You don't care about your siblings?

131
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,590
Do you know how you made it to get out of Jingbei?

132
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,030
I know.

133
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:55,900
I don't dare to spend another penny

134
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,710
of my monthly salary.

135
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,990
I've sent all I got back to you except for the part used for my meals.

136
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,920
What else do you want from me?

137
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,900
As the old saying goes,

138
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,270
as one person is enlightened, chickens and dogs ascend to heaven.

139
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,720
Now that you've got out through examinations,

140
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,540
making achievements,

141
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:13,700
do you think it's enough to send money to your family every month?

142
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,590
What about the prospects of your siblings?

143
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,920
You don't care about it?

144
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,370
I'm not that capable.

145
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,080
Besides,

146
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,930
even if my siblings want to come out,

147
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:26,630
I don't have to

148
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,180
trouble County Mayor Zhang!

149
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,030
Can't I think of another way?

150
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,950
Now that you asked him to arrange a job for my brother,

151
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,990
how can you pay him back in the future?

152
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:35,950
We don't have to!

153
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,350
There's no need!

154
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,640
If you marry his son,

155
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,710
we'll be family!

156
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,970
No need to pay him back!

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,540
No matter what the relationship is between us,

158
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,220
please call your dad

159
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,960
and tell him

160
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,750
not to help my family in the future.

161
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,350
It's okay. It's nothing.

162
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,110
You must call him.

163
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,990
Or we can't contact each other

164
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,350
in the future.

165
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,590
I'll call him later.

166
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:55,710
Don't worry.

167
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,470
Also,

168
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,710
I think

169
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:59,910
you are not suitable to work in Jingbei.

170
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,180
Your dad can't help you out here.

171
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,810
You're different from me.

172
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,730
No one will help me wherever I am.

173
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,470
Qiu Hua.

174
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,000
Didn't I tell you?

175
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,410
As long as you go back with me,

176
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,720
my dad will take care of you just as he does to me.

177
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,110
He is...

178
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,190
All I want is to be away from the web of social relationships.

179
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,190
That's why I stay here.

180
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,110
Do you understand?

181
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,790
How many times have I told you?

182
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,360
Understood.

183
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,040
As long as you don't go back,

184
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,060
I won't go back.

185
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,580
Hello?

186
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,080
Mrs. Luo, you haven't come to work yet.

187
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,680
Mr. Han is looking for you.

188
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,590
Tell him I'm dead.

189
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,380
Unreasonable.

190
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,470
Ms. Qiu!

191
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,530
Mr. Han invited you to his office.

192
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,650
Thank you.

193
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,690
Mr. Han, you want to see me?

194
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,300
I heard the case didn't go well, right?

195
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:42,510
Not bad.

196
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,630
Not bad.

197
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,000
Sexual harassment?

198
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,430
It's not that easy.

199
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,540
What can you get even if you win?

200
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,310
Only a fool like you

201
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,910
would do such a stupid thing.

202
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,560
Anything else?

203
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,430
If not, I'll go back to work.

204
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,110
What?

205
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:16,090
I've thought about it.

206
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,400
You've done a lot of work with me this year.

207
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,360
I know you need money.

208
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,710
These cases

209
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,250
are the most profitable ones I have.

210
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,150
I'll give them all to you.

211
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,170
Any condition?

212
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,940
Yeah,

213
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,990
delete all the recordings in front of me.

214
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:56,430
[Comprehensive Building]

215
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,950
Ms. Mei, I'm leaving.

216
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,360
Goodbye, Ms. Mei.

217
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,110
Bye.

218
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,510
Ms. Mei.

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,710
What's up?

220
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,740
The sexual harassment case isn't going well.

221
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,030
The only witness

222
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,430
is the lawyer of our law firm

223
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,630
who is unwilling to testify unless he's paid.

224
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,510
It's very likely

225
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,770
that even my client is going to back down.

226
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,590
Ms. Mei,

227
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,310
why is the reality so cruel?

228
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,590
Do you know how hard it is for me and Qiu Hua?

229
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,630
In this case,

230
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,110
we've suffered a lot.

231
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,230
We just started to take cases,

232
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:50,360
without even solving our basic needs.

233
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,160
Finally,

234
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,510
here's a profitable case.

235
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,590
It's a patent case.

236
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,920
Neither of us studied the patent law.

237
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,590
For the sake of this case,

238
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,470
we are almost forced

239
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,110
to be a patent law expert.

240
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,930
But now we have a sexual harassment case.

241
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,330
So we gave the patent case

242
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,070
to someone else.

243
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,630
But what did we get in the end?

244
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,710
The reality is so ironic.

245
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:18,730
Who on earth

246
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,990
did you take this sexual harassment case for?

247
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,390
For my client, of course.

248
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,990
It has been present since the dawn of time.

249
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,870
There are many people being harassed.

250
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,240
What do they have to do with you?

251
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,600
We are their attorney agents.

252
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,600
If your client doesn't need you,

253
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,510
she'll be a stranger to you.

254
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,470
What does she have to do with you?

255
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,110
Lawyers take cases

256
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,990
for their own sake.

257
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,320
You gave up the money-making case

258
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:08,110
to take the laborious one.

259
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,020
Isn't it for what you pursue,

260
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,170
for the idealism?

261
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,130
Think about it.

262
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:21,800
Let go of this case

263
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,940
and see if you can get over it.

264
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,350
If you can, why bother thinking about it?

265
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,300
It has nothing to do with you.

266
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,910
If you can't,

267
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,110
you should think of another way.

268
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,440
Even if you suffer a lot,

269
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,970
ending up with nothing,

270
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,000
you deserve it.

271
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,290
Don't complain to others.

272
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,230
Goodbye.

273
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,920
Mrs. Luo! Mrs. Luo!

274
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,430
One of your former clients is here.

275
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,300
She's in the meeting room. Ms. Qiu is receiving her.

276
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,900
Who is it?

277
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,790
Guo Yu.

278
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,270
You might as well give up.

279
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,880
People like us

280
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,990
have no right to make hopeless efforts.

281
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,619
Ms. Qiu,

282
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,500
we're the same.

283
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,270
Yes.

284
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,680
I'm a few years older than you.

285
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,280
I came to this city a few years earlier than you.

286
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,770
So,

287
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,140
I understand what you've been through.

288
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:34,750
I know

289
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,970
no one in this city can help us.

290
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,060
We can't afford to pay that much.

291
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,870
Ms. Qiu,

292
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,530
can I call you sister?

293
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,160
Of course.

294
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,710
Sister,

295
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,190
what would you do

296
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,510
if you were me?

297
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,640
Guo Yu.

298
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,390
Mrs. Luo.

299
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,350
Ms. Qiu has told you about the situation, right?

300
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,070
We don't have any witnesses.

301
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,390
She told me.

302
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,510
So why are you here today?

303
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,950
My parents have been here these days.

304
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,810
So I didn't have time to come over.

305
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,300
But I still want to file a lawsuit.

306
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,070
A lawsuit is based on evidence.

307
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,200
Without evidence,

308
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:55,630
your grievances would end up in nothing.

309
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,560
But it is a fact.

310
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,230
Yes, I believe it is.

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,360
But,

312
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:03,230
when you're in front of everyone

313
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,470
before the court,

314
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,810
you need to prove it's a fact with evidence.

315
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,250
Otherwise, it's not.

316
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,330
But it is a fact!

317
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,070
I know!

318
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,440
You know it too!

319
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,940
It absolutely happened!

320
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:18,360
That's your business to prove it!

321
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,930
Guo Yu.

322
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:24,310
Calm down.

323
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,260
Calm down.

324
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,960
Can you tell us

325
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,430
why you insist?

326
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,070
Do you know how I've lived these days?

327
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,230
My parents saw the news online.

328
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:45,270
In fact, they live in the countryside

329
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:46,920
without any access to the information online.

330
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,240
Someone deliberately told them.

331
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,390
They were terrified.

332
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,940
They've never gone far away from home.

333
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,990
They are reluctant to spend money

334
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,550
but bought tickets to Jingbei

335
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:02,430
to stop me.

336
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,750
They scolded me for being ungrateful.

337
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,700
They scolded me for being ignorant,

338
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,480
saying that I would lose.

339
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,340
They even said...

340
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,640
They even said

341
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,630
that it's not like I'll lose my flesh

342
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,370
because of it.

343
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:26,800
It's just several touches. You can just put up with it.

344
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,620
How can they say that to their daughter?

345
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,060
That's how they've lived their whole lives.

346
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,070
Bowing down to powerful men.

347
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,650
They would run away when something happens.

348
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,350
But they don't know

349
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,840
what they said to me

350
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:49,470
forced me to make a decision.

351
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,190
I was thinking

352
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,310
if

353
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,380
I still live a life like before,

354
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,770
then what's the meaning of studying outside my hometown?

355
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,130
I can just live a routine life.

356
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,790
When I reach a certain age,

357
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:05,240
I'll marry someone and raise several kids.

358
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,470
Isn't it my whole life?

359
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:10,240
But after I finished my studies,

360
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,790
I've got to know the world.

361
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,210
I know people shouldn't live like that.

362
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,420
I finally finished my studies

363
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,430
and have broadened my horizons.

364
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,170
I can't go back, pretending everything's unchanged.

365
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,140
So I want to file the lawsuit!

366
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,440
We both understand you.

367
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,090
But we don't have any witnesses or evidence.

368
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,750
If there are witnesses and evidence,

369
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,190
everything can be settled.

370
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,750
No.

371
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,640
Mrs. Luo and Ms. Qiu.

372
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,080
Why do you still not understand?

373
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,950
Winning or losing

374
00:21:57,990 --> 00:21:59,310
doesn't depend on me.

375
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,430
It's my own business to file the lawsuit or not!

376
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,550
I have to give myself an explanation.

377
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,530
Let's do it.

378
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:13,150
How?

379
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,870
Since she's not afraid of losing, there's nothing we should be afraid of.

380
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,510
Besides,

381
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,940
didn't Ms. Fang remind us

382
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:23,590
that we might not find the key evidence?

383
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,660
Okay. Let's do it.

384
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,330
Guo Yu.

385
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,370
Ms. Qiu and I will try our best to find new evidence.

386
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,290
But you have to be prepared to lose the lawsuit.

387
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,190
I know.

388
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,380
I'll bear all the consequences myself.

389
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,230
It has nothing to do with you.

390
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,190
I...

391
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,670
I thought of someone.

392
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,660
But I don't know if she's willing to testify.

393
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,140
Who are you talking about?

394
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,180
Xia Linlin.

395
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:33,460
[Xia Linlin]

396
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,300
This is Ms. Qiu.

397
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,560
This is Mrs. Luo.

398
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,640
Hello. Hello.

399
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,510
Thank you for coming.

400
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,790
Can you talk normally now?

401
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,910
Yes.

402
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,670
I've told Linlin.

403
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:48,810
I heard

404
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,440
you were forced to quit drugs days ago, right?

405
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,380
I came out last week.

406
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,910
This is Linlin's old photo.

407
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,680
Look at the difference now.

408
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
Will you tell us

409
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,580
the truth?

410
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,730
We need to take a video.

411
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,780
Do you have to?

412
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:28,710
We need evidence.

413
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:32,140
We need to record it when you're making your statements.

414
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:32,970
Well...

415
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,170
Xia Linlin.

416
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,390
We're lawyers,

417
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,190
not reporters.

418
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,040
We're only taking a video

419
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:43,430
to prove the authenticity of your testimony to the court.

420
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,390
It won't be used

421
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,620
for other purposes.

422
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,730
Rest assured.

423
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,030
Okay?

424
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,320
Okay, thank you.

425
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,460
Qiu Hua, don't forget to type the timeline.

426
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,140
Okay.

427
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:05,170
Let's begin.

428
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,420
What's your name?

429
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,870
Xia Linlin.

430
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,950
What's your date of birth?

431
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,390
May 19, 1987.

432
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,270
When did you join the Weida Group?

433
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,120
When did you quit your job?

434
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,380
From August 2015

435
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,260
to October 2016.

436
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,650
I used to work in the Weida Group

437
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,730
as Yang Weida's secretary.

438
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,750
During this period of work,

439
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,160
did you encounter anything unpleasant

440
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,600
in the company?

441
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,610
We hope you can

442
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,690
tell us the truth.

443
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,320
I was raped by him.

444
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,430
What?

445
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,370
After I was raped that day,

446
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,790
I wanted to call the police.

447
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,920
But Yang Weida sent me a lot of messages.

448
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,120
He told me

449
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,550
he liked me.

450
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,530
He wanted to divorce and marry me.

451
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,390
I thought

452
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,240
he was so rich, so...

453
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,910
But I didn't expect that he lied to me.

454
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,390
After his wife found out about this,

455
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,370
he stopped contacting me.

456
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,990
He even made an excuse

457
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,740
to fire me from the company.

458
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,790
All of our chat history

459
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,030
is on this phone.

460
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,740
So,

461
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,080
I...

462
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:03,930
I'm willing to testify before the court.

463
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,410
As long as he gets what he deserves,

464
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,670
I'm willing to do so.

465
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,530
I'll do whatever I can.

466
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,280
Good job.

467
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,600
Turns out

468
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,160
that we didn't find some key evidence before.

469
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,440
Here it is.

470
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,990
Not only did he sexually harass Xia Linlin,

471
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,250
he also raped her on a business trip.

472
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,990
If

473
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,220
Guo Yu went on a business trip with him,

474
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,390
maybe she would have ended up just as Xia Linlin did.

475
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,220
You're in a sexual harassment case.

476
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,670
I suggest

477
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,960
you shouldn't bring the rape thing up

478
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,300
in court.

479
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,550
That's what Qiu Hua and I discussed.

480
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,910
Send these text messages

481
00:27:58,930 --> 00:27:59,790
to be notarized

482
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,200
and convince the court to accept them as new evidence.

483
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,460
Xia Linlin has agreed to appear in court.

484
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,870
Please don't.

485
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,330
Why?

486
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,550
She was a druggie.

487
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,070
If she appears in court,

488
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,020
the other party will make a big fuss about her character.

489
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,790
She can't stand the interrogation.

490
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,920
These texts

491
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,510
are enough.

492
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,070
They can prove sexual harassment did happen.

493
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:29,670
The court could decide according to the texts.

494
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,550
Also,

495
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,270
Tianli Law Firm

496
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,840
doesn't want to take the case anymore.

497
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,990
Our partners have discussed it.

498
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,040
We think now that this case

499
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,270
has come to this far,

500
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,660
it's a pity

501
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,740
to give up halfway.

502
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,990
So we decide

503
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,110
to take it back

504
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,210
in the name of our law firm.

505
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:55,040
The patent case is handled by Mr. Tao.

506
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,900
Mr. Dong and I have discussed it.

507
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,320
There's no problem.

508
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,810
So you two

509
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,090
can do whatever you can

510
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,070
and focus on this case.

511
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:04,910
OK?

512
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,210
Ms. Fang is right.

513
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,760
Don't forget Chen Shuo is against us.

514
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,690
What's wrong with him?

515
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,950
Are you afraid of him?

516
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,470
I'm not afraid of him.

517
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,450
If Xia Linlin appears in court,

518
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,720
I'm afraid

519
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,230
he'll insist on getting to the bottom of her.

520
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,430
Most witnesses

521
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,720
won't appear in court.

522
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,040
And the court won't force her to do so.

523
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,000
We'd rather not make her appear in court.

524
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,710
But Qiu Hua,

525
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,590
even if we don't,

526
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,710
do you think

527
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,640
Chen Shuo won't make a fuss about her drug addiction?

528
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,710
The court won't know

529
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,860
how much it has hurt Xia Linlin,

530
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:45,040
but will only know she used to be a druggie.

531
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,510
Wouldn't it be worse?

532
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,520
I think Xia Linlin should appear in court.

533
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,710
And she should acknowledge

534
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,010
in court

535
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,800
that she took drugs.

536
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,400
Let the court know

537
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,760
how much it has hurt her.

538
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,600
Would it be better?

539
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,270
I'm just afraid that Xia Linlin

540
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,530
can't stand Chen Shuo's interrogation.

541
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,370
I don't believe it.

542
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,880
We can train her.

543
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:20,420
I'll call the court now

544
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,100
to submit the application

545
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,050
to let Xia Linlin appear in court.

546
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,930
It's a deal.

547
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,150
No sexual harassment.

548
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,040
Ladies and gentlemen,

549
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,450
[Jingbei Court]

550
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:33,670
recently,

551
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:35,740
Yang Weida's sexual harassment case that has received wide attention

552
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,090
is officially called in court today.

553
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,730
Due to privacy,

554
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,820
the court won't make the trial public

555
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,470
to avoid secondary damage to the persons involved.

556
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,710
Only professionals and relevant personnel can enter the court.

557
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,610
But we will pay close attention to the results of the trial.

558
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,670
Now we can see

559
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,710
that the car of Liangcheng Law Firm

560
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,630
has arrived.

561
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,070
Let's do an interview.

562
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:51,990
Miss Guo Yu.

563
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,950
Qiu Hua! Qiu Hua!

564
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:55,900
Come on, Qiu Hua!

565
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,320
You can do it, Qiu Hua!

566
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,750
Come on, Qiu Hua!

567
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:07,880
Guo Yu.

568
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,790
Some netizens said you're ungrateful and it's a blackmail.

569
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,730
What do you think about this?

570
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,030
Guo Yu, what do you think

571
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,860
about today's trial?

572
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,990
Can you talk about it?

573
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:15,190
What do you think, Ms. Luo?

574
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,910
Tell us about it.

575
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,230
I'm sorry.

576
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,550
Since we've resorted to the law,

577
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,190
let the law decide the case.

578
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,480
Netizens said he sponsored you.

579
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,270
But you're suing him instead.

580
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,300
What do you think?

581
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,310
Believe in the law and wait for the result.

582
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,070
Guo Yu, please answer us!

583
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,750
Please answer us, Guo Yu!

584
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,080
Please keep order!

585
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:31,750
I have a certificate.

586
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,470
Ms. Qiu.

587
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,270
Mr. Chen.

588
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,950
Righteous Luo.

589
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,240
Unscrupulous Chen.

590
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,840
What?

591
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,790
Where's Mr. Xue?

592
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,630
He's not here.

593
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,760
He's with my client.

594
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,330
Are you alone today?

595
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,090
Yeah.

596
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,310
It's enough

597
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,770
for me to deal with you.

598
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,160
Case of a dispute over general personality rights is now called in court.

599
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,160
Please be seated.

600
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,830
Exhibits from the plaintiff No. 1- No. 6

601
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,270
are text messages on the phone between the plaintiff and the defendant.

602
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,710
They can prove

603
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,270
that the defendant viciously sexually harassed the plaintiff

604
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,990
for a long time.

605
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,190
Does the defendant have any objections?

606
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:24,910
Yes.

607
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,360
In our opinion,

608
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,160
in different relationship models,

609
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,000
the same words

610
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,100
can be interpreted as having different meanings.

611
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,990
I don't think it's a convincible way

612
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,770
to accuse the plaintiff of sexual harassment

613
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,530
only with these texts.

614
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,270
Take the sixth message for example.

615
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:38,790
Yu.

616
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,120
You've lost weight.

617
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:41,120
My heart aches.

618
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,990
When I close my eyes,

619
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:44,230
I can see your lean, fair face.

620
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,980
Isn't this sexual harassment?

621
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,340
Listen to me, the defendant's agent.

622
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,420
A middle-aged man

623
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,170
sent such text messages

624
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,460
to a 22-year-old girl.

625
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,810
If it's not sexual harassment,

626
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,550
then what else can be called sexual harassment?

627
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,270
Your Honor.

628
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,030
The plaintiff went to college

629
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,270
under the support of the defendant.

630
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,210
When the defendant went to pick up the plaintiff,

631
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,270
the plaintiff's parents

632
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,120
held the defendant's hands

633
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,400
and repeatedly said

634
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,230
that he should treat her as his own daughter.

635
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,530
If all the information

636
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,650
is interpreted as

637
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:15,180
the messages between adult males and females,

638
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,590
I think Mr. Yang Weida

639
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,430
was indeed not decent.

640
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:20,440
But if it's not,

641
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,820
it can be interpreted as a father's care for his daughter.

642
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,680
Is the message content appropriate?

643
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,800
Although it looks a little intimate,

644
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,240
it didn't go out of line.

645
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,710
So we think

646
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,770
it's just about a senior caring about

647
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,140
his junior's life

648
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:37,250
and work.

649
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,860
Is it?

650
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,870
The defendant's agent.

651
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,070
Did your client

652
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,470
speak in this tone

653
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:44,990
to all the girls he has sponsored?

654
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:45,650
But not all parents

655
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,060
of all sponsored girls

656
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,950
would hold Mr. Yang Weida's hands

657
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,470
and tell him to treat their daughter

658
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,470
as his own.

659
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:54,080
But I believe Mr. Yang Weida

660
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,070
cares about the life

661
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,900
and work

662
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,990
of every sponsored girl.

663
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,550
But differences exist.

664
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,130
He may care more about some of them,

665
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,860
and care little about the rest.

666
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,800
Plaintiff,

667
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,190
as to the information you provided,

668
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,350
I think

669
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:11,960
the defendant can only be accused of his improper words at most.

670
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:14,100
It's not sexual harassment.

671
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,040
Please go on.

672
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,960
Exhibits No. 7 to No. 15

673
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:29,350
are the WeChat contact

674
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,550
between the plaintiff and Liang Tian, her colleague.

675
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,830
They can prove

676
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:35,770
that the plaintiff told tearfully the fact that she was sexually harassed

677
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:37,370
to Liang Tian several times.

678
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:40,670
And Liang Tian comforted the plaintiff many times.

679
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,790
Does the defendant have any objections?

680
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,469
Yes.

681
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,560
The information can only prove

682
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,150
the plaintiff spoke ill of the boss in front of her colleague.

683
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,000
And her colleague

684
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,600
did agree with what she said.

685
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,719
But in the chat history,

686
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,429
sexual harassment is not demonstrated.

687
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,889
They were colleagues from the same company.

688
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,550
They talked face to face.

689
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,690
These WeChat messages

690
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,860
can prove they did talk in person.

691
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,240
Liang Tian knew the plaintiff

692
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,950
was sexually harassed by the boss.

693
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,430
She was comforting the plaintiff.

694
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,080
Your Honor.

695
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,280
Exhibit No. 5 we submitted to the court

696
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,610
is Liang Tian's testimony.

697
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,880
In her testimony,

698
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,470
she proved

699
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,110
she and the plaintiff never talked

700
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,270
about Mr. Yang Weida's sexual harassment.

701
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,670
The plaintiff just said

702
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,930
the boss wasn't satisfied with her work.

703
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:26,980
Please go on.

704
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:30,390
Exhibits No. 16 and No. 17

705
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,990
are the WeChat contact between the plaintiff and the defendant

706
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:35,510
from January 12 to December 13 in 2017.

707
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,010
In these WeChat messages,

708
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:37,990
the defendant demanded the plaintiff go out for dinner with him

709
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:40,670
two days in a row.

710
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:44,010
The plaintiff found excuses to refuse all the demands.

711
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,690
Exhibit No. 18

712
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,740
is the Outstanding Employee Award

713
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,310
won by the plaintiff in 2016.

714
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,670
Exhibit No. 19

715
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,670
is the list of the year-end bonus of the defendant's company.

716
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,420
In the list, the plaintiff's year-end bonus for 2016

717
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,660
was detained.

718
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,590
Exhibit No. 20

719
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:01,840
is the WeChat history of the plaintiff and the defendant.

720
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,070
The plaintiff asked the defendant

721
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,480
why he

722
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,390
detained her year-end bonus for no reason.

723
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,630
The defendant answered

724
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,470
that "you should know it."

725
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,350
Two days before the detained bonus,

726
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,990
the plaintiff rejected the invitations from the defendant many times

727
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:15,750
to go out for dinner with him.

728
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:17,470
Does the defendant have any objections?

729
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,110
Yes.

730
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,590
The occurrence order of things

731
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,650
is not necessarily legally related.

732
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,230
The plaintiff was an outstanding employee.

733
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,800
In order to reward the plaintiff,

734
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,630
the defendant's invitation to go out for dinner was rejected by the plaintiff.

735
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:30,550
And the plaintiff's bonus for that year was detained.

736
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,880
These are three things.

737
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,910
There is no inevitable cause and effect between them.

738
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,030
Also,

739
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,470
the plaintiff also hid something in fact.

740
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,300
Two days before the bonus was awarded,

741
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,990
due to her negligence at work,

742
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,790
my defendant, Mr. Yang Weida,

743
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,390
missed the meeting with an important client,

744
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,720
which made the company lose big business.

745
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:52,550
Plaintiff,

746
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,530
is it true?

747
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,750
You can answer with the microphone.

748
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,950
I just wanted to avoid him.

749
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,510
So I made an excuse and didn't go to work.

750
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:10,990
He said

751
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,500
because I didn't go to work,

752
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,760
he missed a meeting with his client.

753
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,350
But I'm not sure

754
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,610
if it's a fact.

755
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,080
Okay.

756
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,790
In other words,

757
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:22,830
a boss

758
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,690
wanted to invite his female subordinate to dinner,

759
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:25,820
but he was rejected.

760
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,180
The boss was very angry.

761
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,980
He detained her year-end bonus.

762
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,350
Even though it's a fact,

763
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,250
it can't necessarily

764
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:35,950
conclude that he wanted to sexually harass his female employee.

765
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,830
Let's begin.

766
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,140
Are you sure you want her to appear in court?

767
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,940
Chen Shuo won't be polite to her.

768
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,550
She's our last move.

769
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,780
Without her, we'll lose.

770
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:49,990
Fine.

771
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,870
Your Honor.

772
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,820
We request Xia Linlin, a witness, to testify before the court.

773
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,730
Your Honor,

774
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,200
the time limit for evidence presentation has expired.

775
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,030
The plaintiff's behavior is an evidence attack.

776
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,160
We firmly oppose it.

777
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:00,930
Defendant,

778
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,470
the plaintiff has submitted the application

779
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:03,830
before the trial.

780
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:06,030
Don't you want to find out the truth?

781
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:09,910
Plaintiff,

782
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,950
are you sure

783
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,240
you want to let your witness appear in court?

784
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,470
Your Honor.

785
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,630
We insist on calling our witness to the witness stand.

786
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,430
The witness is waiting outside.

787
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:26,840
The court allows the plaintiff's witness to testify before the court.

788
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,850
I'd like to call the witness!

789
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,710
Yingzi, why do I feel something is wrong?

790
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,640
I think Chen Shuo seems...

791
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,350
-What's wrong? -I don't know.

792
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
What's your name?

793
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,020
Xia Linlin.

794
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,890
What's your date of birth?

795
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,500
May 1987.

796
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,430
Witness Xia Linlin,

797
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,640
you are called to the court today

798
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,350
to testify for this case.

799
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:25,190
You have signed the letter of undertaking.

800
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,880
You have to tell the court

801
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,640
all the truth.

802
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:32,350
No perjury or false testimony is allowed.

803
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,350
In case of a false statement,

804
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:37,310
you should take corresponding legal responsibility.

805
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,430
Do you hear me?

806
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:41,990
Your Witness.

807
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,720
You may testify now.

808
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,590
My name is Xia Linlin.

809
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,980
From August 2015

810
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,030
to October 2016,

811
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,270
I used to work in the Weida Group

812
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,270
as Yang Weida's secretary.

813
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,220
I used to be sponsored

814
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,740
by Weida Fund to go to college.

815
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,430
I couldn't find a job after graduation.

816
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,510
Weida Group hired me

817
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,030
as Yang Weida's secretary.

818
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:20,270
I was so grateful to him at that time.

819
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,350
But then I felt that things were getting worse.

820
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,710
At first,

821
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,040
I just thought he was so nice to me.

822
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,890
He took care of me at work.

823
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:35,220
He also cared about me in life.

824
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,320
He even would notice

825
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,250
when my period would come

826
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,880
and the size of my underwear.

827
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,990
Later, he would touch me

828
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,380
when nobody was around.

829
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,190
He would kiss me,

830
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:48,550
touch me,

831
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,230
and put his hands in my clothes.

832
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,260
He sent me some dirty texts.

833
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,990
Guo Yu and I went through the same thing.

834
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,530
After that, he would take me on a business trip.

835
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,240
Then...

836
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:13,070
Xia Linlin.

837
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,670
Do you have proof

838
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,560
to prove what you said is true?

839
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,170
The plaintiff's agent,

840
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,810
please don't interrupt her.

841
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,320
I have evidence.

842
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,470
I still keep

843
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,190
the text messages he sent to me.

844
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,430
Your Honor.

845
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,300
I have the notarized text messages

846
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,620
between Xia Linlin and the defendant.

847
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:34,830
I'd like to submit them to the court.

848
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,990
I agree.

849
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,560
Your Honor

850
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,700
and the opposing agent,

851
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,510
you can read these texts.

852
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,810
These words are clear,

853
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:51,970
full of eroticism and seduction.

854
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,830
It's pure sexual harassment.

855
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,830
Do I need to read some?

856
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:56,910
No need.

857
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,510
It's clear to see the true intention.

858
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,910
Go on.

859
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:02,110
Xia Linlin.

860
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,310
We sympathize with your misfortune.

861
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,270
Has the sexual harassment

862
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,550
by the defendant

863
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,470
affected your work and life?

864
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,310
As you can see,

865
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,600
what the defendant did to me ruined my life.

866
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,460
I couldn't stand his long-term sexual harassment.

867
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,030
I left this company after that.

868
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,340
Then I got married.

869
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,430
But I couldn't stand such pain.

870
00:42:28,450 --> 00:42:30,250
So I told my ex-husband about it.

871
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,440
But my ex-husband

872
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,280
has a strong sense of chastity.

873
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,020
Because of this,

874
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,030
we had a bad relationship.

875
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,630
In the end, we had to divorce.

876
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,140
After that,

877
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,710
because I couldn't stand the pain and depression,

878
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,600
I chose to take drugs.

879
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,230
Her life was ruined as such.
