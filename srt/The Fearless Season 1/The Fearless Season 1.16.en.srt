[Episode 16]

4
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,300
Conform to the standard price?

5
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,030
As what I just told you,

6
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,670
I...

7
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,990
I really have no money now.

8
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,910
She has all the money of the company in her hands.

9
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,320
I don't even have a small allowance.

10
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,759
My mom is financially supported by my elder sister.

11
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,140
I don't have a dime to my name.

12
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,830
Actually, Mr. Wei, our charge

13
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,440
is reasonable.

14
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,670
There are rules regulating legal fees.

15
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,670
I understand.

16
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,940
Let's take your case as an example.

17
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,350
We won't calculate the fee based on the amount of one billion.

18
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,600
Let's just say it's 200 million.

19
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,990
According to standards,

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,170
the fee, at minimum, should be 3% of it.

21
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,790
It sums up to six million.

22
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,350
Six million?

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,260
Actually, Ms. Qiu and I

24
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:37,440
have discussed it.

25
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,079
We know you're having difficulties now.

26
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,640
Well, as lawyers, we'd love to

27
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,270
help the poor and the distressed.

28
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,990
We can't take advantages of those in vulnerable positions.

29
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,360
So we decided

30
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,220
to

31
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,170
cut the fee by half.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,730
Plus, you'll work with us on a contingency basis.

33
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,670
Contingency?

34
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,220
What is that?

35
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,550
What do you mean by "contingency"?

36
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,829
Well, Mr. Wei, I'll put it this way.

37
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,500
Let's not talk about several million.

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,960
I'm sure at this point you'll feel reluctant

39
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,270
to even pay 100,000.

40
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,550
But think about this.

41
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,550
If we can really help you

42
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,840
get the corporate assets back,

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,040
you'll have one billion in your pocket.

44
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,350
Now that we've cut the fee by half,

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,020
it means you need to pay us 3 million.

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,840
We don't ask for a full payment right now.

47
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,560
All you have to pay is 300,000.

48
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,920
It's 10% of the total amount.

49
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,780
As for the remaining 2.7 million,

50
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,990
when we win the lawsuit,

51
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,870
and your company's assets

52
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,070
are returned to you,

53
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,230
you'll pay us the rest of the fee.

54
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:32,950
That's how we do a case on a contingency basis.

55
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:35,950
-I see.
-By then you'll have one billion.

56
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,430
At that time,

57
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,300
will you think 2.7 million is too much?

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,950
Of course not.

59
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,680
Why didn't you lead with that?

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,110
We'll go with this plan.

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,190
Okay.

62
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,790
Let's sign a contingency agreement.

63
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,590
Wait.

64
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,350
Are we gonna sign it now?

65
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,870
Yes, Mr. Wei.

66
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,829
You must sign this agreement

67
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:59,360
before we officially work as your attorneys,

68
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,550
and are given powers to do this case.

69
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,050
That means to start taking depositions.

70
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,520
The copies of texts

71
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,160
that you talked about

72
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,550
can't be submitted to the court

73
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,030
as evidence.

74
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,790
We'll go to the telecommunications office

75
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,230
to obtain evidence and get it notarized by authorities.

76
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,100
The other things you mentioned,

77
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,470
such as phone recording,

78
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,829
and surveillance footage, also need to be dealt with.

79
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,350
It's a huge workload.

80
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,010
There is a long way for us to go.

81
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,070
I see.

82
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,030
Okay, no problem.

83
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,880
Let's sign it!

84
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,270
We'll sign it now.

85
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,570
Take a look.

86
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,540
This is the contingency contract,

87
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,240
a standard version for all lawyers.

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,670
Any questions?

89
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,350
No.

90
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,590
Let me help you with it.

91
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,550
Okay, thank you.

92
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:06,220
Ms. Luo.

93
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,080
Please sit down.

94
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,070
Take your seat.

95
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,460
I... I...

96
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,040
It's not that I don't trust you.

97
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,700
In fact, I think

98
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,060
you've proposed a great plan here.

99
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,230
However, it seems hasty to sign it now.

100
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,910
Maybe I should spend some time reading it.

101
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,970
When I read it through,

102
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,270
and find no problems,

103
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,140
I'll sign it.

104
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,160
After that, I'll have it delivered to you.

105
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,710
Okay?

106
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,230
No problem.

107
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,970
You've done a good job, Ms. Qiu.

108
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,530
So have you, Ms. Luo.

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,680
Let's go!

110
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,150
We should celebrate it.

111
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,070
It's all your fault.

112
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,790
You appeared weak in the meeting.

113
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,470
That made us look wimpy.

114
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,320
How can you blame me?

115
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,640
We had agreed on the amount of one million,

116
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,390
but you suddenly tripled that.

117
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,420
It's you who deterred him.

118
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,650
How dare you blame me?

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,490
Indeed.

120
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,860
I couldn't control myself.

121
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:01,780
Why have I...

122
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,030
become so greedy now?

123
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,460
I didn't use to place so much importance

124
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,090
on money.

125
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,910
Seriously?

126
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,150
From the moment I met you, you've always been a person

127
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,550
whose eyes sparkle when it comes to money.

128
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,140
If I do this again,

129
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,100
you should stomp on my foot under the table.

130
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,760
I'm afraid that'll leave you with a limp.

131
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,460
Do you mean that?

132
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,740
We should stop worrying about it.

133
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:37,510
What will be ours will be ours.

134
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,710
If not, we can't do anything about it.

135
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,470
Listen, about that 3 million...

136
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:45,610
What?

137
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,409
I can't bring myself to say it.

138
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,270
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

139
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:52,700
Okay.

140
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,900
Thank you. Thank you.

141
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,280
Will they agree on that 3 million?

142
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,910
If they do,

143
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,520
30% of it will go to the law firm.

144
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,710
For the rest 2.1 million, I'll take 60% and you 40%.

145
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,470
That means you'll have 840,000,

146
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,150
and I'll have 1.26 million.

147
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,470
I'm good at math, aren't I?

148
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,260
You are.

149
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,100
Look how proud you are!

150
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:14,310
The contract isn't signed yet and you've got too carried away.

151
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,660
My brain works well when it comes to money.

152
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,970
How much do you think we'll pay for this?

153
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,110
Now the contract isn't signed yet.

154
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,000
Even if it's signed, I wouldn't dare

155
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,710
to come to such a place.

156
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,570
I've gotta change your mind.

157
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,590
A woman should be good to herself.

158
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,310
It'll be great if the contract is signed.

159
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,350
Even if it's not, we should

160
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,550
still come to such a place, if we need to.

161
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,470
Doesn't it make you feel comfortable?

162
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,030
It does.

163
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:44,530
That's what counts.

164
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:47,960
Ma'am?

165
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,960
Here I am.

166
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,470
Can you register her

167
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,710
as a VIP member as well?

168
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,230
Sure.

169
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,850
Nonsense! Don't listen to her.

170
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,360
You get her on the books, not me.

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,150
I'm already a member.

172
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,760
Get her in. I'll pay the registration fee.

173
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,310
Okay.

174
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,210
Don't listen to her. She's crazy.

175
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,480
Welcome back.

176
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,800
You're glowing.

177
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:22,760
Not at all.

178
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,440
I'm burned out.

179
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,710
You were away for a day. What kept you busy?

180
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,630
A case.

181
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,480
What case?

182
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
I'm just too busy.

183
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,670
A bit of this and a bit of that.

184
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,799
Haven't you seen me busy making calls?

185
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,659
I'm eager for cases.

186
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,010
Fine. See you tomorrow.

187
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,990
Qiu Hua.

188
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,510
I...

189
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,280
Actually, we should be very happy.

190
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,440
But I've always had a bad feeling.

191
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
You've gotta be patient.

192
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
It's not about that.

193
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,830
I'm sunk in retrospection.

194
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,510
Something popped up in my head.

195
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,470
At that time,

196
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,280
I shouldn't have suggested that he should

197
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,940
apply for a withdrawal of the equity agreement.

198
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,080
As he heard that,

199
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,110
he knew he had to pay several million

200
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,770
for the trial and his lawyers.

201
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,350
Now he's aware of our plan of working the case on a contingency basis.

202
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,430
He can take it to a lawyer who charges less.

203
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:28,990
Then he'll save 3 million.

204
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,830
If so, the result of our hard work

205
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,120
will be taken by others.

206
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,410
We've shared our idea with him.

207
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,780
It's too late for you to regret it.

208
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,510
But I think Mr. Wei

209
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,950
is a smart guy.

210
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,230
He had consulted so many people,

211
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,830
but he still came to us in the end.

212
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,510
That means our plan

213
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,880
is the best he's seen.

214
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,830
As the owner of such a big business,

215
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,710
I'm sure he knows what's the best for him.

216
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,710
Just don't worry.

217
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,110
We should

218
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,330
do our job well.

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,900
Don't waste time on those wild thoughts.

220
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,500
Come here.

221
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,020
Come on.

222
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,120
Okay.

223
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,650
You're basically toppling

224
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,080
my original plan.

225
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,510
Yes.

226
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,920
About this,

227
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,350
you've gotta have a correct idea.

228
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,830
Given what I wrote here,

229
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,630
you must change your mind.

230
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,350
I don't think I'm making a mistake here.

231
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,950
We should do what I've written here.

232
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,750
Can't you agree with me?

233
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,890
If not, we'll have to go over this again!

234
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,530
Fine.

235
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,870
I'll take this down.

236
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,710
And you take that down.

237
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,760
It would've been over if you had listened to me.

238
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,640
When have you become a whiner?

239
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,730
I'll mark this down then.

240
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,350
Mr. Liu.

241
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,250
Don't worry.

242
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,350
I've fought 4 cases

243
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,580
like yours last year.

244
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,810
I won all of them.

245
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,670
Never lost one.

246
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,500
That's impressive.

247
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,350
It's true that skillful apprentices would take their masters' jobs away.

248
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,890
What did you say, Mr. Han?

249
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,680
I'm sorry.

250
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,250
I need to get this call.

251
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,830
Mr. Han, is this what you want?

252
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,760
Yes, it is.

253
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,230
Thank you.

254
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,710
I'll make sure that you'll become an attorney at law next year.

255
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,580
Just consider it done.

256
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,660
Okay, thank you.

257
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
I'll hang up now.

258
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:37,990
Okay.

259
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:52,120
Did we ask for too much?

260
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,480
After all, we are not masterful lawyers.

261
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,710
Don't say that.

262
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,710
In the very beginning, we need to

263
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:01,000
let them know we are the best.

264
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,630
It doesn't matter if they hire us or not.

265
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,110
We won't bargain.

266
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:04,990
Okay?

267
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,080
However, if they come back to us

268
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,560
and only offer 500,000,

269
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:12,070
we'll take it the same.

270
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,150
If that doesn't happen,

271
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,140
we'll accept 300,000.

272
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,370
If it goes even worse than that,

273
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,030
we'll settle for 200,000.

274
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,280
You're here early.

275
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,970
Good morning, Mr. Han.

276
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,400
Your family came yesterday. Was everything good?

277
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,280
Yes.

278
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,690
Just trivial family matters.

279
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,410
Thank you for your concern.

280
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,350
You should hear what you said.

281
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,080
I'm supposed to care about you.

282
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,980
You're getting more and more serious.

283
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:53,110
Even I don't dare to make jokes around.

284
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,610
Hello.

285
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,220
Sorry. My phone's having bad reception here.

286
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,890
Okay, Mr. Wei.

287
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,590
Thank you for your trust.

288
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,590
Mr. Wei, Ms. Luo is with me right now.

289
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,990
I'll put her on the phone.

290
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,180
Okay.

291
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,650
Ms. Luo, Mr. Wei said he's coming to sign the contract.

292
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:49,660
I'm coming back. Let me talk to him.

293
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,770
Hello, Mr. Wei.

294
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,010
Yes. This is Ms. Luo.

295
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,140
Mr. Wei, here is the thing.

296
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,290
As we've told you,

297
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,910
this is a big law firm.

298
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,150
Yes. We're cautious about new cases.

299
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,880
Our decision wasn't finalized yet.

300
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,610
So we didn't report it to the firm.

301
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,500
Don't worry.

302
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,960
We'll do it right now.

303
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,310
Okay.

304
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,090
We will make it done as soon as possible.

305
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,540
Thank you again for your trust in us.

306
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,700
Okay. Okay.

307
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,540
Goodbye.

308
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,190
The same price?

309
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,650
We've secured 300,000.

310
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,710
And the rest 2.7 million is on the way.

311
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,830
Good things happen when you least expect them.

312
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,510
Our first case is gonna bring us 3 million.

313
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,540
What other lawyers can do that?

314
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,100
How many lawyers in our firm could do it?

315
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,470
Even Fang Lihong's first case

316
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,080
wasn't worth this much, was it?

317
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,410
Stop bragging about it.

318
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,770
You'll get a ton of time for that when we really have the money.

319
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,780
I'm not sure how much we'll get

320
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,590
from his divorce case.

321
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,470
But this 3 million...

322
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,640
No. Just 300,000.

323
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,370
We can definitely get that 300,000.

324
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,020
As long as we win this case for him,

325
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,120
he'll agree to let us

326
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,120
represent him for his divorce case.

327
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,720
He'll let us do it, won't he?

328
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,630
I have an idea.

329
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,540
Listen.

330
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,430
I must get a facial treatment today.

331
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,990
I'm gonna look my best when I sign

332
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,710
my first representation agreement as a lawyer.

333
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,030
Let's go.

334
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,700
Congratulations.

335
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,720
You've got a huge case in the beginning of your careers.

336
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,960
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

337
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,380
Wang, come in.

338
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,430
There is the case that Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu will work on.

339
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,730
Put it on the computer and mark it approved.

340
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,990
Tongren Road and Bridge Construction...

341
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,120
We can't approve it.

342
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:32,990
Why not?

343
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,010
There's a conflict of interest.

344
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,120
What conflict?

345
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,710
Our firm has just taken a case

346
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,110
involving this company.

347
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,230
That's impossible.

348
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,850
The plaintiff Wei Tongren

349
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,050
called us and asked us to represent him.

350
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,370
I'm not wrong.

351
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,150
I just put that other case on the computer.

352
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,510
But it's for a different client.

353
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,860
Please give me a moment.

354
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,790
I'll check it out.

355
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,450
Come on. Let's do it together.

356
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,110
The client's name is Qiao Lianfeng.

357
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,110
Who took the case?

358
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,520
You didn't have to ask.

359
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:08,800
Mr. Han came in the early morning

360
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,480
to put this on record.

361
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,350
Did he come here early just for this?

362
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,740
Yes.

363
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,110
He was waiting at the office door.

364
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,430
He insisted I must process his case first.

365
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,190
This is their agreement.

366
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,350
They signed it yesterday, at the price of 300,000.

367
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,470
My goodness.

368
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:38,290
Didn't Mr. Han

369
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,880
know about your case?

370
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,770
Why don't you go talk to Ms. Fang?

371
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,360
Mr. Han

372
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,100
is not being a decent fellow here.

373
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:01,790
What?

374
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,570
Ms. Fang,

375
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,540
you are a founding partner of the firm.

376
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,060
You've gotta help us.

377
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,690
Qiu Hua and I

378
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,619
did a lot of work in the preliminary stage.

379
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,390
We fought hard to get this case.

380
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,390
For us,

381
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:17,290
it's an important step of building our careers.

382
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,310
For the firm,

383
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,750
we could've signed a 3 million-worth contract,

384
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,640
and increased the firm's revenue.

385
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,270
Mr. Han knew that the plaintiff

386
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:26,390
wanted to sign a contract with us,

387
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,119
but he went ahead of us and signed

388
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:30,780
a representation contract with the defendant.

389
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,530
What's worse, he lowered the price.

390
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,990
The contract he signed is only worth 300,000.

391
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:35,520
He did that simply to stop us

392
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,680
from signing a 3 million-worth contract.

393
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,410
If everyone else follows suit,

394
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,670
how can the firm's business continue?

395
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,280
Who will protect the firm's interests?

396
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,070
Is what you said true?

397
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,670
You can ask Mr. Tao about it.

398
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,980
If the story checks out with what you said,

399
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,730
then I assure you

400
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,220
that this matter will be taken seriously.

401
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,910
Of course, I can't just listen to one side of the story.

402
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,470
Let me get to the bottom of this.

403
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,390
You may go now.

404
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,140
Ms. Fang, at this rate, the firm…

405
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,790
Yingzi.

406
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,810
Trust me, and off you go.

407
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,310
I'll figure out the truth.

408
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,770
I'll get back to you. Okay?

409
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:13,790
Okay.

410
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,540
We believe the firm will

411
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,690
deal with it fairly.

412
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:19,050
Let's go.

413
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,120
The case won't be ours.

414
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,940
Why?

415
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,470
I don’t believe the firm will indulge him.

416
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:32,630
Mr. Han has signed the contract.

417
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,660
Besides,

418
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,990
he's a partner of the firm.

419
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,330
The firm will definitely choose him over us.

420
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,030
If so,

421
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,640
is there still justice in the world?

422
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,640
Maybe we should quit being lawyers.

423
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,510
Look at you, dealing with the superiors now.

424
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,990
You're in direct contact with Fang Lihong.

425
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,060
As your supervisor, I'm out of the picture.

426
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,660
Mr. Han.

427
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,740
Ms. Fang represents me in a case.

428
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,400
I have to contact her, don't I?

429
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm going back to work.

430
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,310
Young people have no respect for rules.

431
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,130
Tao Zheng,

432
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,910
come to my office with Zhang Zhi.

433
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:12,750
Okay.

434
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,390
Is the firm run by partners,

435
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,420
or dictators?

436
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:20,420
When Ms. Mei and her husband were here,

437
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,480
the firm was in the charge of 3 people.

438
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Now,

439
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,270
Fang Lihong has become the sole dictator.

440
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,390
It's enough that she has 2 votes.

441
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,120
Now she even plants her people in the firm.

442
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,190
The management and supervisor committees,

443
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:34,220
plus the CFO,

444
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,650
are all her people.

445
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,330
Don't we have a say now?

446
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,460
That's already bad enough.

447
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,050
And now she tries to get the young employees on her team.

448
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,710
We know what she did to Xia Shu.

449
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,640
She even approached my people.

450
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,850
They've formed a little interest group.

451
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,530
What will become of us?

452
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,600
I introduce this motion,

453
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,380
not to fight those two young lawyers.

454
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,690
I do it to prevent the firm from nepotism.

455
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,510
That would be a horrible thing.

456
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,110
Mr. Zhao, am I right?

457
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,090
If you think I am, you should sign this.

458
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,310
We must make our voice be heard

459
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,790
in the interests of ourselves.

460
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,440
Thank you very much.

461
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,510
I'll go talk to the next one.

462
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,150
Okay.

463
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,560
I was astounded.

464
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,650
It really opened my eyes.

465
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,160
I've seen competition.

466
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,490
But I've never seen such a rat race among fellow colleagues.

467
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,210
He'd rather take less money,

468
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:24,990
than let the young people have their way.

469
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:27,320
If only young people are who he targets at.

470
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:28,630
Think about this.

471
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,670
If what those young lawyers said

472
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,510
is true,

473
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,070
then...

474
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,150
They did tell the truth.

475
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,510
Ms. Fang.

476
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,800
This is malicious.

477
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,110
He left that 3 million alone,

478
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,650
and took in only 300,000.

479
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,470
The firm has lost nearly a million.

480
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,310
Besides,

481
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,170
there's a big case coming up.

482
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,450
To be perfectly candid,

483
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,180
these two young people

484
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,390
have developed a visionary plan.

485
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,990
Should they win the first case,

486
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,580
they'll get the divorce case

487
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,920
and bill the client based on the standard price.

488
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,150
That'll be a considerable amount of money.

489
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,900
Ms. Fang,

490
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,670
we must stop Mr. Han's doing.

491
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,170
If he gets his way this time,

492
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,760
our firm's other lawyers will follow suit.

493
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,000
Should that happen,

494
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,330
we'd better shut down the firm.

495
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:09,160
Ms. Fang,

496
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:11,990
we should make him annul the agreement

497
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,390
and give the case back to the young lawyers.

498
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,210
I didn't expect Mr. Han

499
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,790
would get this far out of line.

500
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,710
In the worst case scenario,

501
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,550
we'll hold a partners' meeting,

502
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:26,030
and nip it in the bud.

503
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,000
I got it.

504
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,920
You may go now.

505
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,560
I'll think about the next move.

506
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:34,990
Okay.

507
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,710
Okay.

508
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,340
Mr. Han.

509
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,280
Come to my office.

510
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,170
Ms. Qiu,

511
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,420
don't you know where your desk is?

512
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,420
Fang Lihong wants to see me.

513
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,560
Go back to where you belong.

514
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:43,900
Ms. Fang.

515
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:44,720
Mr. Han.

516
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,490
Have a seat.

517
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,930
Who is this for?

518
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,490
I prepared it for you. It's tepid water.

519
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,230
For me?

520
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,330
What do you wanna say to me?

521
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:02,410
I'm busy with a new case.

522
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,920
That case about Tongren Road and Bridge Construction, right?

523
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:11,200
I thought you wouldn't bother yourself with a 300,000-worth case.

524
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,410
Mr. Han,

525
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,410
you are an experienced lawyer

526
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,210
and in charge of a department.

527
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,600
I think

528
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,140
you are being

529
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,060
a bit inconsiderate on this.

530
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,750
As far as I know,

531
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,120
those two young lawyers

532
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,900
went through lots of trouble

533
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:33,590
to get this case, didn't they?

534
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,830
On a personal level,

535
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,830
they need this case more than you do.

536
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,350
On a business level,

537
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:41,990
they could've represented Mr. Wei

538
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,270
and brought several million to the firm.

539
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,120
To be fair,

540
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:49,930
they got the case before you did.

541
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,020
Therefore, I hope

542
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,560
you can annul the agreement between you and Mrs. Wei,

543
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,230
and give the case back to the young lawyers.

544
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:00,610
You're a seasoned veteran here.

545
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,410
Why don't you take the high road,

546
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,550
and help them when they're in need?

547
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,610
They will be thankful to you forever.

548
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,590
That's very flattering.

549
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,600
You're a mentor for the young.

550
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,390
I've never thought of myself as that.

551
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,050
But...

552
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,540
Wait. This doesn't sound right.

553
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:23,030
I got the case and signed the contract first.

554
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,550
If they had been ahead of me,

555
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:27,270
could it have been possible for me to sign the contract?

556
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,600
You do have a point here.

557
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,360
Here's what I think, Mr. Han.

558
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,750
This case

559
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,460
is really important to them.

560
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,520
They've had enough hard times.

561
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,990
300,000 is nothing to you.

562
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,910
But it's a huge figure to them.

563
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,920
You're right.

564
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,570
I don't care about that 300,000.

565
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,310
When you called me just now,

566
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,270
I was off the phone with the client.

567
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,710
I told her

568
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,000
I would forfeit the 300,000.

569
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,660
I would do the case for free.

570
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,310
What do you mean by that?

571
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,460
For free?

572
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,670
You'd rather take zero payment

573
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,600
than let them get the case. Is it so?

574
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:08,650
Come on.

575
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:09,910
You work for the firm.

576
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:13,140
If you do the case for free, how will the firm make profits?

577
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,630
I don't understand.

578
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,400
Mr. Han, what are you thinking?

579
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,050
What do you want?

580
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,190
Mr. Han.

581
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,690
What's wrong with you?

582
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,990
Is it necessary?

583
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,470
Why are you crying?

584
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,490
What's going on?

585
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,780
Tell me.

586
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,080
Oh my god!

587
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,000
I...

588
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,800
I'm Sorry, Ms. Fang.

589
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,380
I got too emotional and lost control.

590
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,030
I...

591
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,150
I'm not doing this for money.

592
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:54,130
I didn't take this case

593
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,510
to suppress the young people.

594
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:58,870
I was just being brave and upright.

595
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,300
Do you know what kind of person

596
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,990
Mr. Wei is?

597
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,090
He's a betrayer.

598
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:10,920
He betrayed his wife.

599
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,940
He depraved after he became rich.

600
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,640
He wanted to divorce his wife without paying her a dime.

601
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,600
His wife is a victim of domestic violence.

602
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,630
I took this case for justice.

603
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,830
Ms. Fang, you had attended

604
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:32,060
a national women's union conference.

605
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,720
After you came back, you said in a partners' meeting

606
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,990
that when we took new cases,

607
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,120
we should consider women's benefits,

608
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,310
give more attention to the downtrodden,

609
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:42,030
and bear justice in mind.

610
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,550
His wife is exactly among the downtrodden.

611
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,840
You told me to care about women's benefits.

612
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,770
You told me to bear justice in mind.

613
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,600
But when I do consider women's benefits,

614
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,000
and bear justice in mind,

615
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:56,630
you start talking about money with me. Why?

616
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,310
No. Mr. Han.

617
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,270
Calm down.

618
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,220
Since you want to do this,

619
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,900
I think we should

620
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,380
hold a partners' meeting.

621
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,680
We'll vote on this issue. Alright?

622
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:22,890
Okay.

623
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:25,790
I have a motion for discussion

624
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,650
in the meeting as well.

625
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:35,230
[A Motion to Improve the Firm's Voting System]

626
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,770
Let there be a vote.

627
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,730
Oh no.

628
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,150
Tao Zheng is too aggressive.

629
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,930
We must stop him.

630
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,920
We'll have a partners' meeting right away.

631
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,590
I want every partner

632
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,580
to know what he has done.

633
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,760
Forget it.

634
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,790
Why?

635
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,190
Just because of that?

636
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,310
Some of our partners

637
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,700
have always wanted to change

638
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,590
the voting system.

639
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,980
In other words,

640
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,550
they want to cancel the extra vote you have.

641
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,430
Now, he's only one or two votes

642
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,000
short of you.

643
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,230
If we insist that he should give the case

644
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,190
back to the young lawyers,

645
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,290
he might incite others to do something

646
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,800
that could end up backfiring on us.

647
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,290
Look at the signatures on the motion.

648
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,970
Mr. Han has gained support from many people.

649
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,930
So the extra vote in your hand

650
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,170
is really important to us.

651
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,630
It's just a case.

652
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,660
Those two young lawyers aren't worth so many efforts.

653
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,630
Tell Qiu Hua and Luo Yingzi

654
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,910
to come to my office.

655
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,850
He had a huge smile.

656
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,140
The situation must be bad for us.

657
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,140
What should we do?

658
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,540
We have no choice. Let's go.

659
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:13,560
Wait.

660
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:15,630
If the firm chooses him,

661
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,470
we won't go down without a fight.

662
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,400
Do you think the firm

663
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,780
will offend a seasoned lawyer

664
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,110
for us?

665
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,940
But we're on the righteous side.

666
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,530
When it's about interests,

667
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,250
who cares about righteousness?

668
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,250
Just wait and see.

669
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,150
Qiu Hua, Yingzi.

670
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,050
I think you two

671
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,850
should move onto next case.

672
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:41,410
As for this case,

673
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:45,010
Mr. Han signed the contract first.

674
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,840
I can't change that.

675
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,630
Why?

676
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,440
He can annul the agreement

677
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,380
for conflicts of interest.

678
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,960
We took the case first.

679
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,310
But he signed the contract

680
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,370
before you did, right?

681
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:07,560
Ms. Fang,

682
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,860
what happened in such a short time?

683
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,450
Why did you suddenly change your attitude?

684
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,160
If people follow suit,

685
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,930
and sign a contract with Party A

686
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:21,860
when they hear someone else would represent Party B,

687
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,140
there will be a huge mess.

688
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:25,810
Ms. Fang,

689
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,320
I've wanted to say this for a long time.

690
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:31,960
Doesn't the firm know how Han Zhitong suppresses the young?

691
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,470
There are so many young people in the Criminal Defense Department.

692
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,070
Only we two became attorneys at law in recent years.

693
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:38,070
He divides a case into several parts

694
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,540
and put young lawyers

695
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,170
into different groups

696
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:43,610
so that they wouldn't have a chance to work cases alone.

697
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,000
They'll have to rely on him forever.

698
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,870
Under such circumstances,

699
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,400
young people can't grow up.

700
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,470
Does the firm not know about this?

701
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:53,730
Is it the firm's decision to indulge him?

702
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,900
He's done a really bad thing.

703
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,780
Is the firm still taking his side?

704
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,490
It's unfair.

705
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,950
Who are you accusing?

706
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,910
I'm not accusing anyone.

707
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,270
I'm just stating the facts.

708
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,140
What facts?

709
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,570
When you got this case,

710
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,860
didn't you take your personal gains under consideration?

711
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,400
Tao Zheng and Zhang Zhi have told me

712
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,930
that you asked them to support you.

713
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,770
That's why Han Zhitong interfered with it. Do you know that?

714
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,190
If you had been open about

715
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,980
your meeting with the client,

716
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,460
and won your client's trust

717
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,610
with your ability and sincerity,

718
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,670
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

719
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,510
Your plan went south,

720
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,020
so you thought of me.

721
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,890
If you are competent lawyers,

722
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:46,870
No one can suppress you.

723
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,310
Stop pretending to be innocent.

724
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,070
Don't you take that tone with me.

725
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,670
Go and think about it before you come again.

726
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,400
I'm busy.

727
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,430
What kind of person is he?

728
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,470
Sour loser!

729
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,320
Shame on him!

730
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,440
Are we gonna let him take the case away?

731
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:41,050
What else can we do?

732
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,130
Maybe we should see it as a valuable lesson.

733
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,160
I don't believe it.

734
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,360
We're smart people. Can't we fight him?

735
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,820
What else can we do?

736
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
He has taken the case.

737
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,500
If we contact Mr. Wei again,

738
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,900
we'll violate the rules.

739
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,640
We have no choice.

740
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,120
We can do worse things to him.

741
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,260
Get a bigger villain to punish him.

742
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,179
Hello, Ms. Mei.

743
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,570
What?

744
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:20,949
Okay.

745
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,270
I'll be there soon.

746
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,830
I'm sorry.

747
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,949
What's wrong?

748
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,290
Did she cause you trouble again?

749
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:28,960
It's enough that she causes me trouble,

750
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,230
but now she's even messing with Ms. Mei.

751
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,630
So annoying.

752
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,710
I'll go take a look.

753
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,770
You think about how to fight that guy.

754
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,240
Ms. Mei.

755
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,240
Some people came,

756
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:10,050
including a woman.

757
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,330
They beat her up.

758
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
It was

759
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,170
a huge mess.

760
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,200
What do you think we should do?

761
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,130
Everyone knows that I recommended her to this place.

762
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:21,460
Ms. Mei.

763
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:23,620
I got her here.

764
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,290
Sorry for troubling you.

765
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,960
Please don't be mad.

766
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,220
I shouldn't keep you here any longer.

767
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,280
I'll deal with her.

768
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,160
Yingzi.

769
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,150
Tell me what happened.

770
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:45,880
Yingzi.

771
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,560
I didn't cause trouble.

772
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,590
Mr. Zhou's wife brought a crowd

773
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,150
to the school and beat me up.

774
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,490
Look what they did to me.

775
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,460
They should've treated you worse.

776
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,710
Yingzi, I've been bullied.

777
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,510
How could you say that?

778
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,840
Why are you bullied?

779
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,200
Why?

780
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,510
What's the reason?

781
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,360
It's because of that shameless woman!

782
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,360
She knew Zhou Houze was with me,

783
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,790
but she just wouldn't leave him.

784
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,670
Why would she?

785
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:20,490
She's Mr. Zhou's legal spouse.

786
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,900
They're a legitimate couple.

787
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,540
What are you doing now?

788
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,160
You're pushing her for a divorce.

789
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,690
How can she not be mad at you?

790
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,260
How can she not beat you up?

791
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,510
Yingzi,

792
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,670
you're the only one I can count on now.

793
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,730
Mr. Zhou admires you.

794
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,260
Can you go

795
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,560
and persuade him to divorce his wife?

796
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:54,730
Do you know what admiration is?

797
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,830
That's just a gangster's empty gesture.

798
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,570
Do you really believe it?

799
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,650
He would've got a divorce if he wanted to

800
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,140
without anyone's advice!

801
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,990
Also, Lanlan,

802
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:10,220
I can't do it.

803
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,000
And I don't want to tell anyone to divorce.

804
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:14,900
What should we do now?

805
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,600
Yingzi, I got to know him because of you.

806
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,800
I can't live without him now.

807
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,460
I love him.

808
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,120
I want to be with him.

809
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,290
Did I tell you to date him?

810
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,600
It's true

811
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,740
that you two knew each other because of me.

812
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,190
How about this?

813
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,810
It's wrong for his wife to hit you.

814
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,520
I'll talk about that with him.

815
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,800
Thank you.

816
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,820
I know you're the best!

817
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,810
Hello, Qiu Hua.

818
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,060
Hello, Yingzi.

819
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,740
Mr. Wei called me just now.

820
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,620
He didn't know what had happened.

821
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,940
He urged us to sign the contract with him.

822
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,470
You didn't tell him?

823
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,600
I couldn't explain it on the phone.

824
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,510
He wants to meet us now.

825
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,110
But at this time,

826
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,450
it's inappropriate to meet him, right?

827
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:20,580
We'll be in trouble if Mr. Han knows it.

828
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:21,980
I'm not afraid of him.

829
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,140
I'll meet with Mr. Wei.

830
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,220
Yes. I thought so.

831
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,620
You happen to be outside.

832
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,670
Go see him

833
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,720
and explain to him.

834
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,250
Maybe there will be chances for cooperation.

835
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,830
He's in the tea house where we met him last time.

836
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:34,000
Okay, bye.

837
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:48,800
-Mr. Wei.
-Ms. Luo.

838
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,630
Mr. Wei. Mr. Wei.

839
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,550
I heard from Ms. Qiu

840
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,550
that you would drop the case.

841
00:38:51,550 --> 00:38:52,260
Why?

842
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,360
Mr. Wei, calm down.

843
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,210
Let's sit down and talk.

844
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,600
Okay.

845
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
If it's about the fee,

846
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,420
we can talk about it anytime.

847
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,590
Alright?

848
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,110
Mr. Wei, here is the thing.

849
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,950
It's not about the fee.

850
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,440
Do you remember Mr. Han,

851
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
the man we ate with last time?

852
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,290
Yes.

853
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,600
He went ahead of us

854
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,740
and signed a representation contract with your wife.

855
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,020
With my wife?

856
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,870
So we can't

857
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:23,800
represent you anymore.

858
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,600
I understand.

859
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,550
There's a conflict of interest.

860
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,710
Mr. Han

861
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,960
is quite immoral.

862
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:31,630
I agree.

863
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,490
I didn't know people could be worse

864
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,130
than imagination.

865
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,200
What should we do now?

866
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,070
We have no choice now.

867
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,520
A law firm can't represent the plaintiff

868
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,210
and defendant at the same time.

869
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:45,510
The point is

870
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,710
where can I find other lawyers

871
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,120
as good as you two?

872
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,800
No. Listen.

873
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:51,670
Actually, Mr. Wei,

874
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:53,680
there are many good lawyers.

875
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,410
Why don't you keep looking?

876
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,070
Ms. Luo,

877
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,760
to be honest,

878
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,900
I only trust you and Ms. Qiu now.

879
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:03,220
Why don't you

880
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
recommend a lawyer to me?

881
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,650
We don't have much experience.

882
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:10,990
In fact, in this line of business,

883
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,800
we only know a little number of people.

884
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,260
This has nothing to do with your experience.

885
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,870
I'm an outsider.

886
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,950
I'm not familiar with the legal profession.

887
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,750
You are working in this line of business.

888
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:21,630
Personally speaking,

889
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,750
I know nothing

890
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,080
about your line of work.

891
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,620
You've gotta help me.

892
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,070
I'm telling you the truth here.

893
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:28,660
If you don't help me,

894
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,510
Will you help me?

895
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,290
Will you?

896
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,310
Ms. Luo.

897
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,460
Is your boss upstairs?

898
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,600
Yes, upstairs.

899
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,620
Okay, thank you.

900
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:02,870
Just say how much you charge. It's fine.

901
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:03,960
We are brothers.

902
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,840
Come in.

903
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,400
Just say it.

904
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,310
Mr. Zhou.

905
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,640
How ungrateful you are!

906
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,370
I thought you've forgotten me.

907
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,030
No. I just

908
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,910
don't want to come to this place.

909
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,170
When I'm here, I feel like I owe you money.

910
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,760
Silly girl.

911
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:20,940
Come on. Let me introduce you to him.

912
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,850
This is Mr. Chen.

913
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:23,380
You can stop here, Mr. Zhou.

914
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,070
I know she's Ms. Luo.

915
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,470
It's been a few days since we last met. Have you digested the bird's nest soup yet?

916
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:31,980
Good for you to expand your business this far.

917
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,870
Now you've even taken jobs from Mr. Zhou.

918
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:34,510
Can't I?

919
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,050
I once represented Mr. Zhou in a case.

920
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,370
What a shame it was

921
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,000
that I wasn't part of the case

922
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,510
involving you and him!

923
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,320
I didn't make money from you.

924
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,330
My friends,

925
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:44,990
let's not talk about money.

926
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:45,920
Don't talk about money.

927
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,720
I see her as my little sister now.

928
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,060
Wait. Are you acquaintances?

929
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,000
We're fellow law practitioners.

930
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,240
No.

931
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,090
In my previous case about loans,

932
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,080
he represented the bank.

933
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,680
He made me homeless.

934
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,190
Don't be so petty.

935
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:01,080
Stop with the word game.

936
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,340
You're a lawyer and I'm a lawyer.

937
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,580
Doesn't that make us fellow law practitioners?

938
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:06,060
I have nothing to say to you.

939
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:09,800
Mr. Zhou,

940
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,380
I need to talk to you.

941
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,640
Alright, Mr. Zhou.

942
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,570
Now you see it.

943
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:18,340
You hear the tone she takes.

944
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,900
I'd better be sensible

945
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,880
and show myself out.

946
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,900
I'll leave you alone.

947
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,400
Are you leaving?

948
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:22,990
Yeah.

949
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,880
About this,

950
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,510
don't worry. It's no big deal.

951
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,910
I won't walk you out then.

952
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,770
The fact that you could afford a new car

953
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,880
means you're able to repay your loans.

954
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,740
Don't forget to pay the bank on time.

955
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,420
Why are you so mean?

956
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,430
You've taken my apartment away.

957
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,390
What else do you want?

958
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,890
Do you have a problem with me buying a car?

959
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,420
No. Not at all.

960
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,340
Easy, lady.

961
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,060
Just enjoy what you have now.

962
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,480
I suggest you

963
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,190
drive your car

964
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:49,150
as much as possible.

965
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:49,870
Have fun with it.

966
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,470
Maybe one day, I, an unscrupulous lawyer,

967
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:52,930
will take it away from you.

968
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,290
Wait.

969
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,270
Mr. Zhou, find him a place.

970
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,670
Keep him here for a while.

971
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,660
I need to talk to you.
