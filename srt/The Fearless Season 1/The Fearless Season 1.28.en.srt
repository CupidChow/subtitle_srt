[Episode 28]

4
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,670
Ms. Fang, look at her.

5
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,470
What's wrong?

6
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,620
I recorded it in public.

7
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,330
It fits the evidence rule.

8
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,789
Do you have any questions?

9
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,120
But don't worry.

10
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,500
As long as you can guarantee

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,640
you won't take revenge on Qiu Hua

12
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,030
and stop harassing her

13
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,380
or any other girls,

14
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,130
this recording

15
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,890
will never be used.

16
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,800
That's the only way.

17
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,270
I want these cases.

18
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:14,270
I made preparations of

19
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,800
these cases.

20
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,760
Okay.

21
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,170
They are all yours.

22
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,900
Yingzi, let's go.

23
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,560
A new life begins.

24
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,630
Han,

25
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,610
do you feel relieved?

26
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,780
Satisfied?

27
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,790
I don't care.

28
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,990
You don't care. Huh?

29
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:23,829
I already gave a handle

30
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,110
to them anyway.

31
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,590
I don't care about it anymore.

32
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,550
But Ms. Fang,

33
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:33,870
they can threaten me in this way today.

34
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,880
They may deal with you in the same way tomorrow.

35
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,670
Do you think I'm as shameless as you?

36
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,670
Do you dare say

37
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,990
you leave no handle in your life?

38
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,140
Hello?

39
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,350
There will be a court session of Luo Yingzi's case, right?

40
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,550
Okay, I see.

41
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,600
Thank you.

42
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,050
Look.

43
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:09,990
She's using you,

44
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
but you have to help her in a lawsuit.

45
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,790
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,110
I took her agent fee.

47
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,570
I'm her lawyer.

48
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,880
Surely,

49
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,050
I'll try my best to protect her rights.

50
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,930
When the two lawyers grow up,

51
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,880
do you think

52
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,830
you can manage

53
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,720
and balance them?

54
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:36,060
Han, listen.

55
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,800
Do not find a female assistant anymore.

56
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,970
Got it?

57
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,100
No female assistant.

58
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,520
Ms. Fang.

59
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,570
The court just called.

60
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,000
There will be a trial of your case.

61
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,730
I want to ask you again.

62
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,080
Will you call the police?

63
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,130
Luo Yingzi,

64
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,440
you are not a hesitant one.

65
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,970
Your husband has been away for over a year.

66
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,650
Do you

67
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,570
still have fantasies for him?

68
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,050
For me, he doesn't exist anymore.

69
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,000
As long as you call the police,

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,890
the police will intervene.

71
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,500
At that time, the related materials will be transferred to the public security or procuratorate.

72
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,790
And the court may announce the award to dismiss the action.

73
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,680
If the criminal case is not over,

74
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,470
your property will be safe for the time being.

75
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,230
We will have a longer time

76
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,650
to engage in the lawsuit.

77
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,430
If he is convicted,

78
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,640
you may

79
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,230
keep your house.

80
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,340
I'll think about it.

81
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,470
There's no time.

82
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,520
Make your decision quickly, okay?

83
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,320
Qiu Hua, come with me.

84
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,520
Qiu Hua.

85
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,270
I know

86
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,560
you and Luo Yingzi are very close now.

87
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,840
Luo Yingzi

88
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,840
is too independent.

89
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:36,760
She doesn't care about others.

90
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,659
As her friend,

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,340
you should remind her

92
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,460
that her case

93
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,590
is not just about her.

94
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,830
But also your reputation.

95
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,380
I know that, Ms. Fang.

96
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,590
But no matter who

97
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,790
deals with this case,

98
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,470
it's very likely to lose.

99
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,050
Even if you lose, she won't blame you.

100
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,960
Don't think too much.

101
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,050
Don't I?

102
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:03,270
I took a two million fee from her,

103
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,310
guaranteed her,

104
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,940
and kept her in the firm.

105
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,970
Other partners were unsatisfied with me.

106
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,720
After all, I already lost one time of her case.

107
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,000
If I lose one more round,

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,350
what will they criticize me?

109
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,230
"She makes money

110
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,630
by unscrupulous means."

111
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,450
She has made it clear,

112
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,930
but you refused her advice. Is it okay?

113
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,230
I'm her client now.

114
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,830
A lawyer should respect her client's opinions.

115
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,180
Even so,

116
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,300
she is our boss.

117
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,790
She's my lawyer first

118
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:38,200
and then my boss.

119
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
I'll tell her.

120
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:44,460
Anyway, she is unsatisfied with you

121
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,010
about Han's affair.

122
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,830
When you go up later,

123
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,360
think about how to tell her.

124
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,880
Don't think too much.

125
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,659
We did nothing wrong.

126
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,380
Alright, I'll talk to her.

127
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,640
Hold this for me.

128
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,330
Come in.

129
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,230
Ms. Fang.

130
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,920
Yingzi, come here.

131
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,160
You still don't want to call the police, right?

132
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,910
Yes, for now,

133
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,740
I still don't want to.

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,690
Why?

135
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,400
Ms. Fang,

136
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,230
don't get me wrong.

137
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,270
I'm not doing this for him.

138
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,070
I

139
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,130
actually have no fancy

140
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,410
about him.

141
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,470
It's just that I know him.

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,110
I don't think

143
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,830
he would have done such a good job by himself.

144
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,260
The mastermind

145
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:37,830
is definitely the so-called best girlfriend.

146
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,669
So, if I set a case for Liu Ming

147
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,370
and alert them,

148
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,909
Liu Ming might be caught,

149
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,670
but the woman will escape. I can't accept it.

150
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,060
I must catch her.

151
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,230
Then

152
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
our lawsuit

153
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,510
must be lost.

154
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,310
Well,

155
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,380
Ms. Fang, don't mind it, please.

156
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,700
It's all my fault.

157
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,070
There are other options.

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,050
Do you have to choose it?

159
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,470
No lawyers like losing lawsuits.

160
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,360
I'm sorry, Ms. Fang.

161
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,620
I have to.

162
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,560
Fine.

163
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,400
Since you've made your choice,

164
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
I have nothing to say.

165
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,840
I respect your opinion.

166
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,270
Sorry, Ms. Fang.

167
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:41,930
I will

168
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,270
go to work.

169
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,610
How is it going?

170
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,130
Don't blame her.

171
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,440
She lost many lawsuits because of you.

172
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,320
Normally, she's unhappy.

173
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,280
I don't blame her.

174
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,310
But Qiu Hua,

175
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,470
I can't rely on her

176
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,880
in the future.

177
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,420
I have to rely on you.

178
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,750
I've been thinking for a long time here.

179
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:33,480
If Wen Li is really that kind of person as you said,

180
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,230
do you think she would

181
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,970
live abroad with Liu Ming?

182
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,230
You...

183
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,810
What do you want to say?

184
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,680
I don't know.

185
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,210
It's an instinct.

186
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,470
I think

187
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,960
Liu Ming is not her ideal lover,

188
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,400
but her prey.

189
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:56,220
She transferred over 20 million abroad

190
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,150
through Liu Ming.

191
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,150
Do you think she will live with Liu Ming

192
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,380
for the rest of her life with 20 million?

193
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,710
Will she hunt others?

194
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,630
Others?

195
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,420
I know her ex-boyfriend.

196
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,970
He doesn't have much money.

197
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,020
I also know someone.

198
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,810
He might be Wen Li's prey.

199
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,210
Why is it Hengtong Real Estate?

200
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,430
Hello.

201
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:52,960
Hello.

202
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,940
Isn't the ninth floor

203
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:58,010
called Huading Real Estate Company?

204
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,470
It changed its name long ago.

205
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,390
Change its name?

206
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:00,630
Yes.

207
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,340
Is the boss still Sun Huading?

208
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,080
He was put in prison.

209
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,290
In prison?

210
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:05,740
Yes.

211
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:06,970
When did it happen?

212
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:07,830
I don't know.

213
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:10,090
He had already been in prison when I came.

214
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,470
Can we go upstairs and ask about it?

215
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:14,800
He's not here. Which one do you want to ask?

216
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,320
Do you know

217
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,830
why Mr. Sun was put in prison?

218
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,830
It seems to be

219
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,390
embezzlement.

220
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,280
Functionary embezzlement?

221
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,730
Yes, that's it.

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,750
He embezzled the company's money

223
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,550
and then transferred it abroad.

224
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,910
Then, he was found and sentenced to three years in prison.

225
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,710
The agency agreement of Sun Huading's mother

226
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,770
has been approved.

227
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,700
You can meet him now. Go in.

228
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
Mr. Sun used to study

229
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,610
in the college where my father worked.

230
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,070
[Meeting Room]

231
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,190
He majored in architecture.

232
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,080
But his wife

233
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,110
is my dad's student.

234
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,760
After so many years of graduation,

235
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,620
they've been in touch with my dad.

236
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,330
Liu Ming used to run a company.

237
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,560
In the beginning,

238
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,830
he lost money no matter what he operated.

239
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,860
The couple knew we lived in Jingbei

240
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,120
and came to see me.

241
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:24,080
Then, I introduced Liu Ming to Mr. Sun.

242
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
Since then,

243
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,560
Liu Ming specialized agency for his company

244
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,920
and sold his houses.

245
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,740
They both cared about me and Liu Ming.

246
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,500
Sun.

247
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,840
You're here, Yingzi.

248
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:50,730
Have a seat.

249
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:57,980
Yingzi,

250
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,020
why do you come to me?

251
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,950
What's up?

252
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,530
Sun,

253
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm a lawyer now.

254
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,880
This is my partner.

255
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,430
Qiu Hua, a lawyer.

256
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,710
Hello, Mr. Sun.

257
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,580
Hello.

258
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,990
Why didn't you

259
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,510
let your wife tell me the affair?

260
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,800
I have to bear the consequences

261
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,310
of my actions.

262
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,630
Why do I bother others?

263
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,680
Your father doesn't know

264
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,270
my affairs, right?

265
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,310
I'm sorry.

266
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,000
I told my dad.

267
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:37,990
After my dad knew it,

268
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,310
he told me

269
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,740
to visit you often

270
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,220
and see if you need any help.

271
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,350
Nothing.

272
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,670
It's just three years.

273
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,680
It rests for one and a half years

274
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,220
It'll be over soon.

275
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,480
Is your father

276
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,740
okay?

277
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,480
He misses you.

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,120
He always said

279
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,690
he couldn't figure out

280
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,480
why you made such a mistake.

281
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,300
Sun,

282
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,050
you are not a greedy man.

283
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,930
But why did you commit such a crime?

284
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,780
Don't ask about me.

285
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,830
This is

286
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,070
what I deserve.

287
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,420
I'm willing to bear it.

288
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,250
Yingzi,

289
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,430
thank you for visiting me.

290
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Please come back.

291
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,200
Is it because of Wen Li?

292
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,750
What is your relationship with her?

293
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,710
Why are you willing to

294
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,000
commit such a crime for her?

295
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,930
Why are you willing to be sentenced to prison for her?

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,010
Did Qiang's mother tell you?

297
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,110
What does she want?

298
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,990
The woman

299
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,870
is hopeless.

300
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,160
Sun,

301
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,640
your wife is your classmate.

302
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,060
She came to Jingbei to play hard

303
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,170
and founded this company with you

304
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,450
and had to take care of your kid's life.

305
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,840
You can't say that about her.

306
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,380
She is no longer the one

307
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,320
you knew back then.

308
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,490
She has changed.

309
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,010
She became vicious.

310
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,760
After she found out

311
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,310
the affairs about Wen Li and me,

312
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,990
she even tried to

313
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,270
kill Wen Li.

314
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,610
So

315
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,740
you committed the crime of functionary embezzlement

316
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,790
for Wen Li.

317
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,160
I did it myself.

318
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,230
It has nothing to do with her.

319
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,750
Where did the asset

320
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,550
have been transferred to?

321
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,950
I can't tell you that.

322
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,310
For her,

323
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,800
you abandoned the morality that you have always adhered to

324
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,110
and stole something that doesn't belong to you,

325
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,840
and made yourself be prisoned.

326
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,190
At this point,

327
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,130
you're still thinking for her.

328
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:57,130
Don't criticize her.

329
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:59,250
It has nothing to do with her.

330
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,750
I did it willingly.

331
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,540
I fell in love with her.

332
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,609
Is it wrong for me

333
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,520
to prepare for our future happiness?

334
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,780
I believe you love her.

335
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,270
But are you sure

336
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,240
she loved you from the beginning?

337
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,819
Of course.

338
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:22,170
Did Wen Li come to see you?

339
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,910
After my accident,

340
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:27,010
the woman and shareholders

341
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,130
desired to kill her

342
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,580
crazily,

343
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,140
and almost tore her apart.

344
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,520
I'm ashamed that I can't protect her.

345
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,260
How could I let her come here?

346
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,680
Do you know where she is now?

347
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:39,570
Of course.

348
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,950
But I

349
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,010
can't tell you.

350
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,850
Sun,

351
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,710
I know where she is.

352
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,890
Qiu.

353
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,980
The man next to her

354
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,590
is my husband, Liu Ming.

355
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,250
Why is she with Liu Ming?

356
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,560
She ran away with Liu Ming

357
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,640
abroad.

358
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,740
Before he left,

359
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,840
she stole all the money from our family.

360
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,910
Actually, she and Liu Ming have been together for a long time.

361
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,430
You have no idea.

362
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,360
Impossible.

363
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,150
Wen Li loves me.

364
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,440
And she's pregnant with my baby.

365
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,170
After I was arrested,

366
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,190
the woman and shareholder of the company

367
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,380
kept harassing her.

368
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,910
She went abroad

369
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:32,320
to protect our baby.

370
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,800
Later,

371
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,510
due to rushing

372
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,920
and sadness,

373
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,960
she miscarried.

374
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,390
She told me

375
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,810
she would come back

376
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,500
after recuperating abroad.

377
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,390
When she and Liu Ming ran out behind my back,

378
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,930
she told my mother-in-law

379
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,350
she was pregnant with Liu Ming's child.

380
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,860
So my mother-in-law

381
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,120
supported them to transfer all the fortunes

382
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,840
secretly

383
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,040
and went abroad.

384
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,480
Wen Li has only one belly.

385
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,880
How could she

386
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,540
get pregnant with two men's babies at the same time?

387
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,810
She's not pregnant at all.

388
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,300
Impossible.

389
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,570
I don't believe it.

390
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,180
I know Wen Li went abroad.

391
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,400
I know she's sad about the loss of the baby.

392
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,320
Although she's abroad,

393
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,790
she often writes letters to me.

394
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,270
I keep the letters.

395
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,300
No need to say.

396
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,690
Those letters are the power to

397
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,760
keep you here.

398
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,720
Of course.

399
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,720
She must say

400
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
what you're suffering now

401
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,470
is for your love.

402
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,910
After you get out of prison,

403
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,030
you will continue

404
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,530
to live happily together.

405
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,060
How do you know?

406
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,270
Of course, I know.

407
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,920
I'm a woman.

408
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,780
If I want to gain the trust of a man,

409
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,100
I can do the same.

410
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,830
You mean

411
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,210
she lied to me.

412
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm not an innocent kid.

413
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
Do you believe

414
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,950
after three years, when you get out,

415
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:11,150
you will see the assets you transferred

416
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,610
are all under her name.

417
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,820
You are penniless.

418
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:16,250
Your wife and child will never accept you again.

419
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,170
In the end,

420
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,400
you lose your family,

421
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,440
your reputation,

422
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,990
and your property.

423
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,180
Wen Li isn't that kind of person.

424
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,160
I don't believe you.

425
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,820
I'm imprisoned.

426
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,010
I can't verify

427
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:32,850
what you said.

428
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,940
Mr. Sun,

429
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,350
according to our judgment of Wen Li,

430
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,840
no matter how much money she stole from you and Liu Ming,

431
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,440
it can't satisfy her desire.

432
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,880
Now that she has made you prisoned,

433
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,630
maybe she has left Liu Ming alone.

434
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,980
Did you say she has been writing letters to you?

435
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,510
Yes.

436
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,790
At first, she wrote once a week,

437
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,200
and then half a month.

438
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,590
Did she send you letters recently?

439
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,190
You lost contact with her recently, right?

440
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,170
I have been waiting to receive her letter for three months.

441
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,310
I think

442
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,440
something happened to her.

443
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,250
Sun,

444
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,870
it's not embarrassing to be cheated.

445
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,520
But if you know you were fooled

446
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,990
and keep lying to yourself,

447
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,510
it doesn't make sense.

448
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,720
I don't believe it.

449
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,160
Wen Li loves

450
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,960
me.

451
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,380
I know it clearly.

452
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,650
Mr. Sun,

453
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,630
when she had affairs with you,

454
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,360
she was also seducing Liu Ming.

455
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:41,550
This is

456
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,480
the material of the company registered

457
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,410
by her, Liu Ming, and his mother.

458
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:48,030
The company's name is Mingxin.

459
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,130
Is there a part of the money

460
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,670
transferred from your company

461
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,590
to this account?

462
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,000
The evidence is solid.

463
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,960
Do you still want to believe her?

464
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,040
I'll say.

465
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,370
What do you want to know?

466
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,350
I'll tell you everything.

467
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,790
For this project,

468
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,400
I tend to use Plan B.

469
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,070
What do you think?

470
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,960
If we use Plan B,

471
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,680
it'll be hard to satisfy everyone in profit.

472
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,770
I prefer Plan A.

473
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,410
Plan B seems to have a strong sense of design,

474
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,710
but it's not practical

475
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,580
with a low profit.

476
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,850
In real estate,

477
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,460
we must pursue more than just profit.

478
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,630
Shouldn't we have a higher pursuit?

479
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:55,790
Huading.

480
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,150
I have to refute you.

481
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:02,390
The most important thing in a real estate company

482
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:03,500
is to make money.

483
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,190
If you want to be an artist,

484
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,240
you can teach in school.

485
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,040
Our partner,

486
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,430
Liu Ming's company, also sent a representative here, right?

487
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,670
Which house

488
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,030
are you more willing to sell as an agency?

489
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:20,070
I can't represent our company.

490
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,550
But since Mr. Sun asked me,

491
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,160
I'll tell you my opinion.

492
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,630
I think

493
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,790
Plan B is much better than A in an all-around way.

494
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,490
If I were a consumer,

495
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,430
I would choose Plan B's house.

496
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,700
Youth doesn't consider practical elements.

497
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,760
All right, no discussion.

498
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,430
Plan A.

499
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,440
You seem to forget

500
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,620
I'm the president

501
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,550
of the company.

502
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,600
Plan A, then.

503
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,510
What do you mean by the meeting today?

504
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,880
Nothing.

505
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,350
Nothing?

506
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,900
You were against me in front of so many people.

507
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,410
Plan B has no profit at all.

508
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,990
The company needs to make money,

509
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,450
not to help you achieve your dream.

510
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,500
You're hopeless.

511
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,920
You are the hopeless one.

512
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,530
You can't do anything.

513
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,150
Dare you say it again?

514
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,340
Who is still here so late?

515
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,340
Mr. Sun.

516
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,150
You...

517
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,960
You're…

518
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,160
Wen Li.

519
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:55,920
Yes.

520
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,520
Why don't you go back to your company?

521
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,750
Well,

522
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:02,120
after listening to your speech today,

523
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,670
I have some detailed problems

524
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,910
about the Plan B design.

525
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:08,310
So I stay here to sort out some information.

526
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,510
I've told your company's staff.

527
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,580
I'll go back after I finish these.

528
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,390
Mr. Sun, did you drink?

529
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,990
There is a strong alcohol smell.

530
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,390
Let me get you some water.

531
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,650
Okay, please send it to my office.

532
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,670
Okay.

533
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,470
Mr. Sun,

534
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,730
have some honey water, please.

535
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,240
Thank you.

536
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,880
Is there honey in the company?

537
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,440
I bought it downstairs.

538
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,280
Drink it.

539
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,630
Thank you.

540
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,700
Wen Li.

541
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,520
Do you really like Plan B?

542
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,280
Of course, I like it very much.

543
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:07,010
Look.

544
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,040
It's…

545
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,910
In my eyes,

546
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,250
she was like a breeze

547
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,120
and a piece of paper.

548
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,650
Looking her figure, I felt at ease.

549
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,680
No matter what I said,

550
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,040
she would write it down in a notebook

551
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,390
and implement it carefully without hesitation.

552
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,910
If she didn't do it well,

553
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,370
she would cry secretly.

554
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,810
Are you okay?

555
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,000
It had been a long time

556
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:59,380
that a woman trusted me

557
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,670
and admired me.

558
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,520
The feeling

559
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,830
is good.

560
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,010
This is my new design.

561
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,000
If you want,

562
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,280
it will be yours.

563
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:15,810
So beautiful, Mr. Sun.

564
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,310
Here.

565
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,410
Mr. Sun,

566
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,090
is this the gym you mentioned?

567
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:31,360
It's so convenient.

568
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,020
It doesn't even need to go out.

569
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,680
This is my favourite among all your designs.

570
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,070
Mr. Sun, I admire you so much.

571
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,040
I didn't expect

572
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,600
a middle-aged man to fall in love like a young man.

573
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,990
But it happened naturally.

574
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,970
You were wrong about something.

575
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,180
The money I transferred

576
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,030
is not into

577
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,380
the company you showed me just now.

578
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,190
In her name,

579
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:31,380
I established a company abroad

580
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,980
and transferred the money

581
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,330
in the form of business dealings.

582
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
I knew

583
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,380
the shareholders

584
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:43,510
were investigating me.

585
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:46,970
That was why I transferred all the shares of the abroad company

586
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,510
to Wen Li.

587
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,690
After I was imprisoned,

588
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,140
my wife divorced me.

589
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,380
The child belonged to her.

590
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,370
But I've always been calm,

591
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,710
because I know

592
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,210
I have Wen Li,

593
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:09,190
and I have money hidden overseas.

594
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,340
I thought she would wait for me.

595
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,220
When I get out,

596
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,280
I will spend the rest of my life with her

597
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:27,070
and be a perfect couple.

598
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:36,760
Qiu Hua.

599
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:40,060
I feel chills.

600
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,670
The image of Wen Li mentioned by Sun Huading

601
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,820
is not like the bunny I knew.

602
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:47,130
Wen Li.

603
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:49,340
Look at the desk you were wiping. Are you drawing a map?

604
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
Okay, I'm coming.

605
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,990
I asked you to put the parcel on the table.

606
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,020
Where did you put it?

607
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,710
It's still in the mailroom. I didn't get it.

608
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:55,730
I'll go now.

609
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,590
I'm sorry.

610
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,730
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

611
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,680
Are you blind, or do you do it on purpose?

612
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,200
This is a rag.

613
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,950
I didn't mean it.

614
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,290
Let me send it to the dry-cleaners.

615
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,150
Dry-clean? It takes a lot of work.

616
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,180
Do you know how much my clothes cost?

617
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,670
What happened?

618
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,700
She did it on purpose.

619
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:14,580
My clothes cost over 6,000 yuan.

620
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,660
Let me see.

621
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,510
Ms. Xu, calm down.

622
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,050
Let me see if you're hurt.

623
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,750
My arm is fine.

624
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:19,670
It's okay, Ms. Xu.

625
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,960
It's okay. Definitely.

626
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,410
The coat I wore last time

627
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,530
costs over 9,000 yuan.

628
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,480
The wine was spilt all over it.

629
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,140
Then the dry-cleaning shop made it clean.

630
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,400
It's absolutely fine. Don't worry.

631
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,390
Luo Yingzi.

632
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,580
What do you mean?

633
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,310
Didn't she clean for you?

634
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,960
She spilled water on me.

635
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,150
I didn't ask her to do it.

636
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,550
She did it herself.

637
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,760
Wen Li.

638
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,560
Are you willing to do it?

639
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,400
Yes, I am.

640
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,710
You're wrong then.

641
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,590
All the people in the big office

642
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,310
have nothing to do.

643
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,960
If you do all our work,

644
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,070
and our boss sees it,

645
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:53,010
will he praise you or criticize us?

646
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,430
Don't do these things anymore.

647
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,110
We all have hands.

648
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,060
Why can't we

649
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,160
do it ourselves?

650
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,700
Go back to your work.

651
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,900
I found out later that I knew nothing about her.

652
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:05,230
Before the incident,

653
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,630
we had known each other for more than a year.

654
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,470
But I had no idea

655
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,270
how she joined our institution.

656
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,310
She was

657
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,010
a non-staff.

658
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,750
You've been here for so long,

659
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,950
but I haven't had a proper chat with you.

660
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,270
How did you join the institution?

661
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,030
Well,

662
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,230
have you ever thought of

663
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,030
finding a more interesting job?

664
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,700
It's not that easy.

665
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:33,890
Wen Li.

666
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,690
Where are you from?

667
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,670
Like you,

668
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,230
I am a Beijing drifter.

669
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,430
I find that

670
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,140
Beijing drifters have an advantage.

671
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,600
Everyone struggles alone

672
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:48,100
and has no background.

673
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,330
You're right.

674
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,450
But if you've thought it through,

675
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,440
you can't let them bully you.

676
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,260
In the future,

677
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:01,110
when they ask you to buy food,

678
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:02,650
do cleaning,

679
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,990
or make coffee,

680
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,370
ignore them.

681
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:06,090
Refrain from following their words.

682
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,130
Ignore them.

683
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,080
I can't be as brave as you.

684
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,850
I'm a temporary worker.

685
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,480
So what?

686
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
A temporary worker is also a worker.

687
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,290
If they bully you again,

688
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,540
tell me.

689
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,030
I'll teach them a lesson.

690
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,690
Thank you.

691
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,280
You're welcome.

692
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,460
Okay.

693
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,190
I'll rely on you from now on.

694
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,080
No problem.

695
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,760
Then we became so-called best friends.

696
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,840
When she lost her job,

697
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:42,370
I introduced her to Liu Ming's company.

698
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,900
Until

699
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:45,510
I found that she went missing together

700
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,240
with Liu Ming,

701
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,040
I suddenly realized that

702
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,150
I really don't know anything about her.

703
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:53,740
I wonder

704
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,690
whether Wen Li is her real name.

705
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,210
It's not all your fault.

706
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,710
You don't know

707
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:00,270
she is a vampire hiding quietly,

708
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,310
measuring the people around

709
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,740
and looking for her prey.

710
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,200
She has a keen intuition

711
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,400
to find out the prey easy to fool

712
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,220
and the one who has blood to suck.

713
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,880
Once she finds a target,

714
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,120
she will pounce

715
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,870
and suck his blood quickly and ruthlessly.

716
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,120
While anaesthetizing the aim,

717
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,780
she doesn't let him realize it

718
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,980
until she sucks all the blood on the prey

719
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,750
and goes to the next target.

720
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:25,770
Such a person

721
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,360
will always be on the road

722
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,960
and never stops.

723
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,190
So Wen Li and Liu Ming

724
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,780
won't live with money.

725
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,190
She must be back.

726
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,320
Maybe at this moment,

727
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,880
she has already found the next target.

728
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,180
Interesting.

729
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,310
I bumped into it again.

730
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,390
What's wrong?

731
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:48,630
I once took such a case.

732
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,940
A woman met a boss.

733
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,400
They got married a few days after they fell in love.

734
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,390
After three months,

735
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:57,720
she took away tens of millions of dollars.

736
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,960
In the end, she used all kinds of means

737
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,060
to force the man to commit suicide.

738
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,940
Her actions

739
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,970
are legal.

740
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,450
The law can't punish her.

741
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,580
Wen Li must be stronger than this woman.

742
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,980
I am curious to know how many people she has lied to.

743
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,850
I wonder

744
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,780
how many people she's lying to.

745
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,570
You are all here.

746
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,860
How's the investigation going?

747
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:26,960
My classmate told me

748
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,310
Liu Ming

749
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,030
seems to be living alone.

750
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,040
He has an unkempt and unwashed appearance.

751
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,880
He doesn't go out or socialize.

752
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,550
The thing he does most every day

753
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,480
is to check the mailbox at the gate.

754
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,810
Needless to say,

755
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,670
like Sun Huading,

756
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,520
Liu Ming is locked here by her letters

757
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:46,010
every week or half a month.

758
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,210
She should have flown far and high

759
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,280
with their money.

760
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:54,560
Luo Yingzi.

761
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,330
For you,

762
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,290
I'd like to lose again.

763
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,910
But this time,

764
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,550
we must catch her.

765
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:04,730
I will.

766
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,890
You're going to lose your house.

767
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,470
I know.

768
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,910
There will be a price to pay

769
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,320
to catch her.

770
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,030
The house is part of the price.

771
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,860
Lanlan, you are back.

772
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,070
Lanlan, is that you?

773
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,620
Yingzi.

774
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,680
They hit me.

775
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,450
It's different this time.

776
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,780
Not only his wife,

777
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:08,230
but Zhou also beat me with her.

778
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,130
Zhou

779
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,380
gave me the house he bought from you.

780
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:20,460
His wife found out about it

781
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,530
and came here today.

782
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,510
Then we got into a fight.

783
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,890
But Zhou is a jerk.

784
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,150
He helped his wife

785
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,070
beat me.

786
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,260
Yingzi.

787
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,990
You know

788
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:42,860
he loves me.

789
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,740
We are true love.

790
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,150
I don't believe so.

791
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,640
I'm young and pretty.

792
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:54,240
His wife is an old woman.

793
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:55,950
I...

794
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,880
Why did I lose?

795
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,950
Why didn't you say anything?

796
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,460
Have a seat.

797
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:39,900
Have some water.

798
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,510
Lanlan,

799
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:49,050
you have to understand it.

800
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,710
They are a family.

801
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,460
He will help his wife if something happens,

802
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,430
because that's his child's mother.

803
00:37:59,010 --> 00:37:59,840
And you?

804
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,360
True love?

805
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,950
You don't have love.

806
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:07,920
You're his mistress.

807
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
You told me

808
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,990
to stay out of your business.

809
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,560
If my memory is correct,

810
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,690
this is the second time you are beaten.

811
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,300
Let me tell you the truth.

812
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,650
If you still won't come to your senses,

813
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,080
there will be another battery.

814
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,880
And you'll be beaten even worse next time.

815
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,530
We are adults.

816
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:36,670
You have to be responsible for your choice.

817
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,760
The medicine is here.

818
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,470
And the towel and clothes.

819
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,600
Deal with the wounds first.

820
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,760
Have a rest and take a shower.

821
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,850
Then get changed

822
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,880
and have a good sleep.

823
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,280
I hope you can make a fresh start

824
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,020
tomorrow morning.

825
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,050
I have other things to do.

826
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,750
That's all.

827
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:22,250
I won't give up hope.

828
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,540
It's for you, Yingzi.

829
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,980
I'm going in.

830
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
Who is it?

831
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,320
Righteous Luo.

832
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,860
What are you doing here?

833
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,620
How do you know I live here?

834
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,260
Are you spying on me?

835
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Why am I?

836
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,530
Are you that charming?

837
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:18,840
How do you know

838
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:19,750
I live here?

839
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,430
I took you home when you were drunk last time.

840
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,620
Impossible.

841
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:26,890
I remember

842
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,510
I only asked you to send me downstairs,

843
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,860
-not… -Not upstairs.

844
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,360
You pointed at your newspaper box.

845
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,430
You asked me to drive your car back

846
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,940
and put the car key in the newspaper box.

847
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,340
-Your address is on your box. -Okay, I know.

848
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,230
The house is just so-so.

849
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,920
Don't go inside.

850
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,390
It's all because of you.

851
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,750
What are you doing here?

852
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
Let me have a seat.

853
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,830
No way.

854
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,150
Your key chain

855
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,350
might have dropped in my car.

856
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,930
So I brought it to you.

857
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,890
Forget it. I don't want it now that you've touched it.

858
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,750
Then throw it away when you leave.

859
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,080
Do you really not want it?

860
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:08,600
Yes.

861
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,200
Then I'll tell everyone

862
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,920
this is a love token

863
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,350
from Mrs. Luo.

864
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,240
Lanlan,

865
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,400
take it and throw it into the trash can.

866
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,670
Sir, have some water.

867
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,050
Thank you.

868
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,800
Your attitude changed so fast.

869
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,830
Be careful of him.

870
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,160
He's a famous hooligan.

871
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,200
-What are you talking about? -Famous Lady.

872
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,150
Are you done?

873
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,680
I have something important.

874
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,480
What is it?

875
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,850
The trial of your case is about to begin. Do you know that?

876
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,740
No need to remind me.

877
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,690
The court sent the summon earlier.

878
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:42,150
There will be no other outcome then.

879
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:44,190
You can't keep your house.

880
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,320
Didn't you find a measure

881
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,550
with your lawyer?

882
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,320
Why don't you tell me?

883
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,250
Chen Wuliang.

884
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,920
What are you trying to say?

885
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,550
You asked the bank to take my house away

886
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,380
with barbaric means.

887
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,680
It's strange.

888
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,820
My lawyer is not worried.

889
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,970
What are you worried about?

890
00:41:57,970 --> 00:41:59,190
As a plaintiff's lawyer,

891
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,500
you come to talk about it with the defendant.

892
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,330
What are you thinking?

893
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,380
Tell me.

894
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,510
Nothing.

895
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,140
Just remind you kindly.

896
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,080
Actually, you have another choice.

897
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:11,840
You...

898
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,330
It's none of your business

899
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:15,010
of my choice, Chen Wuliang.

900
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:15,960
Anything else?

901
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,340
Go back if you don't.

902
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,270
Lanlan,

903
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,530
see the guest out.

904
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:20,640
Lock the door.

905
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,190
There are many bad guys now.

906
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,830
You are so cold.

907
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,050
My kindness

908
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:28,080
has never been awarded.

909
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,480
Bye.

910
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,770
Call me if you need anything.

911
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:31,690
I'll answer it.

912
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:33,220
Bye, Righteous Luo.

913
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,180
Bye, Sir.

914
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,160
I won't call you.
