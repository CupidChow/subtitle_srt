[Episode 27]

4
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,210
But let me tell you.

5
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,640
Those who are capable

6
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,430
are capable everywhere.

7
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,210
Even if you knock him back to earth

8
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:42,670
and bury him,

9
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,360
he will rise again.

10
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:48,550
I believe you.

11
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,390
You have the ability.

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,080
So, you should reward yourself

13
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,920
since you gave yourself a chance to make a comeback.

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,390
Wait.

15
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,800
I have another condition.

16
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:06,780
Go ahead.

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,270
You don't want your husband,

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
your ex-husband,

19
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,870
to go to jail, right?

20
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,910
Your lawyers have something.

21
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,390
My condition is that,

22
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,940
regardless of what happens,

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,220
they can't submit it.

24
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,240
You're joking.

25
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,410
How would they listen to me?

26
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,690
Of course, they do.

27
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,010
They are your lawyers.

28
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,070
They represent you

29
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,690
in order to make money.

30
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,970
Give them some more.

31
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,400
What?

32
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,600
I gave you so much money,

33
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,000
more than a billion yuan.

34
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,650
You're not going to be stingy on this, are you?

35
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:52,700
Okay.

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,430
I accept it.

37
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,320
But you have to tell me now

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,870
what evidence they have.

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,740
Ms. Tian, here is tea and soda water.

40
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,160
Which one would you like?

41
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,540
Anything. Thank you.

42
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,220
Here are some fruits for you.

43
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,590
I'm not good at cutting. Hope you don't mind.

44
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,520
Mr. Tian, we returned triumphant.

45
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:19,000
Your bottom line is 50 million yuan,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,740
and we made a deal for 30 million yuan.

47
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,010
Yeah, I didn't expect that.

48
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,290
You guys are amazing.

49
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:23,910
Thank you.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,590
Have you read the divorce papers that we drafted for you?

51
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,090
Is there anything that needs to be adjusted?

52
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:28,820
I've read it.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,870
I think it's good.

54
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,340
There's nothing to modify.

55
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,730
Let's sign it as soon as possible.

56
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,970
By the way, Ms. Tian,

57
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,829
you need to pay the remaining fees

58
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:39,160
to our firm's account as soon as possible.

59
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,430
Of course.

60
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,090
But I have a condition.

61
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,210
Go ahead.

62
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,390
You have evidence

63
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,480
that Yang Weida raped the girl.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,840
I need you to give it to me.

65
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,160
You can't use it

66
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,670
or give it to your client.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,080
Ms. Tian,

68
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,760
we are your divorce lawyers.

69
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,080
It has nothing to do with our other clients.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,370
It has nothing to do with others,

71
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,230
but it has something to do with me.

72
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,160
If Yang Waida knew

73
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,220
that he might become a rapist one day,

74
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,550
he wouldn't agree to

75
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,670
any request I make.

76
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,589
That's why we suggest you

77
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,390
divorce him as soon as possible.

78
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,320
Let me tell you the truth.

79
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,590
Yang Weida knows you have evidence against him.

80
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,410
That's the deal he made with me.

81
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,760
I have to get that evidence.

82
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,230
Ms. Tian,

83
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,030
we have no right to give you the evidence,

84
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,950
and we can't guarantee that we won't use it.

85
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,620
If we hide or destroy any evidence,

86
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,990
it's a crime.

87
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,800
We can't do that.

88
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,909
You really can't do that?

89
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,790
Let me analyze the situation first.

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Since you have the evidence,

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,280
why didn't you give it to Miss Xia the first time?

92
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,710
Instead, you urged me to get a divorce as soon as possible.

93
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,460
Why?

94
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,400
Because you want to make money.

95
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,610
Making money is not a shameful thing.

96
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,010
If you want to make money,

97
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:08,000
then you have to make big money.

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,240
Name your price.

99
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,610
Ms. Tian, why don't you understand?

100
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,850
Since something exists in this world,

101
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,360
it can't be completely wiped off the world.

102
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,520
Even if we don't say it,

103
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,830
someone else will.

104
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,270
If others say it, I'll go to them.

105
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,160
Now, you two are the first ones to take care of.

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:32,710
You can't take care of us.

108
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:36,860
Our attorney-client relationship is not over yet.

109
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,060
Are you really not going to give it to me?

110
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,020
We'd rather not represent you

111
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,870
and give the evidence to the victim

112
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,560
if that's your condition.

113
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,510
Yang Weida has been our partner for years.

114
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,050
If he were to be jailed because of this case,

115
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,200
our company's reputation

116
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,130
would be significantly impacted.

117
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,010
Let alone, he is our shareholder.

118
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,800
Our company is now an important client of yours.

119
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,390
I hope you can think

120
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,650
of the best interests of our company.

121
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,660
Okay, Mr. Dong.

122
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,890
I'll think about it carefully.

123
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,620
Don't worry.

124
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,890
Okay, bye.

125
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:37,920
Hello?

126
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,020
Mrs. Fang,

127
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,750
Mrs. Yang from the Weida Group wants to see you.

128
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:42,790
Let her in.

129
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:43,580
Okay.

130
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,290
That soon?

131
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,250
Mrs. Fang.

132
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,700
I’ve heard a lot about you, Mrs. Fang.

133
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,260
Hello.

134
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Hello, Mrs. Yang.

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,360
My surname is Tian.

136
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,690
You can call me Ms. Tian.

137
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,210
Hello, Ms. Tian.

138
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,240
Ms. Dong must have called you, right?

139
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,200
Your lawyers

140
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,610
are handling my divorce,

141
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,170
which makes me your client.

142
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,470
I believe I am one of the big clients

143
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,240
in your firm.

144
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,010
I'm here today for one thing only.

145
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,460
No matter how horrible Yang Weida is,

146
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,330
we're husband and wife after all.

147
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,110
Besides, we haven't officially divorced yet.

148
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,850
So what happened later is very important to me.

149
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,250
It's directly related to

150
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,340
whether I can smoothly divorce him.

151
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,110
More importantly,

152
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,390
it will affect my interests.

153
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,159
I know you have evidence.

154
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,940
As your client,

155
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:50,470
I want you to not disclose this evidence

156
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,100
under any circumstances,

157
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,730
or use it.

158
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,980
As long as I can divorce him

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,490
and take over our group,

160
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,380
I'll offer you a significant reward.

161
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,990
I'll entrust our group's legal affairs

162
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,300
to your firm.

163
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,950
As for the fees,

164
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,720
you can name your price.

165
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,980
We can talk about this.

166
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,720
Thank you for your trust in our firm.

167
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,930
But if Yang Weida is involved in the crime,

168
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,750
we can't hide his evidence.

169
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,730
I'm your client now.

170
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,090
Isn't your first mission

171
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,500
to ensure my interests?

172
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,900
That's why we're keeping this evidence

173
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,030
under wraps for now.

174
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,679
But if this evidence exists,

175
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,850
Yang Weida won't divorce me smoothly.

176
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,260
By then, my loss

177
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,680
will be significant.

178
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:49,070
I'll think about it carefully.

179
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,340
I like communicating with wise people.

180
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,580
I can understand that young people

181
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,170
won't think about the bigger picture.

182
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,970
But you're a skilled barrister.

183
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,450
You'll take all things into consideration.

184
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,390
It's a win-win.

185
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,690
I hope you can consider it.

186
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,290
I'll wait for your call.

187
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,200
Okay.

188
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,190
I'll leave you to your work.

189
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,130
See you.

190
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,550
The choices are in front of us.

191
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,010
On the one hand, it's an annual consultant fee of 1 million yuan.

192
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,710
On the other hand, it's a case

193
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,150
once it's revealed, it'll become a public prosecution.

194
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,880
It'll have nothing to do with us.

195
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,830
What should we choose?

196
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,100
What do you think we should choose?

197
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,300
Let me say something.

198
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,180
What does it have to do with us,

199
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,030
once it has become a public prosecution case?

200
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,110
We won't make any money from it

201
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,390
or earn a good reputation.

202
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,970
It's like cutting off our nose to spite our face.

203
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:56,120
But we can't hide evidence of a crime.

204
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,030
But the law also doesn't require us

205
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,630
to provide evidence against our client.

206
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,600
What are you talking about?

207
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,840
This is a crime.

208
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,990
We need to make money

209
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,470
and uphold justice.

210
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,470
We are lawyers.

211
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,720
We have to speak boldly to uphold justice.

212
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,330
We can’t just see money.

213
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,700
Fang,

214
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,820
I support you.

215
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:29,460
Can you please stop mopping the floor?

216
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,170
The firm doesn't hire you to mop the floor.

217
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,120
What will those partners decide?

218
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,900
Do we have to think about it?

219
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,160
They won't give up the money, even if they're risking their lives.

220
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,560
That's true.

221
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,020
But once the video

222
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,650
is released,

223
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,720
it will become a case of public prosecution.

224
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,630
Then it will have nothing to do with us.

225
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:49,180
Right.

226
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,030
Not only will we get nothing,

227
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,260
but a good reputation for justice.

228
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,320
How about...

229
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,530
Forget it.

230
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,680
Let's wait for their decision.

231
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,310
If they decide not to make it public,

232
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,580
let's pretend it never happened.

233
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,710
But I think...

234
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,530
It did happen, right?

235
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,350
Do you really think your name is Righteous Luo?

236
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,540
Are you crazy?

237
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,350
Yes, yes, yes.

238
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,750
I'll beat you up.

239
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,190
Come on, kick me.

240
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:25,920
Wait.

241
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,970
Kick me later.

242
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,140
Hello, this is Luo Yingzi.

243
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,760
Mrs. Luo. There are some people at the door looking for you.

244
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,310
Okay.

245
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,450
Just tell the lawyers when they come.

246
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,610
It's okay.

247
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:39,480
Mrs. Luo.

248
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,550
Guo Yu.

249
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,080
They are...

250
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,920
These are the witnesses I found.

251
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,580
Witnesses?

252
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,510
They all worked at Yang Weida's company.

253
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,770
Or, Yang Weida visited them in person.

254
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,710
They have all been sexually harassed by Yang Weida before

255
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,400
and have evidence in their hands.

256
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,510
And they're all following my case.

257
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,610
They all think that Yang Weida went too far.

258
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,780
So, they came to me.

259
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,420
You all have evidence?

260
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,430
I have messages from him.

261
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,120
Look.

262
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,810
His intention is so obvious. He's so shameless.

263
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,560
Because of him,

264
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm afraid to go to work.

265
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,420
After I resigned,

266
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:14,130
he deducted my last month's salary.

267
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,830
He came to my house to visit me

268
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:17,750
during the winter break of my second year of college.

269
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,080
He was sitting on my bed.

270
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,300
My parents were still cooking for him in the kitchen.

271
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,430
He is so disgusting.

272
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,320
I have many chat records between him and me.

273
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:29,590
I have a letter of apology from him after what happened.

274
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:30,780
You can read it.

275
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,580
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

276
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,750
we have so many witnesses

277
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,390
and so much evidence.

278
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,810
If I sue him again,

279
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,880
can we win?

280
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,710
Qiu Hua.

281
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,180
I'm not afraid of you calling me Righteous Luo.

282
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,860
Seeing so many victims,

283
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,860
I really can't cover it up for him

284
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,210
in exchange for money.

285
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,770
But...

286
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
Yingzi, Qiu Hua.

287
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm so mad.

288
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,210
Those partners are ridiculous.

289
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,730
I'll definitely support you.

290
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,120
For what?

291
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,760
We haven't decided yet.

292
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,300
You have another choice?

293
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,890
Yes.

294
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,620
There are only two choices in this world.

295
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,310
One is difficult and the other one is easy.

296
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,770
It depends on your choice.

297
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,240
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

298
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,780
Mrs. Fang wants to see you.

299
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:20,070
Okay.

300
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,080
Mrs. Fang.

301
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,270
How long will it take for Ha Linlin to get clean this time?

302
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,150
Half a year.

303
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,490
Before she gets out of rehab,

304
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,450
you must keep that evidence secret

305
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,160
and don't reveal it.

306
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,370
Xia Linlin isn't our client.

307
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,410
We have no obligation to visit her, right?

308
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,020
How about this?

309
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,490
You two use the six months

310
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,490
to help Mrs. Yang.

311
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:57,170
Six months is enough to get a divorce.

312
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,890
Ms. Tian, sorry to keep you waiting.

313
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,600
Mrs. Fang.

314
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,420
Have a seat.

315
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:07,930
Okay.

316
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,740
Ms. Tian, we really hope

317
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,340
to have a long-term cooperation with your company.

318
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,980
So...

319
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,080
So we have reached a consensus?

320
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,950
Thank you.

321
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,720
Here is the thing. Ms. Tian.

322
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,790
Since you hand over your divorce case to us,

323
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,050
we will take full responsibility for you.

324
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,160
So we decided

325
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,490
that we would keep the evidence secret

326
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:38,540
until the victim was discharged.

327
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:39,880
No one else will find out

328
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,410
about the evidence from us.

329
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,100
So, your decision is

330
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,850
not to destroy it?

331
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:50,470
Destroying evidence is a crime.

332
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,350
Ms. Tian, look.

333
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,720
That girl needs to stay in the rehabilitation center for six months.

334
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,110
In the next six months,

335
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,170
your case will be long over.

336
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,080
If Yang Weida knew

337
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,590
that he might end up in jail one day,

338
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,910
he wouldn't divorce me easily.

339
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,830
If he knew

340
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,000
that he'd become a rapist sooner or later,

341
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,950
do you think sexual harassment is a threat to him?

342
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,680
Do you?

343
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,220
Mrs. Yang.

344
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,490
Call me Ms. Tian.

345
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,400
Yang Weida raped a girl.

346
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,480
He ruined her life.

347
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,560
Don't you think

348
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,560
it's out of line to ask us

349
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,110
to destroy the evidence?

350
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,430
No.

351
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,390
I'm your client.

352
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,810
I have the right to make a request.

353
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:41,950
But what we have

354
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,880
is Yang Weida's evidence of crime.

355
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,610
What does it have to do with you?

356
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:46,250
Besides,

357
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,650
I already told you before.

358
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,780
Cats will eventually be out of the bag.

359
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,300
That means you won't do it.

360
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,390
We can't do it.

361
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:57,900
Okay.

362
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:00,770
No problem.

363
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:02,610
It's a two-way choice.

364
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,880
It's time for me to consider my options for representation.

365
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,990
Also, I have to remind you.

366
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,770
Mr. Dong's business will go with me.

367
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,680
Almost a million yuan in annual legal fees.

368
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,020
It’s a large amount.

369
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,030
Actually, Mrs. Fang,

370
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,790
have you thought about it?

371
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,590
It doesn't matter to you

372
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,630
whether Yang Weida goes to prison or not.

373
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:29,600
What matters to you

374
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,230
is nearly a million yuan a year, okay?

375
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,190
Wake up.

376
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,710
Well,

377
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:35,620
as a woman,

378
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,620
have you ever thought about those girls

379
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,840
who were harmed by Yang Weida?

380
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,030
-What about them? -Why should I?

381
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:42,990
It's so ridiculous.

382
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,380
You want me to think for them?

383
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,060
Listen.

384
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,760
Nothing happens for no reason.

385
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,420
I don't think they are some decent girls either.

386
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,830
Mrs. Yang,

387
00:16:59,090 --> 00:16:59,760
please go.

388
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:05,680
Mrs. Yang,

389
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,140
Mrs. Fang has made it very clear just now.

390
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:08,900
Please go.

391
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,020
Why are you here?

392
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,300
Linlin.

393
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,430
How have you been?

394
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,200
You've gained weight.

395
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,250
And you look much better now.

396
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,630
I'm fine.

397
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,010
I get up and exercise every day on time.

398
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,040
I won't do drugs anymore when I get out.

399
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,000
Linlin.

400
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,350
We are here to tell you

401
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,070
that we got the evidence

402
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,770
that Yang Weida raped you.

403
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,030
The CCTV footage in the hotel.

404
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,260
Actually, the footage

405
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,820
was in the hands of your ex-husband, Wang Jianliang.

406
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,090
He wanted to use it to blackmail for money.

407
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,660
So he didn't tell you.

408
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,570
If you use this CCTV footage

409
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,110
to sue Yang Weida for rape,

410
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,800
he won't get away with it.

411
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,810
Linlin,

412
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,040
you've suffered a lot.

413
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,750
The CCTV footage of the hotel

414
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,410
matches what you told us before.

415
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,690
You were forced into the room by him.

416
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,550
Yang Weida will finally be punished this time.

417
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,570
Do you need us to call the police for you?

418
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,270
Do you want us

419
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,130
to represent you in civil claims?

420
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,280
Ask him for civil compensation.

421
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,100
We have two contracts today.

422
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,750
If you agree, sign here.

423
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,900
I still have my underwear from that day.

424
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:11,920
I thought,

425
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,380
"What if this day comes?"

426
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,820
This day has finally come.

427
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,450
Mr. Dong,

428
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,800
if you wish to terminate our representation,

429
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,810
we can do so now.

430
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,390
But are you sure?

431
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,330
Yang Weida is going to jail soon.

432
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,510
At this time,

433
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,370
what will others think if you choose to stand with him

434
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,870
and endorse him?

435
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:01,040
Have you thought about the consequences

436
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,640
of your company's behavior?

437
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:06,980
Mrs. Fang,

438
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,880
I’m really sorry.

439
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:11,870
I had no choice.

440
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,630
Yang Weida's wife coerced me.

441
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,360
If Yang Weida is really going to jail,

442
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,390
why should we

443
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,010
go against our lawyers,

444
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,040
right?

445
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,280
Your two lawyers

446
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,550
are really good.

447
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:29,550
How about this?

448
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,710
I've decided

449
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,210
to continue working with you.

450
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,230
Thank you so much.

451
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:45,350
Yingzi.

452
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:49,510
When I wanted to drop Guo Yu's case

453
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,340
in order to represent Mrs. Yang,

454
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,200
you didn't say anything,

455
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,280
but you looked down on me in your heart, didn't you?

456
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,120
No.

457
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,990
I think you're amazing.

458
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,430
You guessed what was behind it

459
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,410
when you saw Yang Weida

460
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,650
with a young new secretary

461
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,080
and then found Mrs. Yang.

462
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,520
To be honest, Qiu Hua,

463
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,380
you could make a great detective.

464
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:17,550
I always

465
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,550
feel inferior when I'm around you.

466
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,480
Because, even if you're in the mud,

467
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,540
you can still live with a smile on your face.

468
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,350
I can't.

469
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,770
Even if I make a lot of money

470
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,310
and have financial freedom,

471
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,430
even if I have tens of thousands in my account,

472
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,360
I still dare not spend a penny more.

473
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,840
I always feel like I'm enveloped in shadows.

474
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,230
I always used to take comfort

475
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,030
in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

476
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:50,450
At that time, I thought

477
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,340
only when people solve their livelihood problems

478
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,200
can they have the right to think about other things.

479
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,970
But now I suddenly feel

480
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,350
that people's pursuit of justice, ideals,

481
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,310
and faith

482
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,980
is actually rooted in the heart.

483
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,530
No matter when,

484
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,890
as long as you calm down,

485
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,800
you will find that the string in your heart

486
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,830
is always being strung.

487
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,410
Qiu Hua.

488
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:25,420
From now on,

489
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,520
let's not go to some remote place, okay?

490
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,690
Are you possessed?

491
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,360
One of us being crazy is enough.

492
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,970
Can you be the normal one?

493
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,390
What did you just say?

494
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,340
Mas...

495
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,970
Slow?

496
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,580
Ma what low?

497
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,530
What else did he say?

498
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,290
Talk to me more.

499
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,310
Please take a closer look at the agreement.

500
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,940
Mr. Qiu and I

501
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,100
are willing to file a civil lawsuit against Yang Weida

502
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,870
as your lawyers.

503
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,450
Yang Weida and the Weida Fund

504
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:16,950
sponsored you,

505
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,200
which earned them a lot of social praise.

506
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:24,030
But that doesn't give

507
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:27,110
Yang Weida the right to violate other's character

508
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,070
and sexually harass them.

509
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,950
This behavior is not allowed.

510
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,690
We will demand a public apology

511
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,150
from Yang Weida

512
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,730
and the Weida Fund.

513
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,410
What's more important than the result is,

514
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,670
to tell the truth

515
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:50,330
and reassure the victims in society

516
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,980
who were harassed

517
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,680
that they did nothing wrong.

518
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,350
People should pay for their actions when they abuse their power.

519
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,640
We should encourage

520
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,310
more victims like you in society.

521
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,150
Miss Guo Yu.

522
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,200
There's new progress in the sexual harassment case.

523
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,730
Do you have faith this time?

524
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,860
First of all, thank you

525
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,090
for your ongoing interest in this case.

526
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,900
This time, more victims

527
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,190
are willing to come forward.

528
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:22,210
Their presence

529
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,270
made more people pay attention to this case

530
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,270
and support us.

531
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,630
At the same time, more victims

532
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,890
are coming forward to accuse Yang Weida,

533
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,140
which has also given me greater confidence and courage

534
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,720
to say no to sexual harassment.

535
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,760
Although there have been

536
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,210
only a few successful sexual harassment cases

537
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,670
in previous judicial practice,

538
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,550
I believe

539
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,430
that as long as more people are willing to fight

540
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,230
and confront this problem,

541
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,710
the law will give us

542
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,970
a fair judgment.

543
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,610
I'm standing here today

544
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,480
not just to speak for myself.

545
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,150
As you all know,

546
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,690
Xia Linlin, who was harmed by Yang Weida,

547
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,490
has also reported to the police.

548
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,970
The damage she suffered

549
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,710
is far more than we can understand or imagine.

550
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,350
So, I hope you

551
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,900
can pay attention to her,

552
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,050
just like in my case.

553
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,670
I hope

554
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,280
you don't lose your fair judgment

555
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,190
because of the mistakes she made in the past.

556
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,230
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

557
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,470
I heard you found out

558
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,610
about the sexual assault case involving Yang Weida, right?

559
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,680
It's not us.

560
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,350
It was exposed

561
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,410
by the brave efforts

562
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,890
of countless victims.

563
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,510
We should pay tribute to them.

564
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,670
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

565
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,040
do you have any new expectations

566
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,410
on the court's ruling?

567
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:25,910
The price of sin is death.

568
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,420
Yang Weida deserved it.

569
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,200
The victim is still in the rehabilitation center.

570
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,230
What are your requirements for civil compensation?

571
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,270
The damage to our client

572
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,010
can't be undone.

573
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,900
She summoned her own courage

574
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,240
and exposed Yang Weida.

575
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,690
So, Yang Weida could sit at the defense table today.

576
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,600
We believe

577
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
that our client will have a new life.

578
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,350
Thank you.

579
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,560
For this case...

580
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,600
Mr. Chen is here.

581
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,040
Mr. Chen.

582
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,200
Finally, we've knocked him off his high horse.

583
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,060
Let's go.

584
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:01,660
[Jingbei Court]

585
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,550
All rise.

586
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,870
Your Honor, the court is ready.

587
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,740
You may begin.

588
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,840
Court is in session.

589
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,120
Summon defendant Yang Weida to court.

590
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,590
The defendant, state your name.

591
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,340
Yang Weida.

592
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,030
Your date of birth.

593
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,710
July 8, 1968.

594
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,190
Cheers!

595
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,770
Cheers!

596
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,000
It feels so good.

597
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,190
Today

598
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,120
is the happiest day of the year for me.

599
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:11,740
Of course,

600
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm still a little upset.

601
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,960
Yang Weida was only sentenced to five years.

602
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,880
But he paid the price.

603
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,210
Justice is served.

604
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,280
Although it's a bit late.

605
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,500
Righteous Luo.

606
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:38,870
Ms. Qiu.

607
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,600
You two are celebrating alone.

608
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,270
You won the lawsuit.

609
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,790
How can you not invite me, the loser,

610
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,050
to celebrate with you?

611
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,510
Why are you everywhere, Unscrupulous Chen?

612
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:49,050
I don't think you should only be called Unscrupulous Chen.

613
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,490
We should also call you...

614
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,730
call you...

615
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:53,180
Shameless Chen!

616
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,350
Brazen

617
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,610
Chen.

618
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,070
Why do I find the names you gave me

619
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,280
so pleasing to my ears

620
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,630
as long as they are spoken by you?

621
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,850
When others lose,

622
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,370
they will die of shame.

623
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,670
How dare you still have the mood

624
00:28:06,670 --> 00:28:08,230
to utter such shameless words

625
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,000
in front of us, the victors?

626
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,150
That's enough.

627
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,360
It's not the time when you lost the case and came to scold me,

628
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,800
and I tried to enlighten you.

629
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,230
Without my pushing,

630
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,960
can you win this lawsuit today?

631
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,600
Thank you.

632
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,540
This beer is on me.

633
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,370
That's right.

634
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,860
Here, let's make a toast

635
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,740
to Unscrupulous Chen.

636
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,790
I think

637
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,130
if you die one day,

638
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,170
you can cremate your body anywhere,

639
00:28:37,170 --> 00:28:38,450
except for one place,

640
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,520
your tongue.

641
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,500
And we have to make bacon out of it.

642
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,810
But why did someone

643
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:45,150
suddenly become mute in court today?

644
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,150
I...

645
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:49,100
was defeated by some people.

646
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,960
But, to be honest,

647
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,950
no one has defeated me in the last couple of years.

648
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,510
Really?

649
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,850
You're doomed.

650
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,630
There's more to come.

651
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,770
We will defeat you again and again.

652
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,350
Do you think you can do that?

653
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,030
Yes.

654
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,990
Let's see.

655
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,160
Let's see.

656
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:04,720
Okay.

657
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,990
Let's talk about your case.

658
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,550
It's about to start.

659
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:09,410
If you beg me,

660
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,470
I can ask the bank to let you off the hook.

661
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,340
Stop.

662
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,670
I can be beaten to death,

663
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,770
but not scared to death.

664
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,690
Bring it on.

665
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,520
I just like your personality.

666
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
I like your little attitude.

667
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,360
So great.

668
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,210
Come on, let's drink.

669
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,160
Just take it as a moment of relaxation before the war.

670
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,200
You said the war is coming.

671
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,520
And you have the nerve to drink with the opposing party.

672
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,530
Leave now.

673
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,940
Your last client is in prison.

674
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:33,740
Suck up

675
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,660
to your next client.

676
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,410
I want to suck up to you.

677
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,080
You rascal.

678
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,790
Qiu Hua!

679
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,350
Mr. Han, what are you doing?

680
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,370
I'm so good to you.

681
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,820
How will you thank me?

682
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,450
You are my mentor.

683
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,640
But I'm also a normal man.

684
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,680
I have feelings too.

685
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,740
When did this start?

686
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:02,150
Since the second month

687
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,690
that I started working for him.

688
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,690
At the beginning,

689
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,320
I didn't know what to do.

690
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,420
I even wanted to quit.

691
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,600
But I didn't have many options.

692
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,710
Later, I had a bullet in the chamber.

693
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:17,260
I made these recordings

694
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,370
and left this evidence.

695
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,680
Han Zhitong is a jerk and will always be a jerk.

696
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,110
Qiu Hua.

697
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,720
What are you going to do?

698
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,790
We can take this to the police

699
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:38,660
so that he can at least face administrative punishment.

700
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,220
We're colleagues in the same law firm.

701
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:45,310
Isn't this

702
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,940
too much for him?

703
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:48,860
Mrs. Fang.

704
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,360
He's the one who's being too much.

705
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:55,370
I'm doing this for Qiu Hua's benefit.

706
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:58,050
Do you really want everyone to know?

707
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,070
Mrs. Fang.

708
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:03,320
I hesitated for a long time.

709
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,930
I finally mustered up the courage

710
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,260
to stand in front of you.

711
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,040
I came here mentally prepared.

712
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,570
Qiu Hua, I know

713
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,320
that you have suffered a lot.

714
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,910
As the person in charge,

715
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:26,030
I should have found out about it and stopped him in time.

716
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,290
This is my negligence.

717
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,970
But Qiu Hua,

718
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,210
as a lawyer at our firm,

719
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,870
you should think about the reputation of our firm.

720
00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:37,220
If this gets out

721
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,520
that the partner of Liangcheng firm

722
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,620
sexually harassed his employee,

723
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,570
not only will he be embarrassed,

724
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,370
but our law firm's reputation

725
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:49,200
will also be ruined.

726
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,440
Are you sure you're going to do it?

727
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:54,960
Mrs. Fang.

728
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,230
Even if our good reputation were destroyed,

729
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,830
it'd be him who has ruined it.

730
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:01,420
If

731
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,090
Qiu Hua chooses not to expose it,

732
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,970
there's still tomorrow.

733
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,720
What if others say it in the future?

734
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,260
I know.

735
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,630
I knew it until today.

736
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,830
Qiu Hua,

737
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:20,930
I'll listen to you.

738
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:24,370
Mrs. Fang,

739
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,600
I'm Yau Hua's lawyer.

740
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,410
Our last stand is

741
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,230
that for the reputation of the firm,

742
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:32,630
we can make concessions.

743
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,700
But Han Zhitong himself

744
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,800
must apologize to Qiu Hua

745
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,720
at the firm meeting

746
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,600
and provide financial compensation.

747
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,180
The so-called financial compensation.

748
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,310
We don't want money.

749
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,520
We just want Han Zhitong

750
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,620
to give the unfinished cases

751
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,500
that Qiu Hua assisted him with,

752
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,850
back to her and let her handle them alone.

753
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,690
No problems with the case.

754
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,930
Take away the cases

755
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,090
you handled before,

756
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,980
whether he agrees or not.

757
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,740
But

758
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,390
can we discuss

759
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,630
the public apology?

760
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,980
This is our bottom line.

761
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,740
Have a seat.

762
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,680
As a woman,

763
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,550
I abhor

764
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,100
sexual harassment in the workplace.

765
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:33,010
But as the person in charge of the law firm,

766
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,480
I have to prioritize the firm's interests.

767
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,470
Qiu Hua,

768
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,090
asking him to apologize in public

769
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:43,400
is no different from making it public.

770
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,070
But Qiu Hua has endured

771
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:47,350
his sexual harassment for almost a year.

772
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,200
She is mentally overwhelmed.

773
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,590
She deserves a public apology.

774
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,670
But no one knows about this.

775
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,630
If we make it public,

776
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:57,610
everyone will know.

777
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,290
Are we the ones to be ashamed?

778
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,750
Qiu Hua,

779
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,469
you should be compensated

780
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,639
for what you have gone through.

781
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,199
But as the person in charge of this firm,

782
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,489
I beg you

783
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,290
to make some sacrifices

784
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,750
and compromises

785
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,630
for the reputation of our firm.

786
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,429
Is that okay?

787
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,679
I’ll go find Han Zhicong

788
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,860
and bring him here,

789
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:29,040
and ask him to apologize to Qiu Hua

790
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,830
in front of both of us.

791
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,780
I will give him a warning

792
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:35,530
and ask him not to do it again.

793
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,070
Okay.

794
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,570
For the sake of the firm's reputation,

795
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,340
we're willing to make the final compromise.

796
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,920
Besides the cases we mentioned,

797
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,750
we request Han Zhitong to personally

798
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,389
write a letter of apology

799
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,409
and keep it in our possession.

800
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,670
I'll talk to him now.

801
00:34:59,190 --> 00:34:59,650
Qiu Hua,

802
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,260
unlock your phone.

803
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,520
Wait for me here.

804
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,870
He is getting off easily.

805
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:16,630
Yingzi.

806
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,570
I'm sorry.

807
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,170
Fang Lihong holds a grudge against you

808
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,400
because of me.

809
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:25,070
She may even make things difficult for you in the future.

810
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,420
Don't be sorry.

811
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:28,930
Besides,

812
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,370
is Fang Lihong really that petty?

813
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:33,820
Yes.

814
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,070
Sun,

815
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,370
this is your office.

816
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,240
Normal interns

817
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,580
have a cubicle.

818
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,350
There is no private office for them.

819
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:49,550
Come. Sit down and familiarize yourself with the office.

820
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,930
Your daily task

821
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,200
is to serve me,

822
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,050
both at work and in life.

823
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,870
I'm a workaholic.

824
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,600
I don't sleep or rest when I'm working on a case.

825
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,910
So, I need someone to take care of me.

826
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,840
If you do well,

827
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,090
I can take you on cases.

828
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,790
-I won’t treat you badly. -What are you doing, Han?

829
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,430
Mrs. Fang.

830
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:14,670
You know Mrs. Fang, right?

831
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,560
Yesterday,

832
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,040
she gave a speech

833
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:18,370
when you guys were on your first day here.

834
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,370
Mrs. Fang, hello.

835
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,360
Why is she sitting here?

836
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,210
Didn't you always say

837
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,280
to let the experienced lawyer train the younger ones?

838
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,920
Look, they all fly away when they're full-fledged.

839
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,500
Mentors will starve to death once they have taught their disciples everything.

840
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,200
I have to start from the beginning.

841
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,600
I let Sun be my assistant.

842
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:35,870
Sun.

843
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,110
Go find an empty desk outside.

844
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,870
This place is not for you.

845
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,270
Okay.

846
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,680
Go out and find Mr. Tian.

847
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,290
Okay.

848
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:48,090
It’s none of your business, Fang.

849
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,380
Come in.

850
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,150
Hurry up. I have something to tell you.

851
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,170
Are you going to extend your grabby hands again?

852
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,500
What do you mean by that?

853
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,310
Qiu Hua, you can count on me.

854
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,470
If you're with me...

855
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,540
They actually went to you.

856
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,280
Han Zhitong.

857
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,100
You're old.

858
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,880
Your son is in college, right?

859
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:22,200
Don't you feel ashamed?

860
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,350
Didn't we warn you about that incident

861
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,640
when Ms. Mei was here?

862
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,110
It's only been a few years,

863
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,240
and you did it again!

864
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,500
I didn't do anything.

865
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,160
What else do you want?

866
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:38,470
Do you want to be the next Yang Weida?

867
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:39,930
Don't say that.

868
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,060
How could I do that?

869
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,960
How about I play more recordings for you?

870
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,160
Do you want to hear it?

871
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,930
Listen, this short recording

872
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,660
is enough for you to receive serious punishment.

873
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,330
Do you still want to be a lawyer or not?

874
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:59,870
Do you want your good reputation or not?

875
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,730
How can you face your wife and son?

876
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,500
You're so old.

877
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,340
Once a jerk, always a jerk.

878
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:10,980
I'm sorry.

879
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:12,550
I was wrong.

880
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,310
Listen.

881
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,490
From now on,

882
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,750
no female assistants.

883
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,200
Let's go.

884
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,040
Come with me.

885
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,480
Where?

886
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,410
Qiu Hua and her lawyer

887
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,810
are waiting for you in my office.

888
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,560
Her lawyer?

889
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,360
She hired a lawyer?

890
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,940
She hired a lawyer?

891
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:40,670
Who?

892
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:42,950
Luo Yingzi.

893
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,420
Your good student.

894
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,780
She's so amazing right now.

895
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,990
They threatened you?

896
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,310
These two women are united

897
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,400
and disregard the senior lawyers in the firm.

898
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,690
They've only been here for a few days.

899
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:01,700
Other first-year lawyers don't have a case yet

900
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,050
and they're looking for a case desperately.

901
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,800
They already have an office.

902
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,790
Did you see how arrogant they are?

903
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,860
They can disrespect me today,

904
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,260
and so can they disrespect you tomorrow.

905
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,490
Is our firm still good enough for them?

906
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:17,730
What's the point of saying those?

907
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,350
It's your fault.

908
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,580
Now, apologize

909
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,320
to Qiu Hua.

910
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,320
Apologize to them?

911
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,160
What else do you want?

912
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,980
Are you just going to watch them push their luck?

913
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,900
I have to.

914
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,310
You did it yourself.

915
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,230
They said

916
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,550
that they would go to the police if you didn't apologize.

917
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,350
You'll be ruined then.

918
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,460
Let them call the police if they have the guts.

919
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,260
Let them go.

920
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,730
You're so awesome now.

921
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,050
I’m going to tell them that.

922
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,930
Mrs. Fang.

923
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:01,590
Mrs. Fang!

924
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,020
Mrs... Fang...

925
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,390
Sorry, Qiu Hua.

926
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,790
I was careless

927
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,770
and behaved inappropriately.

928
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:16,360
which caused you pain.

929
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,020
I apologize.

930
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,900
You didn't make it clear.

931
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,040
Tell us what you did to Qiu Hua.

932
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,820
S-S-Sorry, Qiu Hua.

933
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,750
M-M-My behavior...

934
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,890
may have

935
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,110
caused you a misunderstanding.

936
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,850
And make you think...

937
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,330
Well.

938
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,090
It was sexual harassment.

939
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,410
Is it sexual harassment or not?

940
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,180
Sorry, Qiu Hua.

941
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:10,830
I...

942
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,910
I have

943
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,170
sexually harassed you.

944
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,620
I apologize.

945
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:31,870
Qiu Hua.

946
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,740
Mr. Han, as a senior lawyer,

947
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,750
has formally apologized to you.

948
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:38,990
Accept it.

949
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:42,240
Besides, Han,

950
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,760
give the cases in your hands

951
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,320
that were mainly handled by Qiu Hua back to her.

952
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,160
Wh-Wh-What?

953
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:49,700
This is one of the conditions.

954
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,890
And a letter of apology.

955
00:41:58,910 --> 00:41:59,640
What?

956
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,370
They asked you to write a letter of apology

957
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,830
so that Qiu Hua can keep it.

958
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,560
No, I can't write this.

959
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:09,780
Qiu Hua.

960
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,950
I kept you in the firm.

961
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,340
Without me, you wouldn't have found a job.

962
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:18,150
Although I made some mistakes,

963
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,030
you can't chase me into a dead corner.

964
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:24,180
I'm an old man.

965
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,010
I won't be able to live with myself if I leave you something on me.

966
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,460
Qiu Hua.

967
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,760
I believe he won't do it again.

968
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,250
I'm here

969
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:42,350
witnessing everything today.

970
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:43,890
I can testify for you.

971
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,460
Please let him off the hook.

972
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,530
Qiu Hua.

973
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,350
Don't worry.

974
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,380
I recorded everything he said.
