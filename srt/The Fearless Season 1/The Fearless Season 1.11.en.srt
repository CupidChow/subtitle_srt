00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,640
[Episode 11]

4
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,670
Why are you so stubborn?

5
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,039
Your money is money,

6
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,350
and others’ money is not money, right?

7
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,789
I'm telling you, if you make me angry,

8
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,310
I bet you don't even have 80% of it, do you believe that?

9
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,310
I can bring you down

10
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,800
like I could help you out back then.

11
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,950
You figure it out.

12
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,100
Mr. Zhou.

13
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,830
Aren't you Yingzi's housekeeper?

14
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,479
Mr. Zhou.

15
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,600
I'm not her housekeeper.

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,750
My name is Zhang Shilan.

17
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,210
I'm just helping my sister.

18
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:02,190
You really helped a lot

19
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,580
for Ms. Luo.

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,350
I bought you a little something.

21
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,590
I know you don't lack anything,

22
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,789
but it's a token of my appreciation.

23
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,990
It's good for your health.

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,120
Thank Yingzi for me.

25
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,400
But actually, she doesn't have to do this.

26
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,870
Just take me as her brother.

27
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,930
It's not from her.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,610
It's from me.

29
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,780
Well,

30
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:35,470
I have to think of something for her

31
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,070
that she hasn't thought of.

32
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,940
Last time, Yingzi came back,

33
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,750
and she repeatedly told us not to give them this house.

34
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,070
This house was allocated to me

35
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,520
by the school,

36
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,030
and I have the right to decide.

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,790
But now, it's come to this.

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,360
What do you want me to do?

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,920
Give it to me.

40
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
No matter how you persuade me,

41
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,630
I won't give you the property deed.

42
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,970
This house is half mine.

43
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,760
Then I'll give my half to them.

44
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,070
Dad.

45
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,820
-What are you talking about?
-Mom.

46
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,470
What's wrong?

47
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,310
Yingzi.

48
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,030
Why are you back now?

49
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,450
You came back at the right time.

50
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,150
Do you know what your dad wants to do?

51
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,520
He wants to give our old house

52
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,430
to Liu Ming's parents.

53
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,700
Why, Dad?

54
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:21,750
Didn't I tell you

55
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:23,310
not to have any more contact with them

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,060
and not to give them this house?

57
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,270
You think I'm willing to give it to them?

58
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:29,290
It's all your fault.

59
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,720
How could you blame Yingzi for it?

60
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,600
You just felt ashamed

61
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:34,960
of his parents going to the school to talk bad about you,

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,450
so you couldn't handle it

63
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,829
and wanted to give them our old house

64
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:39,710
to shut them up.

65
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,230
How could you do that?

66
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:41,770
Give it to me.

67
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,950
Dad.

68
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,860
Don't go.

69
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,910
If you dare

70
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,630
to give the house to them today,

71
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,850
I'll knock myself dead right here.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,329
Come on.

73
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,400
From whom did you inherit this kind of temper?

74
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,670
Look.

75
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,710
You're the one who drove them out.

76
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,630
The elderly couple have nowhere to live.

77
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,440
Today, the school leaders all came to me.

78
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:04,150
I'm a man of integrity.

79
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,070
You know my principles.

80
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,170
We should treat people with kindness and sincerity,

81
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:08,930
right?

82
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:12,110
Liu Ming did have problems,

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,510
but it has nothing to do

84
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,950
with his parents.

85
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:15,710
Give me

86
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,829
the property deed.

87
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:18,310
You...

88
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,550
You give it to me!

89
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,050
What are you doing?

90
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,990
Do you know what kind of life I've been living?

91
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,030
Your daughter is almost being driven to death by someone,

92
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,870
and you're still speaking up for the people who hurt me.

93
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,640
You taught me from a young age

94
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,750
to treat people with kindness

95
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,670
and sincerity.

96
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,680
What have I gained from that?

97
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:45,270
If I hadn't followed your advice

98
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,680
and been cautious,

99
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,030
how could I have ended up being harmed by their family?

100
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,030
Before Liu Ming left,

101
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:53,270
he not only took away all our property,

102
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:54,390
but also secretly

103
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,390
borrowed five to six million yuan in personal loans.

104
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,930
Five to six million yuan…

105
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,350
Behind my back,

106
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,780
he used our property as collateral

107
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,950
and obtained a ten million yuan loan from the bank.

108
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,990
Then, he immediately transferred the money to the US

109
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,790
and started living with another woman.

110
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,300
All of this burden was placed on your daughter.

111
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,770
Now, all the creditors were hounding me,

112
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,130
and I was almost torn apart.

113
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,100
The house was taken by the bank,

114
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,240
and a bunch of private lenders were demanding repayment.

115
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,670
His parents knew about all of this

116
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,110
and still harmed me.

117
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,540
And now you're still talking about treating people with kindness and sincerity.

118
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,270
They are people, and I am not, is that it?

119
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,830
Yingzi.

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,190
Yingzi.

121
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,080
This is outrageous.

122
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,670
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

123
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,440
Why would I tell you all of this? What good would it do?

124
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,850
If I had told you,

125
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
it would only make you worried and stressed,

126
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,870
and in the end, both of you would have collapsed.

127
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,110
What benefit would I gain from it?

128
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,990
Dealing with people like them isn't worth it.

129
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,060
How dare these two old folks

130
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,910
bully my daughter like this?

131
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,310
I...

132
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,190
I'll

133
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,180
talk to him.

134
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,640
Dad.

135
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,810
I'll talk to him.

136
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,200
Dad, don't go. Dad.

137
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,670
Dad.

138
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,850
I've already dealt with this situation

139
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,310
as best as I could.

140
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,390
If his mother were a reasonable person,

141
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,180
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

142
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,320
Please don't go.

143
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,410
Going there will only tarnish your own dignity

144
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
and potentially harm your health.

145
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,300
If both of you end up in any trouble,

146
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,159
I don't want to live anymore.

147
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,630
Your dad is stubborn.

148
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:38,950
What's the point of

149
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,350
caring about that old couple at this point?

150
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,460
We should take care of our daughter first.

151
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,330
It’s okay, Mom.

152
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,840
There are many people not having a house in Jingbei.

153
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,120
I’m not the only one.

154
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,710
Besides, I've reached agreements

155
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,120
with those private lenders.

156
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,560
I came back this time

157
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,530
to get

158
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:04,520
the remaining money,

159
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,340
and I plan to sell my car

160
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,150
to clear all the debts once and for all.

161
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,350
The property at the bank

162
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,970
may not be recoverable,

163
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:13,510
but it won't incur new debt.

164
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,490
Don't worry.

165
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,430
As long as there's a chance,

166
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,630
everything can be resolved.

167
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,150
Dad, Mom,

168
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,390
the toughest times are behind us.

169
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:25,790
I'm Luo Yingzi,

170
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,340
and I can start over again.

171
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,830
Let's stop interacting with their family.

172
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:33,230
I don't want any more trouble.

173
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:34,930
You can rest assured.

174
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,390
I'll give back to Liu Ming

175
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,290
what he put me through.

176
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:40,360
I will let their family

177
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,870
get what they deserve.

178
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,320
Liu Ming's mother…

179
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,200
Dad.

180
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,390
How dare you call me?

181
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,320
-I was about to…
-Don’t be angry.

182
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,060
Hello?

183
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,040
It's me.

184
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,750
What's wrong?

185
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,780
Is there a problem with me going back to our house?

186
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:01,570
Listen, don't even think about it.

187
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,820
Get ready to pack up

188
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,790
and move again.

189
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,060
Shameless!

190
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,900
How dare she call me.

191
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:11,990
Who was that?

192
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,230
Dad.

193
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:16,900
Dad, are you okay?

194
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:17,910
Luo.

195
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,680
Go get the medicine.

196
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:18,990
Here.

197
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,680
Go get the medicine.

198
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,730
Wait.

199
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,760
Dad, here.

200
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,210
Dad.

201
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,340
Luo.

202
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,659
It's okay. We're at the hospital.

203
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,720
I'm really sorry.

204
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,630
Look.

205
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,070
At a time like this,

206
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,520
I'm causing you trouble.

207
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,710
Dad, what are you talking about?

208
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,920
You're at such an age,

209
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:09,320
and you're worrying so much about me.

210
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,570
Since you told us what happened,

211
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,970
I've been thinking about something.

212
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,890
There are shortcomings

213
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,000
in the Chinese family culture.

214
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,550
Within the family,

215
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,600
there's no right or wrong,

216
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,560
but outside the family,

217
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,270
everyone should be an outsider.

218
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,950
Liu Ming

219
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,030
might not be successful,

220
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,860
but I thought

221
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,490
he was reliable.

222
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:46,640
That's why

223
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,310
I entrusted you to him.

224
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,930
But I never imagined

225
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,780
he would do something

226
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,960
like this.

227
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,830
Dad.

228
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,510
Dad, don't blame yourself.

229
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,300
Even living with him every day,

230
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,010
I couldn't have foreseen this.

231
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,460
Looking from the good side, I've learned something from it.

232
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,940
If

233
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,580
he hadn't treated me so ruthlessly,

234
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,950
I might not have grown up so fast.

235
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
My daughter

236
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,020
has grown up.

237
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,830
Dad, I rarely cry outside,

238
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,000
but when I see you and my mom,

239
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,040
I can't stop crying.

240
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,350
Dad.

241
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,340
From now on,

242
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,620
it's just you and Mom for me in this world.

243
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,660
For my sake,

244
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,350
both of you should take care of yourselves.

245
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,470
Don't let this happen again.

246
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,740
It's too scary.

247
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,930
I will.

248
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,220
Your mom and I will.

249
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,990
It's okay.

250
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,550
Mom, let me do it.

251
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,810
It's quite heavy.

252
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,830
I can do it, Mom.

253
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,390
Come here.

254
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,720
Yingzi.

255
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,190
Days pass by.

256
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,310
As long as you work hard,

257
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,030
things will definitely get better.

258
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,650
Even if you encounter something unpleasant,

259
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,560
you can always come back.

260
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,630
You have us.

261
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,300
Mom, let me do it.

262
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,390
Mom.

263
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,300
You both must take good care of yourselves.

264
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,260
As long as you are healthy,

265
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:45,350
your daughter will have a home.

266
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,670
Even if I'm bullied,

267
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,240
it won't be a big deal.

268
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,780
So please, take good care of your health.

269
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,240
I’m leaving, Mom.

270
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,540
Don't worry.

271
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,890
We'll always be with you.

272
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,150
Take care, Mom.

273
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,940
Take care.

274
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,630
It's okay. You can go back, Mom.

275
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,690
Go back, Mom.

276
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,940
Rui.

277
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,890
I see a warm-hearted citizen here to provide leads again, huh?

278
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:05,830
Have you had breakfast?

279
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,630
I'll share half with you.

280
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,360
No need, you have it.

281
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:08,710
I heard that

282
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,090
you had solved another robbery and murder case.

283
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:10,880
I'm here to see

284
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,820
if the suspect needs a lawyer.

285
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,500
What suspect?

286
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,850
We had had them under surveillance for a week,

287
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,090
and we apprehended them on the spot.

288
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,670
They are indeed the criminals.

289
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,340
Rui.

290
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,000
Be careful with your words.

291
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,470
As long as the court hasn't pronounced a judgment,

292
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,830
they're still suspects.

293
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,410
You can call them whatever you want.

294
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,830
When the time comes for the handover,

295
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,270
you can think about how to earn your legal fees.

296
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:28,770
Okay.

297
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,020
That's it? I'm gonna go.

298
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,040
No, wait.

299
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:35,310
Wu Hang.

300
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:38,750
Wu Hang.

301
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,140
You really impressed me.

302
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,680
You care more about this case than I am.

303
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,640
You guys are so nonchalant about it,

304
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,430
so I can't get my deal closed and get fees.

305
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,470
I've spent so much time

306
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,650
and effort.

307
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,670
Don't I need to earn a living?

308
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,620
Come on.

309
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,160
Could you give me some hints?

310
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,160
Give me something to look forward to.

311
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,940
I will be breaking the rules

312
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,190
if I share details.

313
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,570
The police are thorough in their investigations,

314
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,270
and they've checked everyone

315
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,590
and everything.

316
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,940
Why did they exclude

317
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,010
Wu Hang's suspicion?

318
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,840
Maybe he had an alibi,

319
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,750
right?

320
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,270
This is something you shouldn't concern yourself with.

321
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:17,260
I'm leaving.

322
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,640
Don't. I know.

323
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,310
I know you have rules.

324
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,540
Just listen to what I think.

325
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:21,410
Fine.

326
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:23,950
I've been looking

327
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,430
at the file on Qin Ailian,

328
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:27,390
and I noticed in the autopsy report

329
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,030
that the killer used their left hand to commit the murder.

330
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,990
This must be one of the reasons

331
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,990
you've suspected Wang Dafu, right?

332
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,880
So now that you've excluded Wu Hang,

333
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,860
it means

334
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,620
the real killer is probably right-handed.

335
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,120
Am I right?

336
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,190
Say something, bro.

337
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,300
It tastes good.

338
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:48,990
You...

339
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,910
Good for you.

340
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,270
Ms. Luo.

341
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,150
I assume

342
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,810
this car hasn't been driven much,

343
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,510
has it?

344
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,890
It has run less than 30,000 kilometers.

345
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,420
This is even newer.

346
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,840
It's a good time for it.

347
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:16,310
It'd be a shame to sell it.

348
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,280
I have no choice. I have some personal issues.

349
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:20,590
-Please give me a good price.
-Highway killer.

350
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:24,800
You...

351
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,360
What?

352
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,500
You went bankrupt too?

353
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,950
Of course not. I'm making a fortune every day.

354
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,990
I'm planning to sell my car

355
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,490
and buy a better one.

356
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:32,500
-Ms. Luo.
-Coming.

357
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,860
You see,

358
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,040
the original paint on the front is damaged.

359
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,350
It'll affect the price.

360
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,610
Ms. Luo.

361
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,570
The price I offered you

362
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,370
is the highest we can give.

363
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,480
Your car is in good condition

364
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,940
and hasn't run many kilometers,

365
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,510
but the market is like this.

366
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,370
Even if you haven't driven it a kilometer,

367
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,340
it's still a used car.

368
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,840
If you are not satisfied with the price,

369
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,520
you can try asking other dealers.

370
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,510
Alright.

371
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
I agree.

372
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,160
Let's sign the agreement.

373
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:07,940
Okay.

374
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,530
Okay, I see.

375
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Ms. Luo.

376
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,340
Do you know our manager?

377
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,630
No.

378
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:24,390
Here's the thing.

379
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,000
Our manager just said that,

380
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,420
on top of this,

381
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,860
he can offer you an additional 50,000 yuan.

382
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,800
Do you know that guy,

383
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,570
the one who's talking to our manager?

384
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,760
He's the lawyer for our dealership.

385
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,350
Okay.

386
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:48,850
Let's sign the agreement.

387
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,850
Thank your manager for me.

388
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,510
Okay.

389
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,200
Your paperwork can't be completed today.

390
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,720
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

391
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,099
Look at you all, playing cards every day.

392
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,720
Yingzi.

393
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,510
Cheer up.

394
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,970
This is Mr. Yu.

395
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,160
Yingzi.

396
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,339
Your husband is a jerk.

397
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,829
How could he do that to you?

398
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:17,470
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

399
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,430
This is Mr. Li.

400
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,069
Yingzi.

401
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,700
Don't let him off easily.

402
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,839
We'll testify for you

403
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,700
if legal action is needed.

404
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,230
Mr. Hao.

405
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,000
Yingzi.

406
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,270
Take care.

407
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,790
We'll be friends from now on.

408
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,350
If you need money in the future,

409
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,130
just let me know.

410
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,000
I guarantee lower interest rates than others.

411
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:35,740
I dare not.

412
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,830
You're straightforward.

413
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,160
This is Mr. Hua.

414
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,520
Yingzi.

415
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,510
Let me know if you need any help.

416
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,390
Guys, speak louder.

417
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,640
Have you got the money?

418
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:45,680
Yes.

419
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:46,630
Mr. Qiu.

420
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,610
Have you received the contract?

421
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,550
Yes.

422
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,420
Okay.

423
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,490
That's all for today.

424
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,680
My treat for dinner.

425
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:53,870
One more thing.

426
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,140
Let's take a photo as a keepsake.

427
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,620
Okay.

428
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:57,860
Mr. Qiu, you take the photo.

429
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:12,250
[Peace among Heaven, Earth, and People]

430
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,690
Come here.

431
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,860
Come here.

432
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,120
Yingzi.

433
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,350
Come here.

434
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,210
Didn't you pay the money?

435
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,080
Stand in the middle. Come here.

436
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:07,880
Good.

437
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,300
Cheese.

438
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,160
-Bye.
-Take care.

439
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:15,800
Bye

440
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,330
Yingzi.

441
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,450
Now you've sorted out the private debts.

442
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,150
Look.

443
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:31,060
You'll be under someone's protection from now on.

444
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,800
Do you think I look like under protection?

445
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,520
It's like I'm kidnapped.

446
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,870
I look timid.

447
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,900
♫I'm following♫

448
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,000

Now, we have a zero down payment promotion for electric cars.

451

I know. I'm here for this.

452
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:54,950
Ms. Luo.

453
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,660
Our loans range from one to five years.

454
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:59,340
♫Growing freely♫

455
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Look which one you want to choose.

456
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,800
No need to check. I'll go for the five-year one.

457
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,150
One more thing.

458
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,600
The white one

459
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,610
is out of stock.

460
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,780

461

Okay, I'll take the red one.

463
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,360
Okay. I'll process it for you immediately.

Morning.

477
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,190
She looks different.

♫Freedom♫

479
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,540

Morning.

481
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,520
Morning.

482
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,160
Morning, Tian.

483
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,700
Morning.

484
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,510
Luo Yingzi.

485
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,320
You're back.

486
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:12,860
Yes.

487
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,650
Are you okay?

488
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:14,830
All good.

489
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,620
You look so beautiful today.

490
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,330
Thank you.

491
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
I'll go in first.

492
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,040
How do I look?

493
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,500
My goodness.

494
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,320
Your files.

495
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,630
Aren't you afraid people will say you're showing off?

496
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,380
Why should I?

497
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,440
I deserve a decent life.

498
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:39,330
I'm leaving.

499
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,840
Don't look at me like that.

500
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,470
Okay?

501
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,200
Two million.

502
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
I'll issue a letter of understanding.

503
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,490
Then Liu Dahuai can avoid a death sentence.

504
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,260
How much does your client weigh?

505
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,960
80 or 90 kilograms?

506
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,240
What's his price?

507
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:58,290
Mr. Han, you are a respected and honorable person.

508
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,120
How could you say that?

509
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,300
Life is priceless.

510
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,070
If that's the case, why did you come to me?

511
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:05,770
Well, we can talk about it.

512
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,350
Hello.

513
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,330
A cup of hot Americano.

514
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,100
Everyone can see your smile.

515
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,700
Come on.

516
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:25,750
Just...

517
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,100
Turn around.

518
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,610
You...

519
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,620
Close your mouth.

520
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,780
Hot Americano.

521
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,690
Okay, please wait a moment.

522
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,230
Mr. Han.

523
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,750
Mr. Han, I’m sorry.

524
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,300
I just finished

525
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,230
dealing with some family matters,

526
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,010
so I thought

527
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,310
I should come back to work.

528
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,260
Hello, Mr. Chen.

529
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,130
Hi.

530
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,280
Your car is beautiful. It's red.

531
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,830
Cool.

532
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,120
Isn't that all thanks to you?

533
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,380
You made me sell the two old cars at a good price.

534
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,880
You've asked for leaves

535
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,780
for seven or eight days this year, right?

536
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,460
Well,

537
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,860
I didn't delay my work anyway.

538
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,310
I finished all the cases

539
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,750
you asked me to do at home.

540
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,070
Okay.

541
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,910
Good.

542
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,400
Mr. Han, I'll leave you to it.

543
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,850
I won't bother you.

544
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,150
Bye.

545
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,430
She's just acting tough.

546
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,710
She should be forced to death by those private loans.

547
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,190
What?

548
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:24,680
Well…

549
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,120
Don't you know?

550
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,840
What?

551
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,590
Her husband ran away with a mistress

552
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,890
and left her in a lot of debt.

553
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,740
Well, you should know about this.

554
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,320
Didn't you help the bank with her house?

555
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:35,910
I mean,

556
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,170
it doesn't look like she's in debt at all.

557
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Right?

558
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,480
People like her

559
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,000
even die with dignity.

560
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,780
Why are you in such a hurry to leave the hospital?

561
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,980
You see,

562
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,420
even the doctors agreed.

563
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:51,900
You...

564
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,320
How do I look now?

565
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,680
You should rest well.

566
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:59,510
Look, it's good to have my students here.

567
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,120
They are really helpful.

568
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,020
Professor.

569
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,610
Do we go directly there?

570
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,830
Everyone is waiting.

571
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,030
I need to go home

572
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,480
and get something.

573
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,110
You just got discharged. Where are you going?

574
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,030
I'm going to the old house.

575
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,910
Today,

576
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm going to do something big

577
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,310
for our daughter.

578
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,630
Mr. Luo.

579
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,460
You're all here.

580
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,760
Good.

581
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,040
[Mom]

582
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,400
Yingzi.

583
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,860
Don't say anything.

584
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,030
Just look.

585
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,260
Your dad is going to do something big for you today.

586
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,320
Is the camera ready?

587
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,520
Yes, Professor Luo.

588
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,400
We'll record the whole process.

589
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,400
Did you inform the police?

590
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:13,990
Yes.

591
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,850
They'll be here soon.

592
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,470
After we get there,

593
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,300
I'll politely

594
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,440
ask them to leave first.

595
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,330
If they don't go out,

596
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:25,970
you guys just carry them out.

597
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:26,820
Okay.

598
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,850
But remember,

599
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,580
don't hurt them.

600
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,430
Besides,

601
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,730
mind your words and behaviors.

602
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,240
Got it?

603
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:36,990
Got it.

604
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,400
Who is it?

605
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,400
Coming.

606
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,710
Mr. Luo.

607
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,840
Come in.

608
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,960
Come in.

609
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,140
Liu, our in-law is here.

610
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,560
Okay.

611
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,730
-Mr. Luo.
-Come here.

612
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,630
-What brings you here?
-Have a seat.

613
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,300
Have a seat.

614
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,240
Please

615
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
don't call me your in-law.

616
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:08,790
Well,

617
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,660
what are you doing?

618
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,150
Mr. Liu Yiding.

619
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,520
Ms. Yue Xiuqin.

620
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,040
Due to the despicable actions of your family

621
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,870
towards my daughter,

622
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:21,610
I am now

623
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,910
reclaiming the right to use this house.

624
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,150
I kindly request

625
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,720
that you immediately vacate my property.

626
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,650
Well…

627
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,070
What is this nonsense?

628
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,370
Mr. Luo.

629
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,330
It was your daughter

630
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:35,630
who sold our house in Jingbei.

631
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,870
We had no choice

632
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,530
but to move here, right?

633
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,750
Your dispute with my daughter is something I know about.

634
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:41,890
We're not discussing it today.

635
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,310
You need to deal with that yourself.

636
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,800
The ownership of this house

637
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:46,950
is mine.

638
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,650
Please move out immediately.

639
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,190
That doesn't make sense.

640
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,160
Well…

641
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:52,870
Well...

642
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,100
Mr. Luo.

643
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:55,790
No.

644
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,310
Professor Luo.

645
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,830
We've been friends for years, right?

646
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,170
Even if you want us to move,

647
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,110
shouldn't you

648
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,480
give us some time?

649
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:04,950
That's right.

650
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:06,250
I don't want to wait any longer.

651
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,690
Please move out immediately.

652
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,460
No way.

653
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,900
Who are you to decide

654
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,960
whether we live here or not?

655
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,680
Who do you think you are?

656
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,160
I won't move.

657
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,780
You can carry me out.

658
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,750
I won't move.

659
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,680
What can you do about me?

660
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,310
Ms. Yue.

661
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,800
Say something fair.

662
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,670
Stop filming!

663
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,080
Stop filming.

664
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,320
Ms. Yue Xiuqin.

665
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,080
Let me tell you.

666
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,950
The right to use this house is mine.

667
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,030
I can decide whether you can live here or not.

668
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,530
If I want you to move,

669
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,000
you must move.

670
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,140
Please,

671
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,640
vacate immediately.

672
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,550
No.

673
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:41,640
We won't.

674
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:42,670
What can you do about us?

675
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,680
Then I won't continue being polite.

676
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,920
Get them out.

677
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,350
What are you doing?

678
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,200
What are you doing?

679
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,830
What are you doing?

680
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:52,640
You can't do this.

681
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:53,750
We can talk.

682
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,470
What are you doing?

683
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,640
Help!

684
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:58,190
Help!

685
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,040
Help!

686
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:01,570
You can't do this.

687
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
How could you do this?

688
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,890
This is outrageous!

689
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,250
What are you doing?

690
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,720
You guys are so unreasonable!

691
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,610
-Seriously.
-What are you doing?

692
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,610
What's going on?

693
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,640
Sir.

694
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,140
Look.

695
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,860
They've unlawfully

696
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,750
entered our home.

697
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,260
Sir.

698
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,780
I'm Luo Bingwen.

699
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,680
This house is mine.

700
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,150
This is the property deed. Please have a look.

701
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,240
Now,

702
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,840
I don't want them to live here anymore.

703
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,670
I want them to move out.

704
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,540
Is he telling the truth?

705
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,770
Well, this house does belong to him,

706
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:37,870
but

707
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:38,800
his daughter

708
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,210
sold our house in Jingbei.

709
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,300
We had no choice

710
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,920
but to live here.

711
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,840
The matter in Jingbei should be taken up with the police there.

712
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:48,340
It's beyond our responsibility.

713
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,270
This house belongs to him.

714
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,680
You have to move out

715
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,780
if he doesn't want you to live here.

716
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,580
But...

717
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,910
He can't just force us to move out.

718
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,610
We haven't taken anything out of the house yet.

719
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,000
We need some time.

720
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,940
-Calm down.
-Our stuff...

721
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,050
Sir.

722
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,000
Since you don't allow them to live in your house,

723
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,360
let them move their belongings out.

724
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,430
Sir.

725
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,170
Don't leave just yet.

726
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:09,060
Please watch them move out

727
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,710
before you leave.

728
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,870
Professor Luo.

729
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,370
Can you

730
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:13,030
give us

731
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,480
one more month for a transition period?

732
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,980
I don't want to wait another day.

733
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,580
If you don't move,

734
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,660
Sir, bear witness.

735
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,540
I'm gonna seal the house.

736
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,450
Don't.

737
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,190
We'll move right away.

738
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:25,070
You…

739
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,740
Thank you for today.

740
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,280
You can go back for lunch.

741
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,390
Add an extra dish for lunch.

742
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:37,920
It's on me.

743
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,180
Thank you, Professor.

744
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:40,870
Go.

745
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:41,880
Let's go for lunch.

746
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:42,940
Goodbye, Professor Luo.

747
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,030
Goodbye, Mrs. Luo.

748
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,900
Goodbye. Thank you.

749
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,430
Mrs. Luo.

750
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,490
I'll wait for you in the car.

751
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,570
Okay.

752
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:50,750
Luo.

753
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,070
Come here.

754
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,200
What are you filming?

755
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,510
Your daughter has been watching you the whole time.

756
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,680
Dad.

757
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,490
Yingzi.

758
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,540
Are you feeling better?

759
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,180
I'm much better. Look.

760
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,330
Today,

761
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,920
I managed

762
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
to get Liu Ming's parents to leave our house.

763
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,740
I gathered eight students,

764
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,050
and they carried them out,

765
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,200
four students per person.

766
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,290
-Nine students.
-No.

767
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,470
Right, nine students in total,

768
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
including one who was filming the whole process.

769
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,090
Right.

770
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,040
I was worried that they might twist the story later.

771
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:23,540
I saw it, Dad.

772
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,160
I saw it all.

773
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,280
Dad.

774
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,010
I won't admire anyone else from now on.

775
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,040
I'll only admire you.

776
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:32,890
Dad.

777
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,520
I love you.

778
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,040
I managed to vent your anger for you.

779
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,710
I want to take back

780
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,530
something I taught you before.

781
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,600
What is it?

782
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:51,210
"Return kindness for resentment."

783
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,240
Of course.

784
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,520
I don't want you to seek revenge on others.

785
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,670
I hope

786
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,640
you will

787
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,760
use your integrity

788
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,080
and courage

789
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,800
to confront

790
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,100
those despicable people.

791
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,750
Got it?

792
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,530
I got it, Dad.

793
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,560
[Yanxuan Luxury Car Exchange]

794
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,060
Wearing sunglasses doesn't mean you're blind.

795
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,390
Don't you see me?

796
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,660
Get in the car.

797
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,470
I don't associate with thugs.

798
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:19,020
Is this really necessary

799
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:20,200
just for the house?

800
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,760
We're all professionals in law,

801
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,130
and we're just working for our own clients.

802
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,090
We need to talk. Get in.

803
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,680
Open the door.

804
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,190
Sure.

805
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,530
You can even lean on me. Come on.

806
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:36,330
Come on.

807
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,860
You're sitting in the car I just bought. How lucky you are.

808
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,860
Mr. Chen.

809
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:55,120
There's nothing wrong with working for our clients,

810
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,310
but coming up with unlawful ideas

811
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,630
is where you lack moral character.

812
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,160
I won't find an excuse.

813
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,870
Don't be so cold.

814
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,060
Let me tell you a story.

815
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,860
I don't want to listen.

816
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,840
This story is related to you.

817
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,370
Me?

818
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:12,610
How could your matters

819
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,320
be related to me?

820
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,710
Are you trying to

821
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,240
help the bank plot against me again?

822
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,250
You've developed a severe persecution complex,

823
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,060
and there's no cure for you.

824
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,290
It's begun.

825
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,070
There was a young man

826
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,490
who lost his father at a young age.

827
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,680
His mother was a teacher

828
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,070
who had raised him diligently,

829
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,070
treating him like a model student.

830
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,530
He was indeed a bright

831
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,160
and obedient child

832
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,680
with excellent academic performance

833
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,150
and a strong sense of self-discipline.

834
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,420
To put it simply,

835
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,200
do you see the red light in front of you?

836
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,540
He had never crossed the road when it was green before he was twenty.

837
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:47,920
But,

838
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,760
things changed

839
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,570
after he left home for college.

840
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,310
He started skipping classes, failing exams,

841
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,670
smoking, drinking,

842
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:56,810
going to nightclubs,

843
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,530
and even pursuing nightclub hostesses.

844
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,740
He began a path of self-destruction

845
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
to oppose his mother.

846
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,550
I think so too.

847
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:09,670
You think so too?

848
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,290
Alright, never mind then.

849
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,530
There must be other reasons.

850
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,640
Don't.

851
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,970
You have the same views as the famous lawyer, Chen Shuo.

852
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:16,860
You shouldn't feel ashamed at all.

853
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:17,660
Ms. Luo.

854
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,200
Let me finish the story.

855
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,450
He

856
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,780
accumulated a significant amount of debt and,

857
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,180
in an attempt to repay it,

858
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,560
he started working

859
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,310
in Lanting Club.

860
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,880
You know what I mean.

861
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,590
Are you investigating that case?

862
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,590
No.

863
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:37,210
I just like gossiping.

864
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,030
Please, hear me out.

865
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,850
Although he only worked there

866
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,280
for a while,

867
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,860
during this period,

868
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,250
he met the most important person in his life

869
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,860
and met Qin Ailian.

870
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,250
Right.

871
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,090
He even worked in a restaurant

872
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,960
where she was employed.

873
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,110
He must have been chasing her.

874
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,870
But if he is the person you mentioned,

875
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,800
how could he tolerate

876
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,170
working in a restaurant to earn money?

877
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,360
Exactly.

878
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,210
Did the police investigate him?

879
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:09,310
I asked my friends working in the police station.

880
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,340
They didn't give me a clear answer.

881
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:12,030
But

882
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,960
I read the file.

883
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,239
It says

884
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,460
the murderer is left-handed,

885
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,679
but he's not.

886
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,580
And then?

887
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:18,969
Then...

888
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,040
As someone who enjoys speculating, I started thinking.

889
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,429
Qin Ailian must have been a girl

890
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:26,320
with a troubled life.

891
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:27,710
When she was young,

892
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,570
due to the relationships with her brother and sister-in-law,

893
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,650
she dropped out of school at a young age,

894
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:33,429
and she lived in a challenging environment.

895
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,239
Her life must have been very oppressive.

896
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,900
I imagined

897
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:38,889
that two oppressed people

898
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,630
met at a club,

899
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:41,949
and what kind of story could unfold between them?

900
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:42,800
How far

901
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,389
did their emotions develop?

902
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,719
Could this extreme man

903
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:46,860
scare Qin Ailian?

904
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:47,889
And what exactly was Qin Ailian afraid of?

905
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,199
Which man was she afraid of?

906
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,969
Why are you telling me this?

907
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:53,239
Then why do you think I'm telling you this?

908
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,199
Are you asking me to investigate with you?

909
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,400
Let me tell you.

910
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,030
Qin Ailian is your client,

911
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,000
not mine.

912
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,190
Why are you laughing?

913
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,250
Last time

914
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,330
I was with Mr. Xue in the parking lot,

915
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,830
could you tell

916
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,370
we had a scheme

917
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,320
to trap you?

918
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:12,860
You thought I was stupid?

919
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,520
You two

920
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,710
were obviously planning something together.

921
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:17,190
Do you think I'd fall for it?

922
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,440
Come on.

923
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,480
What?

924
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,230
You think I'm stupid?

925
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:22,670
Mr. Chen.

926
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,960
Please show some respect.

927
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,740
Did you find what you said through your own investigation?

928
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,430
Or what?

929
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,300
I'm a lawyer, not a police officer.

930
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,160
If I had stayed at home,

931
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,350
who would have provided any leads for me?

932
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,000
So you planned all this meticulously

933
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,930
just to dig a hole for me?

934
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,770
And in the end, you fell into it yourself,

935
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,540
right?

936
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,680
I think so.

937
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,590
No, I'm just curious.

938
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:46,340
This case makes me itch

939
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,080
whenever I think of it.

940
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,470
I want to see how it ends.

941
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,920
Good comrade.

942
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,340
The revolution hasn't succeeded,

943
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:54,160
so young man, keep up the good work.

944
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:55,200
Turn right.

945
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,140
You can drop me off there.

946
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,520
I thought you were going back to the law firm.

947
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,640
I haven't finished that story.

948
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,110
I...

949
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,340
I'm not addicted to being Sherlock Holmes.

950
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,500
Turn right and pull over.

951
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:04,410
I still have things to take care of.

952
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,030
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

953
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,480
Mr. Chen.

954
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,880
Whether or not the person you mentioned is the killer,

955
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,340
at this very moment,

956
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,240
he's probably gloating.

957
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,270
If you can't find him,

958
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,510
he will look down on you.

959
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,360
Do you remember back how you mocked me

960
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,460
when I handled the Wang Dafu's case?

961
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,510
You are a lawyer,

962
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,600
not a police officer.

963
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:46,870
You won't get any leads

964
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,710
just sitting at home or talking to me.

965
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,200
Keep up the good work, Mr. Chen.

966
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,730
I have faith in you.

967
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,190
Or, I'll wait to see you make a fool of yourself.

968
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,960
What do you mean by seeing me make a fool of myself?

969
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,830
[Xinxin Delivery]

970
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,470
Wu Hang.

971
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:11,750
Take it.

972
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,320
Liang.

973
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,630
Here's an urgent package.

974
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,860
Okay.

975
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,580
Be careful, Wu.

976
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,320
You'll have to pay if you break something.

977
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:41,930
Be careful.

978
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:51,050
I've been looking at the file on Qin Ailian,

979
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,060
and I noticed in the autopsy report

980
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,480
that the killer used their left hand to commit the murder.

981
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:57,780
Now that we've ruled out Wu Hang's suspicion,

982
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,760
it means

983
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:00,930
he's right-handed.

984
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,500
Xue,

985
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,590
go to the restaurant where Qin Ai Lian works.

986
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,220
Find out who was beaten by Wu Hang the other day

987
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,770
and whether they were injured.

988
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,420
You got off work early today.

989
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,370
Yeah, the traffic wasn't bad.

990
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:26,930
The meal is ready. Wash your hands and eat.

991
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,680
Great.

992
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:34,860
Lanlan.

993
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,330
What's that smell of smoke in our house?

994
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,540
Is there still any?

995
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,020
I've been ventilating the room for a while.

996
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,380
Did someone come?

997
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,070
No one.

998
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:53,810
Well,

999
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:55,130
it's just Mr. Zhou.

1000
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,450
Why did Mr. Zhou come to my house?

1001
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:57,930
Well,

1002
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,480
how did he know where my home is?

1003
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,810
Well, I was not at home.

1004
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:01,200
He...

1005
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,530
Why did he come?

1006
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,460
What did he want?

1007
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,870
Here's the thing.

1008
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,070
Remember I told you

1009
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,140
that I wanted to thank Mr. Zhou

1010
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,280
for his help

1011
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:13,130
so I bought him something

1012
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,140
and visited him?

1013
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:16,690
I also asked him to help my younger brother find a job.

1014
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,920
He's such a good person.

1015
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,060
He came

1016
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,830
to let me know about it today.

1017
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,480
Wash your hands and eat.

1018
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,630
Wait, Lanlan. Wait.

1019
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,780
Let's put aside what you've done.

1020
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,620
If he needed to reply

1021
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,370
to your request,

1022
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,760
he could have called you.

1023
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:36,750
Why did he have to come to my house?

1024
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,080
Well, I should thank him,

1025
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,200
so I invited him over

1026
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,260
for lunch.

1027
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,860
Anyway, you wouldn't come back at noon,

1028
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,680
so it wouldn't disturb you.

1029
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,160
Lanlan.

1030
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,220
You were wrong.

1031
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,670
You shouldn't have brought someone to my house

1032
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,240
without my permission,

1033
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:53,840
especially when I was not at home.

1034
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,240
Ms. Luo.

1035
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:00,550
I thought it was okay

1036
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,880
since you had been grateful for Mr. Zhou.

1037
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,860
Why are you angry about

1038
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,380
me inviting him over for lunch?

1039
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,560
It’s different.

1040
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,540
Expressing gratitude to Mr. Zhou

1041
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:09,500
doesn't mean

1042
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,090
I want to establish a close relationship with him,

1043
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,590
and the relationship

1044
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:13,920
between me and him

1045
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,320
is none of your business.

1046
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:16,640
Even though you're working at my home,

1047
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,780
you can't take others to my house

1048
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,880
without my permission.

1049
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,970
I treat you as my sister.

1050
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,310
Ms. Luo, how could you treat me as a stranger?

1051
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:32,660
Lanlan.

1052
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,530
First of all,

1053
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,990
we are not related by blood.

1054
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,730
Right?

1055
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,180
Even if we were sisters,

1056
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,850
there should still

1057
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,120
be boundaries

1058
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,820
among family members.

1059
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,120
Zhang Shilan,

1060
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,630
I don't want to see this

1061
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,280
happen again at my home.

1062
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,500
Got it.

1063
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,050
Captain Wang, bye.

1064
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:16,740
Bye.

1065
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,460
Mr. Chen.

1066
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,550
Are you picking me up after work?

1067
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:24,620
Dream on.

1068
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,670
A warm-hearted citizen wants to provide a lead. Do you want it?

1069
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,070
Go ahead.

1070
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,030
About a month before the incident,

1071
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,540
Wu Hang also worked at the restaurant where Qin Ailian worked.

1072
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:33,800
One night,

1073
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,950
a customer got drunk

1074
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,430
and harassed Qin Ailian.

1075
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,550
Wu Hang intervened,

1076
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,450
and they got into a fight.

1077
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:41,140
The restaurant owner probably lied about the situation.

1078
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,120
Wu Hang wasn't the one attacking the customer.

1079
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,580
It was the customer who cut Wu Hang's hand

1080
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,800
with a broken glass bottle.

1081
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,680
The customer fled,

1082
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,400
and the owner didn't want to

1083
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,650
pay for medical expenses.

1084
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,400
So, he accused Wu Hang of attacking the customer

1085
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,420
and fired him.

1086
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,930
You can check the hospital records.

1087
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,400
Wu Hang had ten stitches on his right hand,

1088
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,100
so his right hand

1089
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,650
wasn't fully healed

1090
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,090
at the time of the incident.

1091
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,980
I've done everything I can.

1092
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,440
His alibi

1093
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,880
is the police's job.

1094
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,220
Pay more attention.

1095
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,380
You're so persistent.

1096
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,000
I have no choice.

1097
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,660
I don't want to be laughed at.

1098
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,280
If we can't solve the case,

1099
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,460
we will be laughed at.

1100
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:17,870
Okay, I'm leaving.

1101
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,630
I forgot.

1102
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,370
So you've changed your car.

1103
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,030
Seems like you've earned a lot of money.

1104
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,720
Bye.

1105
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,850
Wang, come down.

1106
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,680
We have new clues about Qin Ailian's case.

1107
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,680
We need to go out for a field investigation.

1108
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,600
Lanlan.
