[Episode 33]

4
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,640
Hello?

5
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,050
Is it the automobile 4S store?

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,729
My car

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,380
is powering off,

8
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,100
so I have to park it by the roadside.

9
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,960
Can send someone to help me?

10
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,400
I'm at Jingwang East Road，

11
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,889
around the intersection.

12
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,610
Righteous Luo.

13
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,770
What do you want?

14
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,380
Where are you?

15
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,360
Does it matter to you?

16
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,710
Of course it does.

17
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,030
I represent the bank.

18
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:28,190
I want to meet you and discuss the case.

19
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,460
Seriously? Unscrupulous Chen,

20
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,120
is it the way you practice law?

21
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,250
You represent the plaintiff,

22
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,710
but you discuss the case with the defendant.

23
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,100
Does the law forbid lawyers from contacting

24
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,360
the clients of their opposing counsels?

25
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,829
Fine. I happen to need a life coach.

26
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,430
Come and meet me then.

27
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,300
Zhang Shilan, give me my bag.

28
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,450
Where are you going? I'll go with you.

29
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,160
I'm meeting with a client. Give it to me.

30
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,270
What... What about me?

31
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,470
Get yourself a ride back to the law firm.

32
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,280
-Hello.
-Hello.

33
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,590
Is this your car?

34
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,770
Yes. My car...

35
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,660
Has it powered off?

36
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,110
Yes.

37
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:22,430
Okay. First thing first,

38
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,490
we'll charge a fee for towing the car away.

39
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,020
Okay.

40
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,870
Wait!

41
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm a VIP customer.

42
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,100
Do I need to pay for that?

43
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,700
I'm afraid so. It's our rule.

44
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
Okay, here's the key.

45
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,860
-Don't forget to put the tripod away.
-Okay. Consider it done.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,400
Be careful when you tow it away.

47
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,320
Thank you, sir.

48
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:40,740
No problem.

49
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,050
What happened? Has your car powered off?

50
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,250
It's none of your business. Just drive.

51
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,370
Where are we going?

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,070
I've driven for a while but you haven't told me a destination.

53
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,490
Do you have a problem with that?

54
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,450
You're driving a luxury car. Don't tell me you're gonna skimp on the gas.

55
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,350
Just stop asking me questions.

56
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,060
Keep driving.

57
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,260
I'll tell you when we need to make a turn.

58
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,620
Now spill it.

59
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,180
What do you want to teach me?

60
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,339
Why did you appeal at the last moment?

61
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,579
You're funny.

62
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,380
I'm entitled to file an appeal within the statutory time limit.

63
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,390
Whenever I feel like doing so,

64
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,470
I go with it.

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,150
What? Does it bother you?

66
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,930
Turn right.

67
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,020
Okay.

68
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,260
Turn right.

69
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,710
Listen.

70
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,280
I have no doubt that you'll lose

71
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,350
when you're up against me in court.

72
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,710
However, I do have doubts,

73
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:49,909
if you go down without a fight.

74
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,610
I don't believe there isn't a trick up your sleeve.

75
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,420
Take it down a notch, braggart.

76
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
Didn't you lose to me in a previous case?

77
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,120
Try doing my job, I dare you.

78
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,030
I was supposed to get my client off a charge of sexual harassment.

79
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,590
But he turned out to be rapist.

80
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,320
Even God couldn't help him out.

81
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,570
Tell me. What's on your mind?

82
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,690
Nothing.

83
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,470
I'm just bored.

84
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,040
I've got nothing better to do.

85
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,730
I happen to be in the mood of teasing you.

86
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,860
That's impossible.

87
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,390
Slow down.

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,150
Over there. Pull over.

89
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:21,650
Okay. Okay.

90
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,910
Thank you.

91
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:24,710
What is this place?

92
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,910
Did you really think

93
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,810
I'd talk about the case with you?

94
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,200
My car broke down.

95
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,380
I was using you as my chauffeur.

96
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:35,720
I'm leaving.

97
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,460
Thank you.

98
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,240
Hold on!

99
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,150
Is this a cosmetics store?

100
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:41,770
Yes.

101
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,430
Are you buying cosmetics?

102
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,090
Oh. Come on.

103
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:47,790
Can't a woman shop for cosmetics?

104
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,909
Are you okay?

105
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,850
I'm leaving. Bye.

106
00:05:57,409 --> 00:05:58,940
She fooled me again.

107
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,810
Bye. We look forward to your next purchase.

108
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:15,130
Hello, I wanna ask you about a person.

109
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,340
There used to be

110
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,740
an employee in your store

111
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,400
named Wen Li. Do you remember?

112
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,830
Wen Li?

113
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,820
We don't know her.

114
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,150
Just a second. I have her photo.

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,650
Do you remember her?

116
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,880
Isn't it Ms. Wen?

117
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,390
Yeah.

118
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,909
Her name isn't Wen Li.

119
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,700
What do you call her then?

120
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:36,860
Wen Rong.

121
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:38,590
She worked here before.

122
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,320
But she left after a few months.

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,830
Who was she familiar with

124
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,320
when she was working here?

125
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,310
Ms. Li.

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,970
A customer would like to ask you about Ms. Wen.

127
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:49,670
Ms. Wen?

128
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,070
Yes.

129
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,210
Hello.

130
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,460
You can call me Ms. Luo.

131
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,940
This is my business card.

132
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,790
Hello, sir.

133
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,280
How can I help you?

134
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,000
A woman in shorts

135
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,720
got in here, right?

136
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,400
Did she buy anything?

137
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,480
Nothing.

138
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,880
She came to ask about

139
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,660
a girl who worked here before.

140
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,790
She came to ask about a girl then.

141
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,910
Who's that girl?

142
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,150
When that girl was working here,

143
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,580
she went by the name of Wen Rong.

144
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,040
For some reason, this lady calls her Wen Li.

145
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,050
I don't think you should ask more questions.

146
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,110
We're not supposed to disclose customer information.

147
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,650
Wen Li is my younger sister.

148
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,750
Why would this lady ask about her?

149
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,250
Who... Who is this lady then?

150
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,550
She's my girlfriend.

151
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,350
We're getting married soon.

152
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,550
She goes around, asking everyone about me.

153
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,120
Really?

154
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,480
Maybe she just wants to know more about me.

155
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,710
I suggest

156
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,770
you should be careful around her.

157
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:52,030
I really should.

158
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,350
Okay, I got it.

159
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:53,990
Thank you.

160
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,310
I'll take this.

161
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,120
-Okay. I’ll get you the bill.
-Okay.

162
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Thank you.

163
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:25,990
Wen Li...

164
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,830
Who is this woman?

165
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,950
Is she relevant to the case about the bank?

166
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,950
Do you mean that she seduced another woman's husband?

167
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:36,990
Yes.

168
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,370
She colluded with my client's husband

169
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,730
to transfer all the property

170
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,860
that my client owned with her husband.

171
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,430
What else

172
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,950
do you know

173
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,200
about her?

174
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,360
Now that you've spoken of it,

175
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:54,890
I remember

176
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,030
how I felt about her.

177
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,630
She seemed

178
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,830
quite gentle

179
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,230
and

180
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,560
she was a smooth talker.

181
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,400
She's smart at work.

182
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,500
But she appeared to be quite introverted.

183
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,680
Several senior employees

184
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,160
took advantage of her

185
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,950
and made her do the most tiring chores.

186
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:16,020
She never fought back.

187
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,310
Instead, she lapped up the entire workload.

188
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,840
Sometimes

189
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,110
I felt sorry for her,

190
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,430
so I helped her.

191
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,470
At that time,

192
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,110
Ms. Wen was such a poor girl.

193
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,530
Look,

194
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,310
she couldn't make much money from her job.

195
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:30,590
She had to use the most part of her salary

196
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,920
to pay her monthly rent.

197
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,650
On occasion, she couldn't afford her rent.

198
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,250
So her landlord evicted her.

199
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,130
She would sneak back

200
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,920
and sleep in our office.

201
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,710
I felt like I had to do something.

202
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,990
I sympathized her.

203
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,060
So I let her stay at my place.

204
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,860
However,

205
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,210
something happened at that time.

206
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,110
My husband is a college teacher.

207
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,980
Maybe I misread his interaction with Ms. Wen.

208
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,260
Ms. Wen seemed to be extra nice

209
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,370
to my husband, behind my back.

210
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,250
Later on, she figured out

211
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,980
that I was wary of her,

212
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,900
so she moved out soon.

213
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,480
She knew she had aroused your suspicion, so she left. Right?

214
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,110
Did anything else happen?

215
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,270
Please try to think about it.

216
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:16,860
Maybe Wang Liang was the reason for her departure.

217
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,040
That young man used to take his girlfriend

218
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,950
to buy cosmetics in our store.

219
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,350
There's gonna be a huge discount.

220
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,730
Plus this eye cream, the total will be 3,000, right?

221
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,160
Yes.

222
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,820
We'll give you two samples as well.

223
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,620
Wang Liang.

224
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,880
It's gonna be 3,000.

225
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,330
It's okay. We'll buy whatever you like.

226
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,500
I'll take this 3,000-worth makeup kit then.

227
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,970
Get off your phone.

228
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,090
We have some new facial masks over there.

229
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:44,350
Why not browse around?

230
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,040
Sounds great.

231
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,630
Before I knew it,

232
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,830
that young man had become close to Ms. Wen.

233
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,350
He even came to my house to meet her.

234
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,350
I saw that happen once.

235
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,020
Ms. Wen was very embarrassed.

236
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:58,410
She said that man wasn't the one I knew of.

237
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,510
Since then,

238
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,510
she disappeared.

239
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,920
Wang Liang

240
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:05,190
then became Wen Li's boyfriend.

241
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,670
Thanks to him, Wen Li was able to register

242
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,070
as a permanent resident in Jingbei.

243
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,900
Then she dumped Wang Liang.

244
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:14,710
Gosh!

245
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,590
Is this...

246
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,480
Is this real?

247
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:19,710
It seems...

248
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,120
I didn't expect her to be such a person.

249
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:25,230
If she is a terrible person

250
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,350
like you have described,

251
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,430
wouldn't she

252
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:29,990
take revenge on those senior employees

253
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,750
who used to  bully her in the store?

254
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,990
She just left

255
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,630
and never declared to take vengeance.

256
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,490
That's because she didn't care about

257
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,280
those girls.

258
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,170
She is very ambitious.

259
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,240
She's got a bigger goal than that.

260
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:44,820
This...

261
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
This is really...

262
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,300
scary.

263
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,650
Don't you know what courtesy is?

264
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:52,990
Do you think you can get your way around?

265
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,320
Haven't your mother taught you anything?

266
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,220
I'm sorry. Sorry.

267
00:11:58,450 --> 00:11:59,980
Are you gonna cry over this?

268
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,730
What do think you are doing?

269
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,540
Have I done anything to you?

270
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,650
Turn off the waterworks!

271
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm not buying any of this!

272
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,040
It won't work here.

273
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,020
What did I say?

274
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,070
Did I hurt her or what?

275
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,910
Have I done anything to make you cry?

276
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,390
What do you mean by this?

277
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:21,080
Listen up. Your little stunt won't work.

278
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,210
You'll either do your job or just quit.

279
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,440
Come on in, Ms. Luo.

280
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,000
Have a seat.

281
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,400
I’ll get you some water.

282
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,290
Wang Liang.

283
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,110
What a coincidence!

284
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,820
You said you wanted to see me.

285
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,350
I was also gonna ask you for a meeting.

286
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,610
What do you have to say?

287
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,590
Actually,

288
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,710
I wanna know

289
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,110
if you have got any news about Wen Li.

290
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:51,950
Yes.

291
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,320
She

292
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,930
has returned to the country.

293
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,860
And I'm sure she came back alone.

294
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,310
You met her

295
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,440
at Cornell Cosmetics, right?

296
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,270
Cornell Cosmetics?

297
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,180
No.

298
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,370
No?

299
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,430
You had had a girlfriend before you met her.

300
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:15,350
You and your ex-girlfriend shopped for cosmetics there.

301
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,480
Did that not happen?

302
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,750
It might have happened.

303
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,010
But does Wen Li have anything to do with it?

304
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,170
She certainly does!

305
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,010
She used to work there.

306
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,350
She served you and your old girlfriend.

307
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,010
Don't you remember?

308
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,020
How come I can't recall any of that?

309
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,980
Well,

310
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,020
I get sleepy when I enter a cosmetics shop.

311
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,960
In the store,

312
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,380
my ex-girlfriend shopped around

313
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,010
while I played with my phone somewhere else.

314
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,230
When she picked out what she wanted,

315
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:44,560
I went up and paid for it.

316
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,920
I didn't notice the employees there.

317
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,400
How did you and Wen Li meet?

318
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,490
We met in a restaurant.

319
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,580
My ex-girlfriend and I...

320
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,960
You're supposed to dine with me, not to play with your phone.

321
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,200
It's gonna be over. Just give me one second.

322
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,130
I don't think...

323
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,750
What's wrong with you?

324
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,950
-I’m sorry. -It hurts!

325
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,820
Are you okay? Let me see.

326
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,470
I didn't mean it.

327
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,980
Are you blind?

328
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,400
Couldn't you be careful?

329
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,920
Let me take you to the hospital.

330
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm so sorry.

331
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,610
A large area of my ex-girlfriend's skin was burned.

332
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,940
Besides, it was summer.

333
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,990
So Wen Li and I took turns to take care of her.

334
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,860
Are you stupid or what?

335
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,160
You've spent 5 minutes peeling an apple.

336
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,470
Don't you know how to do it?

337
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,350
You hate for me to have it, don't you?

338
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,850
I'm sorry. I'll give it to you right away.

339
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,650
Don't bother. Now I don't want to eat it.

340
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,850
Looking you peel an apple makes me sick!

341
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,240
You must be blind.

342
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,280
Can't you see my glass is empty now?

343
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,440
I'll get you some water right away.

344
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,110
Hurry up!

345
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,720
Honey, I'm here.

346
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,780
What took you so long?

347
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,790
Go over there.

348
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,750
Is there someone else you wanna burn again?

349
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:53,590
Sorry, honey.

350
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,310
I was stuck in traffic.

351
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Every time you...

352
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,710
I'll be right back after filling the kettle.

353
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,350
Thank you.

354
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:01,680
You’re welcome.

355
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,480
Wang Liang,

356
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,670
is there gonna be a scar?

357
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,450
My skin used to be fair and smooth.

358
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,510
What if this leaves me a scar?

359
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,720
The doctor said

360
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,260
luckily we came to the hospital in time.

361
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,190
Don't worry. There won't be a scar.

362
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,830
It's all that stupid woman's fault.

363
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,440
You should be polite to her.

364
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,250
She didn't mean to injure you.

365
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:23,750
Fine.

366
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,010
That's gonna be my excuse too.

367
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,350
I'll say I don't mean to hurt anyone

368
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,630
while I kill people and burn down houses.

369
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,440
That's not what I meant.

370
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,700
Then what did you mean?

371
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,530
Now I'm the one being hospitalized.

372
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,590
Alright. Alright.

373
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,930
Look what I brought you.

374
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,460
Your favorite food!

375
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,670
Here, take a look.

376
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,070
Don't change the subject.

377
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,310
What did you mean?

378
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,820
My ex-girlfriend

379
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,710
had a bad temper.

380
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,160
She was the one who got hurt in that incident.

381
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,320
So she was really mean to Wen Li.

382
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,940
She yelled at Wen Li and even hit her.

383
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,990
In several occasions, I couldn't stand it.

384
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
But Wen Li

385
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,930
just took the heat.

386
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,000
Stop it. I don't want the apple now.

387
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,080
You'll want it after I'm done peeling it.

388
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,040
Here I come!

389
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,230
I only asked you for two cups of boba tea.

390
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,560
Why did you come back so late?

391
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,390
Sorry, I was waiting in a line.

392
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,040
This is jasmine tea with milk.

393
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,470
And this one has red beans in it.

394
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,990
Thank you.

395
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,990
You should have it. I'm not thirsty.

396
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,950
You don't have to be polite to her.

397
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,340
She's supposed to buy us boba tea.

398
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:22,440
Put it there.

399
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,860
I'll drink it later.

400
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,550
Why is it so sweet?

401
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,950
Didn't I tell you to cut the sugar by half?

402
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,430
Do you want me to get fat or what?

403
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,030
I'm sorry.

404
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,870
I'll buy you a new cup of boba tea.

405
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,430
What's wrong with you?

406
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:40,590
Do you want me to get burned again?

407
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,990
You did it on purpose, didn't you?

408
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,920
It's an honest mistake. I'm sorry.

409
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,720
Are you okay?

410
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:46,390
Yes. I'm fine.

411
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,550
I'll wash it off in the bathroom.

412
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,610
I'm sorry.

413
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,830
Sorry.

414
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,720
Wang Liang.

415
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,060
Just leave her alone.

416
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,440
She can only blame herself for being clumsy.

417
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,710
You're getting out of line.

418
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,750
Am I?

419
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,750
I'm in the hospital because of her.

420
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,550
How could you say I'm out of line?

421
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,089
Who is your girlfriend now?

422
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,829
Why don't you make her your girlfriend

423
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,630
since you care so much about her?

424
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:39,160
Wen Li,

425
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,680
I'm truly sorry.

426
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,960
My girlfriend is always like that.

427
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,560
Please forgive her.

428
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:50,690
In fact, I know

429
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,190
when I am away,

430
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,710
she treats you badly.

431
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,270
Actually,

432
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,000
sometimes, even I...

433
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,420
Let me ask you a question.

434
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,230
How many policemen does it take to screw in a light bulb?

435
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,100
None. Because it turns itself in.

436
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,790
I get the pun!

437
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,270
It's funny, isn't it?

438
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,270
Quite amusing.

439
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,070
You didn't do anything wrong.

440
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,350
Why the long face?

441
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,790
You should always be happy like you are now

442
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,720
and smile more.

443
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,200
She was the one being mistreated,

444
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,250
but she chose to comfort me.

445
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,310
Gradually,

446
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,950
we spent much time together on the roof.

447
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,540
One day,

448
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,420
a man whose face resembles a bike,

449
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,060
walks on the street and is ridden away

450
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
because someone thinks he's a bike.

451
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,530
Is it a bad joke?

452
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,680
I can tell you another one.

453
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,650
One day,

454
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,240
a man whose face looks like a brick

455
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,310
goes for a walk by the lake.

456
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,830
A toad pops up,

457
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,530
points at him, and says:

458
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,860
"Do you dare to toss yourself to the lake?"

459
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,930
Is it also a bad joke?

460
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,220
It's not that.

461
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,720
Then why aren't you laughing at it?

462
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,880
Because your awkwardness is more laughable!

463
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:38,210
You...

464
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,520
Look what you've done to me!

465
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,970
Because of you,

466
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm stuck in the hospital!

467
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,390
Look what you've done!

468
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Hey! What do you think you are doing?

469
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,550
Am I doing anything wrong?

470
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,160
You're being rude.

471
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,220
This time you've gone far out of line!

472
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:58,880
Fine.

473
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,830
You should be with her.

474
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,110
Go and be with her!

475
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,760
Anything wrong?

476
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,830
You tell me.

477
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:02,510
Think about it.

478
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,360
At the moment you played with your phone,

479
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,920
you had been targeted.

480
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,870
She knew from the beginning

481
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,140
that she could trap you.

482
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,670
Every step you took thereafter

483
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,220
was within her plan.

484
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,720
Isn't it horrifying?

485
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,950
[Mr. Wang]

486
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:36,200
Hello, Mr. Wang.

487
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,170
Mr. Chen.

488
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,130
Have you heard?

489
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,450
Luo Yingzi has filed an appeal.

490
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,340
I've heard about it.

491
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,740
Don't you also know that?

492
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,860
We can't proceed with the auction now.

493
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:46,790
It's okay.

494
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:48,750
That house will be auctioned at last.

495
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:50,470
We've also got the news

496
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,340
that she has reported to the police,

497
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,680
saying that her husband's loan is a fraud.

498
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:01,830
Well,

499
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,150
she has the right to do so.

500
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,230
We're in no position to stop her. Right?

501
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,230
I have a question.

502
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,480
As far as I know,

503
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,080
criminal offences must be dealt with first

504
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,200
before the civil part of the case gets its turn.

505
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,120
Her husband has gone abroad.

506
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:16,040
When will this case end?

507
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,400
We'll never be able to collect the debt!

508
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,470
You seem to know a lot about law.

509
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:24,470
The court won't easily judge it as a fraud.

510
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:27,260
That's right.

511
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,680
We'll insist that the loan was put through

512
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,790
a legitimate process before it was granted.

513
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:36,190
The court will take it into consideration.

514
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:38,950
The agreement

515
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,930
was signed by them both.

516
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,450
They came together to apply for the loan.

517
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,060
Obviously, this couple staged a fraud!

518
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,630
That's not it!

519
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,960
Mr. Wang, that's not what I meant.

520
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,760
Look.

521
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,760
She's in trouble because of her husband.

522
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,930
There's no way they would plot it together.

523
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,880
Mr. Chen,

524
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,040
it's our bank that has hired you, right?

525
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,900
You should protect our interests.

526
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,160
You can't side with her

527
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,480
just because you care for a poor woman.

528
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,150
Alright.

529
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,660
Just leave it be. I've got what I wanted.

530
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,780
Okay. Bye.

531
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,430
Mister...

532
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,000
Shuo, the documents are ready.

533
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,670
Where are you going? I'll go with you.

534
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,470
I need to go out for an emergency.

535
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,050
Can you give me a key to your apartment?

536
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,760
A repair guy will fix your air conditioner

537
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,490
in the afternoon, while I do some cleaning.

538
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,670
It's a combination lock.

539
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:28,780
I'll send you the password

540
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,060
and address later.

541
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:30,600
Okay.

542
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,050
See you later.

543
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,480
Done!

544
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,950
Come in.

545
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,900
Mr. Wang.

546
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,310
Mr. Chen.

547
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:48,410
What brought you here?

548
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,910
You rarely show up.

549
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,310
But now you came after a talk on the phone.

550
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:56,220
The defendant filed an appeal at the last moment.

551
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
Given its importance, I had to come.

552
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,290
On my way here,

553
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:03,790
I did some thinking.

554
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,660
In my opinion,

555
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,660
even if the police determines

556
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,350
that Luo Yingzi's husband

557
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,430
has staged a fraud,

558
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,190
we can still find a way

559
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,850
to get the money back from her husband.

560
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,190
It's unnecessary to make Luo Yingzi...

561
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:17,810
Are you

562
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,920
into that girl?

563
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,760
You're getting off topic.

564
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,240
Let's focus on the case.

565
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,000
That doesn't give you a reason

566
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,480
to speak for her again and again.

567
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:30,610
Mr. Chen,

568
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,270
I understand what you said.

569
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,120
How should I put it?

570
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,250
You are a lawyer.

571
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,450
A lawyer

572
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
should provide legal advice to his client.

573
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,170
The final decision

574
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,750
will be made by the client,

575
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,230
instead of the lawyer.

576
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,160
I assure you

577
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,360
that I understand everything you said.

578
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:51,300
I'll take care of the rest.

579
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:53,580
Sure thing.

580
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,240
Do you wanna go out for dinner together?

581
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,270
Mr. Wang,

582
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,270
I respect your decision

583
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,000
to handle the rest by yourself.

584
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,660
That said,

585
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,790
I feel the need

586
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,550
to tell you something.

587
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,500
Go ahead.

588
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,950
Look, I'm representing the bank.

589
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,960
I'm not your personal lawyer.

590
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,790
I will do my best

591
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,580
to help the bank collect debts.

592
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:21,630
However,

593
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,150
well,

594
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,420
if you do something

595
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,970
on your own

596
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,670
without informing me,

597
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,710
and have the bank suffer unnecessary losses,

598
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:31,310
I'm afraid

599
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:33,190
I won't be responsible for that.

600
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,290
Mr. Chen, that's too strong a word.

601
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:39,950
Don't worry.

602
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,270
I won't take any actions.

603
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,990
As long as the bank can get the money back,

604
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,450
I'm fine with everything.

605
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:48,590
That's right.

606
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,850
Money is the only thing we target, right?

607
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:52,900
Aren't we going out for dinner?

608
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,850
Thanks, but no.

609
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,900
You're a busy man. I'd hate to bother you.

610
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,560
I should get going now.

611
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,530
Okay, bye.

612
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:58,230
Okay.

613
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,040
I'm afraid you'll have to show yourself out.

614
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,710
No problem.

615
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,980
This room should be reserved for our baby.

616
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,670
If my parents come, they can also stay here.

618
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,440
Hello, Shuo.

619
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,040
When I rushed out of the office,

620
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,370
I left some documents unsorted.

621
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,400
If the work at my place is done, you should go back to the office.

622
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,880
It's not done yet.

623
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,960
By the way, Shuo, I made you dinner.

624
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,400
When are you coming back?

625
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,660
I'm having dinner with my friends.

626
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,190
I'm not going home tonight.

627
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,070
What friends?

628
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,960
Shuo, have you made a new girlfriend?

629
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,460
Well,

630
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,550
whether I have a girlfriend or not doesn't concern you.

631
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,680
Just go.

632
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,010
I'm sorry.

633
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,790
Come on.

634
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,150
We're waiting for you.

635
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:27,750
Thank you.

636
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,350
Hello, Liangcheng Law Firm.

637
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,070
There's a result already?

638
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,650
Yingzi, we've got a result!

639
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:40,850
Of Xu Jianshe's case?

640
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,510
Am I gonna get it myself or not?

641
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,430
Hold on.

642
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,670
Shall we go and get it?

643
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:47,270
Ask them mail it to us.

644
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,130
Sorry.

645
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,950
I'm afraid I can't go get it now.

646
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,590
Would you mail it to me?

647
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,430
The address?

648
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,900
Don't!

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:54,020
What address should we tell them?

650
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,340
Just forget it.

651
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,150
When people in the firm see it, they'll laugh at us.

652
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,070
I'm sorry. Please don't mail it.

653
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,680
Would you give me a second?

654
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,240
You don't want to get it yourself or have it mailed here.

655
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,480
What on earth do you want?

656
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,670
I don't know.

657
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,860
We'll get it ourselves.

658
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:09,850
We'll go get it.

659
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:11,600
Tell them we're going to get it.

660
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,750
Sorry.

661
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,230
I'll come and get it.

00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,140
Okay.

Bye.

664

What's the verdict?

665
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,300
They can't tell me on the phone, can they?

666
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,430
We won't know it until we see it.

667
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,030
You'll go get it.

No.

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,030
Why should I go?

671
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,560
You said you would go.

672
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,560
You're gonna do it.

673
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,090

00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,590
I won't go.

675
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:36,060
If our claim is dismissed,

676
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,740
I'll go crazy right on the spot.

677
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,640
You handle bad news better than I do. You should go.

00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,700
I can't go. Qiu Hua,

It's true that you might go crazy,

683
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,370
but I'll go insane if I am there.

684
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,670
Over these years,

685
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,720
I've had my fair share of surprises.

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,950
You can't stab a knife in my chest again.

687
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,790
Drop that act.

What's the harm?

No big deal.

695
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,860
Maybe the case stands some chances. Right?

696
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,540
You wish. It's impossible.

697
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,710
What if it's dismissed?

698
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,610
Tell yourself this:

699
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,030
it's normal if our claim gets dismissed;

700
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:19,390
it'd be an accident if it doesn't.

00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,510
Just go, brave girl.

Is there a retrial or not?

733
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,330
The court has ruled that the initial trial made an unclear judgement on the facts,

734

and a decision based on insufficient evidence.

735

00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,150
This is the first retrial in our firm!

749
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,940
I haven't seen such a thing happen

750
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,680
during all these years.

751
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,410
A client sentenced to life imprisonment gets a retrial!

752
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,670
The girls in this firm are better than men.

753
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,530
Awesome!

754
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,710
It's so weird.

755
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,260
It's really a retrial.

756
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:30,190
I can't believe we'd get a retrial for such a huge case.

757
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,150
How long has it been since our firm

758
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,890
last handled a case like this?

759
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:35,970
About five years.

760
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,300
Last time, the miracle was made Ms. Fang.

761
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,410
But this time,

762
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,930
it's made by two junior lawyers.

763
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,800
What's the big deal?

764
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,160
I got Wang Dafu acquitted in a previous case.

765
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,940
That's because those young lawyers

766
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,540
found exculpatory evidence.

767
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,320
What do you mean by that?

768
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,510
Are you jealous?

769
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,610
Jealous of what? Your incompetence?

770
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,730
Tao Zheng, what's that supposed to mean?

771
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,260
Do a criminal case, I dare you!

772
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,870
Do you think I don't know what you're doing?

773
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,310
As the director of the Management Committee,

774
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,710
you keep all lucrative cases for yourself.

775
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,730
Mr. Han, watch your mouth.

776
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,940
Otherwise, don't blame me for being rude.

777
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,520
I also know what you've done.

778
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,449
What have I done?

779
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,230
What have I done?

780
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,469
Enough.

781
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,889
No more quibbles.

782
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,210
Don't you feel pressured?

783
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,750
It was a radical decision

784
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,070
to allow them to form a team.

785
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,070
Mr. Tao is right.

786
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,900
Ms. Fang,

787
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,540
I don’t think you’ve thought it through.

788
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,400
What kind of law firm

789
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,190
would let two junior lawyers make a team?

790
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,949
Now they've become self-sufficient.

791
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,679
What good will it do to our firm?

792
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,280
How about

793
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,020
assigning Xia Shu to them?

794
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,850
Xia Shu is a partner of the firm.

795
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,250
It shows how much the firm cares about them.

796
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,810
That's a good idea.

797
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,380
Hello. Dad.

798
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,870
Are you off work?

799
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,270
Yes.

800
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
What's up?

801
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:28,890
Dad,

802
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,900
I have some good news.

803
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,220
I got a retrial for a case.

804
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,760
Yingzi,

805
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,330
congratulations!

806
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,030
Dad, where are you?

807
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm with your mom.

808
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,500
Put her on the phone.

809
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:48,900
Okay.

810
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,360
Jiayi,

811
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,990
our daughter wants to talk to you.

812
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,260
Listen carefully.

813
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,920
Our daughter has done a great job.

814
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,420
Hello, mom.

815
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,590
This is Yingzi.

816
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:07,770
Mom, I've got some good news.

817
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,590
A client who was sentenced to life imprisonment in the initial trial

818
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,390
now gets a retrial because of me.

819
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,990
Mom, do you know

820
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,530
how hard it is to handle such a case?

821
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:22,750
Few people in my firm could do it.

822
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,360
But I, a junior lawyer,

823
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,390
made that happen.

824
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:28,880
Mom,

825
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,320
I've made you proud, haven't I?

826
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,230
Take good care of yourself.

827
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,720
Just watch how I'm gonna fight for you.

828
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,140
I'll visit you when I have time.

829
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,760
Cheers!

830
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,880
Qiu Hua.

831
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,260
Your won the battle gracefully.

832
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,100
You didn’t see how angry Mr. Han was

833
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,300
in the meeting.

834
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,780
Really? What did he look like?

835
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,820
You have no idea!

836
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,920
Luo Yingzi, you're back at the right time.

837
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,960
I was just talking about Mr. Han.

838
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:21,920
Here, let me fill up your glass.

839
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,640
-It's not empty yet.
-In today's meeting...

840
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,790
Everyone was happy,

841
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,260
except Mr. Han.

842
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:28,040
Tao Zheng quibbled with him.

843
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,520
He almost got into a fight with Tao Zheng.

844
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,230
Would he be able to defeat Tao Zheng?

845
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,270
What do you think?

846
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,770
Guys,

847
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:40,960
to be honest,

848
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,500
it's been a long time since our firm

849
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,020
last made such an achievement.

850
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:45,520
Right?

851
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,300
Yes, yes, yes.

852
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,240
It's a glory for the Criminal Defense Department.

853
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,300
Yes, that's right.

854
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,320
Ms. Luo.

855
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,110
Ms. Qiu.

856
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,620
Through this case,

857
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,740
I find you two admirable.

858
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,540
What you've done is impressive.

859
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:56,300
I...

860
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,430
Wait.

861
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:58,950
Well,

862
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,710
I remember someone had a problem with me

863
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,420
and Ms. Qiu when we started taking on cases.

864
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,790
Who was it?

865
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,780
No one would...

866
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,380
It's you!

867
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,850
Why would I have a problem with them?

868
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:10,480
You did!

869
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,670
After all,

870
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,380
we are in the same department.

871
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,390
If you need help in a future case, just let me know.

872
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,110
I'd love to learn from you.

873
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:19,830
May I propose a toast to you?

874
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:20,690
I'm gonna drink it all.

875
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,970
Come on.

876
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,350
I've been working in the firm

877
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,210
for a long time.

878
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,140
I haven't achieved anything yet.

879
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,990
I also need your help.

880
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,820
Hua, don't join them in the horseplay.

881
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,300
We are in need of your help.

882
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,050
Queue up, alright?

883
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:34,550
Don't jump the line.

884
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,150
If you are to help anyone, it's me, right?

885
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:37,150
Shut up.

886
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,890
Come on, guys.

887
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,020
It's rare for us to have a party.

888
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,250
We'll drink as much as we can!

889
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:42,720
Sure.

890
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,730
Cheers!

891
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,690
One, two, three.

892
00:38:55,450 --> 00:38:57,420
Two, two, three.

893
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,800
You're wrong again.

894
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,690
I feel relieved.

895
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,290
When we first took on cases,

896
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,310
none of them showed support. Right?

897
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:09,990
But today,

898
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,520
they couldn't wait

899
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,560
to fawn on us.

900
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,510
It feels so good to be fawned on.

901
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,110
Wipe that smug look off your face!

902
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,200
I'll be honest with you.

903
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,910
Look.

904
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,300
We started taking on cases

905
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,780
just a year ago, didn't we?

906
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:32,050
Now, we've got a retrial for a client who's sentenced to life imprisonment.

907
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,040
Who could do that?

908
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,830
We made it.

909
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,880
We upheld justice and made money

910
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,150
without compromising our dignity.

911
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,950
We've got fame and fortune at the same time.

912
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,640
Now we've only been granted a retrial,

913
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,260
not an acquittal. Don't get so conceited.

914
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
No way. Just let me have fun

915
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,260
for the time being.

916
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,190
Frankly,

917
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,300
Yingzi,

918
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,150
I owe you many thanks.

919
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,900
You're getting serious.

920
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,240
You must have a load of compliments for me.

921
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,750
Come on.

922
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:02,900
I'm all ears.

923
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,080
I want to thank you

924
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,850
for helping me get rid of Mr. Han.

925
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,870
Otherwise, I would still be bullied by him

926
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,250
just like other guys,

927
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,870
and never make a name for myself.

928
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,750
Don't even mention it.

929
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,640
Listen.

930
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,760
You could get what you have now

931
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,300
because of your intelligence and hard work.

932
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,280
I should thank you instead.

933
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,330

934
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,670
Let's have more fun.

935
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,080
We''ll go drinking now.

936
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,980
Let's get drunk!

937
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,440
Come on.

938
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,100
How about we take a rain check?

939
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,180
I've got something to do.

940
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,280
Are you really heading to another party?

941
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,560
Qiu Hua.

942
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,430
I didn't know

943
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,050
you could be a party animal.

944
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:51,330
Well...

945
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,620
We'll drink next time.

946
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,040
Now I see why you keep looking at there.

947
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,760
Isn't that your suitor,

948
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,220
Zhang Quanquan?

949
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Lower your voice!

950
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,930
Do you have a date with him?

951
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,990
Are you two in love?

952
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,960
Stop gossiping.

953
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,190
Keep your voice down.

954
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,470
If he and I get in a relationship,

955
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,200
you'll be the first one to know.

956
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,090
Alright.

957
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,840
Off you go.

958
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,250
I’m leaving then.

959
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:17,930
Okay.

960
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,320
Text me when you get home.

961
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,970
Just go. I know you can't wait.

962
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,370
Bye.

963
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:22,000
Bye.

964
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,370
Quanquan!

965
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,260
Ms. Luo.

966
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,710
The car is here.

967
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,720
Ms. Fang.

968
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,270
Xia Shu?

969
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,970
Qiu Hua, there you are.

970
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,300
Good morning, Ms. Qiu.

971
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:49,550
Morning.

972
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,400
Qiu Hua.

973
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,170
I just asked Ma Lili to come.

974
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,370
She should be on her way now.

975
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,550
She'll be here soon.

976
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,320
Xia Shu,

977
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,450
I have something to discuss with Ms. Luo.

978
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,580
Would you excuse us?

979
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:14,310
Qiu Hua.

980
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:18,890
Xia Shu has become part of our team at Ms. Fang's request.

981
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,640
Do we have a team?

982
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,730
It's only the two of us.

983
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,010
With me, there's a team.

984
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,480
Ms. Qiu,

985
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,930
I was wrong last time. I'm sorry.

986
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,260
I just wanted to win.

987
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,650
I won't do it again. I assure you.

988
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,620
Xia Shu, stay here.

989
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:40,370
Ms. Qiu and I need to talk in private.

990
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:49,630
Hua,

991
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,310
even though we hate it,

992
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,130
we'd better act like we don't.

993
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,310
Wipe that look off your face.
