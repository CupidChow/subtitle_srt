00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:20,110
on the internet.

191
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,990
Just let us, your lawyers,

192
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,590
take over the rest.

193
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,190
When you get home,

194
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,580
lock up the door and take a shower.

195
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,970
Have a good sleep, too.

196
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,170
If possible,

197
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,470
read some books and watch soap operas.

198
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,950
Just be patient and see how the case goes.

199
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Okay?

200
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,750
Okay, I'll listen to you.

201
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,870
This is an old phone of mine.

202
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,870
I no longer use it.

203
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,430
I've also got a new card in it.

204
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,750
For now, you can use this phone.

205
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,430
You should keep in touch with us

206
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,560
on this phone.

207
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,830
Thank you.

208
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,720
I should probably get going.

209
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,770
I'll walk you out. Come on.

210
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,430
No, thanks.

211
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,830
You've been very bothered by my case.

212
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,060
I can take care of myself.

213
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,590
Go and have a good rest then.

214
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,870
We can't just sit here and do nothing

215
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,320
when people smear her.

216
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,180
We've gotta protect our client.

217
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,300
Our opponent has held a press conference.

218
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,170
I think

219
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:21,740
it's necessary for us to draft a statement.

220
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,550
You didn't expect it to unravel like this, did you?

221
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,990
We did.

222
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,440
We got ourselves prepared in the beginning.

223
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,520
But we underestimated the number of people

224
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,630
taking their side and abusing Guo Yu.

225
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,720
Are you panicked?

226
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,590
No.

227
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,910
We are wondering

228
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,470
if we should

229
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,490
start protecting our client.

230
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,140
Of course you should.

231
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,430
Ms. Fang, is this statement okay?

232
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,690
It's too formal.

233
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,630
Write down what I say.

234
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,430
You can lead with this:

235
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,450
Ms. Guo,

236
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,720
up to this day, is still deeply grateful

237
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:13,250
for the support of Weida Fund.

238
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,050
But she doesn't agree that the sponsorship

239
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,870
gives the founder of Weida Fund

240
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,120
the right to sexually offend her.

241
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,270
So, Ms. Guo

242
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:28,790
will continue to use law as a weapon

243
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,990
to defend her legal rights.

244
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,380
Make sure it gets stamped by Tianli Law Firm.

245
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,780
Send it out in their name.

246
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,550
I'll go to Tianli Law Firm right away.

247
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,480
There's one more reminder for you.

248
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,060
What is it?

249
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,590
It's about your witnesses.

250
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,730
Try to prevent them from backing down.

251
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,580
Before the trial,

252
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,800
keep looking for other witnesses.

253
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,230
My gut tells me

254
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,000
that there's some key evidence

255
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,350
you haven't found.

256
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,730
Why haven't the dynamics of public opinions changed yet?

257
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,860
Am I having poor internet connection?

258
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,420
Why are these comments still around?

259
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,180
What's wrong with these people?

260
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,840
Does justice no longer exist?

261
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:30,830
Xia Shu,

262
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,570
can you stop making noises?

263
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,990
We've issued our statement,

264
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,710
but it hasn't changed anything.

265
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,970
It's like throwing a stone into an ocean.

266
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,350
I told you so.

267
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,160
Tianli Law Firm is too small.

268
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,760
The statement issued in its name

269
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,520
wouldn't attract any attention.

270
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,750
We should've done it in our firm's name.

271
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,480
It's just a patent case.

272
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,710
Finding a bigger case than that

273
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,070
is a piece of case.

274
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,230
Xia Shu,

275
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,900
can you stop saying that?

276
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,270
At least, when you leave this room,

277
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,150
don't say that in front of others.

278
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,580
Doesn't it concern you that people would hate you?

279
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,830
I brought a case to the firm.

280
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,290
Everyone would benefit from it.

281
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,550
Why would they hate me?

282
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,790
If you're angry,

283
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,000
go find another victim.

284
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,830
Ms. Fang had a point.

285
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,510
Perhaps we haven't found

286
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,570
the key evidence, or the key witness.

287
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,020
What?

288
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:27,800
Okay.

289
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,110
Speaking of the devil.

290
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,190
Ms. Fang was right.

291
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,110
What's wrong?

292
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,350
A witness came and asked for a meeting.

293
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,010
Her purpose is quite obvious.

294
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,990
Let's go, Qiu Hua.

295
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,430
Let's meet with the witness.

296
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,090
I'll go with you.

297
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,830
What do you think you can do there?

298
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,640
I insist on going with you.

299
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,640
Xiao Ailing.

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

301
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,250
What brought you here?

302
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,260
The trial hasn't started yet.

303
00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:01,110
[Witness of Yang Weida's sexual harassment case Xiao Ailing]

304
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,210
Ms. Luo, I'm very sorry.

305
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,260
I...

306
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,510
I want to withdraw my statement.

307
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
-No way.
-Xia Shu.

308
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,430
Have a seat.

309
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,460
Why do you want to do that?

310
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,290
Can you tell us the reason?

311
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,110
Isn't it self-explanatory?

312
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,510
You've seen the public opinions these days.

313
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,110
They're targeting at Guo Yu.

314
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:23,550
If my statement is disclosed to the public,

315
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,880
I'll be the next target.

316
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,590
Is that why you want to withdraw it?

317
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,110
Are you going to swallow the shame and never speak of it for the rest of your life?

318
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,750
If another girl gets harassed by him

319
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,470
just like you did,

320
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:32,390
won't you feel guilty?

321
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,260
No, I won't.

322
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,590
Ms. Luo. Ms. Qiu.

323
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,010
I don't want to testify anymore.

324
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,760
Please give my witness statement back to me.

325
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,410
Ailing, don't worry.

326
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,110
Without your permission,

327
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,110
we aren't allowed to submit your statement

328
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,510
to the court.

329
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,780
But since you're here,

330
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,710
would you mind telling us more?

331
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,510
We just want to know

332
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,080
if you have other worries

333
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,990
besides public opinions.

334
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,710
I want to recant my statement also because

335
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:06,710
I know ordinary people like me can't win the powerful.

336
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,510
Let me put it this way, Ms. Luo.

337
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,800
Even if the case ends right now,

338
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,030
given all the disturbance it has caused,

339
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,760
people have probably realized

340
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,900
that Yang Weida is not a good person.

341
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,990
If now I'm a student

342
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,510
who is worried about tuition fees,

343
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,990
and he suggests sponsoring me,

344
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,710
should I accept his help?

345
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,430
What do you think?

346
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,230
Of course you shouldn't.

347
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,440
Money can't buy a person's dignity.

348
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,400
You must have never experienced hunger.

349
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,830
If I can't support myself through college,

350
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,550
and he says he could give me a favor,

351
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,340
I would probably accept it,

352
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,710
though I know he's a hypocrite.

353
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:44,250
How could you?

354
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,630
Yes. That's what I am.

355
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,060
Yang Weida won't be defeated.

356
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,830
If I testify,

357
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll get into trouble.

358
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,250
So, I don't want to testify anymore.

359
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,250
Please give my statement back to me.

360
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,270
Ms. Xiao, we hope you'll reconsider it.

361
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,540
I have made up my mind.

362
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,830
Xiao Ailing,

363
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,360
thank you.

364
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,510
Anyway,

365
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,770
we owe you many thanks.

366
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,470
It's you who made us

367
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,630
truly believe

368
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:20,960
Yang Weida did commit sexual harassment.

369
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,600
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,510
I can't be of help to you anymore.

371
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,180
I advise you to drop the case.

372
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,260
Ordinary people like us can't win the powerful.

373
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,230
Human nature disappoints me.

374
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,730
How many witnesses do we have now?

375
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,510
Four.

376
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,140
Yin Qiao, Liang Aiai, Zhang Min,

377
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,510
and Shan Guiping.

378
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:05,990
With them, the judge should be convinced

379
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,650
that there was indeed sexual harassment.

380
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,180
Plus, some of them

381
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,280
have strong evidence.

382
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,069
Definitely.

383
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,030
If the judge denies it's sexual harassment,

384
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,030
then the world must have gone crazy.

385
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,980
There might be more witnesses quitting.

386
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:19,880
Qiu Hua.

387
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,869
Don't jinx it.

388
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,920
My bad.

389
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,320
Is there one more quitter already?

390
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,160
No way.

391
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,270
Hello?

392
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,510
Okay, got it.

393
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,250
Come on. Liang Aiai is here.

394
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,400
[Witness of Yang Weida's sexual harassment case Liang Aiai]

395
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:01,750
I'm sorry.

396
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,680
[Witness of Yang Weida's sexual harassment case, Yin Qiao]

397
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,060
[Witness of Yang Weida's sexual harassment case, Zhang Min]

398
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,850
What is going on with you?

399
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,050
Are you discouraged?

400
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,870
We still have one witness,

401
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,750
and she has given a convincing statement.

402
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,990
In fact,

403
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,310
as long as we have her statement,

404
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,870
we can convict Yang Weida.

405
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:47,140
Yeah.

406
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,240
Shan Guiping's statement is good.

407
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:49,990
Besides,

408
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:51,430
we have her text messages, don't we?

409
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,290
Those make the whole thing clear.

410
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,330
Maybe she will show up in the next minute.

411
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,960
No, she won't.

412
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,710
I guarantee.

413
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,470
Why are you looking at the phone?

414
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,470
I guarantee you that she won't quit.

415
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,130
Qiu Hua, go!

416
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,560
The evidence exchange meeting is at 10. We've got one more hour.

417
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,490
No need to hurry.

418
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,750
Are you afraid that there will be

419
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:52,470
another call coming in within an hour?

420
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,270
Can you not jinx it?

421
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,990
Don't worry. Shan Guiping won't flip.

422
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,230
Let's go. Go!

423
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:58,620
I mean it.

424
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,400
As long as we submit the evidence,

425
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,590
it'll be too late for her to change her mind.

426
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,110
Xia Shu, stay put.

427
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,130
Make some more calls.

428
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:05,930
See if you can find a new witness.

429
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:07,810
Okay.

430
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,910
[Jingbei Court]

431
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,170
We tried so hard for a long time.

432
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,950
Yet the last witness

433
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,740
was found by Xia Shu.

434
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,030
Anyway,

435
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,750
if she's willing to take the stand,

436
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,370
we might still win this case.

437
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,230
Righteous Luo.

438
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,360
Unscrupulous Chen.

439
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,510
Aren't you thrilled

440
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,410
about doing cases like this?

441
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,410
What do you mean?

442
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,710
It's like a fox mourning for a hare's death.

443
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,390
If we convict Yang Weida this time,

444
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,910
you'll be the next.

445
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,680
Do you think you can get me?

446
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,570
I'm not as stupid as Yang Weida is.

447
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,470
It sounds like you do know what a client you've got.

448
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,990
Whether I know what kind of person he is or not

449
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,910
doesn't matter at all.

450
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,470
I've earned the money I want.

451
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,510
That's for sure.

452
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:07,500
You have no shame.

453
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,890
Maybe I shouldn't call you Unscrupulous Chen.

454
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,570
Ms. Qiu.

455
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,440
Ms. Zhang, Mr. Wang.

456
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,870
Thank you for taking the time.

457
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,930
You did all the work.

458
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,660
We're just gonna build on that.

459
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,520
Let's get in.

460
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:16,920
Sure.

461
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,660
Ms. Qiu,

462
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,230
what do you think of this case?

463
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,160
I don't think our chances are good.

464
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,890
Defendant, is that all you have?

465
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,880
Your Honor, they ambushed us.

466
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,840
The court hasn't given us enough time for discovery.

467
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,360
Can we have a few more days

468
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,350
and postpone the date of the trial?

469
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:49,890
We only ask for 10 days,

470
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,510
or a week.

471
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,360
No.

472
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,470
The trial was scheduled long ago.

473
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,930
Both parties were informed at the same time.

474
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,400
What is he up to?

475
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:01,730
Your Honor,

476
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,230
the court has set a time limit for this part.

477
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,670
This is the last session for discovery.

478
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,470
If the defendant insists on extending the process,

479
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,030
we will file a complaint and deny them

480
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,230
the chance of evidence examination.

481
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,310
Helping others equals to helping yourselves.

482
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,060
Maybe

483
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,470
you will also find new evidence later on.

484
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,470
We don't need it.

485
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,850
We'd like to reiterate

486
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,410
that the discovery stage is over.

487
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:20,490
We hope the court wouldn't accept

488
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,300
the evidence revealed behind schedule.

489
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,380
Gorgeous,

490
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,390
why so serious?

491
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,550
Your Honor,

492
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,860
we don't think the defendant's counsel

493
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,100
addresses us properly

494
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,550
or has shown us respect.

495
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,230
We ask the court to admonish Mr. Chen.

496
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:34,590
Defendant's counsel,

497
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,230
we're in court.

498
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,180
You'd better show some respect.

499
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,230
These two lawyers are good.

500
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,310
Where did you get those helpers?

501
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,240
They're not bad.

502
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,990
We loathe fighting a two-bit lawyer

503
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,580
like you in person.

504
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,320
You're quite confident.

505
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,920
What now?

506
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,890
Is this what you're gonna use to defeat me?

507
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:15,440
You once proudly declared to win us. Now, I say the same thing to you.

508
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,300
Righteous Luo.

509
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,160
I heard

510
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,030
that all your witnesses had quit.

511
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,470
There's only one left.

512
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,960
She must be more righteous than you.

513
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:26,390
She won't quit even if you do.

514
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:27,280
Impressive.

515
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,710
See you in court.

516
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,360
See you in court.

517
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,610
I swear

518
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,670
this time I will teach him a lesson.

519
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,190
Yingzi, I feel like something is wrong.

520
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
What's wrong?

521
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,760
Chen Shuo was clearly implying something.

522
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,690
He seemed sure of winning the case.

523
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,870
He just didn't believe we had adequate evidence.

524
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,470
The evidence provided by Shan Guiping alone

525
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,330
is enough to...

526
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,890
Now I see what's wrong.

527
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:01,170
He has looked through the evidence.

528
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,310
What makes him so confident?

529
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,190
Plus, why is Xia Shu so sure

530
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,920
that Shan Guiping won't withdraw her statement?

531
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,880
Let's go.

532
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,630
If you like her, you should tell her.

533
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,180
Don't sneak around as if you're guarding against me.

534
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,950
There's something wrong with that witness.

535
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,210
You didn't need to insinuate that to her.

536
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:33,230
She could find it out by herself.

537
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,990
You

538
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,280
are too soft.

539
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,510
Oh you...

-Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

What are you doing here?

542
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,080
First, we'd like to thank you for agreeing to take the stand.

543
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,500
The trial will begin on the 15th.

544
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,780
We've completed the evidence exchange stage.

545
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,430
The evidence provided by you was submitted to the court.

546
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,710
We just want to know if you have problems.

547

[Witness of Yang Weida's sexual harassment case Shan Guiping]

548
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,470
No. No problem.

549
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:59,190
Ms. Xia has already talked to me.

550
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,700
Okay, thank you very much.

551
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,750
Ms. Shan,

552
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:03,590
Actually, I have a question.

553
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,510
Don't you worry that taking the stand

554
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,750
will get you in trouble?

555
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,470
I'm all by myself.

556
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,770
As long as I keep my inner peace,

557
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:13,230
what other people think doesn't concern me.

558
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,550
I'm going back to work.

559
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,670
Ms. Shan.

560
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,850
Sorry.

561
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,420
I have another question.

562
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,310
Why would you agree to testify?

563
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,790
Ms. Xia asked me to do so, didn't she?

564
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,990
I was indeed assaulted by Yang Weida.

565
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
When Ms. Xia approached you,

566
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,330
did she promise to give you a benefit?

567
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,390
Ms. Shan, please be honest with us.

568
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,440
Otherwise, when the case is taken to court,

569
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,240
there could serious consequences.

570
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,710
In fact, it's not much of a benefit.

571
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,230
When Ms. Xia came to my place,

572
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,230
my landlord was urging me to pay the rent.

573
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,630
But I couldn't afford it.

574
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,870
So Ms. Xia paid two months' rent for me.

575
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,300
Ms. Xia also told me

576
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:54,030
that even after the case was over,

577
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,290
I could still ask her for help at any time.

578
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,370
Why do you want to take it back?

579
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:02,710
We found that

580
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,570
this piece of evidence is flawed.

581
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,570
But you don't have much evidence.

582
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,990
With this going away,

583
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,290
it's possible that you can't make a case.

584
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,690
We'll take it back for discussion.

585
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,480
Then we'll make a final decision.

586
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,680
Thank you, Ms. Su. Thanks for your time.

587
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,370
It doesn't matter

588
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,190
if I can't make money from this lawsuit.

589
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,870
I just can't accept that because of you,

590
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,470
I appeared unprofessional before the judge.

591
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,410
I think this lawsuit should be dropped

592
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:24,810
as soon as possible. Bye.

593
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,140
You're back!

594
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,800
Wait for me to finish the game.

595
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,650
What are you doing? I was about to get on a higher level.

596
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:40,310
Why did you bribe the witness?

597
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:41,520
Who did I bribe?

598
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,620
Shan Guiping.

599
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,910
Didn't you give her money to pay her rent?

600
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,560
Do you think you can conceal it?

601
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,990
Now, not only do we know that,

602
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,270
the defendant counsel has also found it out.

603
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,910
Do you want to help the haters,

604
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,550
and get us disbarred? Will that make you happy?

605
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,370
No. Luo Yingzi.

606
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,390
I didn't mean to bribe her.

607
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,690
I just wanted to help her.

608
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,710
I thought in in return for my favor,

609
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,990
she would agree to testify for us.

610
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,190
But now

611
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,620
you have traded favors.

612
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,080
Your behavior has constituted bribery.

613
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,180
Do you know what legal liabilities that leaves you?

614
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,310
Xia Shu, you already have a rich father.

615
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,030
Why do you have to stick around in the firm?

616
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,070
You should just go.

617
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,640
Go!

618
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,910
Luo Yingzi, I was wrong.

619
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,470
I didn't expect it to bring such serious consequences.

620
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,910
I just wanted to win the case.

621
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,270
I did it for justice.

622
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,540
You're defiling this word. You know?

623
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:20,670
You are a partner of the firm.

624
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,400
You have your own office.

625
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,750
Why must you stay at our tiny place?

626
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,630
I'm sorry. I admit I was wrong.

627
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,790
I won't do it again.

628
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,250
Please don't chase me off.

629
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:30,710
Xia Shu, stop it.

630
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:32,670
-Go back to your own office.
-Yingzi.

631
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,270
Off you go.

632
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,440
Qiu Hua, you...

633
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,200
Xia Shu!

634
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,420
Xia Shu!

635
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,600
You must be off work now.

636
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,150
Look!

637
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,930
I bought some roses on the way.

638
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,700
I'm not off work yet.

639
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,710
But you're about to.

640
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,320
Didn't you say you wanted to go shopping?

641
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,320
I have time for it.

642
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,450
Let's go shopping.

643
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:59,660
What are you doing in the firm?

644
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,370
Why do you keep coming here?

645
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,720
Do you take me as a child?

646
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,110
You should go.

647
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:05,140
Xia Shu!

648
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,030
What's wrong?

649
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,390
Who made you angry?

650
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:10,190
You made me angry.

651
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,310
I don't want to see you.

652
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,110
Go away!

653
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,070
Xia Shu.

654
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,340
Didn't you hear me?

655
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,960
I told you go away! Go!

656
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,500
See?

657
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,260
Even when she's venting out anger, someone's willing to receive it.

658
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,460
Who's gonna bear with us when we're mad?

659
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:32,830
Yingzi.

660
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,300
Should we continue with the case?

661
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,630
We don't have any evidence now.

662
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,900
What if Guo Yu wants to continue?

663
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,920
Today is set for exchanging evidence.

664
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,910
She hasn't even called yet.

665
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,130
Is she backing down too?

666
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,920
Call and ask her.

667
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,110
I dare not to try.

668
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:56,310
There is a change of situation.

669
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,690
We have the obligation to inform the client.

670
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,730
I know.

671
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,870
I'll call her.

672
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,460
Guo Yu.

673
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,350
This morning, we exchanged evidence with the defendant's counsel.

674
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,520
Sorry, Ms. Qiu.

675
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,710
I'm a bit occupied now.

676
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:18,330
I'll call you back. Alright?

677
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,150
Sorry.

678
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,380
I heard it.

679
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:25,580
She doesn't want to continue with the case. Right?

680
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,320
What should we do now?

681
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,970
What can we do?

682
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,470
She wants to drop it.

683
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,040
Even if we want to keep it going, we can't.

684
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,500
At least,

685
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,820
we don't need to worry about

686
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,680
losing our dignity in the firm.

687
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,070
When it's time to make a report,

688
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,820
we can say the client chooses to give up.

689
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,820
We have no choice.

690
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,810
This is exhausting.

691
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:09,760
It's wearing me out.

692
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:14,080
If you need to, take a holiday.

693
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,320
By the way,

694
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,400
I'll ask Tao

695
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,510
to give the patent case back to us.

696
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,820
We'll work on it by ourselves.

697
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,460
From now on, we'll focus on the cases

698
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,630
that are lucrative and free of risks.

699
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,110
Facing the east,

700
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,350
we'll see spring and flowers out there.

701
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,430
Just eat and sleep.

702
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,410
Wake up and start making money.

703
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,730
Life is wonderful.

704
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,160
Cheers.

705
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,270
I haven't cleared

706
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,670
all my debts.

707
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,170
In just one year,

708
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,990
I was reduced from a worry-free housewife

709
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,450
to a wandering bum

710
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,190
in heavy debt.

711
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,580
If I miss work for one day, I'll starve.

712
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,290
My life is unstable.

713
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,330
My job is unstable.

714
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,180
Even I would laugh when I call myself a career woman.

715
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,770
Who am I

716
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,790
to try to get justice for others,

717
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,710
and call for fair treatment for everyone?

718
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,750
Who else would give themselves such a hard time?

719
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,680
Not many people.

720
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,130
Thank you for being brutally honest.

721
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,070
You're not better than me.

722
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:27,340
Someone harasses you but you keep silent about it.

723
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,000
Then you go out and seek justice for others.

724
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:33,610
Exactly.

725
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:34,750
Come on.

726
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:37,140
Will it kill you to say a few more words?

727
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,610
I'll say one word then.

728
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:41,860
Cheers!

729
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,150
Cheers!

730
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,670
Qiu Hua, listen.

731
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,920
Don't drink it yet.

732
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,750
Let's swear an oath.

733
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,890
If we ever give ourselves a hard time again,

734
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,950
we'll never be able to make any money.

735
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,230
Okay.

736
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,440
You'd better remember what you said.

737
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,080
Chug it.

738
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,960
[Mom]

739
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,070
What's more,

740
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,600
I'll talk to Tao tomorrow

741
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,610
and get that case back.

742
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,660
This is only our first case.

743
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,770
There will be tons of 500,000-worth cases,

744
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,660
or one million-worth cases coming our way.

745
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,990
Soon we'll be very rich.

746
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,020
Even if it can't come true,

747
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,610
it's quite pleasant to just think about it.

748
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,780
Why do you have to be a buzzkill?

749
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,350
Here's a punishment for you: chug it.

750
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:26,970
I'll drink with you.

751
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,090
I won't be a buzzkill anymore.

752
00:32:28,090 --> 00:32:30,360
Cheers for our extremely shallow pockets.

753
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,650
You're so mean.

754
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,740
[Mom]

755
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,640
I need to get my mom's call.

756
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,320
Hey, mom.

757
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
I'm working late.

758
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,940
I've told you

759
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,650
not to call me so often.

760
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,440
I haven't got this month's salary yet.

761
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,710
When I get it,

762
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,390
I'll transfer money to you immediately.

763
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,430
Stop rushing me.

764
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,100
Why do you rush me every month?

765
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:16,630
I don't want to talk about this now, okay?

766
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,390
I'll call you back later.

767
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,940
Are you crazy?

768
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,630
Who is crazy?

769
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:38,580
Are you okay?

770
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,900
It's so embarrassing.

771
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:43,690
I've just given Chen Shuo another reason to laugh at me.

772
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,270
He doesn't know why we're dropping the case.

773
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,300
It's not like that.

774
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:49,520
I can lose to anyone, but him.

775
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,420
Technically speaking, you didn't lose.

776
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,950
You haven't fought him in court yet.

777
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:54,030
One day, I will.

778
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:54,870
I hate him so much.

779
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:55,830
Come on. Have a drink.

780
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,710
More drinks?

781
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:58,190
I... I just threw up what I had drunk.

782
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:58,870
Now I'm sober.

783
00:33:58,870 --> 00:33:59,980
Here comes the second round.

784
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,960
Gosh.

785
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,429
No matter how poor I am,

786
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:51,659
I won't sell these two watches.

787
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,460
These are my last decent things.

788
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,060
I need them for negotiation meetings.

789
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,190
Do you keep your car for the same reason?

790
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,830
Why did you choose a red car?

791
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,320
Red brings wealth.

792
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,150
When I'm officially divorced,

793
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,510
I'll get a pink one

794
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,850
to attract men.

795
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,420
Your old blue car seemed too shy.

796
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,000
That's why I divorced.

797
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:16,160
Your red car is quite eye-catching.

798
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:18,740
I'm just not sure if it'll bring you wealth.

799
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,140
It's a great match for me.

800
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,750
I can't keep a low profile.

801
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,690
-Righteous Luo.
-Look, today, I...

802
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:25,950
Unscrupulous Chen.

803
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,010
Come on. Sit down.

804
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,970
Take a seat and have a drink.

805
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,780
I'm happy today.

806
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,170
We'll keep drinking till we can't.

807
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,830
Waiter, can you get me a glass?

808
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,670
Now you're just slurring words.

809
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,000
Did you drive a car here?

810
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,810
Mind your own business.

811
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,610
It's not like I'm minding yours.

812
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,500
How much did you drink?

813
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,190
Do you remember where you live?

814
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,330
I'll be a nice guy today

815
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,930
and give you a ride. Alright?

816
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,240
Don't pretend

817
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,070
to be a gentleman.

818
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:52,090
I'm telling you, people are lining up to drive me home.

819
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,530
I don't need you.

820
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,160
I know.

821
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,200
Do you wanna be caught driving under the influence?

822
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,190
Who am I supposed to fight in court then?

823
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,520
I don't enjoy crushing others except you.

824
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,480
You?

825
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,950
You won the previous lawsuit

826
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:06,490
because you borrowed our ideas.

827
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,540
Don't be so smug about it.

828
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,400
Fine. Yes. I borrowed your ideas.

829
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,470
Come on. I'll take you home.

830
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:11,430
Don't touch me.

831
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,430
I'm telling you, I'm very ticklish.

832
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,840
I don't need you.

833
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,560
See?

834
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,990
The red car over there.

835
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,070
It's mine.

836
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:19,790
I know you own a red car.

837
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,430
-A red car. Right?
-You betcha.

838
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,390
I got it. I got it.

839
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,070
Ms. Qiu,

840
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:24,510
come on. I'll drive you both home.

841
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,910
No need to. I can go home on my own.

842
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,480
Ignore him. Let's drink.

843
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,390
Stop drinking.

844
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,770
You've drunk enough today.

845
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,280
You've gotta work tomorrow.

846
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,550
Yeah. You've gotta work tomorrow. Let's go.

847
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,340
Come on.

848
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,980
Fine. I'll listen to Ms. Qiu.

849
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:36,780
Don't touch me.

850
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:38,410
Wait.

851
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,450
You should eat some.

852
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,300
You've been juggling with so many girls.

853
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:43,830
You need nutrition.

854
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,720
I've got my fair share of nutrition.

855
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,720
-Okay.
-Let's go.

856
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,080
I meant well.

857
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,380
Take care of yourself.

858
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,380
That way! It's that way!

859
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,580
The car is over there.

860
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,870
Don't touch me!

861
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,290
Mom.

862
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,640
Didn't I say I would call you later?

863
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,310
Don't hang up.

864
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,420
Hua.

865
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,440
You...

866
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,340
You've gotta think about our family.

867
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,860
You can't be so selfish, can you?

868
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,610
Even if you don't care about your parents,

869
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,150
you should care about your younger siblings.

870
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,130
I'm talking about the county magistrate

871
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,590
and his son.

872
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,550
What else do you want?

873
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,040
You went to Jingbei

874
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:06,330
and the magistrate's son went after you.

875
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,570
Where else can you find a man

876
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,690
as good as he is?

877
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,840
Besides,

878
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,990
if you marry him,

879
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,390
our life will be much more comfortable.

880
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,660
Mom, can you let me think about it?

881
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,000
I know he's way out of my league.

882
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,620
It's an honor that he likes me.

883
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,210
Can you just let me mull it over?

884
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:37,770
I'll call you back later.

885
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,480
Where am I?

886
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,770
Outside your home.

887
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,080
How did you...

888
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,930
Why would you drive me home?

889
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,360
You're too drunk to recall it, aren't you?

890
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,020
You begged me again and again.

891
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,390
"My head is aching!"

892
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,550
"Mr. Chen, can you give me a ride?"

893
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,740
I was headed a different direction.

894
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,340
But I chose to drive you home.

895
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:03,880
That can't be true.

896
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,550
That doesn't sound like me at all.

897
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,140
Stop taking advantage of me.

898
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,330
What advantage have I taken?

899
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,290
I'll get off now.

900
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,530
You can barely stand on your feet.

901
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,280
I'll walk you home.

902
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:19,030
No need to.

903
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,290
I don't want to bring a wolf into my house.

904
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,570
What?

905
00:41:23,790 --> 00:41:24,690
Just drop the charge.

906
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,870
It's not worthwhile to stick your neck out

907
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,800
for someone else's matters.

908
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,780
I wanna puke.

909
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:29,440
Save it for later.

910
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,360
Wait a moment.

911
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,470
Do you remember your car?

912
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,940
Do you want it back?

913
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:34,780
Yes.

914
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:35,810
Give me the car key.

915
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,270
I'll drive it back for you.

916
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,260
Don't throw up in your bag.

917
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,140
Come back soon.

918
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,630
Here.

919
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,190
Which room on which floor do you live in?

920
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,800
Which room and which floor?

921
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,080
What do you want?

922
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:57,260
I need to send your car key back, lady!

923
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:00,200
Come with me.

924
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:08,100
Here.

925
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,140
Just leave the key here.

926
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,330
Don't go upstairs.

927
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,390
