[Episode 10]

4
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,550
Open the door!

5
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,000
Luo Yingzi, it's time to pay your debts!

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,710
Hurry up!

7
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,479
Open the door!

8
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:48,190
Pay us!

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,840
We represent the Civil Commercial Bank.

10
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,750
Your husband Liu Ming owes us a loan

11
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,310
that he should've repaid 3 months ago.

12
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,750
Liu Ming wants children now.

13
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,990
Open the door!

14
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,150
Pay us! Pay us!

15
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,110
Open the door!

16
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,590
What's wrong with you?

17
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,040
How could you not repay your loans?

18
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,970
What's going on?

19
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,240
Sorry.

20
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,440
Sorry, Ms. Mei.

21
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,440
Do you always stay alert

22
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,650
when you're asleep?

23
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,500
Since my husband

24
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,270
ran away,

25
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:31,910
I feel that bad things would happen.

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,370
What is it about?

27
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,329
He

28
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,290
mortgaged our apartment.

29
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,870
Then I was evicted from it

30
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,329
by the bank.

31
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,480
The court hasn't ruled yet, has it?

32
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,370
Chen Shuo from Dazheng Law Firm

33
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
played dirty.

34
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,080
And the bank decided to go rogue.

35
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,540
Move out, then.

36
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,020
Thank you.

37
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:13,600
Ms. Mei,

38
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,579
It's just a very short time, isn't it?

39
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:24,090
Before this happened,

40
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,920
my life was comfortable without worries.

41
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,270
I got too bored,

42
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,940
so I took the bar exam.

43
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,280
In a blink of an eye,

44
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,820
my husband ran away,

45
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,900
and left me with a load of debts.

46
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,160
I have nowhere to go.

47
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,590
I don't own a place anymore.

48
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,480
The worst thing is that

49
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,370
I don't know

50
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,329
how I got myself in this situation.

51
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,990
What have I done wrong

52
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,740
to deserve all this suffering?

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,370
I know how you feel.

54
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,750
I was as hurt as you are 3 years ago.

55
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,630
At that time,

56
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,120
my husband Yu Daliang and I

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,870
founded Liangcheng Law Firm.

58
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,490
We ambitiously tried to build it

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,430
into a top-class firm in the country.

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,640
But suddenly,

61
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,470
we were convicted of crimes.

62
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,930
My husband

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,880
collapsed in court.

64
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,980
I was disbarred.

65
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Just like you,

66
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,590
I didn't know

67
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,890
how everything happened.

68
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,280
Someone set us up.

69
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,620
But who was it?

70
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,800
Why would this person do so?

71
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,120
I still can't figure it out.

72
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,380
All of a sudden, I lost my husband, my home,

73
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,560
my reputation and property.

74
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,370
I changed my name

75
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,390
into my husband's.

76
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,590
You can imagine

77
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,950
how I felt at that time.

78
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,050
I insist

79
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,110
that our names must be cleared.

80
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,060
But until now,

81
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,190
I haven't done anything yet.

82
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:15,520
Ms. Mei,

83
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,240
compared to you,

84
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,210
what I've been through is trivial.

85
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,280
Being alive

86
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,640
is all that matters.

87
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,670
We can only

88
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,560
save ourselves.

89
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,570
Why are you here?

90
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,140
I came to see you.

91
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,360
I wanted to know how you're doing.

92
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,730
I'm doing great.

93
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,200
I eat well and sleep well.

94
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,180
Thank you for paying me a visit.

95
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm worried about you.

96
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,080
Ms. Fang said you could take a few days off

97
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,980
before going back to work.

98
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,580
No need to.

99
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,160
I’ll go to work tomorrow.

100
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,810
Won't you consider Ms. Fang's suggestion?

101
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,260
What suggestion?

102
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,190
Call the police.

103
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,400
If there is a criminal investigation,

104
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,630
we can postpone the case about the bank.

105
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,630
If Liu Ming is found guilty

106
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,900
of maliciously creating debts,

107
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,360
you'll have more advantages in the divorce.

108
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,990
I...

109
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,080
will think about it.

110
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,900
You want a beer?

111
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,430
I'd love one.

112
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,420
Soon we'll put an end to all this.

113
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:08,200
Yes. We will.

114
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,430
Is it a human or an animal?

115
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,960
An animal.

116
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,150
Big or small?

117
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,270
It can be both.

118
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,320
What kind of answer is that?

119
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,500
That's right.

120
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,540
It can be big and small.

121
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,270
It's true.

122
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,760
"Meow" or "ruff"?

123
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,070
You're cheating!

124
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,730
I have no choice.

125
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,400
It's "meow".

126
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,830
I have to answer it, don't I?

127
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,350
I've lost.

128
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,840
You've all lost. Chug it!

129
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:38,860
Thank you.

130
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,330
Xinjiang people.

131
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,720
Well, a friend of mine is over there.

132
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,500
I should go say hi.

133
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,780
Okay.

134
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,620
You get back to the game.

135
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,330
Must be Chinese. Sure thing.

136
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,560
What a coincidence, Mr. Chen!

137
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,440
Why are you

138
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,040
eating bread alone?

139
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,670
Where's your partner?

140
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,560
Where's Luo Yingzi?

141
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,820
Thanks to you,

142
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,350
she has to stay in a hotel now.

143
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,810
Don't you know about that?

144
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,820
What does it have to do with me?

145
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,190
She's not my client.

146
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,740
Why are you telling me this?

147
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,260
Doesn't it affect your mood at all?

148
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,140
No.

149
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,620
Does it affect yours?

150
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,660
I really can't understand

151
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,390
how you could be this happy.

152
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,540
What's hard to understand?

153
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,310
I'm confused.

154
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,170
Is this your way of working a case?

155
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,180
Your client suffers misfortune.

156
00:09:59,180 --> 00:09:59,720
But what can you do about it?

157
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,850
Die with the client?

158
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:04,260
Do you have to be so mean?

159
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,750
I'm just being honest.

160
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,180
How many years have you been a lawyer?

161
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,130
I'm still a pupil.

162
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,570
Now I understand.

163
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,490
As a lawyer who's senior to you,

164
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,130
I'll give you a piece of advice.

165
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,770
Lawyers

166
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,120
should draw a boundary

167
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,110
between their own lives and work.

168
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,610
Clients live their lives,

169
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:29,360
and you live yours.

170
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,200
You are paid by clients

171
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,480
to represent them in court. It's your duty.

172
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,490
The bottom line is,

173
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,530
you work as a lawyer only to earn a living.

174
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:37,730
You personal life should stay out of it.

175
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,390
Do you hear me?

176
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,590
Is it supposed to be a lesson?

177
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,250
You're a cold-blooded animal.

178
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,250
Whatever you say.

179
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,920
Forget the bread.

180
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,580
You poor thing.

181
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,480
My friends are here.

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,680
Why don't you join us?

183
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,980
I don't need your pity.

184
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,210
I don't enjoy being in a crowd.

185
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:57,990
What a dull person!

186
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,990
Then sit here by yourself and mourn.

187
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,920
Come on.

188
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,150
Fat or thin?

189
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,310
Both.

190
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,600
It depends on which dynasty.

191
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,840
Both fat and thin?

192
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,900
Excuse me.

193
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,270
Mr. Chen, it's your umbrella.

194
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,330
You should keep it.

195
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,870
Give me your phone number.

196
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,000
We have to stay in contact for the case.

197
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,040
Is it really for the case?

198
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,130
Just kidding.

199
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,660
Fine. Give me your phone.

200
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,050
Done.

201
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,970
Borrow an umbrella and then give it back.

202
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,300
That's a classic trick.

203
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,400
Shuo,

204
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,750
good for you.

205
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,700
Not good at all. She's got a sulky face.

206
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,160
It is not much to my liking.

207
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,720
Now you think you're too good for her!

208
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,320
Liu Ming,

209
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,530
I hope you'll reply if you see this e-mail.

210
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,970
The bank took our apartment yesterday.

211
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,150
I was kicked out of my own home.

212
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,880
I had to move out on a rainy night.

213
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,640
You put a mortgage on the apartment behind my back.

214
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,410
Do you know how much I hate you?

215
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,530
People advised me to call the police,

216
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,230
and charge you with fraud.

217
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:36,220
Do you know how long you could be in prison?

218
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,100
3 to 10 years,

219
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,010
or even longer.

220
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,500
Liu Ming,

221
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,010
why did you do this to me?

222
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,810
I want an explanation.

223
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,840
Will it be something I like?

224
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,330
Who knows?

225
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,600
Come on.

226
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,220
Look...

227
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,610
Is it possible that I wouldn't like this?

228
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,370
I've gotta go and make a call.

229
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,250
Not quite possible.

230
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:58,890
But...

231
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,970
Why do you have to go again?

232
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,520
I'll be right back.

233
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,900
There's no way I wouldn't like this...

234
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,300
Listen up...

235
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,130
Is something going on?

236
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,390
Something is going on.

237
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,370
Come on. Cheers!

238
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,210
Thanks to you,

239
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,750
Luo Yingzi has to stay in a hotel now.

240
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't you know about that?

241
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,610
You didn't leave her a chance.

242
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:31,190
She can't get back to her apartment anymore.

243
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,310
She's in a hotel...

244
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:40,610
[Luo Yingzi]

245
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:40,360
Should I call her?

246
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,830
[Unscrupulous Chen]

247
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,090
I shouldn't have called her.

248
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,890
Yingzi,

249
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,390
why are you still up?

250
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:05,860
Don't worry.

251
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,190
Just go back to your sleep.

252
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,620
Are you not going to sue him?

253
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,110
No. Not now.

254
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,260
Do you still have hopes on him?

255
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:55,970
At this point,

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,600
who am I to hope for anything?

257
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,940
If you don't accuse Liu Ming of fraud,

258
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:03,250
you'll barely win the lawsuits you're in.

259
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,360
I'm fine with anything.

260
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,350
All cases mean resources to me.

261
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,220
But Ms. Fang is different.

262
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,230
She values her career and reputation.

263
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,490
Do you know why she didn't charge you more?

264
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,970
Because she thought

265
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,150
you would lose anyway.

266
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,770
I've been pondering it over and over again.

267
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,370
But I still don't think I will

268
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,020
go as far as to report him to the police.

269
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,720
Despite what has happened,

270
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,070
I still think

271
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,320
Ming is the person I used to know.

272
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,810
He's not a bad person,

273
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,030
though he appears a little weak.

274
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,780
He lets others make decisions for him.

275
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,890
At first, he listened to his mother.

276
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:50,610
Then he married me.

277
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,750
I thought he'd let me decide for him forever.

278
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:57,100
Unexpectedly, he turned to someone else.

279
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,970
I just don't understand.

280
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,890
It's true that he cheated on me with Wen Li.

281
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:04,250
But does that mean he has to be cruel to me

282
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,880
and make me suffer?

283
00:16:07,130 --> 00:16:09,120
Before I could find an answer,

284
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,860
I won't choose the ultimate resort.

285
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:16,850
Fine.

286
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,310
Then prepare yourself for the worst.

287
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,740
Isn't it where Qin Ailian used to work?

288
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,810
Why do you think of her?

289
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,890
About a month before Qin Ailian's death.

290
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,760
Do you know why?

291
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,170
I don't.

292
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:15,520
I was on vacation when he left.

293
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,970
But I heard

294
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,690
he was fired by the boss

295
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,970
for a mistake at work.

296
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,650
Sir, what can I get you?

297
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,540
Some lamp soup.

298
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,160
What are you doing here?

299
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,200
I'm here to eat.

300
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,450
Go on with the interview.

301
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,790
Among all the restaurants in Jingbei,

302
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,170
why did you come here in particular?

303
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,700
The food here is delicious.

304
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,100
Are you still working on Qin Ailian's case?

305
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,800
You see right through me.

306
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,720
Captain Wang, don't be so uptight.

307
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,580
Have the police found something?

308
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:48,440
Tell me about it.

309
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,820
Stay out of this.

310
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,690
When we turn an arrested suspect over to the prosecutor's office,

311
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:55,130
you'll get your chance to earn contingency.

312
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,570
You've gotta go now.

313
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,610
Fine. You do your thing.

314
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,530
I get it. I'll go.

315
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,760
Go. Go in there.

316
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:08,780
Hey, Mr. Xue.

317
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,250
Can you come out now?

318
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,930
You know the restaurant that Qin Ailin used to work in, don't you?

319
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,040
I was just passing by when I saw

320
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,450
Wang Rui interviewing an waitress.

321
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,400
You should come and get some information.

322
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,610
Let's see if the waitress has revealed

323
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,920
something we don't know.

324
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,650
Is that okay?

325
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,450
Over these days,

326
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,330
we have collected some evidence.

327
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,810
Of course, the credit goes to Qiu Hua.

328
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:37,070
We have Grand Property's registration papers

329
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:41,410
and the bank statements of your and Liu Ming's accounts,

330
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,470
plus the proof of your previous income.

331
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,980
We plan to show in court

332
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:45,800
that the company

333
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
never made a transfer to your account.

334
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:50,880
Your income was used for family expenditure.

335
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,130
But I don't think

336
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,150
what we have here is persuasive enough

337
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,750
to separate you from the corporate debts.

338
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,440
Half a year before Liu Ming ran away,

339
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,360
he started to borrow private loans.

340
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,570
So the court is very likely to rule

341
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,330
that the debts were borrowed to pay for

342
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,680
operation costs and family expenditure.

343
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,300
Therefore, Yingzi,

344
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,570
you need to prepare yourself

345
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,320
to repay those private loans.

346
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,230
I understand, Ms. Fang.

347
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,730
In fact, since the very beginning,

348
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,460
I've always known that I'll lose the case.

349
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,610
I just want a closure

350
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,370
with these people in court.

351
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,440
As long as I could make it to court,

352
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,690
I'll consider myself a winner.

353
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,500
I'm just sorry that I got you involved.

354
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,810
In recent years,

355
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,540
you have rarely lost any cases.

356
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,760
My case may be a disgrace on your record.

357
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,090
That's not important.

358
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,390
I've promised to represent you,

359
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,900
and prepared myself for failure.

360
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,310
It is actually a good thing

361
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,320
that the apartment is taken by the bank.

362
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,180
Think about it.

363
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:58,090
If those private loan companies

364
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,030
know you still own a real estate asset,

365
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,430
it'll be a huge disaster.

366
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,790
They won't easily cut you loose.

367
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:03,520
That's true.

368
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,790
About Liu Ming's bank statements,

369
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:08,270
I found something unsual.

370
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,160
He seldom spent money.

371
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
The money he borrowed

372
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:15,380
was used to run the company and was all lost

373
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,210
due to bad management.

374
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,890
If it weren't for this last 10 million,

375
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,650
even I would rather believe

376
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,650
that he's just a lousy businessman,

377
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,900
and that he didn't mean to hurt you.

378
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,850
That's what I've been thinking as well.

379
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,920
It's why I hesitate and haven't charged him with fraud.

380
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,030
Just clear your mind.

381
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,130
Go back and have a good sleep.

382
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,790
Get ready for tomorrow's trial.

383
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,030
I'm exhausted.

384
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,590
Come on. It's not even that much work.

385
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,530
Have you found anything?

386
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:00,690
You've got a lead.

387
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,510
Why don't you investigate it by yourself?

388
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,730
You just enjoy picking on me.

389
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,130
Don't say that.

390
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,320
I didn't want to run into Wang Rui again.

391
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,450
That would be utterly inappropriate.

392
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,980
I've been to the Elegant Club

393
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,770
and the restaurant where Qin Ailian worked.

394
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,970
I did find something.

395
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,300
Give me a second.

396
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,310
Send me.

397
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,630
You should have it now.

398
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,420
This man is Wu Hang.

399
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,610
He used to be a journalism student at Jingbei University.

400
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,140
He graduated top of the class the year before.

401
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,770
Was he Qin Ailian's boyfriend?

402
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,500
I don't know.

403
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,370
The first time he went to the Elegant Club,

404
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,140
he was still a university student.

405
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,860
I guess he was a patron there.

406
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,490
I'm not sure

407
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:37,060
if they knew each other at that time.

408
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,210
Guess what?

409
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,040
After graduation,

410
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,800
Wu Hang didn't seek a proper job.

411
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,880
He began working in the Elegant Club.

412
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,680
What kind of job could a young man like him

413
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,430
do in the Elegant Club?

414
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:49,810
The answer is pretty obvious, isn't it?

415
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,690
That means they did know each other.

416
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,280
Right?

417
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,830
There's more.

418
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,990
3 months before Qin Ailian died,

419
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,850
Wu Hang took a part-time job

420
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,210
at the restaurant she worked in.

421
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,460
But in less than 2 months, he was fired.

422
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,900
For what reason?

423
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,210
The employer said

424
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,320
a drunk customer

425
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,010
harassed Qin Ailian.

426
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,360
Wu Hang beat him up.

427
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,350
Being afraid of bearing liabilities,

428
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,950
the employer sacked Wu Hang.

429
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,900
I've just looked at his photo.

430
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,890
He doesn't appear to be a violent person.

431
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,820
You can't judge a book by its cover.

432
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,530
What's wrong with today's young people?

433
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,130
Wu Hang went to a good university.

434
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,930
He could have taken a better job.

435
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
He even has a postgraduate diploma.

436
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Keep an eye on your son.

437
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:39,930
He's always been an overachiever at school,

438
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,970
but he possibly has done many awful things

439
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:42,610
behind your back.

440
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:46,120
My naughty child

441
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,360
has developed a worse and worse temper

442
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,970
since he went to the middle school.

443
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,580
He talks back to his mom.

444
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
They argue and argue.

445
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,250
It's okay. Don't worry.

446
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:58,050
As long as he doesn't cross the boundary,

447
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,780
you should forgive him for being a bit rebellious.

448
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:01,440
You shouldn't be

449
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,040
as strict with him as before.

450
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,240
Or he'll be under enormous pressure,

451
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,580
have a huge meltdown one day,

452
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,610
and go for self destruction.

453
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,810
If so, you and your wife will be sorry...

454
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,970
Self destruction...

455
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:16,800
Mr. Xue,

456
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,410
look into Wu Hang's relationship

457
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,680
with his parents.

458
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:25,990
I'm talking to you!

459
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,000
Well, though you always talk about money,

460
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,850
I can still detect

461
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,610
that you're somewhat a righteous person.

462
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,040
We are different.

463
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,680
I have a son to raise.

464
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:39,900
We've agreed to split the contingency in half.

465
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,270
I'm gonna get every penny I deserve.

466
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:41,820
Hey.

467
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:44,210
I only took 20% for the first trial.

468
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:46,090
And I did all the work.

469
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,640
That's different.

470
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,690
Back then we were only doing a lawyer's job.

471
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:53,090
But now I'm doing a private investigator's job too.

472
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,130
It's very dangerous.

473
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,980
How about this?

474
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,200
I'll do all the leg work,

475
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,120
while you ask the clients

476
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,370
to pay us more.

477
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,220
Is it okay?

478
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,610
I’ll start working now.

479
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,600
We'll split the money in half. Not a penny less.

480
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,050
I'll get down to work now.

481
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,290
Not a penny less.

482
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,330
Self destruction.

483
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,210
Come in.

484
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,090
This is our new home.

485
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,120
That's your room.

486
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,470
Go and check it out.

487
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,780
Not bad, right?

488
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,030
It's lovely.

489
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,850
It's way worse than before.

490
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,650
Just accept the changes.

491
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,570
We should be glad that we have a home.

492
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:50,900
It's good enough for us.

493
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,560
The kitchen is big, isn't it?

494
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,400
Why is there a musty smell?

495
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,690
I haven't cleaned it yet.

496
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,490
It'll be fine when it's cleaned.

497
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:00,890
Yingzi,

498
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,720
why would there be evil people?

499
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,490
Humans have lived for so many years.

500
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,330
Yet no one

501
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,890
has learned all the truth about human nature.

502
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,880
Lanlan, don't think about that.

503
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,410
Let's clean this place

504
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,110
and live a good life.

505
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,330
However, to be honest,

506
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,130
there probably will be a difficult time

507
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,650
ahead of us.

508
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,400
If you don't like this place...

509
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,050
We'll stick together in all the good and bad times.

510
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,970
Yingzi, I want to study law with you

511
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,100
and become a lawyer.

512
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,200
Let's go for it!

513
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,210
Clean up the place now.

514
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:38,880
Yingzi, this mess is giving me a headache!

515
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,920
Put your stuff into your room.

516
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,530
Doing everything all over again. My god!

517
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:43,810
I'll place mine in my room.

518
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,540
Let's clean the kitchen later.

[Jingbei Court]

529
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Court adjourned.

530
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:55,980
Defendant,

531
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,410
if possible,

532
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,330
try to pay off some debts first.

533
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,930
If the repayment is overdue,

534
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,360
the plaintiff is entitled to confiscate your property.

535
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,000
Thank you.

536
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,390
Defense counsel...

537
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,680
Ms. Luo.

538
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,220
I'm sorry, Ms. Fang.

539
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,570
Don't say that.

540
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,400
Can you pay the debts or not?

541
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,310
If you can't, the lawyer's fees...

542
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,460
I'll handle my own business.

543
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,060
Ms. Fang,

544
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,450
you and Qiu Hua

545
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,390
have finished your work here.

546
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,620
I'll take care of the rest.

547
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:38,550
These gang-backed companies can be brutal.

548
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,290
If you don't pay them back,

549
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,760
they'll surely make a scene in the law firm.

550
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,340
By then, I can't protect you even if I want to.

551
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:49,520
I'll settle with them.

552
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,970
Money is the solution to many problems.

553
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,370
Money is the solution to many problems.

554
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:34,900
Ms. Fang,

555
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,080
Liang, the newly qualified attorney

556
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,760
in the civil case department, is a disgrace.

557
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,330
He went to a pedicure salon and had a fight

558
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,260
with the business owner about money.

559
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,320
They got physical,

560
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:46,400
and ended up in the police station.

561
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,720
Just bail him out.

562
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,520
Then sack him.

563
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,800
Sack him?

564
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,020
His life's quite hard.

565
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,880
His family has met multiple difficulties.

566
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,400
He's the only person his family counts on.

567
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,210
Fire him.

568
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,330
Our law firm is not a sanctuary.

569
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,600
How old are you?

570
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,120
42.

571
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,320
What's wrong?

572
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,830
What were you doing at 28 or 29?

573
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,390
I was a secretary at a public institute at 28.

574
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,590
I ran errands for the boss at work,

575
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,880
and went to the gym after work.

576
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,930
Then I went home and felt lost.

577
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,570
I was searching for the meaning of life.

578
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,200
Why do you ask?

579
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,170
I think what you said was right.

580
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,350
Sometimes we should slow down a young person's career progress.

581
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,150
Yingzi?

582
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,930
Mr. Zhou, sorry to trouble you again.

583
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:09,370
I was in the court the whole time.

584
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,460
I'm sorry for what you've been through.

585
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,210
You shouldn't have been dragged into this.

586
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,120
It's unfair.

587
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:17,320
Mr. Zhou, I'm here to ask for your help.

588
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,360
Can you invite the four creditors

589
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,120
to a meeting with me?

590
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,330
I want to talk to them

591
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,290
about how to repay the debts.

592
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,160
Could you be a mediator?

593
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,170
I'll gather them.

594
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,040
That's easy.

595
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
When do you want to see them?

596
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,160
Please just gather them.

597
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,570
When it's done, tell me about it.

598
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:34,810
I'm available anytime.

599
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,500
Piece of cake.

600
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,930
-Thank you.
-I'll take you out to eat.

601
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:37,570
No, no, no.

602
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:38,680
-It's time to eat.
-Mr. Zhou.

603
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,890
Let's go.
-I'm sorry to bother you.

604
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:41,570
I shouldn't take up any more of your time.

605
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,520
I should probably get going.

606
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,450
You've done this several times...

607
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:48,760
Yingzi,

608
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,150
I have an idea.

609
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:53,130
Be my girl,

610
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,970
and I'll pay all your debts.

611
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,530
It's gonna make your life much easier.

612
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,570
No, Mr. Zhou, I...

613
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

614
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,650
I... I should really go.

615
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,920
What's wrong with you?

616
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,280
Is this what you want as a reward?

617
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,360
I've let you call me "Yingzi".

618
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,420
Isn't that enough?

619
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,890
Should I tell my dad about this?

620
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,580
Then he'll tell your uncle.

621
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,890
Are you out of your mind?

622
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,170
Well...

623
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,600
I was just kidding.

624
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
It was a joke.

625
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,330
I didn't mean it.

626
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,530
How was I supposed to know that's a joke?

627
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,170
You scared me!

628
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,120
Don't forget what I asked you for!

629
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,960
Yingzi, wait!

630
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:44,530
Yingzi,

631
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,330
why does Mr. Zhou

632
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,530
give us so much help?

633
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,780
Mr. Zhou

634
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,610
loves to help.

635
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,110
I don't believe it.

636
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,020
He must be up to something.

637
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,240
He helped us when we sold the apartment.

638
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,170
If he can't get any benefits this time,

639
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,630
why would he help us again?

640
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,890
What do you think the reason is?

641
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,570
Lanlan,

642
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,460
the relationship between people

643
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,520
is not just about interests.

644
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:13,520
Take you for an example.

645
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,280
You're at my place,

646
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,100
and you make less money than before.

647
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,140
Why do you still choose to stay?

648
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,870
That's a good point.

649
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,310
Yingzi,

650
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,970
I think,

651
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,120
no matter what,

652
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,840
we've gotta thank Mr. Zhou.

653
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,160
It's too huge a favor.

654
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,110
How is it possible

655
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,010
for me to ever pay it back?

656
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,380
[Zhou Houze]

657
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,320
Yingzi,

658
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,560
it's Mr. Zhou.

659
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,010
Hello.

660
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,690
Mr. Zhou.

661
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:55,590
What?

662
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,330
Okay.

663
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,960
When?

664
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,810
10 a.m. tomorrow.

665
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:04,990
Okay.

666
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,000
I'll be there on time.

667
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,130
Okay.

668
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,240
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

669
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:12,210
Bye.

670
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,370
What is it?

671
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,360
I asked him to gather the creditors for me.

672
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:18,600
He did it.

673
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,950
The meeting's set to take place tomorrow.

674
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,640
Yingzi,

675
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,160
he cares about you so much.

676
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,640
I begged him for a favor.

677
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,040
Is he into you?

678
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,570
Lanlan, stop talking nonsense.

679
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,310
I don't think he's into me.

680
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,920
He's not my cup of tea.

681
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,930
I treat him as a friend.

682
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,770
Yingzi, look at him,

683
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,680
capable and rich.

684
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:48,570
Dating him

685
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,890
wouldn't be a bad thing.

686
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,930
Lanlan, stop it or I'll be mad at you.

687
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,610
What kind of person do you think I am?

688
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:08,580
Lanlan, I'm going out.

689
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,210
I may not be able to come back for lunch.

690
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,000
Don't wait for me.

691
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:11,530
Yingzi,

692
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:12,860
I'll go with you.

693
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,650
Why?

694
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,929
It's a big deal.

695
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,770
I must go with you or I'll be very worried.

696
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,560
It's my own business.

697
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I can do it myself.

698
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:20,370
Yingzi,

699
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,080
I treat you as my own sister,

700
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,320
but you see me as a stranger.

701
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,230
That's what I fear you'd say.

702
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,030
Alright, let's go.

703
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,219
Let's go.

704
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,520
These gentlemen

705
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
have been friends with me for years.

706
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:34,790
Guys, she's a dear friend of mine.

707
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,090
We should treat the people here

708
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:38,170
as family.

709
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,360
If you have something to say,

710
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,199
say it nicely.

711
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,440
We'll have a friendly talk.

712
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:42,969
Okay.

713
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,199
Yingzi,

714
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,330
you go first.

715
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:47,010
Okay.

716
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:47,639
Thank you.

717
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,010
Gentlemen,

718
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,750
let me make this clear:

719
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,960
I won't deny

720
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,770
the debts.

721
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,770
You must have seen

722
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,700
the evidence I exhibited in court.

723
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,400
All my money at home

724
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:07,770
has been transferred

725
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,360
by my husband.

726
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,650
I was set up by him.

727
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,850
The debts you're trying to collect

728
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,080
actually have nothing to do with me.

729
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,090
Ms. Luo,

730
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,080
what your husband did to you doesn't concern us.

731
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,320
Sir, calm down.

732
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:23,170
Let me finish.

733
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,360
I have a car under my name.

734
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,840
The car under my husband's name

735
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,160
is also in the country.

736
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,680
However,

737
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,360
my house has been taken away by the bank.

738
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:37,690
I'll sell these two cars as soon as possible

739
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,360
and get some money from my parents.

740
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,410
I'm doing everything I can.

741
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,620
To be honest,

742
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,890
no matter how hard I try,

743
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,220
it's still not enough to pay all the debts.

744
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,530
I have an idea.

745
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,250
I'll pay 70% of the total amount

746
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,610
all at once.

747
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,680
Then we'll call it even.

748
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,140
The whole thing will come to an end.

749
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,130
Here's a further explanation.

750
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,760
Plus the interest my husband paid before,

751
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,450
and the 70% of the debts I'm gonna repay,

752
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,730
you'll yield a big enough profit.

753
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:11,170
If you agree with what I suggest,

754
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:12,820
I'll do as I said right away.

755
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,760
If you don't agree,

756
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,730
I'll have to

757
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,210
to fight you in court.

758
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:21,440
I'm afraid that the longer the process is,

759
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,900
the less money I will have.

760
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,200
In the end,

761
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,740
you won't be able to take anything from me,

762
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,060
except for my life.

763
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Gentlemen, there's one more thing.

764
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,920
The money her husband borrowed

765
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,390
wasn't used for their marriage life.

766
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,300
We have evidence to prove that.

767
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Yingzi is willing to pay what Liu Ming owes.

768
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,340
But other than the principal of the loans,

769
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,570
she could only afford a small extra amount.

770
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:48,450
We're here today

771
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,000
to discuss with you

772
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,720
through peaceful dialogue.

773
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,370
If you

774
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,570
don't agree,

775
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,770
we'll wait for the court to rule on this.

776
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,460
I disagree.

777
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:03,820
Ms. Qiu, I don't like what you said.

778
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,080
Yingzi,

779
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,350
don't take that tone with us.

780
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,350
Forget about the lawsuits,

781
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,260
and those negative remarks.

782
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,930
What kind of attitude is that?

783
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:16,080
In all fairness,

784
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:17,890
My buddies

785
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,240
make a living by

786
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,720
lending you money and taking it back

787
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,120
with interest attached.

788
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:24,490
Without it, their business will strand.

789
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,050
Yingzi,

790
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,720
apart from meeting your basic living needs,

791
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,560
you should use the rest of your money

792
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,620
to repay the debts.

793
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,490
Guys,

794
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:35,610
listen,

795
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,010
on behalf of Yingzi,

796
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,740
I've gotta tell you something.

797
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,790
She

798
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:43,120
married to a wrong guy.

799
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,280
Her apartment

800
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,760
was confiscated by the court.

801
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,160
The two ruddy cars she has

802
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:50,230
will be sold soon to pay the debts.

803
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,580
Indeed, she's a lawyer,

804
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,010
but now she just works as

805
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:54,160
an underpaid pupil.

806
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:57,080
Guys,

807
00:37:58,410 --> 00:37:59,270
how about this?

808
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:02,030
Do me a favor and cut her loose.

809
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,090
Guys.

810
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:05,450
Shall we

811
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:06,890
settle?

812
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:09,150
The worst part is that Mr. Zhou backs her up.

813
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,120
We can't do anything.

814
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,720
Yingzi, they're discussing. It's a good sign.

815
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,320
Mr. Zhou,

816
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,390
thank you for helping Yingzi.

817
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,890
I'd like to propose a toast to you.

818
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,550
Does she work in your law firm?

819
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,930
Lanlan is currently working at my home.

820
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,700
She's a nanny then.

821
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,440
Mr. Zhou.

822
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,890
It's okay, Yingzi.

823
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:29,680
Mr. Zhou,

824
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,090
I'm not a nanny.

825
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,340
I'm not staying with Yingzi for money.

826
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm studying law with her.

827
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,220
I want to be a lawyer in the future.

828
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,160
Good.

829
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,010
-Cheers!
-Ambitious girl!

830
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,440
Okay.

831
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,450
Guys,

832
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,170
how did the discussion go?

833
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,010
We've got a decision.

834
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,370
Ms. Luo,

835
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:04,520
you'll pay 80% of the total amount

836
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,760
in proper proportion.

837
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,560
Gentlemen, I really can't afford that much.

838
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,050
Yingzi,

839
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,370
take it as a win.

840
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,120
How about this?

841
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,420
You give them as much money as you can.

842
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,750
I'll deal with the rest.

843
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,330
Mr. Zhou,

844
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,560
we can't let you do this.

845
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,040
How can we take your money?

846
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,530
What do you mean?

847
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:32,210
This is it.

848
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,090
It's a deal now.

849
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,690
By only asking for 80% of the debts,

850
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,930
you've shown me enough respect.

851
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:37,260
Let's put an end to this.

852
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,580
As we said before,

853
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,960
I'll pay you 80% of the debts,

854
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,640
and we'll be even. Right?

855
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,460
We agree.

856
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,960
When she pays us 80% of the total amount,

857
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,460
we'll consider the whole thing over.

858
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,300
Okay.

859
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:52,020
We've prepared 4 contracts.

860
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,720
Let's calculate

861
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,870
the proportion.

862
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:55,970
Alright.

863
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,680
We'll do it later.

864
00:39:58,010 --> 00:39:59,090
What's the rush for?

865
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,660
Come, sit down.

866
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,640
What a successful result!

867
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,080
Let's drink!

868
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,800
Let me walk you out.

869
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:09,460
Come on, Yingzi.

870
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,710
Did you ask the bank to take the apartment?

871
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,670
No.

872
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,870
I'm serious.

873
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,740
A few days ago, I was homeless.

874
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,930
I understand.

875
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,650
The bank has taken the apartment.

876
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:24,110
You can get it back through a trial.

877
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,210
If it falls into my friends' hands,

878
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,280
it'll be as good as gone.

879
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,810
Mr. Zhou,

880
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,160
please stop here.

881
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,090
I owe you so many thanks.

882
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,290
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

883
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,160
No worries.

884
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,190
I'll go back and drink with them.

885
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,530
Okay.

886
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:34,910
Thank you.

887
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:42,640
Yingzi,

888
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,680
you're going back to the law firm but I'm not.

889
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,970
I saw a supermarket nearby.

890
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,300
I wanna go and buy some meat and vegetable.

891
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,370
Don't we have any of that at home?

892
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,090
No.

893
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,330
You can go.

894
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,040
Don't buy too much.

895
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:55,930
Every time you bought too much, some of it rotted.

896
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:56,890
I'll bear that in mind.

897
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:57,850
Drive safe.

898
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,370
Okay.

899
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,170
I'm leaving.

900
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,300
Do you have problems getting the money?

901
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,840
I can deal with it.

902
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:11,980
Qiu Hua,

903
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:15,650
did you tell the bank

904
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,360
that Liu Ming ran away?

905
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,140
Sorry.

906
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,830
I didn't tell you beforehead.

907
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:22,760
Technically speaking,

908
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,010
it's against a lawyer's professional ethic.

909
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,140
But another I knew was more important.

910
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,640
With that apartment in your hand,

911
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,690
those private loan borrowers

912
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,610
wouldn't easily let you off the hook.

913
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,210
You might end up losing the apartment

914
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:35,610
and paying for that bank loan of 10 million.

915
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,240
If they had targeted at your apartment,

916
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,330
we wouldn't have been able

917
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,930
to sit and talk to them today.

918
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,320
Thank you, Qiu Hua.

919
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,440
I've always known you're a smart person.

920
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,450
But I didn’t expect you to be so amazing.

921
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,880
Even Fang Lihong didn’t think of this point.

922
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,160
I'm not that good.

923
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,810
You might still lose your apartment.

924
00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:00,010
But you did help me clear the debts.

925
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,270
If I still had that apartment,

926
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,790
as you said,

927
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,770
those people wouldn't have cut me some slack.

928
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,360
As for the 10 million I owe the bank,

929
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,520
I wouldn't have been able to pay it back.

930
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,890
All I can say is

931
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,530
thank you.

932
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:19,860
There's one more thing.

933
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,790
I know this may sound rough.

934
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:25,650
But I don't think that nanny of yours

935
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,210
is trustworthy.

936
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,480
You live alone now.

937
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,630
Is it really necessary to have a nanny?

938
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,640
Lanlan

939
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,330
helped me a lot

940
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,170
when I was in bad shape.

941
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:40,270
I treat her as my sister.

942
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,930
And she is very diligent.

943
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,260
She's protective of me.

944
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:46,930
I can't tell her to go away.

945
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,050
I'll feel condemned if I do so.

946
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,780
Anyway, you'd better be wary of her.

947
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,410
Why should I?

948
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,020
Is she gonna sell me out or what?

949
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,360
It's just a little reminder.

950
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,730
I know. I know.
