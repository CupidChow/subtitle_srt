[Episode 34]

4
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,830
Xia Shu, you stay here.

5
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:38,750
I need to talk with Ms. Qiu in private.

6
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:48,030
Hua,

7
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,550
even though we hate it,

8
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,070
we'd better act like we don't.

9
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,630
Wipe that look off your face.

10
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,630
You brought her on board

11
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,590
without even discussing it with me.

12
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,120
I called you out now.

13
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:00,510
Besides, Fang Lihong called me.

14
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,770
How could I say no?

15
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,920
You teach me how to say no.

16
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,950
Even if you have prejudice against Xia Shu,

17
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,590
you have to admit

18
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,110
that she may come across as a little silly,

19
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,229
but she's not a bad person.

20
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:10,350
I have no prejudice against her.

21
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,990
I just instinctively dislike her.

22
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:13,910
Besides,

23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,130
it's understandable that we had to fawn over her every day

24
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,370
if we worked under her father.

25
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:19,430
The point is that we are in a firm

26
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,430
that requires us to fight with our abilities.

27
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,600
Do we need someone

28
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,450
who has nothing to offer but a good father?

29
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,350
She has nothing to offer?

30
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,790
If she was good at nothing, how did she earn her degree in the US

31
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:30,990
and pass the Chinese bar exam?

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,260
Besides,

33
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,270
it's not a bad thing for us

34
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,670
that she has a father in a higher position.

35
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,860
Maybe he can bring us some cases in the future.

36
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:37,940
Right?

37
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,160
Qiu Hua, what I mean is

38
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,550
that I'd rather

39
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,110
have a simple-minded person

40
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,350
than a bad guy.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,990
Let's take her.

42
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,760
Pay more attention to her

43
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,390
so that she won't get us into trouble.

44
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,630
I also have to be a kindergarten teacher now?

45
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,350
Alright? Let's go.

46
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,280
I'll get some water.

47
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,110
No. Give her this one.

48
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,180
Say...

49
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,780
something to her first.

50
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:04,670
Xia Shu.

51
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,800
Last time,

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,110
you caused us such big trouble,

53
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,110
but Qiu decided to let bygones be bygones

54
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,880
and agreed to let you join us.

55
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,320
Thank you, Sister Qiu Hua.

56
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,490
Don't. You're a partner.

57
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,550
It is an honor for us

58
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,590
to have you join us.

59
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,610
You think highly of us.

60
00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:18,670
We should thank each other.

61
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,350
Thank each other.

62
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:22,110
It's almost time. Ma Lili should be here soon.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,980
I'll get a glass of water first.

64
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,820
Let me do it.

65
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,960
Bring me a cup of Americano.

66
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,570
Okay.

67
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,230
She has advantages.

68
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,270
At least, she runs fast.

69
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,650
Mrs. Ma.

70
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,340
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

71
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,180
This is another lawyer in our firm, Xia Shu.

72
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,700
Hello.

73
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,550
Hello.

74
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,670
Mrs. Ma.

75
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,780
Xu Jianshe's case has been remanded for retrial.

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,850
What does "remanded for retrial" mean?

77
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,270
It means that if the higher judicial organ determines

78
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,550
that the facts of a case are unclear or that there is insufficient evidence,

79
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:58,960
they'll remand the case to the original judicial organ for a new trial.

80
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,390
That is its meaning.

81
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,570
If

82
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,930
they don't have any new evidence to add,

83
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,870
there's a high chance that the original sentence will be changed in the retrial.

84
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,270
Mrs. Ma,

85
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,070
this case has gone on for so long.

86
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,830
I don't think

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,350
there will be any new evidence.

88
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,670
No, no.

89
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,990
You have no idea how many times they've investigated before.

90
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,300
How could it not?

91
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,070
Isn't there evidence of a debt dispute

92
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,970
between Xu Jianshe and the victim?

93
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,210
But I think that the case was remanded for retrial

94
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,390
mainly because they believe

95
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,510
that Xu Jianshe is not the main culprit in this case.

96
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,370
As for the IOU,

97
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,630
it shouldn't have much impact on the basic facts.

98
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,500
Right.

99
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:38,550
The verdict of the second trial is based on the process of the crime,

100
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,909
not the motive.

101
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,690
It's okay. Anyway,

102
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,840
we finally took a small step forward.

103
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,790
Mrs. Ma,

104
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,470
I heard that you and Xu Jianshe are divorced.

105
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,670
Right.

106
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,710
Gosh.

107
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,210
I believe in love again.

108
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,350
Miss Xia.

109
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,490
Xia Shu, why don't you sit there

110
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,390
and take some notes?

111
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:07,350
Mrs. Ma.

112
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,720
We didn't let you down

113
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,670
during the second trial.

114
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,150
The second trial is now complete.

115
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,590
You need to remit the remaining 150,000 yuan

116
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,350
to our law firm as soon as possible.

117
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:17,990
Okay.

118
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:18,910
Don't worry.

119
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,150
I'll raise it.

120
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,580
Then, we might need to prepare for the retrial.

121
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:27,150
Are you still going to let us represent you in this retrial?

122
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,590
Of course.

123
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,030
Of course, I have to count on you two.

124
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,230
This retrial could be Xu Jianshe's only chance

125
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,310
to regain his freedom

126
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,230
or have his sentence reduced.

127
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,710
The difficulty of defending him is obvious.

128
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,640
So, if you and Mr. Xu

129
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,230
want to continue hiring us,

130
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,790
we need an additional 500,000 yuan for legal fees.

131
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,140
You can pay 200,000 yuan first.

132
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,670
You can pay the remaining amount in a lump sum

133
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,830
after the results are announced.

134
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,909
Okay. Got it.

135
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,770
By the way,

136
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,130
are you still going to visit Jianshe?

137
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:01,760
If you choose not to retain us

138
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:04,840
as your legal representation for the retrial,

139
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,540
perhaps

140
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,330
we will have one final opportunity to visit him

141
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,550
to inform him of the outcome of the second trial.

142
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,540
But if you continue hiring us,

143
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:17,910
we'll have many chances to see him

144
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,790
before the retrial.

145
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,290
I may need your help

146
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,770
with something.

147
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,110
Can you ask him

148
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,830
to sign the power of attorney

149
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,560
that I gave you last time?

150
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,270
So that I can help him sell the houses

151
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,230
and pay the legal fees.

152
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,150
No.

153
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,670
This is against the law.

154
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,350
We can only do it under one circumstance.

155
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,350
What circumstance?

156
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,230
Only when Xu Jianshe agrees to compensate the victim's family,

157
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:50,790
with the judge's permission,

158
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,909
can we get him to sign the power of attorney

159
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:55,230
authorizing you to handle his property.

160
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,450
But Ms. Qiu,

161
00:06:56,909 --> 00:06:58,670
we don't even know

162
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,680
if Xu Jianshe is the one who killed him.

163
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,830
Why should we compensate him?

164
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:01,910
Besides,

165
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,770
you've never seen that family.

166
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,150
They have a big appetite.

167
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,870
If they knew

168
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,590
that Jianshe owned several houses,

169
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,790
they wouldn't stop until they got all of them.

170
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,640
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,310
We can't do this.

172
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,340
We're going to ask him to sign the agency agreement anyway.

173
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,920
I don't think there is a problem with asking him to sign...

174
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:22,030
Mrs. Ma,

175
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,550
we've talked about this power of attorney

176
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,790
many times.

177
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:30,320
Now, we really don't have much time.

178
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:31,910
For the retrial,

179
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,990
we shouldn't

180
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,909
waste our time on this matter.

181
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,210
If you really want him to sign it,

182
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,570
it can only be under the condition that Ms. Qiu just mentioned.

183
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,840
There is no other way.

184
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,830
I'll think about it when I go back.

185
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,590
If there's nothing else,

186
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,909
I'll go now.

187
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,110
Thank you.

188
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,580
Thank you.

189
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:51,909
I have to go.

190
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,230
We're still very happy about the outcome.

191
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:56,470
No need to see me off.

192
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,230
It's okay. Let's go.

193
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,470
This woman is so amazing.

194
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,030
What's so great about her?

195
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,830
She's willing to risk everything to save her ex-husband.

196
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,150
I wouldn't be able to do that if I were her.

197
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,750
If something like this happened to my boyfriend,

198
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
I'd have run the hell away a long time ago.

199
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,800
You'd better hope you never encounter this kind of situation in your life.

201
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,020
What do you think

202
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,320
the judge

203
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,720
wants to see us now?

204
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,550
I don't think there's anything important.

205
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,520
The judge definitely hopes

206
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,350
we can persuade Xu Jianshe.

207
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,909
I think it's nearly impossible for us to win

208
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,289
if we plead not guilty in this case.

209
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,470
We can only hope that Xu Jianshe's sentence will be reduced.

210
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,830
But for some reason,

211
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,350
I just believe that he's innocent.

212
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,860
I think you believe in Ma Lili, right?

213
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,830
Yes.

214
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,870
How many people in this world

215
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,250
can be like Ma Lili?

216
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,310
Look at Xia Shu.

217
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,340
Suddenly, she seems to see through humanity.

218
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,710
Well.

219
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:59,520
Are you Xu Jianshe's attorneys?

220
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,950
Yes, we are.

My surname is Wei.

I'm the person in charge of this case.

223
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,220
I've studied all the materials about this case.

224
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,590
There is no problem

225
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,960
convicting Xu Jianshe.

226
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,170
The final sentence of another co-defendant

227
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,430
won't be as severe either.

228
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,670
It has something to do

229
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,420
with his proactive compensation

230
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,640
and getting an understanding of the victim's family.

231
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,590
Well.

232
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,750
Is it necessary to convince Xu Jianshe to negotiate compensation
with the victim's family?

233
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,110
As far as I know,

234
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,240
Xu Jianshe

235
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,420
is capable of providing compensation.

236
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,590
Once he gets forgiveness from the victim's family,

237
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,080
it can also alleviate the conflict between the two parties.

238
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,230
What do you think?

239
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,020
Judge Wei, let's discuss it.

240
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,590
We'll give you our final decision later.

241
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,350
Is that okay?

242
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,830
Okay.

243
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:44,230
Here is my office.

244
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,010
Okay, thank you.

245
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,310
What do you think we should do next?

246
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,000
Xia Shu, you're not involved in those two trials,

247
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:54,980
so you have no right to speak.

248
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,830
I think the judge's suggestion is good.

249
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,740
She mentioned the sentencing of the co-defendant.

250
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,660
Does it mean that if Xu Jianshe actively compensates the victim,

251
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,930
he will also receive a lenient sentence, right?

252
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,040
I agree with you.

253
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,530
That's how we reply to Judge Wei.

254
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,440
Then we go visit Xu Jianshe.

255
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:14,940
But

256
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,890
only if he pleads guilty

257
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,190
and actively compensates the victim's family.

258
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,630
What if he disagrees?

259
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:25,080
We can explain the pros and cons to him.

260
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,990
I always think Xu Jianshe is so determined

261
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,590
because someone has been giving him the wrong information.

262
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,240
But after we took over,

263
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,350
he wouldn't have any contact

264
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:37,310
with the outside world.

265
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,470
It won't be as hard as it used to be to persuade him.

266
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,490
We can give it a try.

267
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,510
Okay.

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,400
By the way, Xia Shu,

271
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,070
you have to wait for us here.

272
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,640
About your Agent Agreement,

273
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,190
we'll ask Xu Jianshe to sign it

274
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,370
after we meet him.

275
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:03,590
-Don’t worry. -Okay.

276
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,230
Mr. Xu.

277
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,730
We've been unable to find

278
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,310
any evidence to prove your innocence in your case.

279
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,600
It's not easy for us to have your case remanded for a retrial.

280
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,130
I didn't do it.

281
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,670
There's nothing I can trust

282
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:54,190

She's doing everything for me.

285
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,290
It's really hard for her

286
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,500
to bring us to this point.

287
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,160
Although your case is remanded,

288
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,640
it'll be risky

289
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,700
if we continue pleading not guilty.

290
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,010
Will you consider pleading for a misdemeanor

291
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,090
and making positive gestures of compensation?

292
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,110
We will also actively

293
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,930
negotiate with the victim's family

294
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,270
to seek their understanding

295
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,740
so that the court can consider your sentence

296
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,510
and give you a lighter sentence in court.

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,710
What do you think?

298
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,820
I didn't kill him.

299
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,880
Why should I pay for it?

In Meeting Room 3.

301
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,730
You are the lawyers I hired.

302
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,230
You should be on my side.

303
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,780
We've always been on your side.

304
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,590
But it is too difficult for us

305
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,750
to plead not guilty on your behalf

306
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,110
and completely overturn the first trial's result.

307
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,870
So we advise you again to consider

308
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,020
pleading for a misdemeanor and negotiating the compensation.

309
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,060
I think we can

310
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,700
try to make a reduction in your sentence

311
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,110
to minimize the risk of losing the case.

312
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,710
Yes.

313
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,150
If the sentence can be reduced

314
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,190
and you behave well in jail,

315
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,010
your actual time served may be shorter in the future.

316
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,890
I think you should be able to tell which deal is better.

317
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:31,790
How about this?

318
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,750
We can reach out to the other party

319
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,530
on your behalf

320
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,730
to see their attitude.

321
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,960
If it comes to compensation,

322
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,070
we can find out their bottom line.

323
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,180
What do you think?

324
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,370
I understand what you're implying.

325
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,450
There's no time for me.

326
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:55,740
This is my last chance.

327
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,180
Go.

328
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,160
But you can't decide for me.

329
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,490
I'll decide

330
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,420
whether to compensate them

331
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,310
or how much to compensate them.

332
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,310
Of course.

333
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,350
The date for your retrial will be set soon.

334
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,310
We'll come to visit you next week.

335
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,350
You can

336
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,180
tell us your decision by then.

337
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,890
We have

338
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,330
a supplementary Agent's Agreement.

339
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,430
The additional lawyer is our colleague.

Her name is Xia Shu.

341
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,630
Mrs. Ma has confirmed it.

342
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,620
She saw Xia Shu.

343
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,110
Okay.

344
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,110
I accept it.

345
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,630
Okay.

346
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:40,820
Please sign here.

347
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,880
How is it?

348
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,380
He signed it. Don't worry.

349
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,470
No. What did Xu Jianshe say?

350
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,590
He wavered.

351
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,820
He did?

352
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:05,660
Well.

353
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,510
Now there is a retrial,

354
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,510
and we can renegotiate the compensation.

355
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,970
This situation is good enough for us.

356
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,620
Haven't you been running around seeking help for Mr. Xu,

357
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,700
hoping for his prompt release?

358
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,950
I know.

359
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,560
I know. Let me think about it.

360
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,450
Let me think about it.

361
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,470
Mrs. Ma.

362
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,440
If we take too long,

363
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,070
they might think we are not sincere enough.

364
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,290
How about this?

365
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,510
We can discuss the amount of compensation later.

366
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,220
Let's first reach out

367
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,240
to the victim's family.

368
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,910
No.

369
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,820
You can't reach out to them alone

370
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,270
behind our backs.

371
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,690
We won't.

372
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,910
Mr. Xu has agreed.

373
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,880
He agreed?

374
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,230
Did he sign it?

375
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,140
No need.

376
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,670
He agreed in person

377
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,750
to let us reach them first.

378
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,300
As for the terms of compensation,

379
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,920
he will decide for himself in the future.

380
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,170
Jianshe hasn't confessed.

381
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,430
How could he agree to let you

382
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,000
contact them?

383
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:15,310
If you reached them,

384
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,640
wouldn't that mean that he confessed?

385
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,860
Mrs. Ma.

386
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,640
Our client is Xu Jianshe.

387
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,230
He agreed in person.

388
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,290
We also have a recording of the meeting.

389
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,030
Miss Xia,

390
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,060
please show Mrs. Ma

391
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:28,610
our notes.

392
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,480
Okay.

393
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,840
Look.

394
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,870
Didn't Jianshe say he would think about it?

395
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,380
Besides, he said

396
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,280
that you can't decide for him.

397
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,950
It's up to him to decide whether he'll compensate or not, or the amount.

398
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,620
And it's Jianshe's money.

399
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,920
I can't make decisions for him.

400
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,120
How about this?

401
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,190
I think it's better to let Jianshe think it through first.

402
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,910
If there's nothing else, I'll be on my way.

403
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,710
Mrs. Ma,

404
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,870
you need to give us the 150,000 yuan

405
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,470
after the second trial right away.

406
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:03,860
And if you still want us

407
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,210
to represent you for the retrial,

408
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,810
you'll need to pay us 500,000 yuan.

409
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,369
Sure. I'll give you the 150,000 yuan right away.

410
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,200
As for the 500,000 yuan,

411
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
I think we should give Jianshe some time to consider it

412
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:14,650
before I give you the money.

413
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,190
I have to go.

414
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,670
What does she mean?

415
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,569
Didn't she always try to save Xu Jianshe at all costs?

416
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:30,150
It's such a great opportunity.

417
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,960
Why did she suddenly become so inactive?

418
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,710
She becomes like this

419
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,640
because she believes Xu Jianshe is innocent.

420
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,550
We've explained everything to her.

421
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,120
Even Xu Jianshe, who is locked up, came around.

422
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,270
Can't she understand it?

423
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,990
Yingzi, Qiu Hua.

424
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,040
You believe Xu Jianshe is innocent, right?

425
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,140
On the contrary,

426
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
we now believe he may be guilty.

427
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:51,550
As for whether he is the one

428
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,670
who delivered the fatal blow or not,

429
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,280
perhaps only he knows.

430
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,230
If we can try to reduce his sentence,

431
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,430
it will already be a good result.

432
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,980
Hello, what's up?

433
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,020
Xia Shu, hold this for me.

434
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,790
Is our small counseling room available?

435
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,030
Okay.

436
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,830
Bring her here.

437
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,140
Okay, thank you.

438
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,990
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Xiao is here.

439
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,610
Yingzi.

440
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,200
Yuan.

441
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,050
Have a seat.

442
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,050
Here's the thing.

443
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,470
I want you to be my lawyer

444
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,640
to sue Sun Huading.

445
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,620
I received his letter.

446
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:52,310
He told me

447
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,540
that he had transferred the money

448
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:56,110
using his mother's account.

449
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,860
He also gave me the letters exchanged between them

450
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,580
and the password for the bank account.

451
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,390
I went to see his mother as well.

452
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,770
She gave me the bank Ushield.

453
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:06,470
I checked it online.

454
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,900
He transferred a total of about 60 million yuan.

455
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,420
Wen Li has transferred pretty much

456
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,500
all of the money away.

457
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,300
So, I want you to represent me

458
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,370
in recovering this portion of the community property.

459
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,280
Yuan.

460
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,380
Does Sun know

461
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,860
that you want me to be your lawyer?

462
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,590
He knows,

463
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,200
and he agrees.

464
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,620
To be exact, the money he transferred

465
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,830
is not entirely your shared property.

466
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,470
Most of it

467
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,880
is the company's assets.

468
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,350
Did they find out how much he had transferred

469
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,250
when he was arrested?

470
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,430
There was

471
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:49,950
about 20 million yuan.

472
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,040
The rest was squared off

473
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,070
through the transfer of shares.

474
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,010
So when I divorced him,

475
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,910
I didn't get any money for his stock rights.

476
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,470
I believe

477
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:00,720
this is our shared property.

478
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:03,260
But the police found out it was over 20 million yuan.

479
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,710
Now it's over 60 million yuan.

480
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,650
If you sue him now,

481
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,550
he may be held accountable for his remaining crime.

482
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
Does he know about this?

483
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,190
He does.

484
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,800
He now hates Wen Li.

485
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,630
He said he'd rather stay in jail for a few more years

486
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:17,970
than see her get away with it.

487
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:22,550
Okay.

488
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,720
Yuan, I have a suggestion.

489
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,140
As I said,

490
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,520
once the 60 million yuan is disclosed,

491
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,870
Sun

492
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,640
may be exposed to significant legal risks.

493
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,510
He needs a lawyer now.

494
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,840
Anyway,

495
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,970
I went to you and him,

496
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,990
and that's what led to the 60 million yuan.

497
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,470
So,

498
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,400
if he trusts me,

499
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,330
I should represent him in every way.

500
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,070
As for you,

501
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,670
I'm not the right lawyer.

502
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:51,470
Why?

503
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,990
Don't forget.

504
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,190
I'm the other victim

505
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,850
in Wen Li's case.

506
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,710
So in the future,

507
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,980
I'll be one of the parties in Wen Li's case.

508
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,430
So, I'm not the right choice.

509
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,510
But don't worry, Yuan.

510
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,950
I can recommend

511
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,150
a highly suitable lawyer to you.

512
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,550
From your firm?

513
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,990
No.

514
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,790
Because if I'm going to represent Sun,

515
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:12,870
the lawyers in our firm

516
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:14,400
can no longer represent you.

517
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,790
But I trust

518
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,530
that lawyer's ability.

519
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,840
Who?

520
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,330
Mr. Chen Shuo from Da Zheng Law Firm.

521
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,990
I know him well.

522
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,160
He's the perfect man to deal with Wen Li.

523
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,310
Okay.

524
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,070
I trust the person you recommended.

525
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:33,870
I’ll listen to you.

526
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,030
-Hello. -Hello.

527
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:49,620
We're from the Yunyang precinct.

528
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,910
Is Luo Yingzi here?

529
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,220
[Liangcheng Law Firm]

530
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,170
Please wait a moment.

531
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,340
Mrs. Luo.

532
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:01,020
The two officers are looking for you.

533
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,250
What is it?

534
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,000
Hello, Luo Yingzi.

535
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,590
Hello.

536
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,070
We are from the Yunyang Branch.

537
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,670
We have received a report that you are suspected of committing loan fraud.

538
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,410
Please cooperate with the investigation and come with us.

539
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,160
Fraud?

540
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,230
Have you investigated it?

541
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:11,990
Do you have any evidence?

542
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,020
We ask you to come with us for the investigation.

543
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,580
Please cooperate with us. Thank you.

544
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,990
Okay, I'll come with you and cooperate with your investigation.

545
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,450
Yuan.

546
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,360
Don't worry.

547
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,630
Let me find out what happened here,

548
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,780
and I'll contact you later.

549
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,420
Okay.

550
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:26,130
Let's go.

551
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:26,660
Okay.

552
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:31,840
By the way,

553
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,980
Sun.

554
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,270
Help me find Qiu Hua.

555
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,870
I want her to be my lawyer.

556
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:36,480
Okay.

557
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:47,860
Ms. Fang.

558
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:48,940
Something happened.

559
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,770
Tao.

560
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:50,600
What's wrong?

561
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,590
Something bad happened.

562
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,770
Luo Yingzi was arrested by the police.

563
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,160
Are you sure it's Luo Yingzi?

564
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,190
Of course, I am.

565
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,070
Everyone in the lobby saw it.

566
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,530
This will be fun.

567
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:06,550
The lawyer from our Liangcheng firm was handcuffed by the police.

568
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,040
Do you know why?

569
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,870
What else could it be?

570
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,900
Maybe it's because of

571
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,360
that remanded case she's handling.

572
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,360
Luo Yingzi

573
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:16,630
is too bold.

574
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,300
She can do anything.

575
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,470
She might have bribed the judge in the second trial.

576
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:22,660
We can't keep

577
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,100
this kind of person in our firm.

578
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,850
Now she has a criminal record.

579
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,320
She can't be a lawyer.

580
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,720
If we were to keep a lawyer like her

581
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,420
what'd we look like in the legal world?

582
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,560
Ms. Qiu, bad news.

583
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,270
What's wrong?

584
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,730
Mrs. Luo was arrested by the police.

585
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,710
Do you know why?

586
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,140
I heard from a police officer that she is suspected of fraud.

587
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,620
How is that possible?

588
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,480
They must have caught the wrong person.

589
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,200
Should we go to the police station

590
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:53,940
and get her out now?

591
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,430
You're not helping.

592
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,880
The police can only determine the specific reason
after it has been investigated.

593
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,750
Did Mrs. Luo say anything

594
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,710
when she was taken away?

595
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,050
She said that she wanted you to be her attorney.

596
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,130
Well, Mr. Tao,

597
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,340
please excuse us.

598
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,570
I want to talk to Han privately.

599
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,250
Okay.

600
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,550
Han.

601
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,320
Luo Yingzi

602
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,240
has evidence of your sexual harassment.

603
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,360
Don't forget.

604
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:28,190
In the future, when she gets out,

605
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,840
if she finds out that you were the one who insisted on firing her

606
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:32,840
and she discloses the evidence,

607
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,260
can you still be a lawyer?

608
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,490
I'm doing this for the sake of our firm.

609
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,830
For the firm?

610
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,390
Then, don't gloat.

611
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,600
You don't know the situation yet.

612
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:46,030
Then you came here, talking nonsense.

613
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,180
Anyway,

614
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,470
she is our lawyer.

615
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,320
We have to protect her.

616
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,500
As for what will happen in the future,

617
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,610
we'll talk about it later.

618
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,250
Look how smug you are.

619
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,200
Mr. Tao,

620
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,670
come back.

621
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,700
Let's discuss

622
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,090
and see what to do about it.

623
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,100
Do you want me to find out...

624
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,350
why?

625
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,110
No matter what,

626
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,210
we must keep it a secret.

627
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,350
After all, she is one of our lawyers.

628
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,790
She was arrested in broad daylight.

629
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:30,150
You can keep it a secret?

630
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,380
Keep your mouth shut first.

631
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,910
Han, let me tell you.

632
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
If one day I find out that you are the one who leaked it,

633
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,910
there will be consequences.

634
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,500
Ms. Fang.

635
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:44,810
Luo Yingzi was taken away by the police.

636
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,510
How capable.

637
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,500
She even got herself into the police station.

638
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,420
Ms. Fang, we have to save her.

639
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,940
It depends on

640
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,340
what she did.

641
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,190
If she really committed a crime,

642
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,490
not even God could save her.

643
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,790
Do you think Luo Yingzi could commit a crime?

644
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,880
I can't say for sure.

645
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
If you say so,

646
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,990
you're being irresponsible

647
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,930
to your client.

648
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,960
Not to mention, Luo Yingzi would never commit a crime.

649
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,440
Even if she did commit a crime,

650
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,900
you are still her lawyer.

651
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:16,430
You should also protect her legal rights.

652
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,190
Ms. Fang,

653
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:18,470
how could you say that?

654
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,350
Qiu Hua.

655
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,640
We will help her since she won't.

656
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:22,320
Calm down.

657
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,820
Ms. Fang just said it.

658
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,370
We were discussing how to save her.

659
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:26,150
Even if it isn't for her,

660
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:27,840
we'll save her for the sake of our firm!

661
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,720
Qiu Hua.

662
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,450
Do you know why?

663
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,840
They said she's suspected of fraud.

664
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,210
Not bribery,

665
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,290
but fraud.

666
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,590
What do you mean by that?

667
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:43,600
Han.

668
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,520
You're done here.

669
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,330
You can go now.

670
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,740
Qiu Hua.

671
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,640
You've been close to her.

672
00:26:58,990 --> 00:26:59,950
Think about it.

673
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,160
What exactly is it

674
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,900
that could make the police think she committed fraud?

675
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,180
It should have something to do with her filing a police report

676
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,920
about Liu Ming's fraud.

677
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,370
Could it be that the police think she is the co-conspirator?

678
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,240
There's no way Luo Yingzi would cheat for money.

679
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:14,930
Someone must have set her up.

680
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:21,320
If it's related to Liu Ming...

681
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,380
I've been her divorce lawyer.

682
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,850
Of course,

683
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,680
I'm also her lawyer on this matter.

684
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,670
Here, Qiu Hua,

685
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,880
find out

686
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:33,420
the reason for their investigation.

687
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,100
Okay.

688
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,200
I'm familiar with the police.

689
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:35,870
I'll go.

690
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:37,930
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

691
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,740
Xia Shu, Qiu Hua.

692
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,290
Da Zheng Firm is representing the bank.

693
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:49,030
If it's about the bank loan,

694
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,200
I believe

695
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,340
the Da Zheng firm must be involved.

696
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,600
The top priority for both of you is to find out

697
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,780
who framed Luo Yingzi.

698
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,060
Okay, we'll go now.

699
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,890
You go to Da Zheng and ask.

700
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:11,750
I'll go to the bank.

701
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,890
Let’s split up.

702
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,850
-Okay. -Call me if anything happens.

703
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:14,330
Okay.

704
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,880
I've always known that Luo Yingzi is a bad person.

705
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,080
A lawyer was taken away by the police at our front door.

706
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,870
How are we supposed to run our firm after that?

707
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,750
But whom else does she respect?

708
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,400
Whom else?

709
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,440
She is still a young lawyer.

710
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,640
But she has already walked all over us.

711
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:38,730
Turns out, she won by breaking the law.

712
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,830
Fortunately, something happened this time.

713
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,730
Otherwise, there might be a greater problem in the future.

714
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,800
Turnabout is fair play.

715
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:02,580
Not good enough.

716
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,340
Miss Zhang.

717
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,470
A lady is looking for Mr. Chen.

718
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,310
You are?

719
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,440
Are you Zhang Shilan?

720
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,870
I'm a colleague of Mrs. Luo from the Liangcheng firm.

721
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,190
I'm looking for Mr. Chen. Is he here?

722
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,850
He went to see a client.

723
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,640
Does he know

724
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,060
that Mrs. Luo has been taken away by the police?

725
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,910
What did you say?

726
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,410
Hello, Qiu Hua.

727
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,620
Xia Shu.

728
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,590
How did it go at Da Zheng?

729
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,810
I didn't get to see Mr. Chen.

730
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,160
I didn't find anything.

731
00:29:58,550 --> 00:29:59,950
I went to the bank.

732
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,030
The bank manager doesn't want to see me at all.

733
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,990
OK, keep checking.

734
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,920
Okay.

735
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,720
[Ma Lili]

736
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,710
Hello, Mrs. Ma.

737
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
What happened?

738
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:16,990
Miss Xia,

739
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,450
can we meet?

740
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,840
I have something urgent to tell you.

741
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:21,650
I'll send you the address.

742
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,350
Okay, I'll come to you now.

743
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,270
Luo Yingzi.

744
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,110
We've received a report

745
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,220
alleging that you and your husband are suspected of fraud.

746
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,990
Tell us what happened.

747
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,430
Officers,

748
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,640
I'm a lawyer.

749
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,740
I know the law too.

750
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,570
It's not my husband and I who are involved in fraud,

751
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,390
but my husband alone.

752
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,510
I have nothing to do

753
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,140
with my husband's involvement in defrauding a bank loan.

754
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,830
I reported his fraud to the police

755
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,560
a few days ago.

756
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,380
You can check it out.

757
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:21,900
You...

758
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,440
I haven't finished yet.

759
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,340
I'm sorry.

760
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,630
Because I called the police,

761
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,110
the bank can't auction the house

762
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,030
to collect on their loan.

763
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,470
So, they got anxious

764
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,100
and sued me.

765
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,240
I'm done.

766
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,470
You'd better get up on the right side

767
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,640
and think about it calmly.

768
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,670
The bank provided not only physical evidence

769
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,130
but also witnesses.

770
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:47,130
If they have a witness, ask him to come out and meet me.

771
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,240
We can confront each other.

772
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,420
We can't just listen to the witness, can we?

773
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,870
I want to see my lawyer.

774
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,840
This is my legal right.

775
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:05,670
Contact her lawyer for her.

776
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:22,110
Shuo, why didn't you answer the phone?

777
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,500
I was talking to a client.

778
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,570
Someone from Liangcheng said that Yingzi had been arrested.

779
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,840
Did that person say why?

780
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:29,750
A bank fraud.

781
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,160
She may have already been placed in criminal detention.

782
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:34,150
I'll go with you.

783
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,050
No need.

784
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,140
Come in.

785
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,130
Mr. Wang.

786
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,070
It's me again.

787
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,490
What are you doing here?

788
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,240
I'm here to claim credit.

789
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,490
What credit?

790
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:31,660
May I sit?

791
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,150
Sit.

792
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:37,360
Luo Yingzi

793
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,730
reported her husband's blackmail.

794
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,070
Last time, you told me

795
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,080
that it was a marital conspiracy,

796
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,760
and I didn't believe it.

797
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:44,670
Right?

798
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,370
But later,

799
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,710
I carefully thought about it.

800
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,750
I think

801
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,380
that, Mr. Wang, you have a point.

802
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,070
Really.

803
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,630
So,

804
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,410
I secretly and casually

805
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,480
told this news

806
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,330
to my classmate,

807
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,980
who works at the police station.

808
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,960
Guess what?

809
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:01,590
What?

810
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,220
Luo Yingzi was arrested today.

811
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,190
You used this trick too?

812
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,000
Who else used it?

813
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,719
To be honest,

814
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,570
we also reported it to the police.

815
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:18,679
Isn't it "great minds think alike"?

816
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,900
It's not that we think alike.

817
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,570
Don't forget.

818
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,389
You taught us this move.

819
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,690
Mr. Wang, here you go again.

820
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:26,389
Again.

821
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:29,969
Here is the thing.

822
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,460
You called the police,

823
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,510
and Luo Yingzi was arrested.

824
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:37,480
Then let's make it a fact.

825
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,320
Let's find evidence.

826
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,650
We have evidence.

827
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,159
She came to the bank back then with her husband.

828
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,530
It can't be.

829
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:48,659
She came with her husband,

830
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,719
and then she reported it to the police.

831
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,989
Is she stupid?

832
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,590
We don't care.

833
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:53,840
Anyway,

834
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,110
her husband said that the woman was his wife.

835
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:01,460
Mr. Wang.

836
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,080
It's fine that you didn't care about this before.

837
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,230
But now you've called the police.

838
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,100
It's a lawsuit now.

839
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,270
Then you have to consider it.

840
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,330
How about this?

841
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,360
I mean, if you can.

842
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,030
If you can,

843
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,330
let me have a look

844
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,220
at the evidence you have.

845
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm a lawyer.

846
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
I'll check it out for you.

847
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,820
Let's see

848
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,420
if we can avoid any risks.

849
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,360
What do you think?

850
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:29,580
Can I, Mr. Wang?

851
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,800
Anyway, Liu Ming said

852
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,160
that the woman was his wife.

853
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,630
We have to be rigorous.

854
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,850
Is she his wife or not?

855
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,470
Because you're the responsible person for the loan.

856
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,970
You have to testify in court in the future.

857
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,380
If that's what you're going to say,

858
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,030
there will be a problem.

859
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,560
What should we do?

860
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:49,060
It's been a long time.

861
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,330
Show me the materials.

862
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,500
Okay.

863
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:54,850
It's all here.

864
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,450
Is there any security footage from that day?

865
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,090
No.

866
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:23,860
Sorry, I have to take this call.

867
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,260
Hurry up.

868
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,210
You go in first.

869
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,730
What is it?

870
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,550
Ms. Fang,

871
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,040
such a big thing has happened in the firm.

872
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,710
We need to gather all partners

873
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,690
for an emergency meeting.

874
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,190
What happened?

875
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,740
It's just to get her to cooperate with the investigation.

876
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,400
Ms. Fang,

877
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:40,350
you can’t defend her

878
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,350
just because she paid you a high legal fee.

879
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,190
A lawyer from our firm has been arrested.

880
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,420
It will have a significant impact

881
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,870
on our law firm.

882
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,780
I don't think you're right.

883
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,880
What do you mean by "I defend her"?

884
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,000
I'm her lawyer.

885
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,250
But does her detention

886
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,340
have anything to do with me?

887
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:58,940
Then, we need to gather partners

888
00:36:59,020 --> 00:36:59,900
for an emergency meeting

889
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,970
to discuss

890
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,050
the impact of this issue on the law firm.

891
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,630
Just do it if you want.

892
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,100
Mr. Tao, call everyone for a meeting.

893
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,200
Xia Shu doesn't need to attend it.

894
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,230
Go.

895
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,950
Mr. Han.

896
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,180
Wait.

897
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,310
I have a meeting to attend.

898
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,460
I advise you to wait.

899
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,850
What is it?

900
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,240
You instigated this again, didn't you?

901
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,490
I don't understand.

902
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,910
I've worked under you for so long.

903
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,720
I know your characters well.

904
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,030
What does her crime

905
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,390
have to do with my characters?

906
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,690
We don't know whether she committed a crime or not.

907
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,380
But it's true that you sexually harassed me.

908
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:05,590
What do you want?

909
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,010
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

910
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,400
At the partner meeting,

911
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,550
if you dare to harm Luo Yingzi,

912
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,480
I'll reveal what's on my phone.

913
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,710
You think you've got me, right?

914
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,310
Make it public.

915
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,350
As long as you don't care about your reputation.

916
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,350
I didn't do anything shameful.

917
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,460
You're the shameless one.

918
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,800
I advise you not to make me do that.

919
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,630
Ms. Fang,

920
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,750
I know you admire her.

921
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,070
But you're in charge of the law firm.

922
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,510
You need to think about the interests of the law firm.

923
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:57,890
No matter what,

924
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,990
the negative impact of the police coming to our firm

925
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,400
to arrest people has already occurred.

926
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,380
For the sake of our law firm,

927
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:06,380
we must take action immediately.

928
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,330
What action?

929
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,800
She is being investigated,

930
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,550
but it doesn't necessarily mean she has committed a crime.

931
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,550
Let's dismiss her first.

932
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,520
Something happened to a lawyer

933
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,010
from our firm.

934
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,200
At this point, if we don't

935
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,000
legally defend her rights,

936
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,320
what's the point

937
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,180
of having this law firm?

938
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,020
Ms. Fang,

939
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,730
you took her money,

940
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,310
but you can't sacrifice the interests of the law firm for her.

941
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,010
I've represented her in two cases.

942
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,720
Is there a problem with me charging her?

943
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,610
You can't ignore the law firm's interest

944
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,210
just because she's your client!

945
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:46,140
Don't worry.

946
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,090
If the court finds her guilty,

947
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,340
the law firm won't keep her.

948
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,820
In my opinion,

949
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,840
Ms. Fang is right.

950
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,000
We are a law firm.

951
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,630
Our lawyer is facing a legal problem.

952
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,210
It's our job to help her.

953
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,560
Han,

954
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:09,980
why are you on her side?

955
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,370
Who encouraged us just now?

956
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,940
Ms. Fang,

957
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:15,260
do you still need me?

958
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,680
If not, I can represent her with you.

959
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,640
I'll do it for free.

960
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,260
No need.

961
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:26,820
As the person in charge of the law firm,

962
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,780
I repeat.

963
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:34,260
Luo Yingzi is still a lawyer at our law firm.

964
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:37,260
Although she's detained

965
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,980
due to something,

966
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:42,080
that doesn't mean she's guilty.

967
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,880
At this moment,

968
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,720
our law firm is obligated

969
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,260
to provide legal support to her.

970
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,440
It is our duty

971
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,070
to take responsibility for helping her.

972
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,410
If the court

973
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:57,930
finds her guilty in the end,

974
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,320
I will fire her immediately

975
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,820
in accordance with the regulations of our firm.

976
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:07,240
You're back.

977
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,760
Mr. Chen.

978
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,550
Can I have a word with you?

979
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,030
There's really no security footage?

980
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,520
No?

981
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,940
As a lawyer, let me remind you.

982
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:35,600
Hiding and destroying evidence is a crime.

983
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,440
Mr. Wang asked me to destroy it.

984
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,530
I dare not.

985
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:42,820
Can you show me?

986
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,620
It's not easy for you and Mr. Xu.

987
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,980
But Mrs. Ma,

988
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,730
I believe Mrs. Luo and Ms. Qiu

989
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,280
have made it very clear to you.

990
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,030
Only if Xu Jianshe

991
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,780
agrees to compensate the victim's family

992
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,000
can we send this document to him

993
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,250
after the court has approved it.

994
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,890
I really want to help you.

995
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,970
But I really can't

996
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,650
do that for you.

997
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,720
Miss Xia, you know it.

998
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,900
The legal fee is too expensive.

999
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:29,130
I've been scraping money around, and still, I can't get enough of it.

1000
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,100
I just want to sell a house for him.

1001
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,860
But I don't even have the right to do it now.

1002
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,750
I really don't know what to do.

1003
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,290
I understand your difficulties.

1004
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:48,270
So we've been persuading Mr. Xu

1005
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:49,240
to negotiate compensation with the victim's family.

1006
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,650
As long as he accepts it, everything will be fine.

1007
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,360
Besides this,

1008
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,560
if you need any help,

1009
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:58,780
I will try my best to help.
