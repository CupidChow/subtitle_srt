[Episode 5]

4
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,310
What in the world did you write? This is awful!

5
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,830
It's full of misspelled words.

6
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,190
Sorry, Mr. Han.

7
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,470
Is this how you treat your internship?

8
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,470
What I wrote when I was an intern

9
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,930
is much better than yours.

10
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:39,850
Rewrite it.

11
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:41,670
Qiu Hua.

12
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,320
Where did you go?

13
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,850
Are you and Luo Yingzi out of your mind?

14
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,110
You two don't even listen to me.

15
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,750
You two should go find another job.

16
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,190
Mr. Han, calm down.

17
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,190
We've found it.

18
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,400
What have you found?

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,030
Wang Dafu didn't kill anyone.

20
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,030
He couldn't have killed anyone.

21
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,270
He was in the suburbs.

22
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,670
It was dozens of kilometers away from the house he rented.

23
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,030
We've found the suona and the tipper

24
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,190
that he mentioned.

25
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,370
Follow me.

26
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,590
It's our honor to have a client like you.

27
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,020
It's nothing.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,320
It's just a business.

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,760
Don’t say that.

30
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,110
Mr. Zhou.

31
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,829
Ms. Luo.

32
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,740
We are destined to meet.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,060
Mr. Zhou, I’m really sorry

34
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,900
for troubling you to come back.

35
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,990
Li.

36
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,640
Can you leave us alone?

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,079
I'll have some words

38
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,140
with Mr. Zhou.

39
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:36,990
Ms. Luo.

40
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,740
Well…

41
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,710
Just get out.

42
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,180
I'll pay for

43
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,829
your commission.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,590
Okay.

45
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,100
I'll leave you to it.

46
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,550
What's up?

47
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,550
Are you really going to sell the house?

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,230
As the agent told you,

49
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,840
the house is asked

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,810
for 6.6 million.

51
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,670
I can sell it to you for 6.2 million.

52
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,360
You pay for the commission.

53
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,840
From 6.6 million to 6.2 million.

54
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,330
That's a 400,000 difference.

55
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:09,230
Ms. Luo.

56
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,550
Is there anything wrong with your house?

57
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,230
No.

58
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,960
No one died in this house.

59
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,170
It's not haunted either.

60
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:19,170
It'll just be a little difficult for you

61
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,870
when you move in.

62
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,400
Why?

63
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:24,150
Well, he ran away,

64
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,390
but his parents are still living in the house.

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,360
Do you own the house?

66
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,550
Is the ownership clear?

67
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,550
Don't worry.

68
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,829
This house is my personal pre-marital property,

69
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,390
no disputes at all.

70
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,030
It might be difficult for others,

71
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,260
but for me, it's no big deal.

72
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,820
Great.

73
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,110
Well, there's something else.

74
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,790
Go ahead.

75
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,560
Say I sell this for 6.2 million,

76
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,940
and I owe you 80,000.

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,850
So you should pay me 5.4 million, right?

78
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,020
I want cash

79
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,829
for this 5.4 million.

80
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,720
Cash?

81
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,120
How can I get you so much cash?

82
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:00,830
Come on.

83
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,640
I know you're being modest.

84
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,640
With your resources and business,

85
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,270
isn't 5.4 million cash

86
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,870
nothing to you?

87
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,700
Well, Ms. Luo.

88
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,520
You're just a woman.

89
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,910
Even if I get it for you,

90
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,790
aren't you afraid of being robbed

91
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:13,920
with this much cash?

92
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,149
Mr. Zhou.

93
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,269
You should know.

94
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,579
Since he borrowed money  from you,

95
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,019
it meant

96
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,710
he must have borrowed money somewhere else, right?

97
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,050
To me,

98
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,000
I'd rather keep it by myself

99
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,470
than save it in a bank.

100
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,840
I like to make deals with smart people.

101
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,710
You're smart.

102
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,950
You'll help me save 400,000.

103
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,200
How about this?

104
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,520
You owe me 800,000, right?

105
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,659
I just want my 600,000 principal back.

106
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:41,150
-I won't take the 200,000 interest
-No, Mr. Zhou.

107
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,590
What I just told you

108
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,330
was not asking you to pity me.

109
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:46,260
Let's stick to the way it should be.

110
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,830
You won't add up interest for me, right?

111
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,590
That'll help me a lot.

112
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,030
You're really smart.

113
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,990
Let's go. I'll get the money for you.

114
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,720
Mr. Zhou, I have one more thing.

115
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,150
How many things do you have?

116
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,070
Just tell me.

117
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:02,000
I know you have a good network of people.

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,270
Can you find out

119
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,680
how much money he borrowed out there?

120
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,470
Let me summarize.

121
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,510
Three things.

122
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,030
First, you want cash.

123
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,150
Second,

124
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,910
get the old couple out of there.

125
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,350
Third,

126
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,670
find out how much that bastard owes in debts.

127
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,230
Yes.

128
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,270
Just these three things.

129
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,900
Thank you so much.

130
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,550
But the second thing,

131
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,550
after all, they're two elderly people.

132
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,230
Let's not play it rough.

133
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:29,780
Just

134
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,550
ask them nicely to leave.

135
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,110
Don't worry.

136
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,510
I'm a law-abiding citizen. I can handle it properly.

137
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,550
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

138
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,470
Let's go.

139
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,550
Well, Mr. Zhou.

140
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,580
Let's handle the household registration first.

141
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,600
-We should do it now.
-No need to rush.

142
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,060
We'll talk about it later.

143
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,230
After you get the money,

144
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:48,790
hide yourself.

145
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,120
I'm afraid other creditors

146
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,670
might come asking for it.

147
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,710
If they get your money,

148
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,980
your efforts will be in vain.

149
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,510
Mr. Zhou.

150
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,350
You really trust me.

151
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,190
Aren't you afraid

152
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,030
I have any family traditions or customs

153
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,870
where I run away with the money

154
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,170
and refuse to admit it?

155
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:12,120
Don't you dare run away.

156
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,470
Ms. Luo.

157
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:41,670
Mr. Zhou.

158
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,940
It's all here.

159
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,750
-Put them in the trunk.
-Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

160
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,560
Let me do it.

161
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,710
Let them do it.

162
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,600
It's okay. Let me do it.

163
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,490
Come here.

164
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,390
Don't let them know about the money.

165
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:58,710
There's 6.6 million.

166
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:59,640
Not a penny less.

167
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:00,790
Mr. Zhou.

168
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:03,110
Didn't we agree on 6.2 million?

169
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,020
Ms. Luo.

170
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,140
After what you had been through,

171
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,830
you paid back the money he owed to me.

172
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,670
How can I

173
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,280
take advantage of you?

174
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,930
The agent told me that it was 6.6 million.

175
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,390
Let's make it 6.6 million.

176
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,550
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

177
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,390
You know what.

178
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,050
I'll take you as my friend.

179
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,910
Let them secure your car.

180
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,550
Hurry back.

181
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,330
It's okay, Mr. Zhou.

182
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,350
I can drive on my own.

183
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,200
I'll be back soon.

184
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,150
Okay.

185
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,670
Don't stop on the way.

186
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,570
Just go.

187
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,210
Well...

188
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,310
When I come back,

189
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,640
let's do the ownership transfer process.

190
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,270
Just come to have tea at my place.

191
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,710
Goodbye, Mr. Zhou.

192
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,010
Hello, Lanlan.

193
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,390
I'm going back to Lingnan now.

194
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,360
I need a companion on the way.

195
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,350
Can you go with me?

196
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,450
Who is it? It's midnight.

197
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,590
Coming.

198
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,990
Who is it?

199
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:49,470
Mom, it's me, Yingzi.

200
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,340
Yingzi!

201
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,360
Yingzi.

202
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,500
Why are you back at this hour?

203
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,190
Mom, this is Lanlan.

204
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,570
She's my housekeeper.

205
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:00,350
-Hi, Mrs. Luo.
-Hello.

206
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,230
She came back with me.

207
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,350
Come on in.

208
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,350
Lanlan, here are your slippers.

209
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:04,830
Okay.

210
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,990
No need to change.

211
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,350
Luo.

212
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,320
Hurry, your daughter is back.

213
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,230
I can tell it's Yingzi's voice

214
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,920
Why didn't you call us in advance?

215
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:16,600
I wanted to surprise you.

216
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,190
Mom.

217
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,950
Lanlan accompanied me all the way.

218
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,920
She hasn't had dinner yet.

219
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,520
Can you make her some noodles to eat?

220
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,000
It's okay. I'm not hungry.

221
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,110
-Just come with me.
-Make yourself at home.

222
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,070
Here, have some water.

223
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:27,290
Why did you come back?

224
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,470
Can't I visit my family without a reason?

225
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,760
-Dad.
-That's great.

226
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,470
Here, Dad.

227
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,710
There are two suitcases.

228
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,510
-Help me put them inside.
-Okay.

229
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,350
They're so heavy.

230
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,430
Well…

231
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,590
What's in them? Why are they so heavy?

232
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:43,810
Money.

233
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,710
Money?

234
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,960
Well, Liu Ming is running a company.

235
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,220
He needs cash sometimes.

236
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,850
He happens to have business here.

237
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,270
It may come in handy.

238
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:03,650
[Luo Bingwen, Luo Yingzi's Father]

239
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,700
Yingzi.

240
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:04,810
Yingzi.

241
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,110
You're not doing anything illegal, right?

242
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,520
I'm your daughter. Don't you know me?

243
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,310
What illegal things could I do?

244
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,600
It's alright?

245
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:18,240
You sure?

246
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,260
Fine, I'll tell you the truth.

247
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,430
You see,

248
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,480
his company had some small issues,

249
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,490
so he withdrew some cash just in case.

250
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:39,550
If anything goes wrong in the future,

251
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,520
at least we have some money on hand.

252
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,600
That's it.

253
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,070
What's wrong with Liu Ming's business?

254
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,470
I'm not sure about the specifics,

255
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,590
but I think

256
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,630
it's not a big deal.

257
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,350
As you know,

258
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,440
I've never interfered in his company affairs.

259
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,980
He asked me to withdraw some cash,

260
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,380
so I just did as he told me.

261
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,110
Yingzi.

262
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm not speaking ill of your mother-in-law behind her back.

263
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,590
The problem with this family

264
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,090
lies with her.

265
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,760
Do you think Liu Ming is cut out for business?

266
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,710
He had a stable government job,

267
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,590
but she pushed him into business.

268
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,230
Look at the result.

269
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,490
Your mother-in-law's business in Lingnan

270
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,730
is a disaster.

271
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,750
She's always on the run, trying to avoid creditors.

272
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,610
There was a time

273
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,070
she hid in our house for several days and didn't dare to go out.

274
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,840
I wanted to warn you back then,

275
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,230
but

276
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:38,190
I didn't tell you because I was afraid it would affect your relationship with your mother-in-law.

277
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,830
Liu Ming has no backbone.

278
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,760
You have to remind him constantly.

279
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,590
Don't worry, Dad.

280
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,010
I'll remind him.

281
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,070
I'll put these two suitcases of money under the bed.

282
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,100
Well,

283
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,990
when the cleaner comes,

284
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,660
make sure she doesn't sweep under the bed.

285
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:56,960
Hold on.

286
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,420
What are you doing?

287
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,230
Let me do it.

288
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,160
These are books.

289
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,950
What are you doing?

290
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,590
If I don't allow her to clean,

291
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,710
won't she become suspicious?

292
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,230
But with the books here,

293
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,440
you see my point?

294
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:13,770
Let me do it.

295
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,520
Don't forget tomorrow.

296
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,430
There you go.

297
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,770
I don't know if it's to your taste.

298
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,000
Eat slowly. It's hot.

299
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,870
It's alright, Mrs. Luo.

300
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,530
Your cooking is so delicious.

301
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,050
[Xing Jiayi, Luo Yingzi's Mother]

302
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,870
You're really sweet.

303
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,710
You're Lanlan, right?

304
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,160
Are you working at Yingzi's place?

305
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,600
Yes.

306
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,140
But I've only recently started helping out there.

307
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,460
Look at those young people.

308
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:50,110
They need help even though they don't have kids.

309
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,120
She had lived alone,

310
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,050
so she asked me to keep her company.

311
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,590
How could she be alone?

312
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,590
Where's Liu Ming?

313
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:02,710
Didn't she tell you?

314
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,470
Tell me what?

315
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,350
Alright, Dad.

316
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,980
I have to take this suitcase back.

317
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,900
I'll go home first.

318
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,640
What's the rush?

319
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,660
Is everything okay?

320
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,310
Dad, don't worry.

321
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,590
Everything's fine.

322
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,000
I need to work early tomorrow morning.

323
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,670
If I can't get there, the boss might complain.

324
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,190
Your housekeeper doesn't know about the money, right?

325
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,990
She doesn't know.

326
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,050
I haven't told her.

327
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,110
That's good.

328
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:40,240
Although we shouldn't judge people too harshly,

329
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,840
there's no need to test her character intentionally.

330
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,700
You did it right.

331
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,260
Dad, I'm leaving.

332
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,110
Mom.

333
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm leaving.

334
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:54,240
Where is Lanlan?

335
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:56,920
She’s waiting for you downstairs.

336
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,940
Bye, Mom

337
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,640
Yingzi.

338
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:02,470
What happened between you and Liu Ming?

339
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,470
Nothing.

340
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,990
We're doing fine.

341
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,080
Don't hide it from me.

342
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,110
I just called Liu Ming.

343
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,240
His phone is out of service.

344
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,830
I called his mother.

345
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:13,840
She said

346
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,190
you're no longer their daughter-in-law.

347
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,390
She told us not to contact them anymore.

348
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,480
Yingzi.

349
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,300
What's going on between you and Liu Ming?

350
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,260
Nothing. I just had a quarrel with my mother-in-law.

351
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,060
I gotta go.

352
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:29,670
Stop!

353
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,470
Do you think your dad and I are fools?

354
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,630
I felt something was wrong

355
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,750
when you came back in the middle of the night.

356
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,880
We're your parents.

357
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,870
Don't keep things from us.

358
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,510
Liu Ming and I…

359
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,980
It's over.

360
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,470
What does that mean?

361
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,470
He ran away.

362
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,580
He took all your assets and ran away?

363
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,230
That's why I withdrew all the money I could

364
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,470
and brought it home.

365
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,110
You...

366
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,990
Will he come back?

367
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,190
Mom.

368
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,670
What are you thinking?

369
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,880
Even if he comes back,

370
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,870
will you let me live with him?

371
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,470
I've filed for divorce.

372
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,950
I'm sorry.

373
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,190
I feel sorry for you two.

374
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,350
I promised you that we would live well together,

375
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,210
but I couldn't keep that promise.

376
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,330
I never expected

377
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,990
Liu Ming to be this kind of person.

378
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,000
What kind of person did you think he was?

379
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,110
With parents like his,

380
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,390
what kind of good child could they have raised?

381
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,910
It must be hard for you.

382
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
Mom, come on.

383
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,750
I finally got over it.

384
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,080
Now that you're crying…

385
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,830
See? I'm living well.

386
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,760
-I have to go to their house.
-Mom. Mom.

387
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,050
Don't go.

388
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,870
This matter

389
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,590
is in the past for me.

390
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,630
From now on,

391
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,590
don't mention their family

392
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,360
in our home anymore, okay?

393
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,320
Yingzi is right.

394
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,410
Look, she's quite strong.

395
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,160
Misfortune may be a blessing in disguise.

396
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,310
If Liu Ming is that kind of person,

397
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,190
even if he doesn't run today,

398
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,110
he will tomorrow.

399
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,170
Is your work going smoothly?

400
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,470
Yes.

401
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,350
Anyway, everything is hard at the beginning.

402
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,470
I think it's fine.

403
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,960
Fine? Fine for what?

404
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,520
You've just started working as a lawyer.

405
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,050
How much money can you make?

406
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,230
You also need to pay a housekeeper.

407
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,370
Luo.

408
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,870
We don't need the money anyway.

409
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:54,120
Just give it to Yingzi.

410
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,070
Mom, Dad, don't.

411
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,230
Dad, don't give it to me.

412
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,700
Mom, I can handle it.

413
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,960
I'll be fine.

414
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:02,470
Actually, the most challenging times have already passed.

415
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,910
Yingzi said she doesn't want it, so I won't.

416
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,470
But Yingzi, remember,

417
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,960
if you ever face difficulties,

418
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,470
you must tell us.

419
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,930
This is your home.

420
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,109
Got it.

421
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,990
It's too late.

422
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,069
Do you have to take the night road?

423
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,270
I have no choice, Dad.

424
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,150
I just got the job at this law firm.

425
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,730
I have a court case the day after tomorrow.

426
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,160
I haven't finished my defense statement.

427
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,240
I have to go back.

428
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,740
Well then, you should hit the road quickly.

429
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,820
Be safe on the way.

430
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,750
Lanlan.

431
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,400
Look, you were there for Yingzi

432
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,910
when she needed you the most.

433
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,710
I'll take you as my daughter.

434
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:49,040
Take this.

435
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,630
Mrs. Luo, I can't take this.

436
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,280
Take it.

437
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,150
I really can't.

438
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,640
-No.
-So you think it’s too little?

439
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,150
No.

440
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:54,710
Lanlan.

441
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,550
Take it.

442
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,330
It's a token of appreciation.

443
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:57,820
Take it.

444
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,310
You don’t know how much Lanlan has helped me.

445
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,670
When Liu Ming left,

446
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,530
he secretly took the property certificate of my house

447
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,930
and put it in his parents' house.

448
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,350
Lanlan got it back for me.

449
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,870
And, you know,

450
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:12,250
Lanlan used to earn 6,000 a month in their house.

451
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:14,510
Now, she earns only 3,000 with me.

452
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,190
We'll make up the difference for her.

453
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,730
Later, give me Lanlan's bank account details.

454
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:23,620
I'll transfer the money to you every month.

455
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,630
-You don't have to.
-Dad.

456
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,430
Dad, don't worry.

457
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,030
Lanlan and I have an agreement.

458
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,230
When I start earning,

459
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,510
I'll make it up to her.

460
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,270
Don't worry.

461
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,030
You don't have to insist.

462
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,720
When you're not with us,

463
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,750
Lanlan takes care of you on our behalf.

464
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,750
So,

465
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:41,190
we also have to thank you, Lanlan.

466
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,230
Lanlan.

467
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:45,080
I will thank you properly in the future.

468
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,150
Thank you, Mr. Luo, Mrs. Luo.

469
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,720
Well, Dad, Mom, we're leaving.

470
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:51,470
Just go.

471
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,000
Okay.

472
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,910
Goodbye, Mr. Luo, Mrs. Luo.

473
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,550
Bye.

474
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,230
Bye.

475
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,480
Yingzi.

476
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,180
Dad.

477
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,310
Although you're just an intern lawyer,

478
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,010
you're already in the legal profession.

479
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,470
Remember,

480
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,990
at any time,

481
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:10,310
use the law to protect yourself.

482
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,140
Dad, I'll remember.

483
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,310
Don't forget,

484
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,790
I'm the daughter of a law professor.

485
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,870
Dad, Mom.

486
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,950
You go and rest.

487
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:19,710
I'm gonna go.

488
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,290
Okay.

489
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,940
Be safe on the road.

490
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,150
Dad, Mum, take care.

491
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,790
Ms. Luo.

492
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,950
I'm sorry.

493
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,560
I let it slip.

494
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:47,730
I didn't know your parents were unaware of this.

495
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:48,990
It's okay.

496
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
They would find out sooner or later.

497
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,670
My parents

498
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:59,520
used to be very fond of Liu Ming.

499
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,630
This person

500
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,290
has no conscience.

501
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,050
This is primarily an issue between me and Liu Ming.

502
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,340
Why did his family have to

503
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,240
hurt my parents?

504
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,870
That old lady is never a good person.

505
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,150
Even though you're such a good person,

506
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,320
she still hates you.

507
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,990
His mother

508
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,540
never likes me.

509
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:37,280
We're finally back.

510
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,550
It was

511
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,670
a long way.

512
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,270
Ms. Luo.

513
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,480
Thank you.

514
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,080
Are you hungry?

515
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,280
I'll get you something to eat.

516
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,250
I'm not hungry.

517
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,550
If you are tired,

518
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,230
just go get some sleep.

519
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,490
I'm exhausted.

520
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,910
Hello, Luo Yingzi.

521
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:17,950
Qiu Hua.

522
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,870
I'm not feeling well today.

523
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,380
I'd like to take a sick day and not go to work.

524
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,710
Can you tell Mr. Han for me?

525
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,310
I tried calling you yesterday, but you didn't pick up.

526
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,710
Mr. Han took me to find those two people,

527
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,560
and we got the evidence.

528
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,090
Everything went smoothly.

529
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,370
They've agreed to testify in court.

530
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,910
Have you finished the defense statement?

531
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:40,350
Mr. Han said if you can't finish it,

532
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,910
he'll do it himself.

533
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,280
No, no, no.

534
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,870
I still want to write it myself.

535
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,500
Well…

536
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,230
We've got both of the witnesses.

537
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,850
Well…

538
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,600
It's easy to write the defense statement.

539
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,140
It's okay. I'll call Mr. Han.

540
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,510
Okay, bye.

541
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:58,100
Bye.

542
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,230
Luo.

543
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:09,190
Where did you go when we were collecting evidence yesterday?

544
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,230
Qiu Hua couldn't find you anywhere.

545
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,790
Mr. Han, I wasn't feeling well.

546
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,470
Not feeling well?

547
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,990
Health comes first.

548
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,430
Stay at home and rest.

549
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,700
I'll write the defense statement myself.

550
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,310
No, no, Mr. Han.

551
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,470
Well…

552
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,400
Let me write it.

553
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,070
Can I write it at home?

554
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,330
I'll finish it this afternoon and then give it to you.

555
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:31,990
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

556
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,950
I'm off to work.

557
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm not crazy.

558
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:53,730
How can I let you write the most important defense statement?

559
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,310
Qiu Hua, come with me.

560
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,790
Mr. Han, you want to see me?

561
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,420
Come in.

562
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,190
Fang just called me earlier.

563
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,720
He asked me to submit a form.

564
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,000
I told you to come in. Close the door.

565
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,640
I have something to tell you. I'm not going to bite you.

566
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,910
Qiu Hua.

567
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,800
Go to the court with me tomorrow.

568
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,060
Isn't Luo Yingzi going with you?

569
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,450
She's too troublesome.

570
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:40,040
I'm afraid she'll do something unnecessary in court

571
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,300
and make things worse.

572
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,150
Besides,

573
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,390
I've been thinking about your case.

574
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,310
This case,

575
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,710
along with the others we've worked on,

576
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,890
I can make sure you'll transition to a practicing lawyer this year.

577
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,020
You know what I mean?

578
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:01,360
How do I explain this to Luo Yingzi?

579
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,310
Should I inform her in advance,

580
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,150
and give her a heads-up?

581
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:04,680
No need.

582
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,910
Isn't she sick?

583
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,470
Good. I'll give her a few days off.

584
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,060
Don't tell her.

585
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:15,490
Just go to the court and apply for a change of lawyer.

586
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,250
Okay.

587
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,310
Mr. Han.

588
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,540
Well,

589
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,710
should we inform the court

590
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,310
of the witnesses appearing?

591
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:26,130
No.

592
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,220
Won't they accuse us of not notifying them first?

593
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,690
Wealth comes from danger.

594
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,310
I know the judge.

595
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,560
With such important evidence,

596
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:36,910
he won't blame us.

597
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,270
By the way,

598
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,040
call a few media outlets

599
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,970
and have them attend the trial tomorrow.

600
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,350
Notify the media?

601
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,830
Is it appropriate?

602
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,640
Of course.

603
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,640
What's not appropriate about it?

604
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,960
Qiu Hua, let me tell you.

605
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,990
We need a reason for a case.

606
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,310
We don't make money in this case.

607
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,270
If we can't get either money or reputation,

608
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,710
why should we do it?

609
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,550
Got it.

614
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,220
Why didn't you wake me up after I slept for so long?

615
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,030
I went to you.

616
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,900
I knocked on the door for a long time, but you didn't respond.

617
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,190

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:10,290
Move.

747
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:17,050
The trial of Wang Dafu's intentional homicide case is now in session.

748
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,680
Wang Dafu, the defendant,

749
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,660
[Defendant]

750
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,470
is charged with the crime of intentional homicide under Article 195(3) of the Criminal Law.

751
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,430
He shall bear the criminal responsibility

752
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,130
for the unlawful deprivation

753
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:25,660
of another person's life.

754
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,450
[Jingbei Court]

755
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,250
It has also been confirmed by witness Mr. Liu

756
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,670
that on the day

757
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,480
of the incident,

758
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,640
he was returning from a funeral in a neighboring village.

759
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,020
The host paid him more than agreed upon before he came back,

760
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,060
so he played a song with suona,

761
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:07,030
which was the same song that my client heard at the time of the incident,

762
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,670
"Carrying the Bridal Sedan."

763
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,190
It was around 4 p.m.

764
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,030
Both of the two witnesses can testify

765
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,690
that it was impossible for my client, Wang Dafu,

766
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:17,460
to be present at the scene

767
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,400
during the time of the incident.

768
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:24,150
After analyzing the testimonies of the witnesses,

769
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:27,810
[Xue Xiaofeng, Lawyer of Dazheng Law Firm]

770
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,750
we've found that my client, Wang Dafu,

771
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,320
had a solid alibi for the time of the incident,

772
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,409
and there was no opportunity for him

773
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,550
to be present at the scene.

774
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:35,989
In summary,

775
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:38,070
at the time of the incident,

776
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,550
he was located more than 60 kilometers away from the crime scene

777
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,389
and did not have the opportunity

778
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:45,130
to commit the alleged murder.

779
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,469
Therefore,

780
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:48,750
Wang Dafu is innocent.

781
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,340
I hope the court can find out the truth

782
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,790
and clear the defendant Wang Dafu's name.

783
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,710
Thank you, Your Honor, and the jury.

784
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,100
Han Zhitong, lawyer of the defendant.

785
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,780
Qiu Hua, intern lawyer.

786
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,610
Silly girl.

787
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,620
Due to the seriousness of the case,

788
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:31,280
the court allows witnesses to testify in court.

789
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:34,190
[Agent]

790
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,470
Thank you.

791
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,900
Witness.

792
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:46,150
You mentioned that you were repairing a car by the roadside

793
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,670
and had an encounter with the defendant on a certain day last year.

794
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,150
You were complete strangers,

795
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,750
and you had never met before.

796
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,320
You spoke a few words to a stranger over a year ago,

797
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,380
but you remembered the time clearly.

798
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,800
Can you explain it?

799
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:00,010
Actually, I don't remember the exact time.

800
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,620
There happened to be something wrong with my car that day.

801
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:05,310
I was fixing it outside.

802
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,970
It took almost two hours.

803
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,150
I had to explain the situation when I got back,

804
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,680
so I just made a note on the attendance record.

805
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:14,110
I just found the date in the attendance record.

806
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,110
It can't be wrong.

807
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,630
How long did you talk for?

808
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,990
Not long.

809
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,430
I was fixing the car underneath.

810
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:21,630
Sir.

811
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:22,940
Can you do me a favor?

812
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,940
Can you pass that wrench over there?

813
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,240
Is it this one?

814
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,750
Yes, that's it.

815
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:29,840
Thank you.

816
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,280
After I crawled out from under the car,

817
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,510
we smoked together.

818
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,100
It was just a cigarette's worth of time.

819
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:39,460
So, you're saying that you had a conversation with a stranger,

820
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,350
lasting the duration of one cigarette, one year ago.

821
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,670
Are you absolutely certain

822
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,140
that it is the same person who is sitting in the defendant's seat?

823
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,770
Are you so sure

824
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,090
about your memory?

825
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,480
He had a mole

826
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,540
on his face.

827
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,940
I remember it clearly.

828
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,350
Besides, he had a funny way of speaking.

829
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,110
Sir.

830
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,900
What happened to your face?

831
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,810
Who scratched it?

832
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,710
It's actually a tattoo, but it wasn't done properly.

833
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,920
You're quite funny.

834
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,830
When he was lighting my cigarette,

835
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,050
he used his left hand.

836
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:16,750
I remember

837
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,150
that his left thumb had a fungal infection.

838
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:20,350
That's why

839
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,970
I didn't want to take the cigarette he offered.

840
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,910
Just check if he has a fungal infection on his left thumb.

841
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,920
If it's there, it's definitely him.

842
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:45,190
Silence!

843
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,620
Order!

844
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,090
The witness may now leave the courtroom.

845
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,340
Your Honor.

846
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,430
In light of the new evidence in this case,

847
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:00,710
we need further investigation.

848
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,710
I suggest a temporary adjournment.

849
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,940
Given the major changes in this case,

850
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,320
the court is adjourned.

851
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,860
This court is adjourned.

852
00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:23,790
Mr. Xue.

853
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,670
What does this mean?

854
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,330
Are they saying my sister wasn't killed by him?

855
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,680
Now the court is adjourned.

856
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,900
The case is not over yet.

857
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,270
Why is it different

858
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,190
than what you said before?

859
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,000
Right.

860
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,890
You two go back first.

861
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,150
Let me meet the judge with Mr. Chen first, alright?

862
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,880
Just go back.

863
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,600
Mr. Xue, you must tell the judge.

864
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,870
My sister can't have died in vain.

865
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:40,490
Of course, I will.

866
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:41,010
Madam.

867
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,240
Don't worry.

868
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,390
Thank you.

869
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,530
No problem.

870
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:47,950
I'm sure that Wang Dafu will be declared not guilty

871
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,500
next time during the trial.

872
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,500
How will you explain this to the couple then?

873
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,990
If Wang Dafu is found not guilty, then the case will end.

874
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:55,650
This 20,000 yuan is easy, huh?

875
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:58,520
We still have 14,000 yuan left.

876
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,780
You'll get 20%, 2,800.

877
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,770
I'll give it to you after the deal is closed.

878
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:02,320
Mr. Han.

879
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,260
Do you only care about money?

880
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:10,480
Now that the murderer is gone,

881
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,190
and we can't win over the civil compensation.

882
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,990
You want the couple to pay 20,000 yuan.

883
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,110
Do you think they'll accept that?

884
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,240
I've done everything I could.

885
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,000
You've also come to support.

886
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,400
Put anything else aside,

887
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,590
do you think they understand the spirit of a contract?

888
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,470
I do.

889
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,830
Once you have received the service, no return of the money.

890
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,600
Good for you.

891
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,310
Today, the closely watched trial of Wang Dafu

892
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,910
for intentional homicide

893
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,600
has officially started

894
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,410
in the Jingbei City People's Court.

895
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,010
Wang Dafu's lawyer

896
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,270
submitted...

897
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,850
Intern lawyer Luo.

898
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,070
Congratulations.

899
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,040
You're really amazing.

900
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,220
Congratulations for what?

901
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,440
If we hadn't found the alibi evidence,

902
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,530
would you be busy counting money now?

903
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,330
I heard you wanted 500,000 yuan.

904
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,430
How much can you get from 500,000 yuan?

905
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:52,360
Don't you feel guilty making money off this tragedy?

906
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,270
Your achievement has been stolen,

907
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,790
so you're taking it out on me, right?

908
00:39:55,790 --> 00:39:56,870
I've also suffered losses,

909
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,110
and I haven't asked you for anything yet.

910
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,080
What losses have you incurred?

911
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,270
What losses?

912
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,070
This case should have been concluded today,

913
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:02,950
but it hasn't.

914
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,190
So I'll have to come here several more times.

915
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,750
It'll take up a lot of my time,

916
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,350
which is a loss.

917
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,910
Go away.

918
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,330
I don't want to talk to a money-lover like you.

919
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,330
It's disgusting.

920
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,900
You're dressed so decently.

921
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,850
How can you be so uncivil in your speech?

922
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,610
Vent your anger at your teacher, Han Zhitong.

923
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
I'm gonna go, Xue.

924
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:28,750
Mr. Han.

925
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:29,630
Regarding the outlook for this case,

926
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,030
do you have any comments?

927
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,950
My client has

928
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:38,190
an undeniable and unquestionable alibi.

929
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,190
Mr. Han. I heard this is a pro bono case.

930
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,110
You worked so hard

931
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,360
for a pro bono case?

932
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:43,670
Yes.

933
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,170
This is a pro bono case.

934
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,090
In other words,

935
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,590
I didn't charge a penny on this case.

936
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:50,350
You're stepping on my toes and fishing for compliments.

937
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,550
You're so shameless.

938
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,470
First of all, I didn't fish for compliments.

939
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:57,730
I contributed more to this case than you.

940
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,410
Second of all, Mr. Han asked me to come along.

941
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:00,290
I had to come.

942
00:41:00,910 --> 00:41:01,990
When he asked me to be the lawyer,

943
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,910
I called you,

944
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,470
but you didn't answer the phone.

945
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,870
You can check your phone.

946
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,640
As for how you want to think about it, it's up to you.

947
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,520
I'm sorry, Ms. Qiu.

948
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,240
I didn't mean to target you.

949
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,190
It's okay.

950
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,720
I have my car with me.

951
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,960
I can give you a ride.

952
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:13,870
It's okay.

953
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,370
I'll ride a shared bike.

954
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,870
What else do you want?

955
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,870
I don't want anything. It's just...

956
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,990
Without me,

957
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:33,510
he wouldn't have made it.

958
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,630
Wang Dafu

959
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,490
may have been sentenced to death.

960
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:38,950
But when it came to appearing in court,

961
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,790
he just hid it from me

962
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,830
and got rid of me.

963
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,650
How could he be so shameless?

964
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:46,590
You're still an intern lawyer.

965
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:49,990
You don't have the qualifications to go to court alone.

966
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:51,150
From a procedural perspective,

967
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,630
he did nothing wrong.

968
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,460
What else do you want?

969
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,930
You were in a dilemma,

970
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,380
and you insisted on investigating this case.

971
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,180
Why?

972
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,390
Was it for fame?

973
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,470
Ms. Mei.

974
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,550
I don't mind if you scold me.

975
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,680
In fact, I kind of meant it that way.

976
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,250
The more trapped I felt,

977
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:18,110
the more I wanted to find a good case

978
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,270
to prove myself.

979
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,070
I'm just that selfish.

980
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:22,930
Well, it turns out that

981
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,720
I still haven't made a name for myself,

982
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,660
so I got annoyed.

983
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,630
You won't make significant progress in your legal career

984
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,820
if you're constantly distracted by other matters.

985
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,620
Well…

986
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,700
I just hope I can transition to a practicing lawyer.

987
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,310
By the way,

988
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,350
a few days ago,

989
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:46,710
Mr. Han told us about you.

990
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,710
What happened back then?

991
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,350
Someone hoped we'd fail.
