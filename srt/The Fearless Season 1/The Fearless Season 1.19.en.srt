[Tian Yuru, Vice Chair of Weida Group]

6
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,620
I heard

7
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,850
you fell at the entrance of the law firm.

8
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,850
Why were you even at a law firm?

9
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,020
What happened?

10
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,910
It’s a family matter.

11
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,080
Our place is currently under redevelopment,

12
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,470
and there's an issue with the compensation for our house and land.

13
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,600
My family called me,

14
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,750
and I was not sure about the details,

15
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,350
so I went to consult a lawyer.

16
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,760
You've got a good sense of the law.

17
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,940
Have some tea.

18
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,830
Is your leg still hurting?

19
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,990
Have you seen a doctor? What did the doctor say?

20
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,990
Is your bone okay?

21
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,120
No major issues.

22
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,550
I just can’t walk very well.

23
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,550
Ms. Tian, sorry for delaying the work.

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,670
Work is important, but your health is more important.

25
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,930
Take care of yourself.

26
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,720
Don’t worry.

27
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,650
Is everything going well at work?

28
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,350
Is there anything

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,150
between you and Mr. Yang?

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,579
No.

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,110
You were chosen by me,

32
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,760
so I trust you.

33
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,510
I don’t consider you as an outsider.

34
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,040
I hope you feel the same way.

35
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,100
Whether it’s at work or in life,

36
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,440
you can tell me if you have any problems.

37
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:01,290
Is there anything going on

38
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,420
between you and Mr. Yang?

39
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,990
No, there’s nothing.

40
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,750
Really?

41
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,290
That’s a relief.

42
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,110
I thought

43
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,910
you deliberately hurt yourself

44
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,540
to avoid going on a business trip with him.

45
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,000
No, not at all.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,270
You and Mr. Yang have both treated me well and kept mentoring me.

47
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:29,730
I'm eager for such learning opportunities.

48
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,030
I'll give you another chance

49
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,550
to tell the truth.

50
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,310
I hate being lied to.

51
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,440
If you hide something from me

52
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,579
and I find out later,

53
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,070
the consequences will be severe.

54
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,130
Do you understand?

55
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,740
I understand, Ms. Tian,

56
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,340
but there's really nothing.

57
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,390
Okay.

58
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,270
Come here.

59
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,890
I want to show you something.

60
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,620
Can you see it clearly?

61
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,270
Do you want to explain it?

62
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,780
Sorry, Ms. Tian.

63
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,000
Maybe I really didn't dare to tell the truth.

64
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,270
So…

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,440
He asked me to accompany him on a business trip,

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,340
so I deliberately hurt myself.

67
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:06,170
But I’m just someone who came to the city to work.

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,570
What else could I do?

69
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,560
Don’t make yourself

70
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,590
sound so pitiful.

71
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,140
You were chosen by me.

72
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,150
Do you remember what I told you

73
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,230
when you joined the company?

74
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,710
You...

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,320
You told me

76
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,340
to take care of the boss.

77
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,870
What else?

78
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,020
And...

79
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,390
And what?

80
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,050
Don’t wear short sleeves or skirts to work.

81
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,810
Did I not mention that?

82
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,690
Did you listen?

83
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:06,910
Ms. Tian.

84
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,850
You can’t say that I seduced him

85
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,910
only because I wore short sleeves and skirts.

86
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,230
I...

87
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,550
I...

88
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,350
I really had no choice.

89
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,520
That’s why I went to see a lawyer.

90
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,040
So what was your real purpose in finding a lawyer?

91
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,660
I didn’t do anything else.

92
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,810
I just

93
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:30,820
asked about

94
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,980
how to deal with this kind of workplace harassment.

95
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,659
Workplace harassment?

96
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,040
Workplace harassment.

97
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,790
You want to sue him?

98
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,880
Do you think you can win?

99
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,720
If you had behaved yourself,

100
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,280
would things like this have happened?

101
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
Besides,

102
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,990
before you did this,

103
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,230
did you consider the company’s interests at all?

104
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,790
Did you?

105
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,270
Ms. Tian.

106
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,110
I...

107
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,280
What else could I do?

108
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,650
There are many ways,

109
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,900
but you chose the stupidest one.

110
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,420
I can't guarantee your position anymore.

111
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,590
Go to the finance department and get your salary.

112
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:34,390
Leave the work to Tian.

113
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:35,090
Ms. Tian.

114
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,710
You're fired.

115
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,320
Sorry

116
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:52,150
for asking you out with short notice.

117
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,470
The directors are having a lunch gathering

118
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,980
to discuss the issue of you two taking our case.

Please wait here.

120
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:59,920
Everyone has seen the presentation you made.

121
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,040
It's clear how you pointed out the areas

122
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,820
where the other party infringed on our patents,

123
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,400
even better than we did.

124
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:04,790
Right?

125
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:07,090
I believe the directors will understand it very clearly after seeing it.

126
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:08,380
There will be results soon.

127
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,670
Please wait a moment and have some tea.

128
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:10,550
Pour some tea.

129
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,570
Have a seat.

130
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll be back soon.

131
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,030
Let's just wait.

132
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,910
I can't believe it.

133
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,710
We’ve only taken on big cases since we started.

134
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,800
Does that mean

135
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,630
we were born to be great lawyers?

136
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,350
You're bragging again.

137
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,340
We haven’t taken on a single case yet,

138
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,470
and you're already bragging

139
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,190
and daydreaming about the future.

140
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,070
First, you have to dare to dream.

141
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm really impressed by you.

142
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,830
You can think positively about everything.

143
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,110

Look who it is.

00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,360
Unscrupulous Chen.

149
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:55,730
Why is he calling me?

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,310
Hello.

152
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,990
Not too bad.

153
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:05,440
You admitted you're Unscrupulous Chen.

154
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,190
It seems you know your place.

155
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,320
Okay, cut to the chase. What do you want?

156
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,070
Let me tell you, don't bother me if it's not urgent.

157
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:14,130
As a lawyer, I’m not easy to mess with.

158
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,410
What?

159
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,030
Yes, I'm interested.

160
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,830
Isn’t it a trial in Hebei?

161
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,560
What about the food and accommodation expenses?

162
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,070
Cut the crap.

163
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,390
Of course, it's on you.

164
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
You want us to look up to you.

165
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,810
If it's not on you, then who will pay for it?

166
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,230
Fine.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,940

per person per meal.

173

Oh, and there's also the loss of wages,

Deal.

178
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,330
I can't believe he actually called himself Unscrupulous Chen.

179
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:01,530
It means he’s not completely useless.

180
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,100
Right.

181
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:02,890
He said that

182
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,330
his case with Mr. Wei

183
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,560
is about to go to court

184
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,510
and invited us to be spectators.

185
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,490
Let’s see how he beats up that Han.

186
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,710
Are you going or not?

187
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,870
He must be using our litigation strategy, right?

188
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,420
Of course it's our strategy.

189
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,330
What else can he come up with?

190
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,100
What else does he have

191
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,830
apart from his bad intentions?

192
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,270
Let’s go and see.

193
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,610
Really, I can’t wait to see that.

194
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,250
Both sides are bad people, and now they're fighting.

195
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,050
Besides, the pay is pretty good.

196
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,590
I'm good. You can go.

197
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:35,590
I don’t have time to watch other people fight.

198
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,170
We still have a lot of things to do.

199
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,230
Qiu Hua, I have to tell you something.

200
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,180
Life isn't just about the immediate struggle.

201
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
It also involves poetry and gossip.

202
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,560
I’m telling you.

203
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,640
No gossip, no life.

204
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,020
I’ll die if I can't be there.

205
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,190
Do you want me to die?

206
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,650
No.

207
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,760
He's coming.

208
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,660
Look.

209
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:00,970
What did I say?

210
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,810
The whole company unanimously agreed

211
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,340
to let you handle our case.

212
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,470
Besides,

213
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,850
starting from next year,

214
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,010
we'll hire you two

215
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,000
as our company’s legal consultants.

216
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,070
Thank you so much, Mr. Dong. Thank you.

217
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,000
You're welcome.

218
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,460
Well, Mr. Dong.

219
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,120
We’ll go back and report first,

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,710
and then we can sign the agency agreement

221
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:21,770
with your company.

222
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,160
Good, I’ll leave it to you.

223
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,850
No problem.

224
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:45,840
Guo Yu.

225
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,600
Ms. Qiu.

226
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,450
Have a seat.

227
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,610
Sit please.

228
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,180
Ms. Qiu.

229
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,970
I want to file a lawsuit.

230
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,370
Have a seat.

231
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,170
No hurry. Sit down.

232
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,970
Sit down and take your time.

233
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,220
Here, have some water.

234
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,360
What’s going on?

235
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:09,830
What made

236
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:12,170
you want to file a lawsuit again?

237
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,830
I was fired.

238
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,330
Yang Weida's wife,

239
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,270
also Vice Chair Tian at our company,

240
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,810
already had evidence.

241
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,820
She showed me the evidence today.

242
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,110
She insisted that I seduced Yang Weida,

243
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,230
and she didn’t even let me explain.

244
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,490
Then she just fired me.

245
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,850
What evidence does she have?

246
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,350
A surveillance video.

247
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,230
You mean Mrs. Yang

248
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,430
has a video of Yang Weida harassing you?

249
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,390
Where was this video recorded?

250
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,050
Right in Yang Weida’s office.

251
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,640
Besides,

252
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,460
even in that video,

253
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,800
she can clearly see

254
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,750
that it was Yang Weida harassing me.

255
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,680
I was pushing him away and dodging,

256
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,710
but she insisted it was my fault,

257
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,710
saying I shouldn't wear short sleeves

258
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,670
or skirts to seduce Yang Weida.

259
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:58,230
And then she fired me.

260
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:04,190
When was this video taken?

261
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,880
Do you know?

262
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,480
From the time stamp on the video,

263
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,450
it was at least three months ago.

264
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,020
Guo Yu, sit here for a while.

265
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,900
I’m going to talk to Ms. Luo.

266
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,250
I'll come to you later.

267
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,230
Her husband

268
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,560
harassed a girl who just started working,

269
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,200
and then blamed that girl

270
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,400
for dressing inappropriately

271
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,590
to seduce her husband.

272
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,280
How could she be so shameless?

273
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,510
Doesn’t she know how old her husband is?

274
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,870
Is Guo Yu still here?

275
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,470
She's in the reception room.

276
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,130
So what does she want to do now?

277
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,360
She still wants to file a lawsuit.

278
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,040
She insists on suing for sexual harassment.

279
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,590
Suing for sexual harassment?

280
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,350
How can we sue without evidence?

281
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,110
Yeah.

282
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,720
Besides,

283
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,610
Mrs. Yang won't give that video to Guo Yu.

284
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,270
After all, she's Yang Weida's wife.

285
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,150
You just said

286
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,470
they fired Guo Yu.

287
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,420
Labor dispute?

288
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,590
Yes.

289
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,160
You must have signed a labor contract

290
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,710
with their company, right?

291
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,870
After the probation period,

292
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,750
the company signed a three-year labor contract with us.

293
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,030
It’s not even two years yet.

294
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,070
So, they can’t just

295
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,800
terminate your labor contract

296
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,830
without a reason.

297
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,430
Therefore, we'll file a labor dispute.

298
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,000
The chances of winning are relatively higher

299
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,130
through labor arbitration.

300
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,230
But Ms. Tian has that video.

301
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,600
Don't worry about that for now.

302
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,110
I think

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,530
she might have more than one video in her hand,

304
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,110
but she won’t use this

305
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,240
as a reason to terminate the contract.

306
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,060
If she has any reason,

307
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,590
it would probably be

308
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,960
the negligence of your duties,

309
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,670
absenteeism, tardiness, and the like.

310
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,400
I…

311
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:09,560
I have been awarded the title of an outstanding employee in the past two years.

312
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,710
I only took three days off

313
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,930
due to the leg injury.

314
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,360
But she’s the boss, right?

315
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,230
So,

316
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,870
arbitration Is more advantageous for you.

317
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,140
We are lawyers.

318
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,310
We have to responsibly analyze the legal pros and cons

319
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,830
for you.

320
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:28,770
So now the priority for us is to keep your job.

321
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,170
As for the rest,

322
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,010
we’ll figure it out later.

323
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,240
Guo Yu.

324
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,990
You don’t have income now.

325
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,750
If you can't find a new job,

326
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,020
you can’t stay in this city, right?

327
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:08,750
Alright,

328
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,950
then let's file a labor dispute.

329
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,750
Okay.

330
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,510
Tomorrow, I’ll have to trouble you to come to the office again.

331
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,480
Let’s sign this agency agreement.

332
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,790
Then we’ll apply for arbitration.

333
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,050
I'm gonna go.

334
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:24,830
Okay.

335
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,830
Let me see you off.

336
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,510
Be careful.

337
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,790
Let me walk you out.

338
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,470
Well...

339
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,430
It's sort of settled.

340
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,790
We've tried our best

341
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,650
to protect her right.

342
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,890
Maybe.

343
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,849
Why? Ms. Luo. Ms. Qiu.

344
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,950
What do you mean?

345
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,119
Why was I harassed?

346
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,010
and I can't say anything about it?

347
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Why do I have to act like nothing happened

348
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,480
when something clearly did?

349
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,560
Why did I suffer harassment and obscenity,

350
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,280
and then get fired,

351
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,530
but I can only file a labor dispute?

352
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:42,040
Why is that?

353
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,390
Because we have no evidence.

354
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,900
I am the evidence.

355
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,940
I'm standing right in front of you.

356
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,430
Guo Yu.

357
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:54,900
Lawsuits require evidence.

358
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,910
We can’t stand in front of the judge and say…

359
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,040
Let me finish.

360
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:01,870
Have you thought about what I've been through this past year?

361
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,120
Because of him,

362
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:06,120
I’ve lost more than 5 kilograms this year.

363
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,920
Because of him,

364
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,910
I often couldn’t sleep at night and had nightmares.

365
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,150
Because of him, I dared not have a boyfriend.

366
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,900
I dared not go out at night.

367
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,840
I dared not answer the phone.

368
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:17,810
Because of him,

369
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:19,670
I had to

370
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,790
roll down a staircase from a dozen floors high

371
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,550
to hurt my leg.

372
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,550
And because of him,

373
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,250
I had to endure humiliation from his wife

374
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,690
and lost my job.

375
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,430
He was the one who did wrong,

376
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,400
but why

377
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,710
do I have to bear all the consequences

378
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,860
and still can’t say anything about it?

379
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,260
Guo Yu.

380
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,450
Well,

381
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,460
have a seat and calm down.

382
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,470
Let's talk it over.

383
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,190
Ms. Luo.

384
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,780
I'd rather lose but still want to file a sexual harassment lawsuit.

385
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,290
Even if I lose in the end,

386
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,120
I want everyone to know

387
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,010
what kind of person Yang Weida is.

388
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,310
He has a human face with a beast's heart.

389
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,630
I want all the other girls

390
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,830
to be cautious of him.

391
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,990
If worst comes to worst,

392
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,400
after the lawsuit, I’ll go back to my hometown.

393
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,860
If I can't stay in Jingbei, I won't stay then.

394
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,930
Let me get you some water.

395
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,920
Guo Yu.

396
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,150
Have some water.

397
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,310
Take a break.

398
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,180
I’ll talk to Ms. Qiu alone for a moment.

399
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,600
You take a break first.

400
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,380
Qiu Hua.

401
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:43,750
Well...

402
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:45,630
about the patent case,

403
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,480
we're about to sign it,

404
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:49,950
and there's a lot of work on that end.

405
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,030
How about we divide the work?

406
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,560
You handle that,

407
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,280
and I'll take care of this.

408
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,340
You think I can't handle this case?

409
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,550
We should work on it together.

410
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:06,270
Guo Yu.

411
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:08,430
We are your lawyers.

412
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,990
We will definitely consider your best interests.

413
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,330
The plan we've designed for you

414
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:12,730
is undoubtedly the best.

415
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,230
Of course,

416
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,230
we must also respect your decision.

417
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,840
We just want to know

418
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,550
if you've made up your mind.

419
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,150
Yes, I’ve made up my mind.

420
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,870
Let me remind you again.

421
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,480
Given the current situation,

422
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,320
all the evidence is likely in Mrs. Yang's hands.

423
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,330
Mrs. Yang and Yang Weida

424
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,210
are a common interest entity.

425
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,470
She might use this evidence

426
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,150
to control Yang Weida

427
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,470
and drive away the girls around him,

428
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,150
but she definitely won’t

429
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,690
provide the evidence to the victim

430
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,140
to accuse Yang Weida.

431
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,010
You must know this.

432
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,240
So what we are facing

433
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,480
is a lawsuit we will likely lose.

434
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,810
If that's the case,

435
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,930
you still insist on suing, right?

436
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,070
Yes.

437
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,450
Otherwise, I'd lose respect for myself.

438
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,030
Alright.

439
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,780
You can go back now

440
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,270
and think it over tonight.

441
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,160
If by tomorrow,

442
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,780
you’re still so determined,

443
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:26,040
then...

444
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,110
Then come over

445
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,420
to sign the agreement.

446
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,640
I have a bit of a headache.

447
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,170
I want to go to the hospital.

448
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,170
Have you been harassed by Han?

449
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,810
Why did you hide it?

450
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:03,250
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,670
Why didn't you leave him?

452
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:09,990
Do you know that many people

453
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,470
know these things?

454
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,050
Do you know what they say about you?

455
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,060
Of course I know.

456
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,230
Then why?

457
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:23,510
Yingzi.

458
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,790
Do you trust me?

459
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,690
Do you also think there's something between him and me?

460
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,530
I trust you.

461
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,670
Of course I trust you.

462
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:32,730
But what's the use of me trusting you?

463
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,720
He harassed you,

464
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,650
and you still won’t leave him.

465
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,590
Can you shut out the gossip?

466
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,950
What do you want me to do?

467
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,820
Didn't I move out?

468
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,190
I know how to protect myself.

469
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,960
He can't take advantage of me.

470
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,240
What do you mean?

471
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:57,490
So you were harassed for nothing, right?

472
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,300
What do you want me to do?

473
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,470
You saw what Guo Yu did.

474
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,220
Sue him.

475
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,400
Even Guo Yu has made up her mind to sue.

476
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:05,230
Can she win?

477
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:08,960
What are the odds of winning for this kind of case?

478
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,250
Do you think I want to put up with it?

479
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,390
What else can I do?

480
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,510
Forget it.

481
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,190
After all, it's my own business.

482
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,310
It has nothing to do with you.

483
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,790
Why not?

484
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:24,990
Am I not your friend?

485
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,190
Am I not your partner?

486
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,390
How can I turn a blind eye

487
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:29,120
and pretend nothing happened?

488
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,950
Do you really think I'm your friend?

489
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,360
Of course.

490
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,910
Isn't it clear?

491
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,660
You are my friend and comrade.

492
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,470
Thank you.

493
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,000

00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:53,920
♫In the middle of nowhere♫

564
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,630
Yingzi.

565
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,750
♫I thought we could be together forever♫

566
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,230
I really admire you.

567
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,580
♫But it turns out to be just a passing♫

568
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:01,190
You can always be so optimistic about everything,

569
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,150
not like me.

570
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,270
Before making any decision,

571
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,510
I always think back and forth.

572
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,650
♫Only the kite is missed♫

573
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,630
I can't afford such a huge cost.

574
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,030
♫Trapped at the starting point♫

575
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:15,270
♫If I were a bird♫

576
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,390
So you

577
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:16,650
still want to keep silent on this matter?

578
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:21,270
♫I wouldn't be afraid of distance♫

579
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,020
What should I do then?

580
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,610
Report him,

581
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,230
risk my own reputation

582
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,170
♫The wind blows♫

583
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:26,090
to have him detained for a few days and apologize to me in public,

584
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,610
♫And I'll leave♫

585
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,970
and then justice is realized?

586
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,260
Have you thought about what will happen to me next?

587
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:32,860
♫In the long night, find a pure white wave♫

588
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,120
Who would dare to hire someone

589
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:41,440
♫In the long night, find a pure white wave♫

590
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,680
who reports her own mentor?

591
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,090
Which one of us will suffer more?

592
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,950
♫That future♫

593
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,890
"To kill one thousand enemy soldiers while one loses eight hundred soldiers."

594
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:50,420
♫Farewell♫

595
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,920
Is such a tragic victory a victory?

596
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:58,750
♫There'll be something amazing waiting for me♫

597
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,160
Those who insult me

598
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,990
or hurt me,

599
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,590
I will make him pay a real price.

600
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,620
♫The wind blows♫

601
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,360
Forget it.

602
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,050
♫And I'll leave♫

603
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,010
Neither of us should talk about it anymore.

604
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,700
But Qiu Hua, you have to remember,

605
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,310
♫Fly to the deep sea♫

606
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,600
I am your friend.

607
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,350
You're not alone.

608
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:32,880
♫In the long night, find a pure white wave♫

609
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:30,790
Thank you.

610
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,440
Come on.

611
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,680
I feel so wronged for you.

612
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,400
♫That future♫

613
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:41,870
♫Farewell♫

614
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:50,200
♫I see someone waiting in the light♫

615
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:59,950
♫I see someone waiting in the light♫

616
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:08,880
The logic is okay,

617
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,920
but it's too long.

618
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,920
Do you think the judge has so much time

619
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,380
to listen to your emotional speech in court?

620
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:18,920
Have you watched too many foreign movies?

621
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,030
You think the foreign lawyers look pretty cool

622
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,990
striding around in court, right?

623
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,430
They have a jury.

624
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,030
The members of the jury don’t understand the law,

625
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,360
so emotional appeal is very important to them.

626
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,810
What we're facing is the judge.

627
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,220
As soon as you get emotional,

628
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,300
the Judge can tell you're acting.

629
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,080
It might even leave a bad impression.

630
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,510
That makes sense.

631
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,660
Delete all these useless things.

632
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,980
Okay.

633
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:45,160
Just keep the facts, evidence, and defense points.

634
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,940
Okay.

635
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,680
Mr. Han.

636
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,160
About that Tongren Road and Bridge case,

637
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,110
can you take me with you?

638
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,570
You think they're generous about the pay, huh?

639
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,570
No, not like that.

640
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,960
I basically don't make much money from taking this case.

641
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,910
It's not about money.

642
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,420
Mainly for experience.

643
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,380
Take me with you, please.

644
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,030
Focus on the cases at hand first.

645
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:18,970
Okay.

646
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,040
Mr. Han.

647
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,540
Qiu Hua and Luo Yingzi seem to have taken on a new case.

648
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:37,230
It seems to be

649
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,520
a sexual harassment case.

650
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,930
Sexual harassment?

651
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:48,630
Got it.

652
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,160
Well, you're interested

653
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,210
in that Tongren Road and Bridge case, huh?

654
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:55,800
Yes.

655
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:58,890
I'm short of an assistant anyway.

656
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,530
Alright, go for it.

657
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,900
Thank you, Mr. Han.

658
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,360
I'm gonna go back to work.

659
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,140
Your future is guaranteed by me.

660
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,900
Does she want to take this case?

661
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,690
Tao.

662
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,420
Mr. Han.

663
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:29,880
Tao.

664
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,720
Do you still review cases

665
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,550
for newly practicing lawyers?

666
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,040
Of course.

667
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,040
Otherwise, last time,

668
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,960
why didn't it work out

669
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:44,290
when Xiao Luo and her team wanted the Tongren Road and Bridge case?

670
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,930
But now, they've taken a sexual harassment case.

671
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,770
Have you reviewed it?

672
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,800
They told me about that.

673
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,870
There's no conflict of interest

674
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,310
in that case,

675
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,320
but personally,

676
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,800
I suggest not taking it.

677
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,600
You have to insist on this.

678
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,180
Young people nowadays,

679
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,800
once they start practicing, they're not the same.

680
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,800
I have a pile of cases on my plate now.

681
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,800
I wish I could split a day into two.

682
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,170
But for them,

683
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,210
once they start practicing, they won't take the cases I assign.

684
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,870
Instead, they chase cases like this

685
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,940
—tangling with a ten-thousand-buck case they can't win.

686
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
What's the point?

687
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,900
Chasing clout, of course.

688
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,980
They've got a bit of a name now,

689
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,870
but the client lost both reputation and the lawsuit.

690
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,800
That's not what lawyers should do.

691
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:29,470
They just came to let me know.

692
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,070
I'm not clear about the details.

693
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,060
I'll look into it and then decide.

694
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,220
Okay, I'll wait for your update.

695
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,050
Alright then.

696
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,450
Pull.

697
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,910
Han just came to see me.

698
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,720
He talked for a while.

699
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,140
The implication was pretty clear

700
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,000
—he doesn't want those two

701
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,160
to take on the sexual harassment case.

702
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,520
He's worried that if Qiu Hua handles a sexual harassment case

703
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,450
and gains experience and courage,

704
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,060
she might turn around and use it against him.

705
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:10,230
Be careful not to mention this when you're out and about.

706
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,700
If the law firm gets wind of such a scandal,

707
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,560
it won't be fun.

708
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,070
As for this case,

709
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
I also don't want them to take it,

710
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,210
but these young girls

711
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,510
seem determined.

712
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,180
They're just too naïve.

713
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,360
Being a lawyer

714
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,940
isn't just about passion.

715
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,370
I need to find an opportunity to talk to them.

716
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:43,750
Mr. Tao.

717
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:44,870
You want to see me?

718
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,710
We've taken on another case,

719
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,770
and the pay is good.

720
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,400
What case is it?

721
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,630
Come in. Let's discuss.

722
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,910
It's a patent case.

723
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,780
What matters is

724
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,470
the client said if we win this lawsuit,

725
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,750
they'll hand over the company's legal affairs to us,

726
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,750
bringing in a stable income of 600,000 yuan annually.

727
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,990
How big is the target?

728
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,750
The target is in the tens of millions,

729
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,400
but our fees aren't that high.

730
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,640
We've discussed it.

731
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:08,920
We're both just starting,

732
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,310
and we don't want to bite off more than we can chew.

733
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,780
Playing it safe is better.

734
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,830
It's right that you think so.

735
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,930
How about this?

736
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,640
You guys go check with Wang.

737
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,230
As long as there is no conflict of interest,

738
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,230
you can sign the agreement.

739
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,510
Okay, thank you, Mr. Tao.

740
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,100
Wait.

741
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,390
I want to discuss about the case

742
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:27,390
you're handling.

743
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:28,510
Which one?

744
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,510
The sexual harassment case.

745
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,170
Have a seat.

746
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,990
We've talked it over.

747
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,750
We still don't recommend you pursue the sexual harassment case.

748
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,430
Why?

749
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,750
Have any of you heard of

750
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,320
who winning a sexual harassment case?

751
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,640
I know you're doing it for justice,

752
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,270
and it's good that young people have a sense of justice,

753
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,930
but you also need to be practical.

754
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:55,860
Can you win this?

755
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,710
We and the client

756
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,230
are prepared to lose.

757
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,830
Talking like that is irresponsible to the client.

758
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,470
Theoretically,

759
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,680
every lawyer has a 50%

760
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,510
or even higher chance of losing.

761
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,469
So, it's okay if you lose.

762
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,760
It's just a record of one loss.

763
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:15,739
But for the client,

764
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,620
losing

765
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,520
is like a second injury.

766
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,310
She might not realize it now,

767
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,219
but she'll understand how tough it is later.

768
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:22,949
By then,

769
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,239
you can move on to other cases,

770
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,900
but what about her?

771
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,830
Can she handle it?

772
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,030
I'm afraid not.

773
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,929
She doesn't know the stakes,

774
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,540
but you're lawyers,

775
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,860
and you should know.

776
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,960
I'll tell her

777
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:44,790
when she comes to sign the agreement.

778
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,560
Thank you.

779
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,470
Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu

780
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,070
have already reported your case

781
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,500
to the firm.

782
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:07,940
After careful consideration,

783
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,550
the firm suggests you go for labor arbitration

784
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,810
instead of suing for sexual harassment.

785
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:17,830
Why?

786
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:18,890
Ms. Guo,

787
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,710
I completely understand your grievances and anger.

788
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,010
We empathize with you.

789
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,070
However,

790
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,450
the more intense the situation is,

791
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,600
the more we need to stay calm

792
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,390
to avoid making wrong decisions

793
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,990
that could further harm you.

794
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:39,450
I heard from Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu

795
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,130
that you know this case might not win,

796
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,310
but you're determined to sue him,

797
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,930
hoping to make him pay the price of reputational destruction.

798
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:47,670
Is that right?

799
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,270
Yes.

800
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,870
I want everyone to know

801
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:51,730
what kind of person Yang Weida is,

802
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,470
and I want to prevent him

803
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,670
from doing such things to others again.

804
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:56,990
But have you ever thought that in the end,

805
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:58,150
the one facing reputational destruction

806
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,990
might not be him but you?

807
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,440
Think about it.

808
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,660
You were funded through university by Weida Foundation.

809
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,960
After graduation,

810
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,840
you went to work in Weida Group.

811
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,250
No, you're accusing him of sexual harassment,

812
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,680
but you can't produce any evidence.

813
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,740
How do you think the court will think?

814
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,470
Won't they say you're ungrateful

815
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,800
and counterattack you?

816
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:33,830
Fine.

817
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,430
You can say

818
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,630
you're willing to risk your reputation to bring him down,

819
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,600
but you can't bring him down

820
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,490
because you have no evidence.

821
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,770
On the flip side,

822
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,930
Yang Weida is a public figure.

823
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,860
Will he just defend himself

824
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,660
and keep getting hit passively?

825
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,630
I'm sure that

826
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,860
once your lawsuit goes south,

827
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,800
you'll immediately receive a subpoena.

828
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,340
Yang Weida will definitely sue you for infringing on his reputation rights.

829
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,770
He'll do it anyway

830
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,000
for his status,

831
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,680
family, foundation, and group.

832
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,890
He has evidence,

833
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,320
and it's public.

834
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:09,480
Since you baselessly accused him of sexual harassment,

835
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,860
causing a decrease in societal esteem,

836
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,810
you will likely lose the case.

837
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,240
He won't just ruin your reputation

838
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,410
but also make you pay financially

839
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,810
and potentially face criminal penalties.

840
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,170
Can you handle that?

841
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:38,040
But it's different when it comes to labor arbitration.

842
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,040
We have a strong assurance

843
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,550
that we will win.

844
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:52,290
But I don't want to work around him anymore.

845
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,780
No one is forcing you to continue working around him.

846
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,320
Labor arbitration is about

847
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,160
making the other party pay a high price

848
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,840
for their wrongdoing.

849
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,390
You can use that money

850
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,650
to support your family

851
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,870
or find another job in Jingbei

852
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,050
to start a new life.

853
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,170
Isn't that a good option?

854
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,340
Guo Yu, if you persist…

855
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,750
Ms. Guo,

856
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,270
there's a saying,

857
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,370
"Who hasn't encountered scum in this world?"

858
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,130
There are two ways to deal with scum.

859
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,270
The first

860
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,700
is to confront them head-on.

861
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,150
The best-case scenario

862
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,630
is mutual destruction,

863
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,410
and the most likely outcome

864
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:55,920
is having no place to bury the dead

865
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,980
because you can't out-scum the scum.

866
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,050
The second way

867
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,340
is to steer clear of scum from a distance.

868
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,600
You want to eliminate scum?

869
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,910
Scum can't be eliminated.

870
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,580
So, if that's the case,

871
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:10,820
avoiding them from afar

872
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,500
is the wisest choice,

873
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,560
especially when you've made them pay a price.

874
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,280
Of course,

875
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,160
the choice is yours.

876
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:21,390
Think about it carefully.

877
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,510
Okay,

878
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,030
let's go with labor arbitration.

879
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,090
It's so unfair.

880
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,590
It's so unfair.

881
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,300
Now you understand my frustration, right?

882
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,750
Yingzi.

883
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,500
I'm not afraid of you making fun of me.

884
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,690
Those three cases,

885
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,080
I must take them.

886
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,730
I must handle them.

887
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,670
If you won't, I will.

888
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:31,610
I understand.

889
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:33,330
Okay. I'll join you.

890
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:35,490
We can't let Han take advantage.

891
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,750
Since we're going for labor arbitration,

892
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,040
we need to figure out

893
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,740
how to make the other party pay an even greater price.

894
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:18,940
Is it unethical?

895
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,620
Clearly, I found a good place,

896
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,390
and he's there again.

897
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:24,980
Why are you everywhere?

898
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,350
Move.

899
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,190
Never.

900
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:39,320
You won't move?

901
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:41,120
Don't you believe I can crash your car?

902
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,800
Please.

903
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,180
Alright.

904
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,500
Alright. I'll leave.

905
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,400
What the…

906
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,610
This lady is really something.

907
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,800
The opposing counsel is him.

908
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,220
Flies seek filth.

909
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,210
How can he be absent from this?

910
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,100
Hello, Mr. Chen.

911
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,720
Hello.

912
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,230
Are there two lawyers to meet Mr. Yang?

913
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,420
Yes.

914
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,150
Find a way to stall them.

915
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,150
Just ten minutes.

916
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,140
Okay.
