[Episode 38]

4
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,000
Ms. Qiu, just tell me

5
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,350
what I can do for you?

6
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:37,030
Your appearance just now

7
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,660
is already helping me.

8
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,190
Oh, I see.

9
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,970
Let me remind you one more thing.

10
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,110
You'd better let her know

11
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,620
you have something on her.

12
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,600
In this way, before she wants to do something bad later,

13
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,050
she will think about it.

14
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,789
Okay, Ms. Qiu.

15
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,590
I will.

16
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
I don't care.

17
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,470
What you just said

18
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,530
is different from your collusion with Xu Jianshe.

19
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,630
You must give me the money today.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,080
Do you think it's easy to slander a lawyer?

21
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:22,329
You went to see Xu Jianshe

22
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,560
and taught him how to say, didn't you?

23
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,050
If the police find out

24
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,270
that it was you who instigated Xu Jianshe to make false testimony,

25
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,610
aren't you afraid of taking legal responsibility?

26
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,930
That's his business.

27
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:39,340
We have nothing to do with each other now.

28
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,120
Let's talk about something related to you.

29
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,400
Xu Jianshe has four properties under his name.

30
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,630
You've sold two of them.

31
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,150
The other two have been for sale online.

32
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,860
The price is 45,000 per square meter

33
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,330
and 60,000 per square meter respectively, right?

34
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,570
How did you know?

35
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,340
We know a lot more than that.

36
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,510
Pan Shengyi violated the discipline and helped you

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:28,150
let Xu Jianshe sign the power of attorney.

38
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,790
Do you think other lawyers are stupid?

39
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,300
Have you ever thought

40
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,829
they would keep evidence?

41
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm not afraid of that.

42
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,430
Their indiscipline

43
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,710
is their business.

44
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,000
Do they dare to show the evidence?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,870
Then let me tell you something you might be afraid of.

46
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:52,950
Xu Jianshe insisted on his innocence in court.

47
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,870
The victim's family once said

48
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,300
they would give up civil compensation.

49
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,190
But don't forget,

50
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,550
that was only a verbal statement.

51
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,610
And it can't represent the whole family of the victims.

52
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,720
We're going to

53
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,300
entrust a lawyer to represent the victim's family

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,700
to file a civil lawsuit against Xu Jianshe.

55
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,630
We'll request Xu Jianshe

56
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,700
to compensate the victim for civil damages.

57
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,399
Your stupid Jianshe

58
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,740
has the ability to compensate but is not willing to compensate.

59
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,320
And during this period,

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,020
he illegally transferred his personal property under your name.

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:29,670
Mrs. Ma,

62
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:32,110
do you think you can

63
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,560
keep the property?

64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,500
Let me tell you.

65
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,080
That's our community property.

66
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,080
You two had divorced

67
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,570
before Xu Jianshe's case.

68
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,980
That's not your community property.

69
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,110
He still has the right to deal with those properties.

70
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,110
That's why

71
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:51,670
you spared no effort

72
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,210
to hire lawyers to sign a power of attorney.

73
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,030
I see.

74
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,480
You asked Ms. Xia to send the message.

75
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,280
She didn't do it.

76
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,710
Mrs. Ma,

77
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,750
bringing messages for their clients' families

78
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,230
is not against the rules.

79
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:13,240
But we have the evidence

80
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,440
of your illegal transfer of the property.

81
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,820
Luo Yingzi,

82
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,980
take Xia Shu to the Bar Association

83
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,530
and make things clear.

84
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,270
OK.

85
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,010
Let's see the attitude of the Bar Association.

86
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,960
But Mrs. Ma,

87
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,230
there's something you need to be aware of.

88
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,460
It might be a butterfly effect.

89
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,710
By then,

90
00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:36,950
if they find out

91
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,750
your transfer of property,

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,630
don't blame us.

93
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,690
Enough.

94
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,460
I don't have time to talk to you.

95
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,210
Keep the money for yourself.

96
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,490
Don't panic.

97
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,620
What are you doing?

98
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,990
Sit over there.

99
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,870
Write it down.

100
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:11,040
I don't have time to write anything for you.

101
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,330
What do you want from me?

102
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,690
I'm giving you a chance.

103
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,470
Look before you leap.

104
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,960
Write as I say.

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,760
No mistake is allowed.

106
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,110
It proves

107
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,040
Luo Yingzi,

108
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,030
Qiu Hua,

109
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,270
and Xia Shu

110
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,240
were appointed to represent Xu Jianshe in the case of intentional injury.

111
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,610
The proxy relationship has been established

112
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,820
after I, Ma Lili held the power of attorney

113
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,110
signed and recognized by Xu Jianshe.

114
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,100
From the day we signed the Agreement,

115
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,560
till the termination of the proxy relationship,

116
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:23,680
the three lawyers have been diligent.

117
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,030
They didn't violate any laws,

118
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,500
regulations,

119
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,630
or the professional ethics of a lawyer.

120
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:34,810
I fully recognize the process

121
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,300
and results of the representation

122
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,900
by the three lawyers.

123
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,650
I undertake that I shall not

124
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:51,560
make any claim against the three lawyers

125
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:56,580
in any form to any organization or individual.

126
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,210
Hereby I declare.

127
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,720
Tell me when you're done.

128
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,610
I'll get the seal for you to leave your fingerprint.

129
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,190
You're back?

130
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,480
How is it going?

131
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,270
Everything went well.

132
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,110
Miss Wen is hunting patiently.

133
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,330
If no one alerts her,

134
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,510
she won't run away.

135
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,430
Did you bring any harm to Yuan?

136
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,740
What are you talking about?

137
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,800
I haven't earned a penny in this case.

138
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,500
What?

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,400
You changed your name to Righteous Chen?

140
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,530
No, no, no.

141
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,550
Justice

142
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,030
is exclusive to you.

143
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,210
I can only take it as

144
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:03,400
you don't charge for the time being to catch bigger fish.

145
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,640
I have to remind Yuan.

146
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,850
I do want to catch a big fish,

147
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,650
but

148
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm not doing this for money.

149
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:12,990
Then why?

150
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,160
You don't know the reason?

151
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,060
Unscrupulous Chen, I admire you.

152
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,550
You almost put me in prison.

153
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,390
I am not that generous to laugh it off.

154
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,490
Righteous Luo.

155
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,500
What's our relationship now?

156
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,050
If we are enemies,

157
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,730
why did you introduce the case to me?

158
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,690
An alliance.

159
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:37,950
There are no permanent enemies,

160
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,020
only eternal interests.

161
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,210
We get what we need.

162
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,160
Aren't you afraid I'll trap you again?

163
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,870
That's why I'm making you my ally.

164
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,500
We should know our enemies well.

165
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,700
It's the same as fighting against an opponent

166
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,230
and cooperate with an ally.

167
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,530
I know you well, so I won't fall for it.

168
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,530
Stop it.

169
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,870
Let's talk upstairs.

170
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,780
You're so smart.

171
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:02,650
Okay, Ms. Fang.

172
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,510
Ms. Luo.

173
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,670
Ms. Fang,

174
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,090
we've found Wen Li.

175
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:10,190
Do you want to meet Mr. Chen?

176
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,310
Which Chen?

177
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,320
Chen Shuo from Da Zheng Low Firm.

178
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,570
What is he doing here?

179
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,110
That's why

180
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,640
I introduced Chen Shuo

181
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,360
to Sun Huading's ex-wife, Ms. Xiao.

182
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,120
After taking the case,

183
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,180
he went to Shanghai

184
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,900
and found Wen Li there.

185
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,280
Wen Li is in Shanghai now,

186
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:29,510
targeting a new goal.

187
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,560
She is seducing her new target.

188
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,430
Is Ms. Xiao's case a big one?

189
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,510
Yes.

190
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,120
Ms. Xiao told me

191
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:40,810
Wen Li got more than 60 million from Sun Huading.

192
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,540
How could you give

193
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,960
such a big case to others?

194
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,660
Ms. Fang,

195
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,230
I planned to leave this case to our firm,

196
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,710
but I'm involved

197
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,680
in this case.

198
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,330
I'm afraid we might alert her

199
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,650
if it's related to me.

200
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,020
Hi, Ms. Fang.

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,970
Long time no see.

202
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,350
Mr. Chen, you're the best.

203
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,790
I failed to catch Wen Li

204
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,310
although I'm Luo Yingzi's lawyer.

205
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,420
You've done a fantastic job.

206
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,770
As soon as you took it over, you made it.

207
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,900
Not really.

208
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,230
You're the one who's amazing.

209
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,400
You've done all the work.

210
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,330
I was just lucky.

211
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,880
That's because Luo Yingzi trusts you.

212
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,880
Yes.

213
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,100
Have a seat. Tell me about the progress.

214
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,140
As far as I know,

215
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,770
this Wen Li

216
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,850
is not simple.

217
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,340
She took no less than 60 million

218
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,300
from Sun Huading.

219
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,110
Wen Li, Liu Ming

220
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,470
and Liu Ming's mother

221
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,450
set up a company called Ming Xin.

222
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,130
She transferred 20 million to Ming Xin

223
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,060
from Liu Ming's previous company.

224
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,950
Liu Ming's private loans and bank loans are included.

225
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:50,790
She took over 80 million

226
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,320
from these two men.

227
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,240
That much?

228
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,910
Yes.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,020
But it's not over yet.

230
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,590
She has a new target now.

231
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,710
Ding Qigwei, the son of Ding Zhaoguang,

232
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,440
the famous real estate developer in Shanghai.

233
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,150
I guess

234
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,990
she's trying to get close to Ding Qiwei.

235
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,290
Ding Qiwei is almost her prey now.

236
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:13,510
I'm curious.

237
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,230
How did she

238
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,990
get close to Ding Qiwei?

239
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,020
Ding Qiwei

240
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,190
is a passionate movie lover.

241
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,270
She catered to his pleasure

242
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,430
by talking to him about movies.

243
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:24,270
She also created

244
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,190
a new identity for herself,

245
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,790
which is a screenwriter.

246
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,100
A screenwriter?

247
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,840
She does look like a screenwriter.

248
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,240
She has turned her life into a movie.

249
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,390
Maybe

250
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,310
it's impossible for her

251
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,070
to be a professional screenwriter.

252
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:41,190
But I guess

253
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,020
her script will be ready soon.

254
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
What's wrong?

255
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,240
Dong.

256
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,160
I am touched by your work.

257
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,730
Really?

258
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
Have you shown this script to others?

259
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,850
Have you sent it to any studios?

260
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,910
Actually, I sent it to many studios,

261
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,870
but I haven't heard from them.

262
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:21,680
No one likes it.

263
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,390
Do you know

264
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,030
how hard it is

265
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,160
not to find someone

266
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,590
who appreciates and understands you?

267
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,230
It's such a good script.

268
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,050
What are you going to do in the future?

269
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,710
I don't know.

270
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,830
I think

271
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,970
I don't have the courage to send it anymore.

272
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,540
It'll be a pity that no one can read it.

273
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,930
Dong.

274
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,500
Let me help you.

275
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,000
That would be great.

276
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,350
How are you going to help me?

277
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,930
How about this?

278
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,360
Transfer the copyright of the script to me.

279
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,760
We can discuss the price.

280
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,500
I'll use it to find investors.

281
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,060
But...

282
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,280
I've been writing this script for a year.

283
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,670
I'm a little reluctant

284
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,490
to sell it.

285
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,470
Then you can't let your talent be buried.

286
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,470
I really admire your talent.

287
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
What do you think?

288
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:44,620
Okay.

289
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,520
After hearing what you said about Wen Li,

290
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,210
I'm getting more curious about her.

291
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,220
She's already got tens of millions, right?

292
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,650
Then why is she so persistent?

293
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,720
Isn't she afraid that she will lose everything she has already got?

294
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,510
Greed?

295
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,960
Her greed is endless.

296
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:04,060
I don't think so.

297
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,320
It's out of the sense of security.

298
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,390
She can only gain a sense of security

299
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,190
by the constant quest for money.

300
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,290
Alright.

301
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,940
Go on, Mr. Chen.

302
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,440
Righteous Luo, I'm wondering.

303
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,740
Grand Property belongs to you and Liu Ming,

304
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,220
right?

305
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,630
Someone transferred 20 million directly from it.

306
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,430
You're so smart,

307
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,110
but why didn't you find it?

308
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,100
That company had nothing to do with me.

309
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,180
It belonged to Liu Ming.

310
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,550
When he was about to run away,

311
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,340
he changed the company's legal entity

312
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,130
to my name behind my back

313
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,110
so that the debts would be on me.

314
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:35,430
He made you the corporate representative

315
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:36,670
without telling you.

316
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:38,470
Then why did you pay this personal loan

317
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,670
out of your own money?

318
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,600
You are so smart.

319
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,250
Can't you figure it out?

320
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,890
Yes, I got it.

321
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,370
If you admit that you are a shareholder

322
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,190
and the legal person of Grand Property,

323
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,480
you can claim your right

324
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,510
in the name of Grand Property, right?

325
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,350
Only if

326
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,920
they haven't spent all the money.

327
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:01,880
If Liu Ming

328
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,140
just transferred your community property,

329
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,910
you can only get back the money.

330
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,450
If he illegally transferred the company's property,

331
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,910
it's a duty encroachment,

332
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,870
so it will be a grave crime.

333
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,140
You're so cruel.

334
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,230
Let me make it clear.

335
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,140
I'm not the one

336
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,550
who wanted to be the legal person, right?

337
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,280
I don't care.

338
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,300
Anyway, as long as we go to court,

339
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:21,330
I'll definitely be your opponent.

340
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,880
It's fun to fight with a matchable one.

341
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,010
Okay, no problem, Unscrupulous Chen.

342
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,630
By the way, Ms. Fang,

343
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,730
this is the basic situation.

344
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,960
What's the strategy we should take now?

345
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
The opponent we meet now

346
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,070
is foolish and greedy.

347
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,060
It's not hard to catch her.

348
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,380
But our ultimate goal

349
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,800
is not only to bring her to justice

350
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,450
but to deprive her of her properties.

351
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:48,370
It's not easy to achieve this goal.

352
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,900
Let alone those fake contracts

353
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,350
Sun Huading and Liu Ming cooperated with her to make those fake contracts,

354
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,010
and they've transferred a lot of assets abroad.

355
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,510
If we alert her,

356
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,540
she might hide abroad.

357
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,340
Let's do it step by step.

358
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,760
I'll talk to Wen Li

359
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,200
on behalf of Ms. Xiao.

360
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:08,270
I'll let her transfer back

361
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,339
the 30 million

362
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,920
Sun Huading transferred to her personal account.

363
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,050
What if you alert her and she runs away?

364
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,940
She won't.

365
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,890
Why?

366
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,950
Ding Qiwei is a big fish.

367
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,670
He is a billionaire, right?

368
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,630
If it were you,

369
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,290
would you give up and run away?

370
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,329
I see.

371
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,640
You mean you'll let her pay the 30 million back first.

372
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,890
Then we will

373
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,480
sue her and Liu Ming for duty encroachment.

374
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,250
If the lawsuit goes well,

375
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,070
she might be sent to prison.

376
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,400
Chen Shuo.

377
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,250
This kind of unscrupulous thing

378
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,620
can only be done by you.

379
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,020
I have faith in you.

380
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,310
Anyway, for your good,

381
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,120
I'll work hard.

382
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,090
I'll try my best.

383
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,020
It's good.

384
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,360
Prepare the materials according to this.

385
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,220
Okay, Ms. Fang.

386
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,020
Ms. Fang.

387
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,050
Ms. Fang.

388
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,220
I forgot to tell you.

389
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,350
Let's sign another agency agreement.

390
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,340
For what?

391
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,230
I want to sue

392
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,080
Liu Ming and Wen Li for duty encroachment.

393
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,810
But I'm not familiar with the criminal business.

394
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:11,860
Please help me and be my lawyer.

395
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,300
Let's sign another agreement.

396
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,900
Forget it.

397
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,570
I won't take over the easy case.

398
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,470
You should ask Chen Shuo

399
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,460
or Qiu Hua to be your lawyer.

400
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,760
Ms. Fang, how about we...

401
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,440
No more discussions about it.

402
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:30,920
[Fang Lihong]

403
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,210
You can turn to her later

404
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,430
and ask her to be your lawyer.

405
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,830
Be more sincere

406
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,340
to clear up any misunderstandings she may have had about you.

407
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,660
Otherwise,

408
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,250
you are making an enemy of her.

409
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,580
I don't want to explain.

410
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,330
It will only make things worse.

411
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,970
And she didn't misunderstand anything.

412
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,320
I did do it.

413
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,520
But I have my reasons to do it this way.

414
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,260
Fang Lihong is so intelligent,

415
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,020
so she should understand the reason.

416
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,780
I'm afraid she won't understand.

417
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,820
If she doesn't,

418
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,090
it will be her problem.

419
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,340
It has nothing to do with me, right?

420
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,710
How can it not matter?

421
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,040
She's your boss.

422
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,350
Yes, she's my boss.

423
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,050
I don't need her to support me.

424
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,650
Fine. Let it be.

425
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,120
Unscrupulous Chen.

426
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,630
Don't call me all the time.

427
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,540
If no one can witness the glory,

428
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,060
it will be like walking at night.

429
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,730
How about

430
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,220
a first-class flight trip?

431
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,750
I'd like to invite you and Ms. Qiu to Shanghai.

432
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,070
I'll show you

433
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,650
how Wen Li

434
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,070
returns

435
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,060
the 31 million.

436
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,330
What I hate most in the world

437
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:58,320
is the expressions of upstarts.

438
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,590
Take a video of yourself.

439
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,310
Watch it whenever you want.

440
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,540
Are you really going to miss this show?

441
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,220
Bye.

442
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,080
Oh no.

443
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,540
Now she knows how to deal with me.

444
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,550
Hello.

445
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:15,650
Shuo.

446
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,980
I haven't seen you for days.

447
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,730
I miss you.

448
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,690
I don't miss you.

449
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,170
I have the unrequited love now.

450
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,420
Oh no.

451
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,920
To Qingyang?

452
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,870
Isn't she from Qingyang?

453
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,430
I want to know

454
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
what made Wen Li who she is today.

455
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,380
Like what kind of family she was born in,

456
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,190
and what she's been through.

457
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:47,940
Okay.

458
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,180
I'll go with you.

459
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,300
I'm sorry.

460
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,170
[Boshi Group]

461
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,150
We can't sign the agency contract yet.

462
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,060
Is there a problem, Ms. Gu?

463
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,810
Not really.

464
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,750
There are no major problems.

465
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,130
If we transfer other's business

466
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,330
to you,

467
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,850
we need to be accountable to our customers.

468
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,860
Didn't we agree on that last time?

469
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,800
Yes.

470
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,730
But there's been a change.

471
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,520
After Mr. Ding came back from dinner with clients,

472
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,320
he asked us to re-evaluate the project carefully.

473
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,590
Ms. Gu,

474
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,270
in order to cooperate with your company,

475
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,430
we've turned down several offers.

476
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:45,060
Why bother?

477
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,720
You are free to cooperate with other companies.

478
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,960
In this way,

479
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,140
we can also be responsible to our clients.

480
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,780
I mean,

481
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,370
Mr. Sun has repeatedly told us

482
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,950
to cooperate with Mr. Ding even if we won't make money.

483
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,260
I'm really sorry.

484
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,140
This is Mr. Ding's idea.

485
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:05,820
Ms. Wen,

486
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,830
I don't think you need to come anymore.

487
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,740
If there is any news,

488
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,130
I'll let you know.

489
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:13,430
Okay.

490
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,690
Thank you.

491
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,300
Do whatever you want.

492
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,830
Dad, listen.

493
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,770
In my life,

494
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,060
I just want to make movies and be a director.

495
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,100
Don't talk about movies.

496
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,360
Stop talking about it.

497
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,840
Is it edible or drinkable?

498
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,670
Dad.

499
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,470
Making movies is my dream.

500
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,850
Don't insult my dream.

501
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,220
Nonsense.

502
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,810
I sent you to college.

503
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,950
You didn't study well, but worked for others!

504
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,080
Aren't you ashamed?

505
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,930
You are so unreasonable.

506
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:42,840
Fine.

507
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,910
I'll make it clear today.

508
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:48,110
I won't do anything you ask me to do.

509
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:48,940
Okay?

510
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,970
I'll only make movies.

511
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,110
Don't even think about it.

512
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,790
As you wish.

513
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,990
You can only take your living expenses every month.

514
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,220
You won't get anything else.

515
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,830
Why can't you

516
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,110
support my ideals?

517
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,260
I can't support you.

518
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:24,370
Wen Li.

519
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,510
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,180
Sorry to keep you waiting.

521
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,930
It's okay.

522
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,440
What would you like to drink?

523
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,840
The mocha here is not bad.

524
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,610
Up to you.

525
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:36,970
One cup of mocha, please.

526
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:37,540
Okay.

527
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:40,150
Wen Li.

528
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,500
I'm in so much pain right now.

529
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,830
How could I have such a father?

530
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,420
What happened?

531
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,420
I had a few quarrels with my dad recently.

532
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,080
He asked me to take over the sales of the company.

533
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:52,800
He must be kidding.

534
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,530
He asked me to sell houses!

535
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,930
I think your father thinks highly of you.

536
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,390
I don't need him to think highly of me.

537
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,880
I was born

538
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,510
for movies.

539
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,770
I'm not interested in selling houses.

540
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,230
Wen Li, what's wrong?

541
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,830
It's the same with my dad.

542
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,980
You also have a father like that?

543
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:28,510
He is also a businessman.

544
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,430
He's been cultivating me to do business since I was young.

545
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,080
You know what?

546
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,000
I was as painful as you.

547
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,090
But I figured it out later.

548
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,620
If I prove to him that I have the talent to be a screenwriter,

549
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,940
he won't stop me.

550
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,140
So now,

551
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:48,530
I make money by doing business

552
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,030
and then make art with the money I earned from business.

553
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:51,630
Qiwei,

554
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,920
if you want your father's approval,

555
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,190
you have to prove to him

556
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,460
that you can only reach your full potential

557
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,380
on making movies.

558
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:04,630
Wen Li, that's what I thought.

559
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,700
But I'm just a director.

560
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,850
I can't do anything

561
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,360
without the scripts.

562
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,300
Have you forgotten?

563
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,010
I'm a scriptwriter.

564
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,210
Do you have any ready-made works?

565
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,550
I just finished this a few days ago.

566
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,570
See if you like it.

567
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,390
"Tracking".

568
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,200
Interesting.

569
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:54,470
Wen Li.

570
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:55,910
No, no.

571
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,710
I should call you Ms. Wen.

572
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,410
I'm flattered. It's just a practice.

573
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,120
No, no.

574
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:04,030
Does this script

575
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,560
have a buyer?

576
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,040
I've sold everything I wrote.

577
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,230
But since I met you,

578
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,230
I don't want to sell this one.

579
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,630
You don't want to sell it?

580
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,580
I want to work with you.

581
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,760
Don't you want to?

582
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,150
I do.

583
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,010
I really do!

584
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:22,550
I...

585
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,140
But as you know,

586
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,210
filming will cost

587
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,720
a lot of money.

588
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,130
With my relationship with my dad,

589
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,550
he won't give me a penny.

590
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:34,620
It's okay.

591
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:36,950
I saved some from my business.

592
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:39,780
How much do you need?

593
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,320
You can invest?

594
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,450
How much can you invest?

595
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,330
What I can offer now

596
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,510
is only two million.

597
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,690
Two million?

598
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,790
I know

599
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,720
it may be far from enough to make a movie.

600
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,640
But I can think of a way.

601
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,480
No, no, Wen Li.

602
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,830
I really don't want to wait any longer.

603
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,880
Now I announce

604
00:26:59,010 --> 00:26:59,710
the two million

605
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:01,110
is the initial fund

606
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,100
of our film "Tracking".

607
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,230
No, I mean...

608
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,640
Wen Li, let me finish.

609
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,470
I figured it out just now.

610
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,670
I'm going back to the company

611
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,530
to take over the company's sales business

612
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,130
and give you full authority.

613
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,030
We'll do business together

614
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,800
and make movies together with the money we earn.

615
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,470
Really?

616
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,220
Yes.

617
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,820
I was just saying.

618
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:26,990
But if I'm not mistaken,

619
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,480
your father must be suspicious.

620
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,300
He'll be worried

621
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,060
if you entrust the business to me.

622
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,430
You're right.

623
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,490
My dad

624
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:38,540
trusts nothing

625
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,180
except money.

626
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,290
However,

627
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,430
I won't tell him

628
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,640
that I'll delegate the sale

629
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,430
to you.

630
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,310
Fine.

631
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,250
How about this?

632
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,570
From now on,

633
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,460
we'll discuss business matters.

634
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,940
And you'll be in charge of all the art stuff.

635
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,840
Qiwei,

636
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:03,560
I really want to thank you.

637
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,350
Why?

638
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,710
All these years,

639
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,730
I've been working hard in business.

640
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
But you know what?

641
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,630
My passion for movies

642
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,220
has never been extinguished in my heart.

643
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,790
I can only say

644
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,380
fate made me meet you.

645
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,100
I regret we didn't meet sooner.

646
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,830
I'm sorry.

647
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,580
I shouldn't have said that.

648
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,990
Wen Li, why not?

649
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,030
I...

650
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,190
Can you believe it?

651
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,310
I feel the same way as you do now.

652
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:37,970
My feelings for you...

653
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,330
But you know my girlfriend...

654
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,450
Of course I know you have a girlfriend.

655
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:46,510
No need to explain.

656
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,760
I don't want to ruin others' happiness.

657
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,320
It's not your fault.

658
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,480
We're not right for each other.

659
00:28:54,810 --> 00:28:55,290
Yes.

660
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,840
She is nice to me.

661
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:57,550
But...

662
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:59,530
But she doesn't understand me at all.

663
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,530
We shouldn't have gotten together.

664
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,290
Wen Li, how about this?

665
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,800
Give me some time.

666
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,120
I'll explain everything to her.

667
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,180
I'll come back to you

668
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,590
when I deal with everything.

669
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,180
Wen Li, wait for me.

670
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,020
It took me so long

671
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,050
to find my Mr. Right.

672
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,840
Of course I'll wait for you.

673
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,640
Okay.

674
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:25,100
I'll talk to my dad now.

675
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,500
Wen Rong?

676
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,090
Who are you?

677
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,220
Let me introduce myself. I'm Chen Shuo.

678
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,550
A lawyer from Da Zheng Law Firm in Jingbei.

679
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,960
My client entrusted me to come to you.

680
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,980
Xiao Yuan.

681
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:06,550
Do you remember Ms. Xiao?

682
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,990
She's Sun Huading's ex-wife.

683
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,670
I don't understand what you're talking about.

684
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,460
I've gotta run.

685
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,120
Then I have to call the police.

686
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,210
What do you want from me?

687
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,030
Here's the evidence

688
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:37,140
that Sun Huading transferred money to you.

689
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,220
Let's count.

690
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,780
Two million.

691
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,470
Three million.

692
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:42,780
Five million.

693
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,220
Another two million.

694
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,110
Did you put a hex on Sun Huading

695
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,720
to make him be enchanted by you?

696
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,470
Every penny of their hard-earned money

697
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,330
was transferred to you one by one.

698
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,350
The total is 31 million.

699
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,000
It's 31 million.

700
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,100
Do you have anything to say?

701
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,470
He gave me the money voluntarily.

702
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,520
I spent my youth with him.

703
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,300
This is a sort of

704
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,020
youth compensation.

705
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,390
You know very well

706
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,790
there is no youth compensation written

707
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,660
in our country's laws.

708
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:17,860
Besides,

709
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,600
these are their community property.

710
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,060
He has no right to deal with it secretly.

711
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,570
Tell me.

712
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,610
Are you going to pay back the money now,

713
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:27,630
or wait until

714
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:30,170
you and Sun Huading are sued?

715
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,550
Then go talk to Sun Huading.

716
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,620
Don't talk to me.

717
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,250
I only know

718
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,630
he gave me the money voluntarily.

719
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,820
So you won't pay it back?

720
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,110
Why should I?

721
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,830
To be honest,

722
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,670
if I weren't for his money,

723
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,830
why do you think I would spend my youth

724
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,020
with

725
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,080
a greasy old man?

726
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,190
Besides,

727
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,700
even if I have to pay it back,

728
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,260
I'll return it to Sun Huading.

729
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,860
Why should I return it to you?

730
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,160
Here.

731
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,260
Look at this.

732
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,250
Ding Qiwei,

733
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:20,230
the only heir of Boshi Group.

734
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:21,970
Wen Rong.

735
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,910
I'm not interested in the things

736
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,260
between you and him,

737
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,480
but I have to say

738
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,830
you have a sharp eye.

739
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,470
Ding Qiwei

740
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,920
is your next target, right?

741
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,780
If Ding inherits

742
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,270
all his father's property,

743
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,800
how much money will he have?

744
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,660
I searched online.

745
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,750
It should be almost

746
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,410
9 billion.

747
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,420
Do you think

748
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:47,910
I should show the evidence

749
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,120
to Ding Qiwei?

750
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,510
Mr. Chen,

751
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,470
I

752
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:11,990
didn't mean to

753
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,520
destroy other's families.

754
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:15,350
It was Sun Huading

755
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,120
who used me, seduced me and threatened me.

756
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:20,810
Tell me.

757
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,110
What could I do as a delicate lady?

758
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,950
I'm also a victim.

759
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:29,580
I finally got rid of him.

760
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,630
Can you

761
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,350
help me?

762
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,760
Your trick doesn't work on me.

763
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,040
Tell me honestly, will you pay the money back?

764
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:42,740
If you don't,

765
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,270
I'll show the evidence to Mr. Ding and his son,

766
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:47,240
and then throw you into prison.

767
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,610
But I don't have that much now.

768
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,600
Sun Huading gave me 30 million.

769
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,770
But

770
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,670
it's been almost two years.

771
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,710
I stayed abroad for one year.

772
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,300
It's almost spent up.

773
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,540
Give me some time.

774
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,770
I'll try to get the money right away.

775
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:18,560
Five days.

776
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,310
At least ten days.

777
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:21,860
What did Ms. Xiao say? I think she said three days.

778
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,449
In five days.

779
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:23,489
Deal.

780
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:23,880
Here.

781
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,639
Repayment Undertaking.

782
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,420
You must undertake to

783
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,130
pay back the 31 million

784
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,090
within five days.

785
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,010
Otherwise,

786
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,130
you're willing to bear all the legal consequences.

787
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,389
Sign here.

788
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,210
I'll send you the account later.

789
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,500
There's no compromise.

790
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,590
I can pay you back,

791
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,300
but I need to add a confidentiality clause.

792
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,970
In other words, after I pay back the money,

793
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,930
you must keep it a secret.

794
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,260
If you violate it,

795
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,210
you must pay for my loss.

796
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:12,400
You just don't want Ding to know.

797
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:12,860
Yes.

798
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,980
But with your intelligence,

799
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,600
you should know even if you add this,

800
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,800
it doesn't have any legal effect.

801
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Of course, you don't have to sign it.

802
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,000
Before I call the police,

803
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,540
you can fly abroad

804
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,620
with the 31 million

805
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,650
and turn to Liu Ming who is abroad.

806
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,200
Otherwise,

807
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,750
you have to sign it.

808
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:37,090
You can hope

809
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,940
we'll keep our promise to keep your secret.

810
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,120
Then you can continue to seduce Ding,

811
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,280
without the fear of being exposed.

812
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,960
Ding's potential value is 9 billion.

813
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,030
Don't look at me like that.

814
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:51,340
Lawyers' time is precious.

815
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,030
Please keep your promise.

816
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,190
Hello.

817
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,170
I'm Unscrupulous Chen.

818
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:02,040
What did I tell you?

819
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,650
[Police]

820
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,230
You bragged a lot.

821
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,920
How would I know what you said?

822
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,060
I didn't even

823
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,430
put much effort into it.

824
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,800
Listen.

825
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:12,150
31 million will be transferred back soon.

826
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,900
You've met her?

827
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:15,780
Yes, I have.

828
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,180
And I took control of her.

829
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,510
She'll transfer the 31 million

830
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,390
to Ms. Xiao's account

831
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:20,940
within five days.

832
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,650
Guess

833
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:24,870
how much I can earn this time?

834
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,530
How much?

835
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,470
930,000.

836
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,460
930,000!

837
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,030
I knew your so-called free

838
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,080
is an empty word.

839
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,750
I was very sincere.

840
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:39,510
You kept

841
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,110
testing me with sugar-coated bullets.

842
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,150
My willpower

843
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,200
is very weak.

844
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,380
Especially when I'm facing money and beauty.

845
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,280
So I can't pass

846
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,580
your test.

847
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,220
Do you think

848
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:53,650
Wen Li is really willing to

849
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,250
pay the 31 million for Ding?

850
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,710
If you were Wen Li,

851
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,730
do you want 31 million

852
00:37:58,730 --> 00:38:00,240
or 9 billion?

853
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,190
Fine.

854
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,740
But let me tell you, Unscrupulous Chen.

855
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,520
Don't do unnecessary things.

856
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,490
Let her finish Ding's order.

857
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,050
There will be no extra actions.

858
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,730
I'll go back to Jingbei right away.

859
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,510
Let's talk about the rest of things.

860
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,520
I'll treat you to a big meal.

861
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,230
How is it, Yingzi?

862
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:19,290
I'm not in Jingbei.

863
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,600
Where are you now?

864
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,430
Qingyang.

865
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,360
Why did you go to Qingyang?

866
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:28,730
Did you find it out?

867
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,930
Her name was neither Wen Li

868
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,700
nor Wen Rong.

869
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,520
This ID number

870
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,250
belongs to a girl named Wen Xin.

871
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,770
Look, is it her?

872
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,800
[Personal Information]

873
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,610
Yes, it's her.

874
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,080
Her home is in Mashanchang.

875
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
It's over 40 kilometers from here.

876
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,650
The road to there was just built the year before last.

877
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,140
[Mashanchang]

878
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,480
Is anyone there?

879
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,550
No.

880
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,430
Same here. The doors are all locked.

881
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,450
Where are the villagers?

882
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,560
The signal is almost gone.

883
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,910
Do you have it?

884
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:17,410
Mine is weak, too.

885
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,320
This place is really remote.

886
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,880
When Wen Li was a kid,

887
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,910
she must be isolated from the world.

888
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,770
There are kids over there.

889
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,210
There are villagers here.

890
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,350
Excuse me, Madam.

891
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,760
Are you busy?

892
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,280
Let me ask you about a person.

893
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,960
Do you know this girl?

894
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,250
Sure, it's a deal, okay?

895
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,310
Mr. Ding, you don't have to see me off.

896
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,540
My driver is waiting outside.

897
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,070
Ms. Xiao,

898
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,410
you came in a hurry this time.

899
00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:04,600
Please tell me in advance next time you visit Shanghai, okay?

900
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,920
Thank you. I hope we can cooperate happily.

901
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,710
I'm looking forward to it too.

902
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,240
See you.

903
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:07,770
Okay.

904
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,280
Goodbye, Mr. Ding.

905
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:14,860
Ms. Xiao.

906
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,340
I parked my car in the basement.

907
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,820
Okay, I'm leaving.

908
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,860
Okay, call me.

909
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:19,740
Bye.

910
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,350
What did you do with Mr. Ding?

911
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,270
It's confidential.

912
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,540
-Did you tell him...
-No.

913
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,110
I promised you.

914
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,620
But if you don't return the money

915
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,170
within the agreed time,

916
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,980
I can't guarantee

917
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,730
what will happen next.

918
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,470
I know.

919
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,960
I will return it.

920
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:50,650
But Mr. Chen, let me tell you.

921
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,680
If you dare to expose me

922
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,510
and report me,

923
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,780
as long as you can't kill me,

924
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,220
I'll make a comeback.

925
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,630
If Wen Li hadn't grown up in that environment,

926
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,270
she wouldn't have become like this.

927
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,580
I disagree.

928
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,510
Why?

929
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:17,500
It's true that people are created by the environment they are living in.

930
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,430
But a human is a reed that can think.

931
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,380
People can have their own choices.

932
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,510
When Wen Li was young,

933
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:24,150
possibly she was constrained by the environment.

934
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,280
But when she grew up,

935
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,730
went to college, and received higher education,

936
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,840
I don't think it's fair

937
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,390
to blame the environment for what she's done.

938
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,560
I am not sure

939
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:43,680
if I had the same experience as hers,

940
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,530
would I be like her when I grow up?

941
00:41:47,850 --> 00:41:49,010
Even if I had gone through

942
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,410
what she went through when I was a kid,

943
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,100
I wouldn't have been like her.

944
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,400
Qiu Hua, I know

945
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,470
you suffered a lot

946
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:03,650
when you were young.

947
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,220
I used to hate my parents.

948
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I hated them for being patriarchal.

949
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,640
I hated them for only loving my brother.

950
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,570
I hated them for taking me as a tool.

951
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:23,890
But after listening to

952
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,690
the story about Wen Li's mother,

953
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,230
I think I can understand my parents better.

954
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,910
They actually wanted to

955
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,840
protect every child in our family.

956
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,130
They hoped someone could help them.

957
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,730
If they have to sacrifice me to achieve it,

958
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,930
then I'm fine with it.

959
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,540
I'm living a better life than other kids anyway.

960
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:52,360
If I didn't have this moral obligation at all,

961
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,530
I would have become another Wen Li.
