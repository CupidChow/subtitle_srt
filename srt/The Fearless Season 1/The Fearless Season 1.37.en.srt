[Episode 37]

4
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,050
Hello.

5
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,950
I heard that

6
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:45,710
Sun Huading collapsed because of a woman.

7
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:47,460
I don't know if it was her.

8
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,650
Anyway,

9
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,120
you just talk business with her.

10
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,650
Should all things be equal,

11
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,229
you'll moderately lean towards her.

12
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,780
Alright?

13
00:01:54,370 --> 00:01:54,970
That's it.

14
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,110
Ms. Gu,

15
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,070
I appreciate your help with the project.

16
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,730
No problem.

17
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,970
I assure you, Ms. Wen,

18
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,460
that we'll take the assessment seriously

19
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,390
and give priority to your company.

20
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,199
I'd like to treat you and Mr. Ding to dinner

21
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,400
at your convenience.

22
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,110
Sure.

23
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,870
I'll tell Mr. Ding about it.

24
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,160
Let's meet up sometime.

25
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,590
Great.

26
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,910
I'll show myself out.

27
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:17,840
Okay.

28
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:18,790
Bye.

29
00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:19,430
Bye.

30
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,380
Take care.

31
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,990
"Capital comes dripping from head to foot,

32
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,760
from every pore, with blood and dirt."

33
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,620
Huang, I can't stand it anymore.

34
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,130
I talked with my dad today.

35
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,660
Everything was going well,

36
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,430
except when I asked him

37
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,990
to invest money in my movie projects.

38
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,270
Then we fell out.

39
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,230
Huang,

40
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,390
how did my dad become like this?

41
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,070
He doesn't understand me at all.

42
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,710
All he cares about is his business

43
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,790
and his money.

44
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,790
A man seems to own all the wealth,

45
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,670
but his soul

46
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,750
stays lonely in eternity.

47
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,100
What kind of desperate situation is this?

48
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,390
Now less and less people can understand me.

49
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,930
Okay. I'll go and draw some storyboards.

50
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:17,829
Who is it?

51
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,350
Hello.

52
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,300
You must be Mr. Ding's son.

53
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,750
We met in your father's office.

54
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,150
If it's about business, go talk to my dad.

55
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,110
I'm busy.

56
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,240
Are you busy drawing storyboards for movies?

57
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,180
You've drawn quite a lot of pictures.

58
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,310
You're so talented.

59
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,829
It's just a piece of cake.

60
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,829
If you wanna talk about business, go to my dad's office.

61
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,670
"I have to come."

62
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,150
"Is has nothing to do with love."

63
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,370
Did you go to the movies in the morning

64
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,770
and watch "Spellbound"?

65
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:00,240
Yes.

66
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,190
Before my meeting with Mr. Ding,

67
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,950
I went to watch that movie too.

68
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,120
You looked familiar to me at first sight.

69
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,550
Now that I think of it, we watched the movie

70
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,230
at the same time and place.

71
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,520
What a coincidence!

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,640
Oh, it's you.

73
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,270
That's truly a coincidence.

74
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,360
Do you also like Hitchcock?

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,120
Yes.

76
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,660
I didn't expect you to be a movie fan too.

77
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,810
I just came back from America.

78
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,790
I don't have a friend

79
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,100
to talk about art and movies with.

80
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,350
I heard your conversation with your father.

81
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,150
I don't think your passion for "Spellbound"

82
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,590
is just a spur of the moment.

83
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,650
I believe that you truly love movies.

84
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,790
So, after the work meeting,

85
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,310
I took the liberty to knock on your door.

86
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,150
How should I address you?

87
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,630
My family name is Wen.

88
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:47,590
I'm Wen Li.

89
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,150
Ms. Wen.

90
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,409
Please have a seat.

91
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:54,830
I'm sorry.

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,230
I shouldn't have given you my business card

93
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,760
as it has the stink of money.

94
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,920
But what else can I do?

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,190
An artist's career is sustained by money.

96
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,320
You're right.

97
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,520
This is every movie maker's struggle.

98
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:08,860
Ms. Wen,

99
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,250
you said you just came back from America.

100
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,230
Yes.

101
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,710
I spent a few years in America studying

102
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,040
movie production in New York University.

103
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,170
I've always thought if one's goal is

104
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,530
to make a living, it's okay to stay abroad.

105
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,470
But if one's goal is to do art,

106
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,930
then one must come back to one's motherland.

107
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,930
That's why I came back.

108
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,150
Unfortunately,

109
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,390
the domestic film industry

110
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,750
is completely different from what I thought.

111
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,350
I couldn't continue with my artistic pursuit.

112
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,230
I had no choice

113
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,730
but to enter the commercial world,

114
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,480
and do real estate business with my friends.

115
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,340
I agree with everything you said.

116
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,110
As you mentioned, you studied movies

117
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,440
in New York University in America. Right?

118
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,150
Yes.

119
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,790
I applied several times for an admission

120
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,150
to the movie school of New York University,

121
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:54,230
but I never got accepted.

122
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,150
I had no other option than to work

123
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,950
for the film crews in Hollywood.

124
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,670
Ms. Wen,

125
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,850
since you're making movies,

126
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:02,180
which part of the industry do you focus on?

127
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,110
Mr. Ding.

128
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,150
I'm here for a business meeting with your father.

129
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:10,110
Maybe we shouldn't talk about movies

130
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,150
in this place.

131
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,990
Something doesn't feel right.

132
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,880
Exactly.

133
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,180
This place is full of the stink of money.

134
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,130
How about this?

135
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,710
Let's meet up for coffee tomorrow. My treat.

136
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,440
Sounds good.

137
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,720
But please let me be the gentleman

138
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,830
and buy you coffee.

139
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,400
No.

140
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,530
I insist that it should be my treat.

141
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,590
Please give me a chance

142
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,050
to talk about art with you.

143
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,040
Great.

144
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,790
Why don't you give me your name card?

145
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,170
I'll contact you after I book a place.

146
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,720
Forget about the name card.

147
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,810
I'll add you to my WeChat friend list.

148
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,670
Okay.

149
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,909
Let me scan your QR code.

150
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:39,350
No.

151
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,720
I'll scan yours.

152
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,390
Okay.

153
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,630
Done.

154
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,990
See you tomorrow.

155
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:49,990
See you tomorrow.

156
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,190
Wen Li...

157
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:08,670
Luo Yingzi!

158
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,390
What should we do?

159
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,350
What's up?

160
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:14,030
Ma Lili is here.

161
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,150
What does she want?

162
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,030
Isn't her case closed yet?

163
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,230
She has achieved her goal.

164
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,710
She declared to report us.

165
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,990
For what?

166
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:21,350
She said she'd report us for helping her

167
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,150
and Xu Jianshe falsify testimonies.

168
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,790
She said Xu Jianshe was sentenced to life imprisonment

169
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,470
because of us and she wanted an explanation.

170
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,790
She must have gone crazy.

171
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,990
Isn't she satisfied with what she's got?

172
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,720
Where is she?

173
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,710
She's in the meeting room.

174
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,530
I came to you the moment I heard what she said.

175
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,980
What am I gonna do? It's all my fault.

176
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,740
Don't panic.

177
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm sure she came prepared.

178
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,030
Let's discuss how to deal with this.

179
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,360
Come on. Let's go there.

180
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,010
Can she prove that we helped her

181
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,610
and Xu Jianshe falsify testimonies?

182
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:50,450
On the day you met with Xu Jianshe,

183
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,350
what did you do?

184
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,830
Don't you see what situation we are in now?

185
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,159
Are you still gonna keep the truth from us?

186
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,350
Last time I saw Ma Lili,

187
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,320
she gave me a letter, saying

188
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,630
that it's about nothing but family matters.

189
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:07,160
She asked me to give it to Xu Jianshe.

190
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,790
What?

191
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:08,670
I didn't give the letter to him.

192
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,590
I didn't.

193
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,300
I also had doubts about her request.

194
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,590
I went and asked for Mr. Tao's opinion.

195
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,020
He said it was against the rules.

196
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,590
So I gave the letter back to Ma Lili.

197
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,110
Wait.

198
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,470
If so, it shouldn't do any harm to us.

199
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,710
But you're obviously panicking now.

200
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,030
There must be something else

201
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,430
that you haven't told us.

202
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,540
She showed me a video

203
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:29,250
that she filmed in secret,

204
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,800
demonstrating that I did take the letter.

205
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:35,429
But I did it only to comfort her.

206
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,230
I returned the letter to her in front of the law firm.

207
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,890
Only she and I saw that happen.

208
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,110
I swear,

209
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,470
I'm telling the truth.

210
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,660
If I lied,

211
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,410
I would be struck by lightning.

212
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:48,790
Are you saying that Ma Lili uses the video

213
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,120
of you taking a letter from her to frame you

214
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,980
for giving it to Xu Jianshe as a way

215
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,110
to coach him to falsify his testimony?

216
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,750
I didn't expect her to do such a thing.

217
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,170
You didn't expect that, did you?

218
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,910
There are many things you didn't expect!

219
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,840
Do you think she's as stupid as you?

220
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,110
If she reports you,

221
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,590
you could be disbarred.

222
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,790
Worse still, what you did can be seen as a violation of law!

223
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,640
Qiu Hua, don't worry.

224
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,570
This has nothing to do with you two.

225
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,040
I'll bear all the consequences by myself.

226
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,950
Xia Shu, don't be silly.

227
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:17,120
How is it not relevant to us?

228
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,830
The three of us worked together

229
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,710
on this case.

230
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,880
Nonetheless,

231
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,520
Ma Lili is just trying to make something out of nothing.

232
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,760
Even if she succeeds,

233
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,000
at worst, the bar will find Xia Shu

234
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,870
in violation of law practice disciplines.

235
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,470
If anyone has broken the law,

236
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:32,350
it must be Ma Lili.

237
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,740
Xu Jianshe has been sentenced to life imprisonment.

238
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,470
Ma Lili has got what she wanted.

239
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,670
Why is she threatening us?

240
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,270
Maybe because she's out of her mind.

241
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
The 300,000 yuan.

242
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,710
She's doing this for that 300,000 yuan.

243
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,470
When the second trial took place,

244
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,870
she paid a legal fee of 300,000 yuan.

245
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,070
Now she wants it back.

246
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,350
I don't think so.

247
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,230
It's a real possibility.

248
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:53,290
She values money more than anything.

249
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,990
She's targeting at this sum of money.

250
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:56,580
Now we know what her purpose is.

251
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:56,980
I...

252
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,840
I can give her that money!

253
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,630
Xia Shu, don't ever think about that.

254
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,950
You're a lawyer.

255
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,890
Are you gonna submit yourself to extortion?

256
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:04,490
Yingzi,

257
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,990
just let Xia Shu do whatever she wants.

258
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,350
300,000 yuan means nothing to her.

259
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,140
It's time she paid for a lesson.

260
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,830
Plus, it can keep us out of trouble.

261
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:13,860
That's not it, Qiu Hua.

262
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,640
The point isn't about the 300,000 yuan.

263
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,830
What's important is that we can't yield to a despicable person's scheme.

264
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:19,350
If we give her 300,000 yuan,

265
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,610
she'll have something on us from then on,

266
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:24,030
and continue to blackmail us.

267
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,230
The same thing will happen again and again.

268
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,890
We can't give her this chance.

269
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,860
Then what should we do?

270
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,260
As lawyers, we should be able to defeat her.

271
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,350
Isn't she in the meeting room?

272
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,190
Let's go meet her.

273
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,720
Let's go.

274
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,080
Ms. Ma.

275
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,780
Sorry to keep you waiting.

276
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,150
I was just telling Ms. Qiu

277
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,120
that no one could be as admirable

278
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,830
as you.

279
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,430
You've pulled a perfect stunt.

280
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,470
Till the day he dies, Xu Jianshe might never

281
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,730
figure out how he ends up in jail for life.

282
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,820
It's you who reduced him to that situation.

283
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,710
See?

284
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,830
This is one of the reasons I admire Ms. Ma.

285
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,690
She's a natural at making up lies.

286
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,070
Tell us.

287
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,630
How did we reduce him to this situation?

288
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,470
Did you not do that?

289
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,180
If you had put on a better defense,

290
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:08,680
we could've won the retrial,

291
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,600
instead of seeing him get sentenced to life imprisonment again.

292
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,460
Hold on. Let's get this straight.

293
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,070
When Xu Jianshe was sentenced to life imprisonment,

294
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,470
we didn't represent him.

295
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,990
We had managed to get a retrial for him.

296
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:19,470
But then you replaced us with Mr. Pan.

297
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,190
He's the one responsible for the sentence.

298
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,350
You can blame us

299
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:24,800
as much as you want,

300
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,760
but no one will support your story.

301
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,830
Fine.

302
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,830
Let me ask you this.

303
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,360
Didn't you help me coach Xu Jianshe

304
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,990
to plead not guilty in the court

305
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:37,650
and have him put away for life?

306
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,950
We helped you?

307
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,990
Ms. Ma, are you serious?

308
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,410
I wrote him a letter,

309
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,650
and you brought it to him, didn't you?

310
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,120
What letter?

311
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,520
Where is the letter?

312
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,990
Ms. Xia,

313
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,050
you brought the letter to Xu Jianshe, right?

314
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,970
Xia Shu, did you

315
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:56,560
ever deliver a letter for Ms. Ma Lili?

316
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,750
I didn't do it.

317
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,110
I gave the letter back to her right away.

318
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,770
When did you give it back to me?

319
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,720
Young lady, listen up.

320
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,080
I have a video of you taking a letter from me.

321
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,740
The letter was a secret code between Xu Jianjian and me.

322
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,960
It's you who brought it to him!

323
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,120
He knew how to read it.

324
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,870
It turns out that's how you managed

325
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,800
to change Xu Jianshe's testimony.

326
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,580
Mr. Qiu,

327
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,750
have you recorded

328
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,230
everything that Ms. Ma Lili said?

329
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,230
Yes. Everything.

330
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,250
Ms. Ma,

331
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,710
will you turn yourself in to the police,

332
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,770
or let us give the recording to them?

333
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,160
Do you have no shame?

334
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
What kind of lawyers would record what their clients say?

335
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,690
Everyone knows who has no shame here.

336
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,530
You've put on quite an act. What do you want?

337
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,160
I want my 300,000 yuan back.

338
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,750
Anyway, you failed to help Xu Jianshe out.

339
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,510
See?

340
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,650
Qiu Hua, you were right.

341
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,710
Her real target is that 300,000 yuan.

342
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,400
Ms. Ma,

343
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,620
you've sent Xu Jianshe to prison.

344
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,360
You've taken all his money.

345
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,230
And now you still want that 300,000?

346
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:56,720
That's my hard-won money.

347
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,510
Why wouldn't I want it back?

348
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,960
So now instead of faithful love,

349
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,840
we're talking about money, aren't we?

350
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,970
You won't get a penny.

351
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:04,590
Aren't you afraid

352
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,790
that I'll report you?

353
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,710
Do it right now!

354
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,950
Out of the firm, you'll see a police station on your left,

355
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,120
and the law association on your right.

356
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,190
Report us to whomever you want.

357
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,590
Take it down a notch, thug!

358
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,590
Are you gonna give me the money or not?

359
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,590
Do I look like a thug to you?

360
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,320
You won't get anything from us!

361
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,320
Fine.

362
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,710
Wait and see!

363
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,230
This is maddening!

364
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,200
I'm telling you,

365
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,440
this is making me mad.

366
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,960
I always have a theory

367
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,950
that if you keep bumping into a certain kind of people,

368
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,190
it means you are born to attract such kind of people.

369
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:40,830
Qiu Hua,

370
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,620
do you think I'm born with an attraction

371
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,740
for villains?

372
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,650
There's nothing you can do about it.

373
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,850
After all, you've chosen to be a lawyer.

374
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,410
I wanna quit now.

375
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,840
Which way will she go, left or right?

376
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,030
Luo Yingzi.

377
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:56,590
Maybe I should give her that 300,000 yuan.

378
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,940
I don't care if she's gonna report me.

379
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,230
I'm only afraid that she'll drag you down.

380
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:01,470
Cut it off, My Lady.

381
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,990
Even though you're truly rich,

382
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,710
you shouldn't waste your money on a devil.

383
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,990
I don't think

384
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,590
she'll turn left or right.

385
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,540
All she wants is that 300,000 yuan.

386
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,260
She'll definitely come back.

387
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,270
Then she'll report us to the firm

388
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,730
and ask for the money back.

389
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,310
What will the firm do?

390
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,110
It's hard to tell.

391
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,560
She has a video of Xia Shu taking a letter from her,

392
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,970
while we don't have a video to show Xia Shu returned that letter.

393
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,500
What should we do now?

394
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,430
Is there anything I can do?

395
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,510
Just stop making it worse.

396
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,110
You shouldn't do anything.

397
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,070
Just go back to your office

398
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,750
and continue to play games on your phone.

399
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,990
This is my fault.

400
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,100
I have to do something.

401
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,710
Enough.

402
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,040
Luo Yingzi, if she needs compensation...

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:42,470
Just go.

404
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,350
Be with your games.

405
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,350
That's your way to help us.

406
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,350
Let us have some quiet time.

407
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,470
Ms. Qiu and I will have a discussion. Okay?

408
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,230
Off you go.

409
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,830
To be honest,

410
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,350
if Ma Lili reveals this to the firm,

411
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,630
what will be the firm's decision?

412
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,830
Needless to say,

413
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,710
the firm will choose to shelter Xia Shu.

414
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,350
So, as long as this matter isn't handled

415
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,470
by the police or the law association,

416
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,050
we won't be in trouble.

417
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,120
Though Xia Shu didn't deliver the letter,

418
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,230
Ma Lili insists that she did.

419
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,830
If the firm determines that Xia Shu

420
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,590
passed on messages for clients in secret,

421
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,010
and aided in falsifying testimonies,

422
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,110
her professional career

423
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,360
will be affected.

424
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,510
It's her own professional career.

425
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,360
Who are you to worry about that?

426
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,980
She's got a powerful dad.

427
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,990
Qiu Hua, don't be like this.

428
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,350
When I was a housewife

429
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,350
staying home comfortably,

430
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:30,950
I had no idea that my future

431
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,610
would turn out to be like this.

432
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:33,350
Who knows

433
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,870
what will happen to Xia Shu?

434
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,530
Besides, Xia Shu is too naive.

435
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,630
There isn't a serious blot on her character.

436
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,470
She's a trouble maker. Isn't that a blot?

437
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,110
No.

438
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:43,200
People like Han Zhitong and Ma Lili

439
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:44,870
have major blots on their characters.

440
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:45,950
A naive person

441
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,480
is usually not a bad person.

442
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,580
What's more,

443
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,830
the key is,

444
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,350
we must not let Ma Lili trick Xia Shu into paying her.

445
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,590
Once she gets her way,

446
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:54,950
it means she has successfully extorted us.

447
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:55,630
In spite of everything,

448
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,240
Xia Shu is on our team.

449
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,540
Righteous Luo.

450
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,000
What do you have to say?

451
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,070
I have some good news for you.

452
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:28,710
Your prey,

453
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,350
just walked gracefully past me.

454
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,140
She's about to get on the elevator.

455
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,220
Sh's staying in Room 1224, next to mine.

456
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,940
So you're neighbors now, aren't you?

457
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,630
Great.

458
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,090
Mr. Charming Neighbor,

459
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:42,710
I have faith in you,

460
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,210
as I told you a long time ago.

461
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,070
Wen Li and you are a perfect match.

462
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,890
What are you talking about?

463
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,290
I'm way out of her league.

464
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,240
Then whose league are you in?

465
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,380
Yours.

466
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,220
Nonsense.

467
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,990
We're in the same league.

468
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,820
Did Chen Shuo find Wen Li?

469
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:05,890
He said so on the phone.

470
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,119
Look, Qiu Hua.

471
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,640
Your life and mine

472
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,750
are secured now, right?

473
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,599
Why do we have to spend so many

474
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,359
extra hours working?

475
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,150
I'm telling you,

476
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,230
I can't do this anymore.

477
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,030
I've gotta go.

478
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,550
Okay.

479
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,890
I need to stay a bit longer.

480
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,550
You should really think about

481
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:33,710
your relationship with your boyfriend.

482
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,920
Why do you suddenly talk about him?

483
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,230
If you do love him, there's no way

484
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,230
you'd rather stay late at work

485
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,750
than go home to him.

486
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,310
You're wrong.

487
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,710
Even if I'm gonna marry a rich guy,

488
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,630
I'll work overtime as long as I have to.

489
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:52,090
I should have the ability to support myself.

490
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:52,950
In this way, one day,

491
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,510
if my husband takes all our money away,

492
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:57,510
I won't be totally helpless, will I?

493
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,210
That's a sarcastic comment on me, isn't it?

494
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,920
I've figured it out.

495
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,910
Aren't you afraid that I'll go talk to Zhang Quanquan now?

496
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:04,710
Just go.

497
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,750
I'm leaving then.

498
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,010
I'm really going away.

Federico Fellini,

512
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,940
was an Italian movie director,

513
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,040
a script writer, and a producer.

514
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,280
A script writer and a producer.

515
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,680
[Mingming]

516
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,420
Hello, Mingming.

517
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,630
Lili, where are you?

518
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,470
I miss you so much.

519
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,910
I'm alone in a foreign country.

520
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,230
I'm so lonely.

521
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,000
I miss you too.

522
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,530
It's so scary to stay at a hotel alone.

523
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,990
But what else can we do?

524
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,510
Don't worry.

525
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,310
I'm trying to find someone to help you.

526
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,150
I'll see if the police can close the case,

527
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,990
and get you off the wanted list.

528
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,900
Otherwise,

529
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:56,350
we'll be fugitives in the rest of our lives.

530
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,200
Mingming,

531
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,090
You have no idea how difficult this is.

532
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,200
I have a hard time looking for helpers.

533
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,560
I spend every day begging people.

534
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm so sad.

535
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,470
I know you've worn yourself out

536
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,530
during these days.

537
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,480
Lili, I need to tell you this.

538
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:29,550
My parents must be worried about me.

539
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:31,310
Would you do me a favor and pay them a visit

540
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,870
at your convenience?

541
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,710
I had already done that

542
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,720
before you asked.

543
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,270
I looked at them from a distance.

544
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,800
I didn't dare to get closer.

545
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,670
I was afraid the police would find me out if I had shown up before them.

546
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,230
I was also afraid that your parents

547
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,990
would get too excited and expose our secret.

548
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,190
That could get you in a worse situation.

549
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,790
Mingming,

550
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,070
I know this isn't easy for us,

551
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,020
but we must be patient.

552
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,530
When it's over,

553
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,600
we can come home without fear.

554
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,810
Fine, Lili.

555
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,370
I just miss you too much.

556
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,960
I miss you too.

557
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:12,510
Mingming.

558
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,440
It's nearly 1 a.m. in China.

559
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,390
Well, I'll hang up then.

560
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:18,140
I'll hang up, Lili.

561
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,230
You should have a rest.

562
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:19,970
Good night.

563
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,670
Good night.

564
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:22,850
Good night.

565
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,510
So annoying.

566
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,670
All the accounts he subscribes are about movies.

567
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,980
You're doomed, Chen Shuo.

568
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:54,470
You have to quickly make yourself

569
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,770
look like an artist,

570
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,720
or you won't be able to trap your prey.

571
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,110
Mr. Ma, you wanna speak to me?

572
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:17,950
Mr. Meng.

573
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,330
Let me introduce you to each other.

574
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,400
I went to college with this gentleman here.

575
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,240
He's Chen Shuo, from Jingbei Dazheng Law Firm.

576
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,230
Hello, Chen Shuo.

577
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:25,830
Chen Shuo.

578
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,190
This is Mr. Meng,

579
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,410
a law consultant for Boshi Real Estate.

580
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Please be seated.

581
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,990
Chen Shuo wants to ask you

582
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,820
about Ding Zhaoguang's family.

583
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,150
[A Law Consultant for Boshi Real Estate Mr. Meng]

584
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,070
I can't have private discussions

585
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,350
about my clients.

586
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,050
Mr. Meng, we're both lawyers.

587
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,990
I won't ask the questions

588
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,920
that I shouldn't ask. Don't worry.

589
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:50,800
I came here

590
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,330
to inform you of something.

591
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,440
I've taken on a case recently.

592
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,640
My client

593
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,230
was defrauded by a woman,

594
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,510
who is right now

595
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,850
in Shanghai.

596
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,940
I think her target is Mr. Ding and his son.

597
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,580
You like Christopher Nolan?

598
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,420
I like him too!

599
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,450
I also like Quentin Tarantino.

600
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,150
I enjoy his movies, like "Reservoir Dogs",

601
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,230
"Inglourious Basterds",

602
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,400
and "Pulp Fiction".

603
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:12,970
Those are what I enjoy too!

604
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,040
Gosh! Someone finally clicks with me!

605
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,100
Which of his movies is your favorite?

606
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,630
May I go to the bathroom?

607
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,910
-Okay.
-We'll talk about that later.

608
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:22,650
Okay. Okay.

609
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,470
What I memorized last night isn't helpful.

610
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,240
What "Quentin"?

611
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,920
"Reservoir Dogs".

612
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,970
Seriously?

613
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,960
Let me tell you.

614
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,670
Children were their parents'

615
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,890
worst enemies in their past lives.

616
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:51,330
I truly believe that.

617
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,380
It's real.

618
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:54,930
Ding Zhaoguang is a smart businessman.

619
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,070
He craves for money like a beast longing for blood.

620
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:59,790
Even if it's just a penny,

621
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,150
he'll rack his brains for it.

622
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,210
God knows why his son is so different.

623
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,630
This young man doesn't care about money,

624
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,230
but he can't live without it.

625
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:08,990
The only thing he thinks about

626
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,280
is how to get money from his dad

627
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,510
so that he can make movies.

628
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,430
The problem is,

629
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,560
he's not much of a movie expert.

630
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,300
He worked as an errand boy in Hollywood

631
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,300
for a short time.

632
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,710
And now he sees himself as an artist.

633
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,960
Hasn't Mr. Ding done something about it?

634
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,040
He sure has.

635
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,500
He has even arranged a girlfriend

636
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,260
for his son.

637
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,990
What choice does he have?

638
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,010
Ding Zhaoguang lost his wife many years ago.

639
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:32,390
Being occupied by work,

640
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,630
he didn't get remarried,

641
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,270
or spend much time with his son.

642
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:37,390
He only gave his son a bank card with no spending limit,

643
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,250
and sent him abroad at a young age.

644
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,200
So he always

645
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,880
feels guilty about his son.

646
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,940
This woman hits the bull's eye every time.

647
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,430
What woman?

648
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,130
No one. Go on, Mr. Meng.

649
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,880
I'd love to hear how the story develops.

650
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,020
Yuru, how many times have I told you?

651
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,790
I don't mean to go against my dad.

652
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,190
I'm just not interested in doing business.

653
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,310
Yuru, why can't you understand me?

654
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,500
I just hate doing business.

655
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,020
Alright. I'm with someone now.

656
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,770
I'll attend the meeting. Okay?

657
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,370
Alright. I'm gonna hang up.

658
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:13,230
Was it your girlfriend?

659
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,710
Sort of.

660
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,580
My dad set me up with her.

661
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,690
She's been nice to me.

662
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,270
Wen Li.

663
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,460
I only want to make movies

664
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:25,410
and pursue my dreams,

665
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,410
but she just doesn't understand me.

666
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,550
She suggests me listen to my father,

667
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:30,870
do business with him,

668
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,690
and just take the path he took.

669
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,550
I don't get it.

670
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,650
What's the meaning of doing business?

671
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,240
Isn't it just about money?

672
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,650
You're right.

673
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,320
But now,

674
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,150
few people truly understand us.

675
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:44,910
Oh.

676
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:46,790
Let's get back to our talk about Quentin.

677
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,160
I think his movies...

678
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,230
Alright. Stop.

679
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,990
That phone call has got me into a bad mood.

680
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,950
I don't wanna talk about movies now.

681
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,710
In my company,

682
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,100
there's a board meeting in the afternoon.

683
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:55,910
I haven't made an appearance.

684
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:56,540
So,

685
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,120
Yuru called.

686
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,310
She asked me to go back for the meeting.

687
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,970
Now I have to go to the company.

688
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,470
It's been a pleasure to meet you, Wen Li.

689
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,170
The pleasure is mine.

690
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,820
It's lovely to meet you, Director Ding.

691
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,600
I hope we can talk about movies again.

692
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,130
Sure.

693
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,870
Oh, by the way,

694
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:15,290
you'd like to be a director,

695
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,990
but I'm a bit different

696
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,950
as I want to be a script writer.

697
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,680
You... You are a script writer?

698
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,600
Have you... created any works yet?

699
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,230
Just some rudimentary writings.

700
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,620
I wrote them for fun. Nothing to speak of.

701
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,850
Don't say that.

702
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,840
If you don't mind,

703
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,910
you can send me your works.

704
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,510
Maybe we could be partners.

705
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,310
Sounds great.

706
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,550
I'll sort them out then.

707
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,610
I look forward to your masterpieces.

708
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:38,710
Okay.

709
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:39,970
I really need to go now.

710
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,930
We'll meet up some other time.

711
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,220
Don't forget about it.

712
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:43,790
Sure.

713
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,430
Mr. Guo,

714
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,730
when will we start shooting this movie?

715
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,830
I consulted a divination master

716
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,640
who said next week would be nice.

717
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,400
Young man, this is a rare opportunity.

718
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,230
The director said

719
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,710
all the costumes and looks would be designed

720
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,640
by the top stylists in the country.

721
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,160
We promise your image

722
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,510
will be sweet and cute.

723
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,680
You know, girl-next-door type.

724
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,740
Really? Many thanks to the director.

725
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,390
What film projects were you in?

726
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,990
Let me show you my works.

727
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,610
Here, all of these.

728
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,840
Good.

729
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,170
What do you think about this?

730
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,740
Can I use the socket here?

731
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,830
Sure.

732
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,400
How come it doesn't get in?

733
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,390
I'm sorry.

734
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,260
I'm sorry.

735
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,100
Let me help you with it.

736
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,800
Thank you.

737
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,200
This is not a good place

738
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:28,870
to write stuff in.

739
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,020
How weird is it?

740
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,320
I can only find inspirations here.

741
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,610
Me too.

742
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,430
Well,

743
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,390
Mark Twain also loved doing his writing

744
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,670
in a place like this.

745
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,610
Exactly.

746
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,410
I always think

747
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,550
I must have been affected

748
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,150
by Mark Twain's biography.

749
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,650
That's why I enjoy writing in such a place.

750
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:56,960
[Movie Script Writer Yu Dong]

751
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,330
Well,

752
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,390
my name is Yu Dong.

753
00:28:58,910 --> 00:29:00,940
I'm a movie script writer.

754
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,390
What are the odds?

755
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,670
I'm also a movie script writer.

756
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,680
Nice to meet you.

757
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,440
Nice to meet you.

758
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:12,910
Can I get you a drink?

759
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:14,790
Sure.

760
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,950
Excuse me!

761
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,510
Can I have the menu for drinks?

762
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,000
Who?

763
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,740
She wants to see me?

764
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,120
Okay.

765
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,080
Take her to the guest meeting room.

766
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,510
I'll be right there.

767
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,840
Luo Yingzi.

768
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,200
Your client, Ma Lili, is here.

769
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,360
She insisted on having a meeting with me.

770
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,410
What is it about?

771
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,860
Ms. Fang,

772
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,660
I'm sorry

773
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,790
that there's something we haven't told you.

774
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,450
But since she's already here,

775
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,780
why don't you listen to what she has to say?

776
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,550
Do you need me and Qiu Hua there?

777
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:01,670
No.

778
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,510
I'll see what's going on.

779
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:04,330
Bye.

780
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,880
What will Ma Lili say to Ms. Fang?

781
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,470
You know that, don't you?

782
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,220
What should we do?

783
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:21,750
We can't undo what has been done.

784
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,150
We'll try to stop it from exacerbating.

785
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,410
As to what the firm and Ms. Fang will think,

786
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,940
we can't control it, can we?

787
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,050
Of course we can't.

788
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,750
Now that it's out of our hands,

789
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:31,450
we should come up with a strategy

790
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,650
to fight Ma Lili with.

791
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:36,280
Are you saying that they helped you falsify Xu Jianshe's testimony?

792
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:36,880
Yes.

793
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,230
If this goes to public,

794
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,920
your law firm will be harmed as well, right?

795
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,230
I think you're the first one to be affected.

796
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,410
Even if what you said is true,

797
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:55,600
they've only violated some rules,

798
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,850
while you have offended the law.

799
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,020
Tell me.

800
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,350
What do you want?

801
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,610
I went to great lengths to get the 300,000

802
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,510
that I paid you to help Xu Jianshe out of jail.

803
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,990
I would've accepted a reduced sentence, if not an acquittal.

804
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:20,720
But he was still sentenced to life imprisonment.

805
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,000
My money has gone down the drain, right?

806
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,020
Lawyers like you deal with

807
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,900
big sums of money all the time.

808
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,310
I paid you but you didn't do your job well.

809
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,000
300,000 yuan means nothing to you,

810
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,730
but to ordinary people like me,

811
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,070
it's everything.

812
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,530
It's even my whole world.

813
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,430
Shouldn't you return it to me?

814
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,810
What if I don't?

815
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,740
I'll expose this matter to the public even if it means I'll be put behind bars!

816
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,110
I guess

817
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,510
you must have tried blackmailing Luo Yingzi

818
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,270
and the girls like what you're doing to me.

819
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:57,470
How is it a blackmail?

820
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,380
Then why don't you expose this to the public?

821
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,030
If what you said is true,

822
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,190
their behavior has constituted

823
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,790
a violation of disciplines.

824
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,290
It has nothing to do with the firm.

825
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,600
At worst, I fire them. That's all.

826
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,980
You won't handle this matter, will you?

827
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,310
You can do

828
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,230
whatever you want.

829
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,060
Fine.

830
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,250
I'll give you several days to mull it over.

831
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:25,110
Get prepared for a fierce attack.

832
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:41,510
She won't easily give up on extorting us.

833
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,270
Ms. Fang.

834
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:48,950
Ma Lili said you aided her

835
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:51,120
in falsifying Xu Jianshe's testimony.

836
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,920
Is that true?

837
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,200
-It’s Xia Shu.
-It never happened.

838
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,000
Ma Lili asked us

839
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,310
to deliver a letter for her,

840
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,470
but we refused.

841
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,470
We only told Xu Jianshe

842
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,220
about the content of the letter,

843
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,880
which appeared to be about family matters.

844
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,730
There was nothing illegal.

845
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:09,300
Otherwise, we wouldn't have told him the content.

846
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,630
You must have forgotten what the law says.

847
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,970
It's not against the rules to pass on a few words among family members, is it?

848
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:15,610
Ms. Fang,

849
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,110
Ma Lili

850
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,750
only wants us to give her back

851
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,220
the legal fee she paid.

852
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:23,180
It's an unreasonable request,

853
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,240
so we said no to her.

854
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,250
Then she came and threatened us.

855
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,090
I don't want to be anyone's scapegoat again.

856
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,620
Ms. Fang,

857
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,740
the trouble was caused by Xia Shu.

858
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,750
She concealed the truth from us.

859
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,150
We didn't know anything

860
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,260
until Ma Lili came to the office.

861
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,300
At that time,

862
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:45,370
Ma Lili's love story with Xu Jianshe

863
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:49,120
deeply moved me.

864
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,320
Then I read the letter

865
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,180
and found nothing unusual.

866
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,920
So I memorized it and told Xu Jianshe about it.

867
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,210
I didn't expect

868
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,000
she'd put a secret code in it.

869
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,300
Ms. Fang,

870
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,790
I...

871
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,050
It's all my fault.

872
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,719
I'm the one to blame.

873
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,290
If she is to report anyone,

874
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:15,290
it should be me.

875
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,630
If she claims for compensation,

876
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:17,489
I'll pay for it.

877
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,000
Are you stupid?

878
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,330
Are you out of your mind?

879
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,530
Did you learn the law for nothing?

880
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,639
You wanna pay for it?

881
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,630
You were moved by their love?

882
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,929
Where was your brain when you did that?

883
00:34:28,929 --> 00:34:31,389
Did you watch too many romantic soap operas?

884
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,670
Now, the whole thing is over.

885
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:42,590
From now on,

886
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,960
do not do anything.

887
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:47,000
Can you promise me that?

888
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,639
Now you may go.

889
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,830
Ms. Fang,

890
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,880
they shouldn't be involved in this.

891
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,800
I know.

892
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:54,630
Xia Shu.

893
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,870
Just go.

894
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,850
Never speak of this matter again, alright?

895
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,090
Calm down,

896
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,700
and hide your emotions.

897
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,030
Just clear your mind.

898
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,070
Okay.

899
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,300
But I don't think

900
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,000
it'll get very serious.

901
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,630
In the end,

902
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,830
it won't evolve to be a grave situation.

903
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,510
Who knows if she had done anything else than delivering a message?

904
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,590
Ma Lili wouldn't mind

905
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:31,120
doing the nastiest things.

906
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,070
God knows what her next accusation will be.

907
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,990
Qiu Hua, I have only one request.

908
00:35:35,350 --> 00:35:36,760
Can we put aside

909
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:38,330
our prejudice against Xia Shu?

910
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,540
Is it prejudice?

911
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,610
Fine.

912
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,280
It's not prejudice.

913
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,870
But at this moment, our enemy

914
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:46,070
isn't Xia Shu, right?

915
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,560
Let's not be mad at her.

916
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:49,060
Just leave her alone

917
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,640
like she's a naive and trouble-making kid.

918
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,590
If you get Xia Shu out of your mind,

919
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,630
I believe you'll figure out a way

920
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,520
to deal with Ma Lili.

921
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,830
She's the one

922
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,350
that we should be fighting against, right?

923
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,480
Here's what I think.

924
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,790
She wants money, doesn't she?

925
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,320
We should make use of it and defeat her.

926
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,180
Ma Lili has been authorized by Xu Jianshe.

927
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:13,650
His real estate property

928
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,010
should be at her disposal now.

929
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,630
See?

930
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,870
No wonder you are my partner.

931
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:20,130
You're quick-witted.

932
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:20,750
Come on.

933
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,410
Let's check it out.

934
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,690
Stop being angry.

935
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,890
Qiu Hua and I did this case together.

936
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,050
If anything had gone wrong,

937
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,310
we should take the main responsibility.

938
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
I really don't think it's a big deal.

939
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,050
Xia Shu, are you sure

940
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,480
you didn't give that letter to Xu Jianshe?

941
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,370
I really didn't.

942
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,490
I memorized it after reading it once.

943
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,390
Given I had memorized it, why would

944
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,900
I take risks and deliver the letter?

945
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,160
I just told Xu Jianshe about the content.

946
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:48,760
Look.

947
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:49,970
It's not a big deal.

948
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,670
I wish it could be as simple as you say.

949
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,990
A ruling has been made

950
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,390
on Xu Jianshe's retrial.

951
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,990
He has been transferred to prison.

952
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:02,670
Ma Lili will see him soon.

953
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,120
What will they say when they meet up?

954
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:08,190
He trusts her so much.

955
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,570
If they plot against you and say

956
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:13,250
that you helped them falsify testimonies

957
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,900
and coached Xu Jianshe to plead not guilty,

958
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,580
what do you think will happen?

959
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,990
Now I want an answer from you.

960
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,520
Can you figure out a way to shut her up?

961
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,400
If you can't,

962
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,440
you'll have to pay her by yourselves.

963
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,650
I... I'll pay her.

964
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,870
We do have a solution.

965
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,200
What solution?

966
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:36,900
No matter what that is,

967
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:39,770
you must not violate the law or disciplines.

968
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,950
Don't worry.

969
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,630
Take it as a warning

970
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,210
from the firm.

971
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,100
Whatever approach you adopt,

972
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,800
the firm will deny all knowledge of it.

973
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,520
Got it.

974
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,050
You may go now.

975
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,310
Xia Shu, stay.

976
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,040
Have you asked you father

977
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,400
about what I requested?

978
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Did you hear that?

979
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,070
When things get serious,

980
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,880
they are the most unreliable people.

981
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,840
Have we ever thought of relying on them?

982
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,570
We'd better rely on ourselves.

983
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,360
What's your decision, Ms. Qiu and Ms. Luo?

984
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:40,870
On what?

985
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,800
We stopped representing Xu Jianshe

986
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,260
a long time ago, didn't we?

987
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,230
You owe me 300,000 yuan.

988
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,860
We don't owe you a penny.

989
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:49,290
But you,

990
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,750
on the contrary,

991
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,450
owe us the lawyer fee

992
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,670
for the retrial.

993
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:55,520
Aren't you afraid

994
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,980
that I'll report you to the law association?

995
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,380
She's quite forgetful.

996
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,740
Go out and you'll see a police station on your left,

997
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,390
and the law association on your right.

998
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,750
You don't need to give us

999
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,120
the same threatening speech again.

1000
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,560
Fine. You won't budge, will you?

1001
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,530
I'll talk to your supervisor.

1002
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,890
We'll go with you then.

1003
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,080
Ms. Fang,

1004
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,730
you came at the right time.

1005
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,920
Hasn't the problem been solved yet?

1006
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,980
Of course not. I haven't got paid yet.

1007
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:20,790
I did some thinking.

1008
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,730
Though you didn't save Jianshe out of prison,

1009
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,370
you did work diligently.

1010
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,950
I'll charge you 50,000 yuan less.

1011
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:27,410
Now I demand 250,000 yuan.

1012
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,310
Did you bend the rules or not?

1013
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,780
Admit it if you did.

1014
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:32,850
If necessary, return the money,

1015
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:34,160
and compensate the client.

1016
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,810
No. We didn't.

1017
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,190
How dare you deny it?

1018
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,140
Stop yelling.

1019
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,000
We didn't do any of that.

1020
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,390
Ma Lili, have you forgotten the evidence

1021
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,000
of you asking me to deliver authorization papers to Xu Jianshe

1022
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,480
is still kept in my phone?

1023
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,630
Do you want me to read

1024
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,110
the text message out loud?

1025
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,310
I didn't entrust you with that.

1026
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,280
But what I have here is enough to prove

1027
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,950
that you asked me to do something illegal.

1028
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,350
On that matter, I clearly rejected you.

1029
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,510
Ms. Fang,

1030
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,960
I entrusted Ms. Xia with this matter.

1031
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,550
I have a video to prove that.

1032
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:10,300
Meetings with criminal suspects are under surveillance cameras.

1033
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,270
You can go and check the footage.

1034
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,750
Ms. Xia Shu

1035
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,490
never handed anything

1036
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,080
to Xu Jianshe.

1037
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,090
What else do you have to say?

1038
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,380
Listen.

1039
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,060
If you don't give me the money,

1040
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,480
soon Xu Jianshe will sue you.

1041
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,370
When you met with him,

1042
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,480
you abetted him in reversing his testimony.

1043
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,130
I can prove it with a video of Ms. Xia's.

1044
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,420
What do you have?

1045
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,730
Come in.

1046
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,040
Sorry to interrupt.

1047
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:43,260
Ms. Qiu, Mr. He from Fangzheng Law Firm wants to see you.

1048
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,050
Well, Ms. Fang,

1049
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,130
I should get going.

1050
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,420
This way, please.

1051
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:52,410
Ms. Ma, are you busy?

1052
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:56,080
Does Mr. He look familiar to you?

1053
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:57,960
Who?

1054
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,700
I don't know him.

1055
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,060
What's that about, Yingzi?

1056
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,270
Ms. Fang, let me tell you.

1057
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:05,570
Mr. He

1058
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:08,450
now represents Xu Jianshe.

1059
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,320
Mr. Pan Shengyi

1060
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,520
used to be his mentor.

1061
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,380
As far as I know,

1062
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,480
the first trial Qiu Hua and I did

1063
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,370
for Xu Jianshe was on August 9.

1064
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,850
Before that,

1065
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,100
Ms. Ma

1066
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,860
had contacted Mr. Pan.

1067
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,470
They had Xu Jianshe sign the authorization

1068
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:27,630
papers that granted Ms. Ma the permission to dispose of his property.

1069
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,150
Listen.

1070
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,650
Stop talking nonsense.

1071
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,050
Can you prove that?

1072
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,860
Do you want me to invite Mr. He to the room

1073
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,710
and ask him to tell the truth?

1074
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:40,720
Ms. Qiu.

1075
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,560
Have a seat.

1076
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,760
-Have some coffee.
-Thank you.

1077
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:49,590
Mr. He,

1078
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,400
thank you for coming today.

1079
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,750
You're welcome.

1080
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,230
Previously, you gave me a kind reminder.

1081
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:56,490
I've always wanted to thank you for that.

1082
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,190
Why did you tell me to come in such a hurry?

1083
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,270
Nothing serious.

1084
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,720
I just wanted to ask you about something.

1085
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,760
Mr. Pan told you to bring authorization papers to Xu Jianshe.

1086
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,880
You have proof of that, don't you?

1087
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:09,980
Well...

1088
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,340
Even if you hadn't kept proof at that time,

1089
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,310
after I gave you that little reminder,

1090
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:16,770
I believe now you must have found something.

1091
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,290
We are both lawyers.

1092
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:22,570
You don't need to tell me the details.

1093
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,570
All I need to know is that you have proof.

1094
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,650
As you've seen,

1095
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,790
Ma Lili is in the meeting room now.

1096
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:30,320
She's here for a fight.

1097
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,190
What is it about?

1098
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,660
All sorts of trouble.

1099
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,540
Anyway, she's not a nice person.

1100
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,150
She's picking a fight with us today.

1101
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:41,420
One day, she might do the same to you.

1102
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,100
We should help each other at this time.

Ms. Qiu, let's cut to the chase.

1104
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:47,920
How can I help you?

1105
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:49,720
By appearing in front of her,

1106
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,350
you have already helped me.

1107
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,840
