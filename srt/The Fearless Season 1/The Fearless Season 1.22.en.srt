[Episode 22]

4
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,550
What should we do?

5
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:39,830
She is unwilling to tell us even after she left the company,

6
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:41,830
let alone those

7
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,490
who still work in the company.

8
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,070
What are you thinking?

9
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,440
I'm thinking

10
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,060
why I didn't fight back at the first time

11
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
when I suffered sexual harassment.

12
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,430
No girl

13
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,400
can keep calm for such a thing.

14
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,699
Some

15
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,610
may think it's their own fault.

16
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,150
Others may misunderstand

17
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,880
that their boss is fond of them,

18
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:19,270
thus having an illusion of being in love with their boss.

19
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,110
But for more people,

20
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,640
they have no other choices.

21
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:23,990
Take me for an example.

22
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,110
Just look how I am,

23
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,720
and we can imagine the hard times that they've been through.

24
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:35,990
Qiu Hua,

25
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,340
after we settle Guo Yu's case,

26
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,270
let's sue Han directly.

27
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,020
After all, you have sufficient evidence.

28
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,180
It's not that easy.

29
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,480
What are you afraid of when you have the evidence?

30
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,390
I can't even afford it,

31
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,340
even though he'll lose more than I'll do.

32
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,690
I have a weaker capital.

33
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,110
Yingzi,

34
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:01,210
leave this to me.

35
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:03,690
I won't let him go anyway.

36
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,960
Fine.

37
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,030
But remember,

38
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm here for you.

39
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,550
We can't inquire about

40
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,110
other victims one by one.

41
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,400
By the way,

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,530
there are two people we can try to do so.

43
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,480
One is Chen Jinghao.

44
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,510
She used to be Yang Weida's secretary as well.

45
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:36,950
Now she still works in the company, but her specific job has been changed.

46
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,160
It's weird

47
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,230
that she has the privilege

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,840
of going to work if she wants

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,150
and taking a vacation if she doesn't.

50
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,390
Once,

51
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,270
she didn't come to work for a week.

52
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,670
The finance department deducted her salary for being absent from her job.

53
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,990
She made a scene when she came back,

54
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,320
and the finance staff complained to the leader.

55
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,410
Unexpectedly,

56
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,990
Mr. Yang scolded the finance staff.

57
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,600
The other is Xia Linlin.

58
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,070
She used to be the most beautiful woman

59
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,210
in our company.

60
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,550
When her incident happened,

61
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,950
I had joined the company.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,350
What is

63
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,110
the incident?

64
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,790
At that time, I was a newcomer.

65
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,760
Mr. Yang was on a business trip.

66
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,990
The company planned to send me to go with him,

67
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,589
but Yang Weida asked Xia Linlin to go together.

68
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,470
I remember she was very happy

69
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,950
and thought it was a good chance

70
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,240
to learn from the trip with her boss.

71
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:29,300
However,

72
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,830
she fell sick

73
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,920
after she came back.

74
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,600
Then she left the company.

75
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,560
After that,

76
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,720
Yang Weida gave her compensation.

77
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,330
I don't know the exact amount.

78
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,830
Rumor has it

79
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,960
that it was a large amount of compensation

80
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,010
for Xia Linlin.

81
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,710
They also gossiped

82
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,960
that Yang Weida must have done something to Xia Linlin on the trip.

83
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,510
He must have harassed her.

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
That pervert

85
00:04:59,909 --> 00:05:01,110
won't let anyone go.

86
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,480
He's unlucky to meet us.

87
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,640
How about we split up?

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,360
Qiu Hua, go find Chen Jinghao.

89
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,180
I'll check the list of resignees

90
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,830
from Yang Weida's company in recent years.

91
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,110
Xia Shu.

92
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,910
You have a tough task.

93
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,030
What is it?

94
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,630
Go find Xia Linlin.

95
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,080
Xia Linlin?

96
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,480
Didn't she quit?

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,590
Where can I find her?

98
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,470
That's why I call it a tough task.

99
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:35,030
You can ask Guo Yu first,

100
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,590
and see if she

101
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,190
has Xia Linlin's contact information.

102
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,070
If not,

103
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,780
use your connections

104
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,030
to check the household registration files.

105
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,820
And then?

106
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,840
Then,

107
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,380
if you can get the household registration,

108
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,040
you should be able to find her.

109
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,310
And?

110
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,150
Well,

111
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,470
what do you want to ask?

112
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,950
After I find her,

113
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,150
what should I ask her? And how?

114
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,660
Xia Shu.

115
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,510
You're a grown-up.

116
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,040
Ask tactfully.

117
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,150
Do you understand?

118
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,720
I know what it means,

119
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,010
but how to ask tactfully?

120
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,270
Ms. Chen?

121
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,750
Hello, Ms. Chen.

122
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,410
Who are you?

123
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,840
There are two more.

124
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,180
Because they still work in the company,

125
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,860
I'm afraid they might have misgivings.

126
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,710
I heard their mumbling once.

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,700
They mumbled, with tears rolling down,

128
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,080
some words such as pervert.

129
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,630
I know that.

130
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,760
Who will help me if I help her?

131
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,659
Well,

132
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,030
your testimony is very important to me.

133
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,830
Later,

134
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,630
after being harassed,

135
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,000
I could tell that the one they talked about was Yang Weida.

136
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,260
But sexual harassment

137
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,670
never happened to me.

138
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:01,710
Ms. Chen.

139
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,190
Go back to work, please.

140
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,200
What about their names?

141
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,760
Liang Yanping and Liu Jing.

142
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:11,910
Again.

143
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,390
What you said

144
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,150
has never happened to me!

145
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,240
Please leave.

146
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,720
Or we'll call the police.

147
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,260
Don't do that. I'm leaving.

148
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,150
I really don't want to face him now.

149
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,830
Not at all!

150
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,760
Hello.

151
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,150
Hello.

152
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,230
Can you please open the access control for us?

153
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm sorry.

154
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,659
The company doesn't meet visitors during working hours.

155
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:42,790
We are lawyers.

156
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,350
We're here for business.

157
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm sorry. According to the instruction,

158
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,670
during working hours,

159
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,600
no outsiders are allowed to enter.

160
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,590
Let's wait for a while.

161
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,430
It's almost noon.

162
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,850
There will be someone coming out for lunch.

163
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,150
You two

164
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,490
work so hard to make money.

165
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:10,570
By the way,

166
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,860
keep those without any duties outside.

167
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,250
Don't let them in.

168
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,920
You see?

169
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,590
Let's go.

170
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,100
In this case,

171
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,470
even if we meet the two girls,

172
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,110
there's nothing we can gain from them.

173
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:30,640
Let's go.

174
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,240
Let's go.

175
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:33,830
We need to get ready.

176
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,230
It's hard to handle the bank case with him around.

177
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,240
Why should we be afraid of him?

178
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,330
It's not that hard.

179
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,950
It's just a house.

180
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,370
I'll give it up at worst.

181
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,650
Leave it to him as the payment for his coffin.

182
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,800
Why are you laughing? I'm going crazy.

183
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,440
The smartest war

184
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,520
is about surrendering the enemy without fighting

185
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,910
and dismantling the enemy's camp before they can find out.

186
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,870
When we win the war,

187
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,750
we haven't even shown our move.

188
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,450
What do you mean, Mr. Chen?

189
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:01,370
I've asked around.

190
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:02,830
The two girls

191
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,230
took over Dong Dacheng's patent case.

192
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,760
Mr. Yang.

193
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,480
Do you know Dong Dacheng?

194
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,960
Yes.

195
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,990
Our company is the main product agent

196
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,690
of their company.

197
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:14,470
I

198
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,750
am a shareholder of their company.

199
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,110
I see.

200
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,510
It's easy now.

201
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,310
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

202
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,110
It's nothing.

203
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,720
So, you still haven't found the witness

204
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,300
who is willing to testify against him, right?

205
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,430
We're still trying.

206
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,320
Give up.

207
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,470
Why?

208
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,290
As you know,

209
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,510
if Guo Yu sues

210
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,420
alone,

211
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,410
the result won't be optimistic with her current evidence.

212
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,460
By then, Yang Weida

213
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,020
will sue her for the infringement of his rights to reputation.

214
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,880
Who do you think

215
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,570
will be most injured?

216
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,470
And.

217
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,630
What?

218
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,230
Someone from the company of Mr. Dong, whose patent case you're taking,

219
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,110
came today.

220
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,350
His company has a close business relationship

221
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,530
with Yang Weida's company.

222
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,470
If Yang Weida

223
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:10,600
is accused of sexual harassment,

224
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,290
it will have a great impact on his company.

225
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,290
So Mr. Dong wants us not to sue him.

226
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,430
If we insist on suing him,

227
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,130
he'll consider

228
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,410
to cancel your agency.

229
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,600
The patent case you take

230
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,350
is the most profitable one

231
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,520
after you work independently, right?

232
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,650
We've discussed it.

233
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,170
Though the patent case

234
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:36,870
involves a small value,

235
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,110
we can make impressive profits

236
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:41,240
from Mr. Dong's company in the future.

237
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,880
He creates

238
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,080
nearly one million stable revenue

239
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,410
for our firm every year.

240
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:49,110
This case

241
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,250
will bring you a stable income.

242
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,680
If you insist on

243
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:55,510
taking the case without any chance of winning or income,

244
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:57,170
and choose to give up this one,

245
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,990
is it worthwhile to do so?

246
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,230
Ms. Fang,

247
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,030
we have to discuss it,

248
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,370
OK?

249
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,660
The firm has made a decision.

250
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,120
You can discuss

251
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,770
how to execute it, OK?

252
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,880
[Liangcheng Law Firm—Professional Legal Escort]

253
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,880
[Your satisfaction is our greatest achievement]

254
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,720
-Guo Yu, you're here. -Mrs. Luo.

255
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm here to pay the attorney fee.

256
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,140
-It's 10,000 yuan in total. -No hurry.

257
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,110
I made you coffee and black tea.

258
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,310
What would you like to drink?

259
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,390
Black tea, please. It's a stomach-warming drink.

260
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,520
Thank you, Mrs. Luo.

261
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,280
Mrs. Luo,

262
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,600
who should I pay the fee to?

263
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,080
Guo Yu.

264
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,080
I have something

265
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:09,720
to tell you.

266
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,350
What is it?

267
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,940
We've asked around all the people

268
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,310
on the list you gave us.

269
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,470
No one is willing to testify against Yang Weida.

270
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,470
I know that.

271
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,510
It's unlucky for any girl to suffer it.

272
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,320
If it's exposed,

273
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,920
the public will tarnish them.

274
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,420
The world is so unfair.

275
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,200
But,

276
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,470
if no one else

277
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,720
is willing to testify against him about sexual harassment,

278
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,830
the lawsuit

279
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,690
would be very risky.

280
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,240
I'm ready.

281
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,140
It doesn't matter if I would lose.

282
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,490
No, you are not.

283
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,870
You have no idea

284
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,230
of how terrible the result would be.

285
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,830
If we accuse Yang Weida of sexual harassment

286
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,630
and the court takes the lawsuit,

287
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,950
it goes well when the court issues a mediation decision,

288
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:00,470
right?

289
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,110
But what would be the decision like?

290
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,220
There's no evidence to prove

291
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:07,390
Yang Weida's sexual harassment.

292
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,470
With such a decision,

293
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,510
he could take it

294
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,590
as evidence

295
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,980
to sue you for infringement of his rights to reputation.

296
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,960
You have no evidence to sue him for sexual harassment.

297
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,480
But he has the evidence

298
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,810
to sue you for the crime you've committed.

299
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,100
In the end,

300
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,650
you may not only lose

301
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,370
but also be criticized

302
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,940
for extorting his money

303
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,270
with sex.

304
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,920
Have you ever thought about it?

305
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:51,470
Guo Yu,

306
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,230
as your lawyers,

307
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,110
we're obligated to consider your best interests.

308
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,060
In this case,

309
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,770
both Ms. Qiu and I are suffering

310
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,600
and unwilling to lose.

311
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,110
But,

312
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,480
we've done everything we could.

313
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,520
Under such circumstances,

314
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,700
we suggest you

315
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,760
give up.

316
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,120
It's doomed, right?

317
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,390
Yes.

318
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,230
Only one person is testifying.

319
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,630
And there's no evidence.

320
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,330
We have to be responsible for the client, right?

321
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,530
We do.

322
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,350
We have to take the client's best interests

323
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,320
as priority.

324
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:01,230
If we know that this lawsuit

325
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:02,870
will hurt her seriously,

326
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,670
we have the obligation to remind and even stop her.

327
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,590
Forget it. There is no turning back on this matter.

328
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,230
Are we making the best choice for her?

329
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:21,990
Of course.

330
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,920
Fine.

331
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,290
I admit

332
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,290
it has something to do with the patent case.

333
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,510
But Qiu Hua,

334
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,760
we are under great economic pressure, right?

335
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,160
Yes.

336
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,210
The patent case

337
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:40,950
is the only opportunity for us to make a living.

338
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:41,350
Yes.

339
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,070
Forget it.

340
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,730
Guo Yu has agreed to give up.

341
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,550
Forget it.

342
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:07,590
Guo Yu.

343
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,190
Why are you back?

344
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,170
I met her in the parking lot

345
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
and brought her here.

346
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,610
Guo Yu, have a seat.

347
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,330
Qiu Hua and Yingzi.

348
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,800
I've found a witness.

349
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,360
Who?

350
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,470
Xia Linlin.

351
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,870
I found her household registration through my connections.

352
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,000
She's now in a rehabilitation center.

353
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,290
Yang Weida ruined Xia Linlin.

354
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,850
Look how miserable she turns out.

355
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,010
Because of such a pervert,

356
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,000
the girl's life is ruined.

357
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,600
If we don't stop him,

358
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,650
more girls will get hurt.

359
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,600
What's wrong?

360
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,990
Don't you get it?

361
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,350
We have a witness.

362
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:54,030
But she's in a rehabilitation center.

363
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,510
So what?

364
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,350
Yang Weida ruined her life.

365
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,550
That's why she gave herself up and became a drug addict.

366
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,230
Of course,

367
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:01,910
we all believe

368
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,069
your words.

369
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,750
But in court,

370
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,750
how many people will believe

371
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,280
a drug addict's testimony?

372
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,050
But...

373
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,300
She'll be released soon, anyway.

374
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,560
We'll let her testify when she comes out.

375
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,990
In court,

376
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,450
the other party will question her morality.

377
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,440
Her testimony

378
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
will be greatly weakened

379
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
because she used to be a drug addict.

380
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,390
Then,

381
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,260
what do you mean?

382
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,310
Guo Yu

383
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:34,090
has made up her mind.

384
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,310
We still choose to go to labor arbitration.

385
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,910
What do you mean?

386
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,530
Did you persuade her to give up?

387
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,610
Yes.

388
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,290
We are her lawyers.

389
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,790
We should put her best interests first

390
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,650
and consider what's best for her.

391
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,720
Do you want to see this photo again?

392
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,510
Take a look.

393
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,510
Do you want to see it?

394
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,520
Are you willing to go to labor arbitration

395
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,450
and let Yang Weida get away with it?

396
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,060
Guo Yu.

397
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,150
Look.

398
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,670
You can't give up!

399
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:11,330
Xia Shu, be professional, all right?

400
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,260
You're a lawyer.

401
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,480
Guo Yu is our client.

402
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,750
You can't provoke her into accusing him of sexual harassment.

403
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,230
If we don't take this case,

404
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,550
how many more girls will be hurt?

405
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,510
Do you know that?

406
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,180
Mrs. Luo,

407
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,470
I still want to sue him for sexual harassment.

408
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,640
Even if I lose

409
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:35,150
and he sues me for defamation,

410
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,150
I'll do so.

411
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,860
Guo Yu insists on suing him for sexual harassment,

412
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,550
even if she could end up losing.

413
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,080
Ms. Fang,

414
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,560
we can't refuse it

415
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,190
in the face of such a picture.

416
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,310
You once told us

417
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,790
you hoped young people in the firm

418
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:02,590
can realize their ideals of law.

419
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,670
If we don't take the case,

420
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,240
we'll never be at ease.

421
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,710
Have you all

422
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,930
made up your mind?

423
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,470
Yes.

424
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,560
Then,

425
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,690
you go find the evidence first.

426
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,350
Leave this to me.

427
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:21,930
What will you do?

428
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,010
There will always be a perfect way.

429
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,520
Don't worry about it.

430
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,320
Leave it to me.

431
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,710
But,

432
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,450
I have to remind you.

433
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,910
If you want to sue him for sexual harassment,

434
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,790
we can't use this witness.

435
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,000
You must keep looking for other witnesses.

436
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:44,610
If you fail to do so,

437
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,100
the firm has to

438
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,770
forbid you from taking it.

439
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,310
Got it.

440
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,120
Let's refresh ourselves first.

441
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,450
Get something to drink.

442
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,920
What do you want to drink? Coffee, tea,

443
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,750
or soda.

444
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,200
Soda, please.

445
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,890
Okay.

446
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,110
Xia Shu, what about you?

447
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:06,930
Coffee.

448
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,130
-Okay. -Thank you.

449
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,400
I want coffee, too.

450
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,480
What should we do now?

451
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,840
We've inquired everyone.

452
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,270
I have an idea.

453
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,010
What is it? Tell us.

454
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,740
I think we should cast a wide net

455
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,360
to investigate

456
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,910
the Weida Fund

457
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:33,030
that's especially designed for poor girls.

458
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,910
We need to know how many girls the fund has sponsored.

459
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,280
If Yang Weida is so unrestrained,

460
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,150
he must have harassed

461
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,960
many college girls.

462
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,040
Some of them

463
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,840
may not work in the Weida Group,

464
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:46,860
and have fewer concerns.

465
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah.

466
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,950
Why didn't I think of it?

467
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,190
I'll look for them.

468
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,120
You've grown up.

469
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,030
Where can you find them?

470
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,090
His club must be legally registered.

471
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,230
Since then,

472
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,640
there must be records online.

473
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,120
Besides, a man like him

474
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,170
would spread the news of his good deeds to the whole world.

475
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,270
It'll be easy to find them.

476
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:05,990
Xia Shu.

477
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,070
Are you upgraded?

478
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,400
Qiu Hua,

479
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,340
is this the original Xia Shu we know?

480
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,670
She's quite something.

481
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,340
Leave it to me.

482
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,220
I'll settle it.

483
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,800
It is great to be young.

484
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,670
Mr. Wang.

485
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:27,390
Hello, Ms. Fang.

486
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,650
Nice to meet you. Have a seat.

487
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:29,250
OK.

488
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,230
Mr. Wang,

489
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,710
this case is hard to deal with,

490
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,310
but as long as you win,

491
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,920
your law firm will benefit from it in terms of reputation.

492
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,290
If you lose,

493
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,990
your law firm won't suffer any loss.

494
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:42,430
Our former lawyers

495
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,870
will help you organize evidence materials

496
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,360
to prepare for the trial.

497
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,920
If we win the lawsuit,

498
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,950
the honor

499
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,160
will be all yours.

500
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,080
Thank you so much, Ms. Fang.

501
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,760
How much is the commission?

502
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,230
I'm sorry.

503
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,920
It's just 10,000 yuan.

504
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,110
We won't take a penny. It's all yours.

505
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,810
I don't mean so, Ms. Fang.

506
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,810
Since

507
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,480
the case isn't profitable

508
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:06,340
and

509
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,670
requires so much time and effort,

510
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,800
I wonder what do you want from the case.

511
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:11,880
To be honest,

512
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,150
I didn't want to take it at first.

513
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,660
But our firm's young lawyers

514
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:20,470
have their persistence

515
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,020
and senses of justice

516
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,290
and leave me

517
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,710
no other choice but to accpet it.

518
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,470
Mr. Dong.

519
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,740
How is it, Ms. Fang?

520
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,930
As you wish,

521
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,140
we've handed over the case.

522
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,960
But as the legal advisor of your company,

523
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,310
I'd like to remind you kindly.

524
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:46,430
Yang Weida's case

525
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,550
is not as simple as you think.

526
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,400
You need to be prepared.

527
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,470
Fine.

528
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,090
As long as our company

529
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,610
can make an explanation to his company.

530
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,090
We've done everything we can, right?

531
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,620
Yang

532
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,500
should be taught a lesson.

533
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,600
This,

534
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,750
this,

535
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,350
and this.

536
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,930
Nine in total. Take a look.

537
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,050
You mean

538
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,230
the fund

539
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,710
has sponsored over 40 girls.

540
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,000
And he only met nine of them.

541
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,670
It's the opposite.

542
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:30,110
Only nine girls he has never met.

543
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,240
He met the rest

544
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,190
with the excuse of comforting, visiting, or continuing to care.

545
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:35,990
How many girls are still in contact with

546
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,070
the Weida Group?

547
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,510
This is what I want to say.

548
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,720
Except for the two

549
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,990
who are still working in the Weida Group,

550
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,870
the rest of those who met with him

551
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,870
have no contact with the company.

552
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,680
There was a reporter

553
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,470
who wanted to write an article about this.

554
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,190
He aimed to criticize the girls for

555
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,390
being ungrateful.

556
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,460
Yang Weida suppressed the event.

557
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,120
Others even praised him for his understanding.

558
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,620
In fact, he didn't want to make it a big deal.

559
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,370
More than 30. That's more than enough for us to make headway.

560
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:01,940
Are we going to find them now?

561
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,940
Don't be anxious.

562
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,910
The one who's meeting them has to reassure them

563
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:07,950
that even if there is a court session for the case,

564
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,630
due to personal privacy,

565
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,070
there will be no public trial.

566
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,270
Everyone's testimony

567
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,570
will be strictly confidential

568
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:14,890
and won't be leaked out.

569
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,150
Xia Shu, did you get that?

570
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:16,910
Yes.

571
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,360
Hey, this is Qiu Hua.

572
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:26,160
Okay.

573
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,330
To retain the patent case

574
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,310
and prevent it from interfering with

575
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:34,230
your case,

576
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,780
I made such arrangements.

577
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
Is it acceptable?

578
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,640
Sure.

579
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:39,270
We didn't take this case

580
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,860
for money or fame.

581
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,390
It's a good arrangement.

582
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:45,390
After all, the case of Mr. Dong's company

583
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,140
is very important to us.

584
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,550
If you want to continue with this case,

585
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,500
the firm wants to

586
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,990
hand over the patent case to someone else,

587
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:58,900
so that the patent case will go smoothly.

588
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:02,280
Of course, you did the preliminary preparations.

589
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,360
In the future,

590
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,670
you'll get part of the agency fee.

591
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,410
About one-third.

592
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,650
Ms. Fang.

593
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,660
We...

594
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,740
We can handle the two cases together.

595
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,610
It's not about that.

596
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:18,540
After talking with Mr. Dong, I realized

597
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,180
Yang Weida

598
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,170
is a major shareholder of Mr. Dong's company.

599
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,150
Yang Weida's attitude

600
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,510
is very important to Mr. Dong.

601
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,870
What I want to do now

602
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,610
is to separate the two cases

603
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,900
completely.

604
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,910
In this way,

605
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,800
our firm can keep the patent case.

606
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:40,230
It's important to pursue justice,

607
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,590
so it is to make money.

608
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,570
If you

609
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,470
still want to take this case…

610
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,890
Can we get half of the fee?

611
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,580
Only one-third.

612
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,790
There's a price to pursue justice.

613
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,890
Who are you going to give this case to?

614
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,660
This is new evidence brought by Mr. Dong.

615
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,670
Mr. Tao,

616
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,110
if you take it,

617
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:16,970
we will be relieved.

618
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,440
Luo Yingzi,

619
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,140
now you know how to flatter.

620
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:21,840
No.

621
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:22,700
Mr. Tao,

622
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:24,650
according to Ms. Fang,

623
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,180
we only take one-third.

624
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,970
But can you let us continue to participate in it?

625
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,300
We can learn from you.

626
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,510
It's great to be young.

627
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,600
Tao Zheng, you're so hypocritical.

628
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,640
I feel annoyed when speaking of Yang Weida.

629
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,710
If I ever meet him...

630
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:56,530
-All I want to do is hit him! -Xiao Ailing is willing to testify

631
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:58,130
that when she was in college,

632
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,880
Yang Weida asked her to visit the company

633
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:03,450
and blocked her in the office to harass her.

634
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,590
Are you done with me?

635
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,800
I said I don't want to say anything!

636
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,510
Don't disturb my work.

637
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,510
This way, please.

638
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,630
Yin Qiao's experience is even worse.

639
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,710
When Yang Weida

640
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,960
visited her house in the name of comforting her,

641
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,150
he sexually harassed her on her bed after drinking alcohol.

642
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:16,950
Liang Aiai

643
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,360
was sexually harassed

644
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:21,270
many times by Yang Weida when she interned in the Weida Group.

645
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:23,470
It caused great trouble in her life.

646
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:24,990
Later, she got depression.

647
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,110
Zhang Min and Liang Aiai

648
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:28,230
both suffer from depression.

649
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,430
He touched my butt when I got some water.

650
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,550
The worst thing is

651
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,470
that my boyfriend broke up with me...

652
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:33,400
-Because of this. -Shan Guiping

653
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,450
used to work in the Weida Group.

654
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,470
She was sexually harassed by Yang Weida many times.

655
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,230
Most importantly,

656
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,390
she kept all the messages sent by him

657
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,030
on her phone.

658
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,620
Those messages can prove

659
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,730
Yang Weida's verbal

660
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,030
and physical behavior of sexual harassment.

661
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:48,070
Call me anytime

662
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,090
if you need.

663
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,470
Okay, thank you.

664
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,410
With Guo Yu, there are six of them.

665
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:56,150
I don't believe the judge would have no conscience.

666
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,680
With six girls' testimony,

667
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,470
I don't think he would decide that there's no sexual harassment conducted by Yang Weida.

668
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,460
Good, Xia Shu.

669
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,190
I won't agree

670
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:05,320
if anyone questions your capability.

671
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,320
Mr. Yang.

672
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:08,910
Mr. Yang.

673
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,680
You're here.

674
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,420
Take a seat.

675
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:10,850
Okay.

676
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,060
Bad news.

677
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,280
You need to respond to a lawsuit immediately.

678
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,380
What is it for?

679
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,140
Sexual harassment.

680
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,620
Does Guo Yu really want to go to court?

681
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:29,680
Yeah.

682
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:31,940
So, Mr. Yang,

683
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,660
if you continue

684
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,940
to hire us as your agents,

685
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,180
please sign the agreement first.

686
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,610
[Agreement of Agency]

687
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,590
And as a lawyer,

688
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,090
I need to record

689
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,720
the dialogue with the client.

690
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,450
Is that okay?

691
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,070
Okay.

692
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,620
Give me a second.

693
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:52,310
Let Mr. Yang sign the agreement first.

694
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,090
It's okay.

695
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,710
I know you two are good friends.

696
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,080
But this is the rule.

697
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,480
Mr. Yang,

698
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,630
if you want us to be your agents,

699
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,160
please sign these two agreements first.

700
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,710
Okay.

701
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,300
It's costly.

702
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,480
It's okay, Mr. Yang.

703
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,940
You can hire someone else.

704
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,690
According to our agreement,

705
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,320
you have to transfer 300,000 yuan

706
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,870
to the account of our law firm today.

707
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,520
No problem.

708
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,130
Okay.

709
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:41,620
Okay, thank you, Mr. Yang.

710
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,680
Shall we continue?

711
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:43,430
Okay.

712
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,760
What I care about most is

713
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,190
whether they have evidence of your sexual harassment.

714
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,620
Do you mean Guo Yu?

715
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,340
Is there anyone else?

716
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,770
Guo Yu

717
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,430
has the messages I sent her.

718
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,800
But they can be explained

719
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,070
from various perspectives.

720
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,370
Others

721
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,120
may have the messages

722
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,350
I sent to them.

723
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,960
If they have the evidence,

724
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,280
you'll be in danger.

725
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,660
You'll surely do.

726
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:24,990
Don't waste time.

727
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,300
Come on.

728
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,280
Let's talk about how things will be going.

729
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:27,770
Come on.

730
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,110
I suggest

731
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,820
we speak on Weibo first.

732
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,760
If you make it public,

733
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:34,070
the public

734
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,790
will definitely be on the victims' side.

735
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,720
We need to control public opinion.

736
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,780
I disagree.

737
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,020
If we expose the truth,

738
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,500
the evidence will be exposed as well.

739
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,830
This will be bad for the trial

740
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,650
in court.

741
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,360
Besides,

742
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,720
we don't know

743
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,030
who the judge will be.

744
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,250
What would the judge think about

745
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,850
the public opinion warfare?

746
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,070
What can he think?

747
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,960
If a girl is sexually harassed,

748
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,150
will the public support the bad guy?

749
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,230
The judge will pity her

750
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,730
when he sees these comments.

751
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,340
Do you think public opinion is so easy to control?

752
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,200
How much evidence do you have now?

753
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,470
The whole society

754
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,390
will keep an eye on the evidence you have.

755
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:06,330
If you can't show the evidence,

756
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,790
the public opinion will reverse in a minute.

757
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,650
Aren't we still looking for evidence?

758
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:13,050
I don't believe we can't find anything new.

759
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,480
Guo Yu, what do you think?

760
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,810
I don't want to post it online.

761
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,480
I don't want to be the focus of public opinion either.

762
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
If my family finds out,

763
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,590
the neighbors will gossip.

764
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,800
If you're afraid of being gossiped about,

765
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,610
I advise you not to go to court.

766
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,210
It

767
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,520
will be found out sooner or later.

768
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,250
You'll be gossiped about then.

769
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,200
I mean

770
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,830
I want my parents to know as late as possible.

771
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,360
Xia Shu, stay with Guo Yu for a while.

772
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,070
I'll talk with Qiu Hua.

773
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,400
I think Guo Yu

774
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,020
has no idea about the issue.

775
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,260
I personally prefer Xia Shu's opinion.

776
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,960
What does Xia Shu know?

777
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,610
She makes any decision out of passion.

778
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,850
It's unrealistic.

779
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,520
Calm down.

780
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:15,400
Listen to me.

781
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,280
In this case,

782
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,590
we have too little evidence.

783
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,460
We have to mobilize all resources

784
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,590
to fight against Yang Weida.

785
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,760
Admittedly,

786
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:27,800
public opinion is a kind of resource.

787
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,830
The topic of women's rights is getting popular.

788
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,030
In the public opinion of similar cases,

789
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,410
the public is usually on the women's side.

790
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,310
I'm not sure that the court's decision

791
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,410
will be affected by public opinion.

792
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,090
But speaking for oneself

793
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,860
and creating a better public opinion environment

794
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,590
are beneficial, aren't they?

795
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,140
I expressed my opinion.

796
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:49,710
It's very likely that

797
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,860
after we expose the sexual harassment case,

798
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,160
it'll be heatedly discussed immediately.

799
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,020
The public will care about Guo Yu.

800
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,450
But then?

801
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,980
Do we have evidence to support what we said?

802
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,590
No.

803
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,080
Can you control public opinion?

804
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,350
But we have so little evidence now.

805
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,110
We need a lot of witnesses.

806
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,110
When this event attracts wide attention,

807
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,770
those who were not brave enough to speak out

808
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,500
might have the courage to do so.

809
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,160
Isn't that in favor of us?

810
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,580
Yingzi,

811
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,430
you're oversimplifying the issue.

812
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:26,440
What kind of public opinion you're talking about?

813
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,640
Is it the public opinion in a big city like Jingbei?

814
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,110
People here are of better manners

815
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,370
and broader-sighted.

816
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,570
They have their own thoughts and discussions

817
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:35,390
on social trending events like this.

818
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,990
About the awakening of female consciousness.

819
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:38,990
Do you know

820
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,890
what it means for the small places

821
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,410
where Guo Yu and I live?

822
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,930
Different from you,

823
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,880
I do not just want to

824
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,400
win this case.

825
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,190
What I am more concerned about is

826
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,320
whether Guo Yu can survive in this city

827
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,830
if we lose.

828
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,210
She is just a secretary

829
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,680
without an outstanding appearance,

830
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,410
higher education background,

831
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,400
or profound connections.

832
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,170
If she accuses her boss of sexual harassment,

833
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,500
which company will hire her in the future?

834
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,780
She can only go back to her hometown in that case.

835
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:06,730
But in her hometown,

836
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:08,659
there will be different opinions.

837
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:10,940
People there will scold her

838
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,530
for being ungrateful, making a big deal out of it,

839
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,530
being shameless,

840
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,440
and extorting money by seducing men.

841
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,460
They don't have their own thoughts.

842
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:21,949
Their opinions will only depend on

843
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:24,080
the court's final decision for Guo Yu.

844
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:32,100
When I came to this city,

845
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,060
I swore

846
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,239
no matter how awful my life is,

847
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,630
I would never go back to my hometown.

848
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,389
But I'm afraid that one day,

849
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,250
I can't make a living here anymore

850
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,489
and I have to go back.

851
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,350
I don't know if Guo Yu has the same thought.

852
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,210
I see.

853
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,270
I'll listen to your opinion. Let's go.

854
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,080
Will they expose this first?

855
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:21,190
If we don't,

856
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:22,390
will they?

857
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,710
No matter they expose it or not,

858
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,340
let's do it first.

859
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,850
Unscrupulous Chen

860
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,750
does whatever he wants.

861
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,600
He won't give up this method.

862
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:32,650
Mr. Yang,

863
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,610
you have to take the moral high ground.

864
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,960
Guo Yu

865
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,390
got into college

866
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,640
with the help of the Weida Fund.

867
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,130
It's in favor of you.

868
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,870
Her poverty

869
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,950
will be your most powerful weapon to fight back.

870
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,740
If they start the public opinion warfare,

871
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,550
we must avoid making

872
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,820
this event the focus of public opinion.

873
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,700
But we should not ignore that

874
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,680
it's easy for public opinion to reverse in a very short time.

875
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,010
So this matter should not

876
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,710
be exposed by you

877
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,850
or the Weida Group.

878
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,660
But if we do not expose it,

879
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,120
who will speak for us?

880
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,560
Someone will.

881
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,990
Why?

882
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,530
It's not only for Guo Yu

883
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,570
but also for other victims,

884
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,380
and those

885
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,910
who are ready to testify for us.

886
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,430
Many kiss the baby for the nurse's sake.

887
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,400
We're not doing this for the plaintiff,

888
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,630
but for others.

889
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,400
Others who could testify for her.

890
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,280
If Yang Weida manipulates public opinion,

891
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,130
maybe they'll back down.

892
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,470
In the past years...

893
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,040
In the past years...

894
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,470
Weida Fund worked hard

895
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,450
to help the poor

896
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,830
and has established a good social image.

897
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,710
All the victims he harassed

898
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,040
could only swallow down the smashed teeth.

899
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,160
In this case,

900
00:36:46,290 --> 00:36:49,710
our strategy is to create an image of innocence and generosity

901
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,970
and sticks to our social responsibility.

902
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,410
Now our strategy

903
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,990
is to be tolerant and resistant.

904
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,590
We shall adhere to the law and facts.

905
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,350
Meanwhile, we shall promise the victims

906
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,950
we won't uncover their personal information.

907
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:12,930
Hello.

908
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:13,910
Thank you.

909
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,640
Is the case initiated now?

910
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:28,940
Yes.

911
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,480
The battle is about to start.

912
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,990
We need to get prepared.

913
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:46,840
Mr. Yang.

914
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:49,120
A summon.

915
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,190
It's a court summon.

916
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,800
I received a summon!

917
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,600
Guo Yu

918
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,970
really sued me.

919
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,110
The court has made an announcement.

920
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,170
And there is already news on the Internet.

921
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,670
It makes sense.

922
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,160
Besides, we have already had a solution.

923
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,720
Don't worry.

924
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,860
Find your secretary

925
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,000
to record what I dictate.

926
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,470
We'll make an announcement.

927
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,200
Tian.

928
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,400
Sorry, no comment.

929
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,690
Yes. All matters are subject to the court announcement.

930
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:18,170
Bye.

931
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,420
Hello, this is the Liangcheng Law Firm.

932
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,460
What should I do, Qiu Hua?

933
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,990
A lot of people are calling me.

934
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,980
It's annoying.

935
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,990
You can turn off your phone if you're annoyed.

936
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,400
I'm her lawyer. Yes.

937
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,440
Sorry, no comment.

938
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,930
[Guo Yu]

939
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,480
Hello, Guo Yu.

940
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,580
Don't panic.

941
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,990
It will definitely become a social hotspot.

942
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,960
We just stick to

943
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,410
our strategy.

944
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,150
Ms. Guo Yu

945
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,430
did work for the Weida Group.

946
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,570
Then, she was fired

947
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:54,950
due to her lack of capability.

948
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,740
As for the compensation after the termination of the labor contract,

949
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,730
we were in a friendly negotiation with Ms. Guo Yu

950
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,850
till she sued Mr. Yang.

951
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,650
We solemnly declare that

952
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,720
Mr. Yang Weida

953
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,280
has never had any contact

954
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,200
with Ms. Guo Yu outside of work.

955
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,350
They were

956
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,230
just a superior and subordinate.

957
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,400
We understand

958
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,880
the hardship of Ms. Guo Yu after being fired.

959
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,110
But we feel regret and shocked

960
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,920
by Ms. Guo Yu's accusation.

961
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,220
We believe

962
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:29,080
the court will respect and restore the facts,

963
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:31,910
and clear Mr. Yang Weida's name.

964
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,510
All right.

965
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,330
That's all?

966
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,310
That's all.

967
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,160
How about

968
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,490
her being supported by the Weida Fund?

969
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:42,710
Mr. Yang,

970
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,240
I told you before.

971
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,750
This can't be publicized

972
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,650
by you or the Weida Group.

973
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,580
Let someone else

974
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,090
do it for you.

975
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,850
Yingzi, come here and look at this.

976
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,610
That's all, bye.

977
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:01,700
[Statement Regarding the Relationship of Mr. Yang Weida, President of the Weida Group, and Ms. Guo Yu]

978
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:59,040
Did you see that?

979
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,510
Since the Weida Group has made a statement,

980
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:03,370
why didn't they mention the fund provided to Guo Yu?

981
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,750
I'm reading the news.

982
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:09,220
Something must be wrong.

983
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,000
Are you Ms. Guo Yu?

984
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,640
Ms. Guo Yu,

985
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,190
can we talk about Yang Weida's sexual harassment case?

986
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:22,740
Ms. Guo Yu.

987
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,820
Ms. Guo Yu.

988
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:25,470
Ms. Guo Yu, please say something.

989
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:27,440
We've waited for a long time, Ms. Guo Yu.

990
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:27,870
Ms. Guo Yu.

991
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,190
I'm her lawyer.

992
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,120
She can't answer your interview now.

993
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,240
Please see our statement later.

994
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,100
Thank you. Please stop filming.

995
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:40,960
I don't believe you will never come back.

[Consultation Room]

997
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,070
Don't worry.

998
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,000
Didn't we run away just now?

999
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,990
Besides,

1000
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:48,180
even if everyone knows,

1001
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,840
they will support you, right?

1002
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,890
Don't worry.

1003
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,070
It's fine.

1004
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:54,220
Please wait a minute.

1005
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:54,900
Okay.

1006
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,570
What's wrong? What happened?

1007
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,550
We ran into many reporters on our way here.

1008
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,830
Luckily, we escaped.

1009
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:03,990
But it's unfair for us to keep quiet.

1010
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,190
I'm just afraid that my family will know about this.

1011
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,120
What should I do?

1012
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,850
Your family will find out sooner or later.

1013
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,690
Let me introduce them to you.

1014
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:14,810
Please come in.

1015
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:19,830
They are Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang

1016
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:20,990
from the Tianli Law Firm.

1017
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,990
This is Guo Yu.

1018
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,940
Nice to meet you.

1019
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,670
Hello.

1020
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,030
Guo Yu, we'll work together

1021
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,230
for your case later.

1022
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,520
Mrs. Luo and I will take the off-court part.

1023
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,380
Ms. Zhang and Mr. Wang will be in charge of the trial.

1024
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,550
I need you to cooperate with the two lawyers

1025
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,210
to review the evidence again.

1026
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:39,060
Okay, thank you.

1027

The food delivery hasn't arrived yet.

00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,330
Eat this first.

1029
00:41:46,810 --> 00:41:47,360
How is it?

1030
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:48,590
Any comments?

1031
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,700
It'll rank first among the trending topics.

1032
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,710
Many paparazzi

1033
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,610
lurked around Guo Yu's house

1034
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,940
and filmed many videos.

1035
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,480
When Xia Shu went to pick up Guo Yu,

1036
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,940
they ran into some of them.

1037
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,670
Fortunately, I told her

1038
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:05,910
not to accept the interview.

1039
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,010
Otherwise, she would say

1040
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,610
something she can't take back

1041
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,750
and take her safety

1042
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,580
to fulfill her sense of justice.

1043
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,160
Then,

1044
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,280
we need to remind her more.

1045
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,630
Here he comes!

1046
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,590
Mr. Yang! Mr. Yang!

1047
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,920
Mr. Yang!

1048
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:48,510
Look.

1049
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,130
People're supporting us.

1050
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,310
Yes.

1051
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:52,520
Look.

1052
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,430
I'm reading them.

1053
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,430
What's wrong?

1054
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,370
Isn't it good that the public is supporting us?
