[Episode 35]

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,580
I understand your difficulties.

5
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,289
So we've been persuading Mr. Xu

6
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,479
to give compensation.

7
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,140
As long as he is willing to compensate, everything will be easier.

8
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,380
Besides this,

9
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,490
if you need any help,

10
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:47,789
I'll do my best to assist.

11
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,110
I always believe that Jianshe is innocent.

12
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,380
But I've figured it out now.

13
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,430
No matter he's guilty or not,

14
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,950
as long as he's alive, there's hope.

15
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,150
Ms. Xia.

16
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,800
I wrote a letter to Jianshe.

17
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,820
I just want to encourage him

18
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,670
to better cooperate with you

19
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,960
to win the case as soon as possible.

20
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,680
When you meet him later,

21
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,990
can you please give this to him?

22
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,550
A letter?

23
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,950
Mrs. Ma,

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,460
you and Mr. Xu have divorced.

25
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,970
This is no longer a family letter.

26
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:39,440
According to the rules,

27
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:42,500
we are not allowed to deliver it for you.

28
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,850
I have to talk to Ms. Qiu and Ms. Luo...

29
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,940
Ms. Luo...

30
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,010
Ms. Xia.

31
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,790
I heard that

32
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,620
Ms. Luo is in trouble recently?

33
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,670
And Ms. Qiu,

34
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,910
I went to see her several times but I didn't see her.

35
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,120
Our case

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,990
is about to go to trial, Ms. Xia.

37
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,910
I can only count on you now.

38
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,220
You won't leave us alone

39
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,440
because our case is too minor, right?

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,370
Absolutely not.

41
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,640
The two lawyers have been

42
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
really busy recently.

43
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,829
But I promise you

44
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,579
we won't delay our work.

45
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,440
No one cares about Jianshe

46
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,240
except me.

47
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,110
Maybe this is his fate.

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,110
Thank you.

49
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,380
I'm so stubborn sometimes.

50
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,970
I don't even know...

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,070
I don't even know if I'm doing the right thing.

52
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,570
Mrs. Ma,

53
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,980
I'll keep this letter.

54
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,589
But I have to read it

55
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,370
before making a decision.

56
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,720
Thank you, Ms. Xia.

Thank you for helping me.

the blank power of attorney I let you sign last time.

65
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,100
Are you okay with it?

66
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes.

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,110
From now on, Qiu Hua and I

68
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,830
will be your lawyers.

The agency fee is one yuan.

70

You can pay it when you get out.

71
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,220
Thank you.

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,350
As far as we know,

73
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,820
it was reported by the bank.

74
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,390
Yes.

75
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:26,210
Our priority now

76
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,540
is to prove that you have nothing to do with this.

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,690
So,

78
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,690
you need to give us some important clues.

79
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,950
Ms. Fang,

80
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,980
I'm thinking we've been to the bank before.

81
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,790
We've seen the signature

82
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,909
on the document.

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,830
I can cooperate with the handwriting verification.

84
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,470
If we can get these documents from the bank

85
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,250
and complete the handwriting verification,

86
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,320
everything will be clear

87
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,320
after matching the two signatures.

88
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,790
Yes, that's right.

89
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,590
We'll mention it to the police.

90
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,240
But Yingzi, you have to know

91
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:00,110
the handwriting verification

92
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:02,470
needs a process and time.

93
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:04,120
There's no time to wait.

94
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,300
So

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,750
you need to provide other solid evidence.

96
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:08,820
Besides,

97
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,950
I heard from the police

98
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,170
they have witnesses.

99
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,230
I heard it from them, too.

100
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,870
But I think the witnesses they mentioned

101
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,970
were Liu Ming's parents.

102
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,750
It must be a false testimony.

103
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,590
Then we don't need to worry.

104
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,440
Ms. Fang,

105
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,360
can you ask the police to release me on bail now?

106
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,730
I can't stay here.

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,040
My mom is already lying in bed.

108
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,590
If my dad can't contact me

109
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,970
and gets emotional...

110
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,300
Yingzi, don't worry.

111
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,680
We will bring up the guarantor pending trial.

112
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,390
I'll keep it a secret from your parents.

113
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,470
Don't worry.

114
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,830
Qiu Hua, thank you.

115
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,920
Don't mention it.

116
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,210
By the way, Ms. Fang,

117
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:52,830
when we went to the bank last time,

118
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,240
Mr. Wang said

119
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,710
the CCTV was broken.

120
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,980
But I think they must have the videos.

121
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:58,970
Of course.

122
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,830
But I'm sure

123
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,310
he won't give it to us.

124
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,950
Yingzi.

125
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,450
How about

126
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,150
we turn to Chen Shuo?

127
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,120
After all, he's the attorney of the bank.

128
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,550
Can he get the surveillance video for us?

129
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,030
If he can help me,

130
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,480
it will be so great.

131
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,150
But I suspect it was his idea

132
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,500
to get me in.

133
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,780
Yingzi, don't blame him.

134
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,940
He is a lawyer.

135
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,190
He should protect his client's interests.

136
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,780
Let's think of another way.

137
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,440
Don't worry.

138
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,830
You must be Wen Li.

139
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,860
You haven't eaten. What are you watching?

140
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,230
No.

141
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,480
Nothing.

142
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,640
Hello.

143
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,660
Okay, I got it.

144
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,040
I'll be right there.

145
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,590
Take your time.

146
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,750
Where are you going?

147
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,470
Ms. Qiu.

148
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,630
What's up?

149
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,520
Luo Yingzi was taken away by the police.

150
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Don't you know?

151
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,789
I didn't know.

152
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,919
How can such a righteous person commit a crime?

153
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,780
What did she do?

154
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,110
I know. I see.

155
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,520
She was arrested for maintaining justice on the street?

156
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,910
She was reported

157
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,030
by your client, Civil and Commercial Bank.

158
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,890
Don't you know?

159
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,840
She was...

160
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,040
I really didn't know about it.

161
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,190
Why was it so serious?

162
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,590
What did they sue her for?

163
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,160
Didn't you come up with this idea?

164
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,350
Not me...

165
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,070
I don't believe they can

166
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,730
come up with such a despicable idea on their own.

167
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:11,120
Does that mean I'm very despicable?

168
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,060
It's despicable to frame others.

169
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,110
Mr. Chen,

170
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,970
you should be loyal to your clients.

171
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:21,170
But if you deliberately frame your peers,

172
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:23,190
I don't think there's a bottom line.

173
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,510
Luo Yingzi's mother has been in a coma for a long time.

174
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,910
Her father is the only one in her family now.

175
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,940
If anything happens to her,

176
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,780
their family will be doomed.

177
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,280
Ms. Qiu.

178
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,190
We are both lawyers.

179
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,150
When did you change your profession

180
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,800
and become a writer?

181
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,610
Her family is having a hard time, right?

182
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,950
Does she need donations?

183
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,480
Does she?

184
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,270
You deliberately framed your peer.

185
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,620
How could you do that?

186
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:47,130
She's not my colleague.

187
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,500
In this case,

188
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,040
she was clearly involved.

189
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,080
Luo Yingzi was framed by her husband.

190
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,120
She's innocent.

191
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,850
You must have known that.

192
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,590
She's under arrest.

193
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,410
If we can't prove her innocence,

194
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,950
whether she will be convicted or not,

195
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,150
her lawyer qualification will be gone.

196
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,350
Although you two always argued,

197
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,370
I can see that you admire her.

198
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,630
If she really goes to prison,

199
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,270
or gets disbarred,

200
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,730
won't you feel guilty?

201
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,110
You know what she called me.

202
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,190
I'm the famous "Unscrupulous Chen".

203
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,950
As a lawyer,

204
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,230
I only have one belief,

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,100
which is to win.

206
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,960
But you can definitely find someone from the banks in the province who has connections in that bank.

207
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,630
It has nothing to do with Luo Yingzi.

208
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,120
There must be CCTV in the bank.

209
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,040
Can you please help us get it?

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,930
What do you mean?

211
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,750
You want me to betray my client?

212
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,430
So you won't help me?

213
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,990
I'm sorry.

214
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,600
I'm a very professional lawyer.

215
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,620
I can't help you.

216
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
No wonder Luo Yingzi always calls you Unscrupulous Chen.

217
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,800
Now I know the reason.

218
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,770
Hold on, please.

219
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,790
I want to ask you about a person.

220
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,140
I don't have time to answer your questions.

221
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,500
Just one word.

222
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,670
Is there a woman in your firm

223
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,380
who became a business partner right after becoming a practicing lawyer, right?

224
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,640
What's her name again?

225
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,830
Xia Shu.

226
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,840
What's wrong?

227
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,630
Why do you ask about her?

228
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,160
What's it got to do with you?

229
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:26,780
Nothing.

230
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,880
It just occurred to me that

231
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,940
similar things happened in our firm.

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
He became a business partner right after becoming a practicing lawyer.

233
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,770
I also heard that

234
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,480
the father of the one in our firm

235
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,300
was promoted by the father of the one in your firm.

236
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,360
I'm just talking.

237
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,810
Ridiculous.

238
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,240
Mr. Tao.

239
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,500
Xia Shu.

240
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,110
Sit.

241
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:12,880
No, thanks.

242
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,860
I have a question to ask.

243
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,900
Go ahead.

244
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,350
As lawyers,

245
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,510
is it against the rules

246
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,190
if we deliver a letter to our client

247
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:24,450
when we meet him at the detention center?

248
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,810
What kind of letter?

249
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,910
It's just a letter from his family.

250
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,950
A letter from his family?

251
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,740
They can send it to the detention center.

252
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,140
You don't have to deliver for them.

253
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,740
Well...

254
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,180
The situation is a bit complicated.

255
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,100
They're divorced by mutual consent.

256
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,900
They are not relatives anymore.

257
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,480
In that case,

258
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,670
I don't think you should assist with the delivery.

259
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,670
They should deliver it themselves,

260
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,800
following the prescribed procedure.

261
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,670
If there's anything related to the case

262
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,950
or impeding the prosecution of a trial,

263
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,390
as lawyers,

264
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,680
we can't take the responsibility.

265
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,950
I see.

266
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,950
I'll talk to the client later.

267
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,120
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

268
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,950
Xia Shu.

269
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,750
You must explain it to your client clearly

270
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,500
that it's against the rules.

271
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,830
Besides,

272
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:17,010
you'd better keep a piece of evidence

273
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,770
to prove that

274
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,860
you didn't help deliver this letter.

275
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,010
No need.

276
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,470
She just asked me for a favor.

277
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:24,670
It's not obligatory.

278
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,370
Don't worry, Mr. Tao. See you.

279
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,990
I don't care. You must find someone to help us.

280
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:37,390
You don't know them?

281
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,960
But you can definitely find someone from the banks

282
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,690
in the province who has connections in that bank.

283
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,580
All right.

284
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,350
You go find them first.

285
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,950
I'll call you back later.

286
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:50,890
What happened?

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,880
Qiu Hua.

288
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,510
I want my dad to see if he can find someone

289
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,590
in the Civil and Commercial Bank through his guanxi,

290
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,500
and persuade them to withdraw the report.

291
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,510
But my dad said

292
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,270
Civil and Commercial Bank is a private bank.

293
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:03,730
So he doesn't know anyone.

294
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,580
Xia Shu.

295
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,980
You know someone in Da Zheng Law Firm, right?

296
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:14,480
Yes.

297
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,150
Ma Jian.

298
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,690
We grew up in the same yard.

299
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,680
Ma Jian's father

300
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,680
was promoted by your father, right?

301
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:22,620
His father worked for my father.

302
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,340
When my dad became the head of the NDRC,

303
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,630
he promoted his father to  a division chief.

304
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:30,630
And then my father recommended him to work in Jingbei.

305
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:32,430
What's wrong?

306
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,630
Nothing.

307
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,750
I turned to Chen Shuo just now.

308
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:37,150
He refused to help.

309
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,660
But he intentionally

310
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,200
mentioned Ma Jian.

311
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,020
It's quite strange.

312
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,480
I don't know what he meant.

313
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,530
Can you please go

314
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,590
and ask around?

315
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,700
No problem.

316
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,870
I'll do it right now.

317
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:07,160
Hello, I'm here for Mr. Ma Jian.

318
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,410
Hold on, please.

319
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,870
Xia Shu.

320
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:11,950
You...

321
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,600
Mr. Chen is waiting for you upstairs.

322
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
Let me take you upstairs.

323
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:18,500
How is Uncle Ma?

324
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:19,940
He's quite good.

325
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,360
We played tennis together a couple of days ago.

326
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,420
He was so handsome.

327
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,870
Here we are.

328
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,630
Come in.

329
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,510
Mr. Xue.

330
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,140
Ms. Xia is here for Mr. Chen.

331
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,280
Where's Mr. Chen?

332
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,820
He just went out.

333
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,010
Well...

334
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,880
How about this?

335
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,980
Sit here and wait for him.

336
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,210
He should be back soon.

337
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:47,470
Okay, I'll wait for him.

338
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:47,880
Okay.

339
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:48,990
Ma Jian.

340
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,630
Have you had lunch?

341
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,870
I was about to.

342
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:52,780
Wait for me.

343
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:53,680
Let's have lunch together.

344
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,080
Okay.

345
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,840
Just stay here and wait for him.

346
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:57,960
Ms. Xia.

347
00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:00,440
There's lots of important information

348
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,570
on Mr. Chen's laptop. Please don't...

349
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,730
Okay.

350
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,829
Where did you get this video?

351
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,869
Do you have to know it, Ms. Fang?

352
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,260
I don't need to know.

353
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,619
Here you go.

354
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,040
Hand it over to the police now.

355
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,569
Okay.

356
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:26,849
Well done.

357
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,330
I was too nervous.

358
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,910
Or I would have copied all the information back.

359
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,470
It's enough.

360
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,870
You've done well enough.

361
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,910
This is the woman

362
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,970
who went with Liu Ming to get the loan.

363
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,280
She's not Luo Yingzi.

364
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,690
Her real name is Wen Li.

365
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,510
She's Liu Ming's lover.

366
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,680
Now they escaped abroad together.

367
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
We've applied for a handwriting verification.

368
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,750
Look at the signature on this power of attorney agreement.

369
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,550
This is Luo Yingzi's signature.

370
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,420
How about this?

371
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,640
We'll investigate it immediately

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,030
and get back to you as soon as possible.

373
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,570
-Okay?
-Okay.

374
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,290
Thank you.

375
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,410
Mr. Zhang.

376
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,010
Hi, Ms. Fang.

377
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,950
What happened?

378
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,150
What on earth happened?

379
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:05,790
Don't...

380
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,400
Please calm down.

381
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,080
Mr. Zhang,

382
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:11,540
why did you release her so soon?

383
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,800
Luo Yingzi is suspected of fraud.

384
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,910
The facts are clear and the evidence is solid.

385
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:15,590
Mr. Wang,

386
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,630
you and the other party have a loan dispute.

387
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,990
You shouldn't have used our force

388
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:21,880
to attack her.

389
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:23,700
Besides,

390
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,230
we have checked the evidence you provided.

391
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,630
The signature is forged.

392
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,400
The person who accompanied the suspect

393
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,500
that day wasn't Luo Yingzi.

394
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,230
So she has nothing to do with this case.

395
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:34,770
No.

396
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,950
How did you know

397
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,980
it wasn't her

398
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,190
who came with Liu Ming that day?

399
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,620
You...

400
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,430
You can't just listen to her.

401
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,510
It's shown on the CCTV footage.

402
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,210
You knew it wasn't her,

403
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,530
yet you were here to make a false report.

404
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,660
We should hold you accountable

405
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,980
for slander.

406
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,070
Videos?

407
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,090
Mr. Zhang,

408
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:59,180
even if you think

409
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,080
the evidence is problematic,

410
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,160
you should at least

411
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,920
challenge the evidence in court, right?

412
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,330
It's inappropriate

413
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,870
to release her now.

414
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,090
Indeed.

415
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,550
We will find out the truth for sure.

416
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:20,580
Ms. Luo, sorry for the trouble.

417
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,460
Thank you for your cooperation.

418
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,940
Officer,

419
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,160
when you inquired me before,

420
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,560
you mentioned a witness.

421
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,040
I think this witness must have made a false statement.

422
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,910
You should go to the bottom of this.

423
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,000
Ms. Luo, please be assured.

424
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,660
We'll go to the bottom of this.

425
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,430
Mr. Chen, as lawyers,

426
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,520
it's our duty to do what we should do for our clients.

427
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,980
But you're too shameless.

428
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,150
Didn't you call me Unscrupulous Chen?

429
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,140
You finally see

430
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,580
how shameless I am today.

431
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:01,360
Mr. Chen,

432
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,660
I don't understand.

433
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,070
How could they get the surveillance video?

434
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,530
Is there a mole in the bank?

435
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,720
This is the problem

436
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
with your own internal management.

437
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,960
Mr. Wang,

438
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,380
this is all we can do.

439
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,990
You can hide the videos now,

440
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,670
but the truth will be found out when the case is on trial.

441
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,350
Perjury is serious matter.

442
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,240
All right.

443
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,300
Sit there and wait for me.

444
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,500
Let's discuss how to deal with it later.

445
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,000
Mr. Zhang,

446
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,200
I have another question.

447
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,870
Based on the current evidence,

448
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,430
can we further prove

449
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,400
that Liu Ming

450
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,330
did a loan fraud

451
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,190
on purpose?

452
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,160
Yes.

453
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,340
He took someone to disguise his wife

454
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,630
for a loan that day,

455
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,250
so we can confirm that he was committing fraud.

456
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,700
Does the Public Security Department

457
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,110
has a fox-hunting program

458
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,760
for financial crime?

459
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,720
Can you put him

460
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,040
on this list?

461
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:58,350
Yes.

462
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,960
We're already proceeding.

463
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,650
It's close to the state our son lives.

464
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,880
It's a better place to retire.

465
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,920
Of course.

466
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,610
Really?

467
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,260
The air quality...

468
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:13,900
Coming.

469
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,090
Who is it?

470
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,840
Is this Yue Xiuqin and Liu Yiding's home?

471
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,230
Yes.

472
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,190
Are they home?

473
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,250
Uncle, Auntie.

474
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,040
Who are you here for?

475
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,440
You're Yue Xiuqin and Liu Yiding, right?

476
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,160
-Yes.
-Yes.

477
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,370
You two are suspected of perjury.

478
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:32,310
We need you to come back with us for investigation.

479
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,040
What!

480
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,190
Did you get it wrong?

481
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:35,910
Yes.

482
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,170
It must be a mistake.

483
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,440
Don't frame a good person.

484
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,240
So we need you

485
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,980
to go back with us for investigation.

486
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,490
Take them away.

487
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,270
What's going on?

488
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,070
-Investigate what?
-Can't we make it clear here?

489
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,470
Yes, make it clear.

490
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:45,990
This...

491
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,090
Why...

492
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,950
This is too much.

493
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,330
Watch the door.

494
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,660
What's going on here?

495
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,230
Mrs. Ma.

496
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,580
I'm really sorry.

497
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,430
I can't deliver this letter for you.

498
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:09,190
This is indeed against the rules.

499
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,190
But don't worry.

500
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,720
I will try my best

501
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,300
to express your thoughts and feelings to him.

502
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,160
Alright, Ms. Xia.

503
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,230
Could you please

504
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,690
tell Jianshe

505
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,490
to persist in his statement

506
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,420
when you see him.

507
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,660
I'll do my best.

508
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,660
As long as he sticks to it,

509
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,620
all my efforts will be meaningful.

510
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,690
Don't worry.

511
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,280
I'll bring this up to him.

512
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,560
[Luo Yingzi]

513
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,730
Hey, Righteous Luo.

514
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,490
Are you gonna boil

515
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,360
or fry me?

516
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,510
Mr. Chen, where are you?

517
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:53,110
Can we meet?

518
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:56,840
What? Are you trying to take revenge on me?

519
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,690
It's about a case.

520
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,350
I'll send you the address.

521
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,080
I hope you can be here in an hour.

522
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,960
I'll be here waiting for you.

523
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:28,980
Hello.

524
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,260
-Hello.
-Let me introduce you to each other.

525
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,790
This's Xiao Yuan, Ms. Xiao.

526
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,140
Ms. Xiao.

527
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,390
This is Mr. Chen I just introduced to you.

528
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,490
He's a lawyer from Da Zheng Law Firm.

529
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm Chen Shuo.

530
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,100
Hello.

531
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm Ying Zi's old friend.

532
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,070
I trust you very much since you are recommended by her.

533
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,910
Ms. Xiao, please give us a second.

534
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,990
I'll have a brief chat with Mr. Chen.

535
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:49,660
Okay.

536
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:00,430
Mr. Chen, let's cut to the chase.

537
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,710
I hope you can take

538
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,930
Ms. Xiao's case.

539
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,700
It's very tricky.

540
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,490
It's hard to get evidence.

541
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:10,830
But I believe you can make it.

542
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,930
And you'll earn a lot if you make it.

543
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,280
Did she just say you were old friends?

544
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,140
Why didn't you take this case?

545
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,420
Because her case

546
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,350
has something to do with my personal matter.

547
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,350
It's inconvenient for me to show up.

548
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,670
But I need a lawyer

549
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,270
I can trust.

550
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,790
It has something to do with you?

551
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,750
It has something to do with you, then...

552
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:42,910
Because of her?

553
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,420
Ms. Xiao and I are both her victims.

554
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,510
So I hope

555
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:01,640
you can take Ms. Xiao's case,

556
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,430
be her lawyer,

557
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,940
and get her money back.

558
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,470
I also want that woman

559
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,730
to receive the punishment she deserves.

560
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,980
Okay, I'll take the case.

561
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,780
But I'll give you my commission.

562
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,460
No need.

563
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,380
I'm not that fragile.

564
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,390
I just need you

565
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,030
to beat her completely.

566
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,750
I'll be so grateful.

567
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,620
Okay, I'm done talking.

568
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,280
Can't I talk?

569
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,090
I've told Mr. Chen the basic information

570
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,270
about this case just now.

571
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,360
You two can talk about the details.

572
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,570
If you think he's suitable, then entrust him.

573
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,630
If not, I'll find another one for you.

574
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,910
There must be no problem with your recommendation.

575
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:45,350
Okay.

576
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,750
You guys go ahead.

577
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,870
-Okay.
-I'm gonna hit the road.

578
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:49,270
Okay.

579
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,590
Ms. Xiao, please wait a moment.

580
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,560
Let me see her off.

581
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,490
Sure, no problem

582
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,650
Luo Yingzi!

583
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,430
I just want to tell you in person.

584
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,030
I'm sorry.

585
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,700
Sorry for making you suffer.

586
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,270
It's OK. We had to serve our own clients.

587
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,730
I can't say you were wrong.

588
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,930
But congratulations.

589
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,170
You beat me again.

590
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,260
I'm leaving.

591
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,770
Okay.

592
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,930
She doesn't admit she likes me.

593
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,850
Let me do it.

594
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,750
Let me do it.

595
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,430
I'll sweep the floor now.

596
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:38,730
Sorry.

597
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,390
It'll be cleaned soon.

598
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,670
I'm back.

599
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,750
How was it going?

600
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,550
Don't forget he's Chen Shuo!

601
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,150
How could he not take it

602
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:57,800
when given such a good case?

603
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,810
Flies will never avoid odor.

604
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,740
A fox may turn gray, but never kind.

605
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:03,010
Xia Shu.

606
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,930
The dustpan is in the bathroom.

607
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,130
Go and get it to collect the dirt.

608
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,650
Okay.

609
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:14,410
Oh my.

610
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,820
Yingzi.

611
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:20,290
I am not sure

612
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,650
if your case has anything to do with Chen Shuo.

613
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:24,040
There must have.

614
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,690
It must be his idea.

615
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:28,650
But the video that proves your innocence

616
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,720
was provided by Chen Shuo on purpose.

617
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,270
No way.

618
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,710
He must have been careless.

619
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,630
Do you think Chen Shuo would be careless?

620
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,370
[Zhang Shilan]

621
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,070
What's wrong with you, Zhang Shilan?

622
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,070
Shuo.

623
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,520
When will you come back?

624
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,080
It's none of your business.

625
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,450
I've cooked dinner for you at home.

626
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:14,070
Come back early.

627
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,580
Hi.

628
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,150
Hello, please come in.

629
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,560
Zhang Shilan?

630
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:01,690
Zhang Shilan?

631
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,290
It's too dangerous with these candles burning.

632
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,670
Shuo,

633
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,220
tonight,

634
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:05,440
I'm not going home.

635
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,200
Why?

636
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,920
Shuo, I like you.

637
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,070
Let's

638
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,410
be together.

639
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,240
Zhang Shilan.

640
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,910
Who gave you the confidence to do this?

641
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,730
You think I can be with anyone, right?

642
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,750
Shuo, you always changing your girlfriends.

643
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,920
-Why can't I be your girlfriend?
-Don't come over.

644
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,060
We need to make things clear.

645
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,370
I'm your boss.

646
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,190
You're my employee.

647
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,390
To put it bluntly, you are the nanny I hired.

648
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,150
You're the housework helper

649
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,270
to take care of me.

650
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,570
What did you say?

651
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,880
I paid you to work for me.

652
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,270
If you don't want to work here, just leave.

653
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:55,990
Am I a nanny?

654
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,540
I'm your assistant!

655
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,950
Is it an assistant's job

656
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,690
to serve the tea, run errands and carry bags?

657
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:03,590
Also,

658
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,230
I made you my assistant

659
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:06,590
as a favor to

660
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,830
Luo Yingzi.

661
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,500
That's all.

662
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,030
Also,

663
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,190
you are a girl.

664
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,850
You should love yourself.

665
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,600
You took off your clothes.

666
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,800
It's appropriate to be this shameless.

667
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,300
Put on your clothes and leave.

668
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,270
Chen Shuo.

669
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,130
I quit!

670
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,740
Bye.

671
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,320
You have to pay me extra money.

672
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:48,740
I was paid 6,000 per month

673
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,670
as a housework helper at Yingzi's.

674
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,690
You don't want to pay me?

675
00:32:57,690 --> 00:32:59,130
Take it easy.

676
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,270
Check your account.

677
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,980
Is 8,000 enough?

678
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:12,850
Wait and see.

679
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,300
Are you leaving or not?

680
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,370
Does Luo Yingzi know

681
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,630
you are treating me

682
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,470
like a nanny?

683
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,870
No, she doesn't know this at all.

684
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,780
I know.

685
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,950
Are you two fooling me together?

686
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,830
Zhang Shilan.

687
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,130
Don't take yourself too seriously.

688
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,090
You're not worth

689
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:45,750
the trouble

690
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,750
of me teaming up with her to fool you.

691
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,550
Chen Shuo,

692
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:51,460
don't regret it.

693
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:52,550
I won't.

694
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,610
I'll transfer you the extra 2000.

695
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:57,870
Save it for medicine.

696
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,760
Thank you.

697
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:00,890
Unbelievable.

698
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,840
Gosh.

699
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:24,550
Luo Yingzi!

700
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,659
[Righteous Luo]

701
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,590
Are we so in sync?

702
00:34:32,929 --> 00:34:33,770
Hello.

703
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,330
Why are you looking for a famous hooligan, the famous lady?

704
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,750
You wanna buy me a drink?

705
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,719
You hid evidence and framed a good person.

706
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,699
Mr. Unscrupulous Chen,

707
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,740
you've done a really good job as the lawyer of the bank.

708
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:00,090
I'm really wronged.

709
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,790
After you were asked

710
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,760
to cooperate with the investigation,

711
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,190
the bank repaired their equipment overnight

712
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,690
in a spirit of responsibility.

713
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,890
So they found the video.

714
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:14,180
We're very happy

715
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,240
you've been cleared of all charges.

716
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:17,480
Pretentious.

717
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,550
You showed me a video just now.

718
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,430
Let me show you one, too.

719
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,250
Watch this.

720
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,550
This must be one of your firm's partners.

721
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,410
Xia Shu, right?

722
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,680
I never thought

723
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,740
Liangcheng Law Firm

724
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,800
would be such a loving family.

725
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,870
In order to save an ordinary practicing lawyer,

726
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,330
the partner's committed the theft herself.

727
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,810
It's really a big deal.

728
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,420
I'll look up the law when I'm back.

729
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,360
Excuse me.

730
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,400
Two more of the same.

731
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,200
My treat this round.

732
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,220
Unscrupulous Chen, thank you.

733
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,810
Qiu Hua told me everything.

734
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,580
You helped us

735
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
find the most important video surveillance evidence.

736
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,160
Otherwise,

737
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:07,070
I might still be in the detention center,

738
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,510
waiting to be investigated.

739
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,870
Don't talk nonsense.

740
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,590
I have no idea

741
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:12,830
how they got the evidence.

742
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,320
Also,

743
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,540
I'm not interested in it either.

744
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,820
Anyway, thank you.

745
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,840
You sued Liu Ming.

746
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,470
Mr. Wang called me

747
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,560
to consult.

748
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,550
What I said unintentionally

749
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,900
was made use of by him.

750
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,200
And I didn't know Liu Ming bribed him.

751
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,900
Forget it.

752
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,920
Anyway, Mr. Wang has been arrested,

753
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,400
right?

754
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:40,600
But I'm sorry

755
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,310
for throwing you in jail.

756
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,140
I'll have to take my time to find out

757
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:52,760
if your advice was inadvertent

758
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,400
or deliberate.

759
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,910
Go ahead.

760
00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:00,440
If you can find out the truth,

761
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,500
that's your ability.

762
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,650
By the way,

763
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:09,690
I have one more thing to tell you.

764
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,700
I fired Lanlan.

765
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,430
You don't have to know the specific reason.

766
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,000
I just think this girl

767
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,630
is a bit evil.

768
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,130
I can't keep her with me.

769
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,280
But I don't know if she'll misunderstand.

770
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,160
I said I treated her like an nanny.

771
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,460
She asked me

772
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,440
if you knew about it.

773
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
I said you didn't.

774
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,410
I'm worried that she would put the blame on you.

775
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,900
I see.

776
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:38,870
Cheers.

777
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:50,040
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

778
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,400
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

779
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:07,940
Yingzi.

780
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,570
Lanlan.

781
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,230
You scared me.

782
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,140
I just called you.

783
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,890
Why did you power off your phone?

784
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:18,090
You changed the lock?

785
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,070
You don't want me to come in?

786
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:21,990
How come?

787
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,890
I lost my key a few days ago.

788
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,470
Then I found a locksmith

789
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:26,970
and got a new key cylinder.

790
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,770
I have the key.

791
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,850
Why didn't you ask me for it?

792
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,340
I was in a rush that time.

793
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,740
Lanlan, don't think too much.

794
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,090
Let's go in. Let’s talk inside.

795
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,350
Come in, Lanlan.

796
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:45,900
Chen Shuo told me

797
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,170
he fired you.

798
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,550
When you went to his firm,

799
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,580
he didn't sign

800
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,030
any contract with you, did he?

801
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,710
No.

802
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,590
Did he pay you when you left?

803
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:58,210
Sure, as long as he did.

804
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:00,750
Yingzi, let me ask you something.

805
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,500
Go ahead.

806
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:03,960
Have some water.

807
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,460
Did you know Chen Shuo

808
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,170
took me as his nanny?

809
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm just here to tell you

810
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,470
I resigned.

811
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,050
Where are you going?

812
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,350
I'll play it by ear.

813
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,190
Anyway, I'll stay in Zhou's house at present.

814
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:32,160
Mr. Zhou gave you the house?

815
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:34,190
It's mine as long as I live there.

816
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,660
I deserve it anyway.

817
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,190
So you know Lanlan,

818
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,730
you just think too simply.

819
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,390
Your relationship will definitely not work.

820
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,750
Enough, Yingzi!

821
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:45,380
You have pity on me, don't you?

822
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,150
Listen, Yingzi.

823
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,010
I care so much about gain and loss.

824
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,490
If one owes me,

825
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,840
I will let him pay it back.

826
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,190
Do you believe it, Yingzi?

827
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,720
I do.

828
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,880
But I think you are just a little girl.

829
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,030
What can you do?

830
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,790
If there's no better solution,

831
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,000
come back to live with me again.

832
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,540
It's impossible for me

833
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,640
to be a nanny again.

834
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:21,860
See you.

835
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,930
It's settled then.

836
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:52,060
Qiu Hua, you'll be in charge of the advocacy of innocence.

837
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,550
I'll work on sentencing

838
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,830
with the fact-findings and evidence.

839
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,920
When we meet Xu Jianshe this time,

840
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,140
we'd better try to persuade him to make compensation.

841
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,270
As long as he has a positive attitude,

842
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:03,210
we'll go to the victim's family

843
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,090
and see if we can get a letter of understanding

844
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:06,300
and negotiate with them on the compensation.

845
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,260
Xu Jianshe should be innocent.

846
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:11,520
It's not up to him to decide whether he's guilty or not.

847
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,350
There is no evidence to prove his innocence.

848
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,440
But there's a lot of evidence to prove his guilty.

849
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,890
All right. Just follow us this time.

850
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,500
Prepare the materials

851
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,820
and evidence

852
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,920
for the trial.

853
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,710
When we are in court,

854
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:28,070
get ready to take

855
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,890
the certain material out, okay?

856
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,540
But I think he's innocent.

857
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,340
You are not the judge.

858
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,650
Hello, I'm Qiu Hua.

859
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,770
Got it.

860
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,920
Luo Yingzi.

861
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,490
Someone is looking for you at the front desk.

862
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:56,100
Thank you.

863
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:57,850
What made you here?

864
00:41:58,410 --> 00:41:59,290
Luo Yingzi!

865
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,830
Liu Ming is on the fugitive list.

866
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,790
Did you do this?

867
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,190
Yes.

868
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,460
How could you do this?

869
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,890
How cruel you are!

870
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:09,960
Calm down.

871
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,250
Why did you do this?

872
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:14,030
Do you want me to die?

873
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,380
I don't want to live anymore.

874
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,560
You and Liu Ming were husband and wife.

875
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,120
How can you be so cruel?

876
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,040
Yue! Yue!

877
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:26,330
Stop talking.

878
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,270
Are you done?

879
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,350
If you're done, let's talk somewhere else.

880
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,890
Call the police if you're not done yet.

881
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:34,810
Enough!

882
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:35,750
Enough!

883
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:38,270
We're here to negotiate with you.

884
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,020
Let's go.

885
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:40,940
Okay.

886
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,870
Don't talk too much.

887
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:54,370
What?

888
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,390
Nothing.

889
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,780
I'll never

890
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,570
turn my back to you in my life.
