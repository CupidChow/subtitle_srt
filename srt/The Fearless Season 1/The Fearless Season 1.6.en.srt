00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,670
Mr. Qin, please sign here later.

192
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
We'll return the money to you.

193
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,000
Sounds reasonable.

194
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,040
But did

195
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,160
my sister die in vain?

196
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,180
You know nothing.

197
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,610
Can we understand legal matters?

198
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,210
Mr. Chen does.

199
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:13,120
Mr. Chen,

200
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:15,350
we've signed the contract.

201
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,830
We'll take the money back.

202
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:18,820
Sure.

203
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,390
20,000 yuan

204
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,660
for a life.

205
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,070
Is it worth it?

206
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,280
Mr. and Mrs. Qin,

207
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,530
when you take 20,000 yuan back,

208
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,010
it means you only saw the 20,000 yuan in front of you.

209
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,870
What I saw was that you've given up the possibility

210
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,789
to look for the murderer of your sister.

211
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,230
Chen Shuo,

212
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,200
I despise you.

213
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,919
Do you have a conscience?

214
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,850
They don't understand, but you do.

215
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:46,390
It's not that we don't have a chance.

216
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,140
What did you tell me on our way back?

217
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,870
There's new evidence and clues.

218
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,990
Explain to them

219
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,750
so that they'll understand.

220
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,840
What are you talking about?

221
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,830
What did I say?

222
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,030
Don't believe him. I didn't say anything.

223
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,270
How come you didn't?

224
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:56,930
Well...

225
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,110
Mr. Chen,

226
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,840
do you have any other solutions?

227
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,700
I don't.

228
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,470
I'm not a cop. I have no solutions.

229
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:03,950
That's so mean of you.

230
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,340
My sister-in-law died!

231
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,830
No one in our family knows the law.

232
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,950
That's why we asked you and Mr. Xue for help.

233
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,400
You won't help us?

234
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,870
Do you have any conscience?

235
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,990
Mrs. Qin, this has nothing to do with conscience.

236
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,630
The current situation we face is tough.

237
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,350
But now we have new clues

238
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,440
and evidence.

239
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,510
If we don't keep moving,

240
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,470
I feel pity for her.

241
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,640
You just need to follow up with

242
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,590
the new evidence and clues.

243
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,890
I can't take care of the rest.

244
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,000
You should have told them.

245
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,840
They'll understand if you tell them.

246
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,230
I have nothing to say.

247
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,010
No, no, no.

248
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,950
Stop arguing, please.

249
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,110
Just say it.

250
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,990
Otherwise, we won't understand.

251
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:37,860
Say it or not?

252
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:40,890
I will if you don't.

253
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,160
The only thing we need to do now

254
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:46,550
is to send a lawyer to negotiate with the police

255
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,870
and urge them to catch the murderer as soon as possible.

256
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,230
In this way, we can seek compensation for you.

257
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,420
That's all.

258
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,470
I really don't understand, Xue.

259
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,260
What are you doing?

260
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,420
They've signed it.

261
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,000
We are not their lawyers anymore.

262
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,310
Why do you care so much?

263
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,660
That makes sense.

264
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Right?

265
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,260
I've made up my mind.

266
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,480
Give me the money.

267
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,990
Give me the money!

268
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,400
Where did you put it?

269
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,240
Mr. Chen,

270
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,970
since you said so,

271
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,550
I can't accept the money.

272
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,530
How about this?

273
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,050
I'm entrusting you to negotiate with the police

274
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,310
and urge them to catch the murderer

275
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,440
as soon as possible.

276
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:37,990
In this way,

277
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,120
we have a place to claim compensation.

278
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,540
No, this is too difficult.

279
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,180
I can't do it.

280
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,710
Please take the money back.

281
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,250
No, no, Mr. Chen.

282
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:45,990
Don't...

283
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,390
Mr. Chen, if you refuse the money,

284
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,120
you're looking down on me.

285
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,410
If you don't want to go to the police,

286
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,120
then don't.

287
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,110
This is

288
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,510
for you and Mr. Xue.

289
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,410
You two have been working hard for so long.

290
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,940
Your hard work deserves it.

291
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,490
This is supposed to be yours.

292
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,090
I can't accept it.

293
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,110
Guys,

294
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,880
what you signed just now

295
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,230
is the first trial agreement.

296
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:11,070
In other words, after the first trial,

297
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,350
our agreement will automatically end.

298
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,150
Now I've changed my mind.

299
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,710
After the termination agreement,

300
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,350
our serve to our clients

301
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,140
won't end.

302
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,710
Mr. Chen Shuo and I

303
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
will continue to be your lawyers and supervise the police

304
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,070
to catch the murderer as soon as possible.

305
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:26,750
Now,

306
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,960
we'll sign another agency agreement

307
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,270
so that we can seek civil compensation for you.

308
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,420
What do you think?

309
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,590
Sure.

310
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,780
You're the boss, Mr. Xue.

311
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,710
You make the call.

312
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,370
You decide.

313
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,650
Mr. Xue,

314
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,040
can we

315
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,770
ask for compensation from only one murderer?

316
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:48,220
It's supposed to be.

317
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,070
Your sister could only die once.

318
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:51,740
She can't die for more than one time.

319
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,480
Mr. Xue,

320
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,230
This sounds strange.

321
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,450
Then we were not compensated under the original agreement.

322
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,700
If the murderer is caught later,

323
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,630
can we follow

324
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,150
the original agreement?

325
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,790
That's right.

326
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,690
We're not compensated.

327
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,900
When the murderer is found,

328
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,030
let's follow the original agreement.

329
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Please take care of my sister's case.

330
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,640
Sure.

331
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,520
Thank you.

332
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,160
It's our pleasure.

333
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,920
Thank you.

334
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,720
Don't worry.

335
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:21,230
Bye.

336
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,140
Bye.

337
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
See you.
Bye. Bye.

338
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,750
Take care.

339
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,490
Good acting.

340
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,800
I need to learn from you in the future.

341
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,760
It's not that I'm good at acting.

342
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,240
It's your level

343
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,990
that has dropped a lot.

344
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:41,360
What were you doing?

345
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,130
You had been smart, hadn't you?

346
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,070
Are we stupid?

347
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,290
We'll represent two cases with one agreement.

348
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,790
We should have received 40,000 yuan.

349
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,350
If we kept going, we would have been over.

350
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,280
The couple would have

351
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,710
taken the 20,000 yuan.

352
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,290
You got 80% of the payment

353
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,620
for this case.

354
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:57,110
You should return the money to me.

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,310
Hello, Yingzi.

356
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,810
I have something to tell you.

357
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,990
I sold their house.

358
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
But I guess

359
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,290
they'll come and make a scene today.

360
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,340
So,

361
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,910
will give you a short break.

362
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,430
You can go home for a few days.

363
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:22,710
When I'm done here,

364
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,710
you can come back.

365
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,550
I have to stay in this way.

366
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,630
You can't face them alone.

367
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,760
Don't worry.

368
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,680
I won't be bullied by them again.

369
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,480
I'll give you a red packet later.

370
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,160
Go home and have a good rest.

371
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
No need, Yingzi.

372
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,940
Your parents just paid me the day before yesterday.

373
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,710
So you don't need to give me money.

374
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,110
Just take it.

375
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:42,590
Pack up and leave.

376
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,870
Be careful

377
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,230
not to be blocked by them.

378
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,270
I'm hanging up.

379
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,480
What?

380
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,920
A miscarriage?

381
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,580
What did the doctor say?

382
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,230
My goodness.

383
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,540
How could this happen?

384
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,140
All right, boy.

385
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,280
Take good care of her.

386
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,350
Let Wen Li recuperate well

387
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,370
before getting pregnant again.

388
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,120
How are we?

389
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:11,820
We're good.

390
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,190
What can she do

391
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,530
to me?

392
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,370
Don't worry.

393
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,830
I have something to do. I gotta go.

394
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,900
You know,

395
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,720
Wen Li had a miscarriage?

396
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,430
She fell over at her friend's house.

397
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,620
Gosh.

398
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:33,360
You asked her to come back after giving birth.

399
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:35,800
It'll take more than a year.

400
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,080
Maybe in a year,

401
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,840
they can get their green cards.

402
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,670
In the future,

403
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,290
we can enjoy our retirement in the US.

404
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,270
We can both get our pensions in China

405
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,780
and be on welfare in the US.

406
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480

00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,330
Are you unsatisfied with me?

568
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,830
How dare I?

569
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,710
How could I not be satisfied with you?

570
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,090
I have potential clients though.

571
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:40,290
I need to meet them.

572
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,980
We need to talk it through.

573
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,040
Okay.

574
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,460
I'll wait for your news.

575
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,070
Okay.

576
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,320
Please solve this problem peacefully.

577
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,190
Don't worry.

578
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,160
Sir.

579
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,220
Sir!

580
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,370
They're unreasonable.

581
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:53,290
They can't treat us like this.

582
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:53,690
He...

583
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:56,390
The justice is the house is mine.

584
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:58,220
And I asked you to move out today.

585
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,270
We won't.

586
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,460
Take me out if you dare.

587
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,860
How overbearing you are!

588
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,430
This old lady is so bad.

589
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:16,230
You like to be carried out

590
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:18,020
by a sedan chair?

591
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,030
I'll meet your needs.

592
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:20,790
Guys,

593
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,750
carry one leg each.

594
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,030
Come on, carry her out.

595
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,800
Sure.

596
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,610
Enjoy.

597
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,030
What are you doing?
Enjoy.

598
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,990
What are you doing?

599
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,390
One, two, three, go.

600
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:30,660
They're killing me!

601
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,400
Put her down.

602
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,550
Come on.
Put it down.

603
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,420
We'll move.

604
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,490
We will.

605
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,640
You should have moved earlier.

606
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,370
It's supposed to be solved like this.

607
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,900
[Jingbei Court]

608
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,590
The evidence submitted by the public prosecution organ

609
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,790
does not meet the standard of proof required

610
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,240
to convict Wang Dafu of a crime.

611
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,490
The facts of this case are unclear,

612
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,860
and there is insufficient evidence.

613
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,190
The alleged crime cannot be established.

614
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,790
The defendant's defense

615
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,470
and the advocacy of his defense lawyers

616
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,630
are accepted.

617
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,980
In accordance with

618
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,780
the article 195, item 3

619
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,560
of the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China,

620
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,500
and the article 160, paragraph 1

621
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,800
of the interpretation of the Supreme People's Court

622
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,400
on the application of

623
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,090
the Criminal Procedure Law

624
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,170
of the People's Republic of China,

625
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,830
the verdict is as follows.

626
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:30,790
One,

627
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,470
the defendant Wang Dafu is innocent.

628
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,710
Second,

629
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,390
the defendant Wang Dafu

630
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,750
shall not be liable for civil damages.

631
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,870
He shall be released in court.

632
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,310
Court adjourned!

633
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,180
You scared me.

634
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,430
You scared me.

635
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,570
Calm down.

636
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:06,310
You scared me.

637
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:07,630
Calm down.

638
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,880
You scared me.

639
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,090
The evidence of innocence

640
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,000
was found by that girl?

641
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:14,530
Let's go.

642
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,780
Luo Yingzi.

643
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,910
Hello.

644
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,810
Hello.

645
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,070
Congratulations.

646
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,380
For what?

647
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,620
It was you who found the evidence, right?

648
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,020
Let me introduce him to you.

649
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,860
We've met before.

650
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
I'm Xue Xiaofeng.

651
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,410
He's a senior lawyer at Dazheng Law Firm.

652
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:33,230
Luo Yingzi.

653
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,690
I really admire you.

654
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,990
What is this called?

655
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,580
Justice, conscience, and responsibility.

656
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,520
Shouldn't every lawyer be like this?

657
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,120
Yes.

658
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,820
Isn't this what we are talking about all the time?

659
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,620
That's right.

660
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,070
Anything else?

661
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,190
Yes.

662
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,290
If Wang Dafu didn't kill Qin Ailian?

663
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,380
Then who do you think did it?

664
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,210
I don't know.

665
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,150
It has nothing to do with me.

666
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,150
Of course, it has.

667
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,370
We're the lawyers of the same case.

668
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,410
Besides,

669
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,400
you are so responsible to your client.

670
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,190
We can't let ourselves fall behind.

671
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,990
That's right.

672
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,540
Qin Ailian

673
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,080
was killed

674
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,140
at such a young age.

675
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,900
What a tragedy!

676
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,370
Yes.

677
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,400
She is pretty.

678
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,640
Everyone feels sorrow and pity for her.

679
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,180
Yes.

680
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,920
She was so beautiful

681
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,040
but was eager to marry Wang Dafu.

682
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,630
Don't you think it's strange?

683
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,470
No.

684
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,040
There are many strange things in the world.

685
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,840
For example, why would he entrust this case to you?

686
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,990
What's wrong with that?

687
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,560
I am so responsible, right?

688
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,040
I even want to work as a cop.

689
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,350
You did work hard.

690
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,070
They're so poor,

691
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,230
but you still want to earn their money.

692
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,840
His family is not that poor.

693
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,700
Qin Ailan earned more than 200,000 yuan every year.

694
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:45,020
A waitress can earn more than 200,000 per year?

695
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,890
Yes.

696
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,180
Aren't you curious about that?

697
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,440
What do you want to say?

698
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,510
You want neither a good reputation

699
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,270
nor profit.

700
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,400
You just solved the case

701
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,280
and cleared Wang Dafu's name.

702
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,380
The same goes for us.

703
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,240
We also want to offer justice

704
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,390
to Qin Ailian.

705
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,350
Right?

706
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,730
We'd like to bring the wicked to justice.

707
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:04,300
But to catch the murderer,

708
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,830
it depends essentially on

709
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,100
if Wang Dafu

710
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,010
can cooperate with and help us.

711
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:11,250
After all, Qin Ailian

712
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,730
was the closest one to him.

713
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,110
But Wang Dafu

714
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,300
is your client.

715
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,070
Do me a favor.

716
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,800
Can you help us to investigate?

717
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:20,270
Sorry.

718
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,430
It's none of my business.

719
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,320
I can't help.

720
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,480
Do you really want to

721
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:27,070
see a family break up like this?

722
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,630
The murderer was still not brought to justice

723
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,960
and punished by the law.

724
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,190
I couldn't bear to.

725
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:33,050
So I'm waiting for your good news.

726
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,550
Bye, Mr. Xue.

727
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,370
She didn't fall for it.

728
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:43,490
It shouldn't be like that.

729
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,230
I know why.

730
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,010
You were not sincere at all.

731
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,360
You neither.

732
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,040
You even said

733
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:49,990
it breaks the heart of those who hear it

734
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,880
and brings tears to those who see it.

735
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,720
That's too much.

736
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,780
Isn't that how cultured people talk?

737
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,660
Who killed Qin Ailian?

738
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,700
How would I know?

739
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,570
I knew she didn't commit suicide.

740
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,350
Leave it to the police.

741
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,550
I'm just curious.

742
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,360
The more I look at Wang Dafu,

743
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,910
the more I am curious about

744
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,940
why Qin Ailian insisted on marrying him.

745
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,270
Why are you curious about it?

746
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,630
It's practical for us to earn some money.

747
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,370
Could the murderer be a rich man?

748
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,710
If you say he might be rich,

749
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,830
I'm thinking of

750
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,090
if we can earn a lot of money from him.

751
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Is that possible?

752
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,860
Why not?

753
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,470
She worked at a club

754
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,560
and earned over 200,000 yuan a year.

755
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,760
You can figure it out.

756
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,140
Oh no.

757
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:42,930
Shuo.

758
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:45,440
You promised the Qin family

759
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,340
that if we solve the case,

760
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,730
we'll fulfill the first agreement.

761
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:50,370
Then we'll lose a lot.

762
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,380
You continue to solve your case.

763
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,110
I'll think about it carefully.

764
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:58,800
Don't be that serious.

765
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,030
I was just saying.

766
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,470
But the murderer

767
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,120
went to Wang Dafu's and killed Qin Ailian.

768
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:08,840
This can't be for money.

769
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
It's an obvious murder.

770
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,330
Who has such a deep grudge against her?

771
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:16,510
[Blessings Express Hotel]

772
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,110
What are you doing here?

773
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,610
Why are you here?

774
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,530
Luo Yingzi, how could you do such a thing?

775
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,620
What did I do?

776
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,110
Is that your house?

777
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,040
That's my son's.

778
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,100
How could you kick us out?

779
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,170
Believe it or not,

780
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,370
I dare to sue you.

781
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,800
Go ahead.

782
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,150
Go ahead.

783
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:44,730
My parents

784
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,260
bought this house for me before I got married.

785
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,380
My name was written on the property certificate.

786
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,910
I have the right to deal with it.

787
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:53,600
How could you say that?

788
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:54,900
Well,

789
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,790
this house

790
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,180
was bought by my son.

791
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,770
We can move in too.

792
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,040
This house is our shared property.

793
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,800
And your dearest son Liu Ming

794
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,770
took away much more of my property.

795
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:09,010
This house is the only thing left.

796
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,800
I must live in it, understand?

797
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,620
No.

798
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,400
I don't have to know that.

799
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,850
As long as my son's name is on the property certificate,

800
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,100
I have the right to live here.

801
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,760
Are you trying to make a scene?

802
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,320
If you want to,

803
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,660
I'll run into the corridor

804
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,390
and tell all the neighbors loudly

805
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:24,480
about

806
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,760
what you and your son did.

807
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,980
Do you want me to do it?

808
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,170
Yingzi.

809
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,130
We're sorry.

810
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:35,900
Sorry.

811
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,350
Before we came to Jingbei,

812
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,700
we had sold our house in Lingnan.

813
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,420
Now,

814
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:44,330
where do you want us to live?

815
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,730
Besides,

816
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:49,290
you're not divorced.

817
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:51,080
We're still family.

818
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,630
Now you know we are family.

819
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,990
What were you thinking when you hurt me?

820
00:29:59,220 --> 00:29:59,950
Did I

821
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,690
do any harm to your Liu family?

822
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,680
How could you treat me like that?

823
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:04,870
Listen.

824
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,160
As long as I live here for one day,

825
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,010
you can never step into this door, understand?

826
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,230
There's an express hotel

827
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,640
near the south railway station.

828
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,240
Here's the address. Take it.

829
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:19,990
Take it.

830
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,410
I've already paid three days' rent for you.

831
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:24,670
You can live there now.

832
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,660
After three days,

833
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,950
you can go wherever you want.

834
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,200
You don't have to tell me.

835
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,820
If you want to solve the problem,

836
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,150
ask your son Liu Ming to come and talk to me.

837
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,130
Yingzi, wait.

838
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:35,150
Well.

839
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:39,790
Liu Ming wanted to settle your divorce

840
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,980
before talking about other things.

841
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,660
Because

842
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,920
the girl with him

843
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,680
insisted on marrying him.

844
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,280
Because she had been pregnant

845
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,940
when she left.

846
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,960
♫It's getting out of reach♫

847
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:03,200
♫It gradually becomes♫

848
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,870
You bastards!

849
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:07,170
♫A punctuation mark♫

850
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:05,980
Yingzi.

851
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,270
♫All the buildings♫

852
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,350
♫Flicker with lights♫

853
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,270
♫The night is deep♫

854
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,170
♫And the stars are dim♫

855
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,660
♫The wind blows♫

856
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,780
♫And I'll leave♫

♫Farewell♫

861
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:04,010
♫There'll be something amazing waiting for me♫

862
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:13,890
♫I see someone waiting in the light♫

863
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:23,440
Hello.

864
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,650
Mr. Zhou.

865
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,490
Yingzi,

866
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,600
here's the situation.

867
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,560
I've investigated it.

868
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,550
Your husband

869
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,510
owes money to four people.

870
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,750
Except mine,

871
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,540
he still owes over 4 million.

872
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:39,820
He hasn't paid the interest

873
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,950
to one of them.

874
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,660
The interest has already been raised to 24%.

875
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,300
So you now owe

876
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,450
five to six million.

877
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,370
And recently,

878
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:52,030
the creditors are coming.

879
00:32:59,460 --> 00:32:59,940
I...

880
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:07,510
Yingzi?

881
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:08,740
Yingzi?

882
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:24,750
♫Drink it up and fill it up♫

883
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:32,320
♫Let's get drunk tonight♫

884
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,210
Did our director sing well?

885
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,400
Yes!

886
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,400
Thank you all.

887
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,130
You've won a great case.

888
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:47,760
It's true.

889
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,320
I've never seen such success.

890
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,520
The prosecution couldn't say anything

891
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:53,320
about the evidence you found.

892
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,070
Mr. Han, if you encounter such cases again,

893
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,000
please guide me.

894
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,250
Let me learn from you.

895
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,810
Please guide me, Mr. Han

896
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:04,790
Come on.

897
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,710
You don't have to envy me.

898
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,000
It was fair when I assigned the cases.

899
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,739
Yes.

900
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,810
You guys didn't want this case,

901
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,550
right?

902
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,389
But someone was different from you.

903
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,800
She could see the possibility of this case.

904
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,500
Right?

905
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,139
Qiu Hua?
Ms. Qiu.

906
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,199
We finally hang out together.

907
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,429
Come on, drink more.

908
00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:30,290
Ms. Qiu, this time, I was really impressed.

909
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,429
That's why

910
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:34,050
you are our director's pet.

911
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,980
She learns from our director every day.

912
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,790
So she studies better than us.

913
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,850
Her ability is better than ours, right?

914
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,040
That's right.

915
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,710
Ms. Qiu, in the future,

916
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,159
teach me more.

917
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,630
Cheers.

918
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,790
Ms. Qiu, please guide me as well.

919
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,420
Ms. Qiu.

920
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,699
Let me propose a toast to you, Ms. Qiu.

921
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,760
Actually, I'm not the only one

922
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,380
who found the evidence of this case.

923
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,570
It's mainly because of Luo Yingzi's persistence.

924
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,640
She always believed

925
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,170
there was a reasonable doubt about this case.

926
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:06,460
Mr. Han knew it.

927
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:07,660
I did.

928
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,910
But you found

929
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,270
the most evidence, didn't you?

930
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:12,950
Yes.

931
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,830
So don't be too modest.

932
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,340
Ms. Qiu, you should at least drink with our director.

933
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,880
You did a great job in this case.

934
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,080
When there's the opportunity to transfer to a practicing attorney at the end of this year,

935
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,540
our director will definitely consider you.

936
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,580
Come on, cheers.

937
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,730
Cheers. Cheers.

938
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,200
Come on. To our director.

939
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,750
Mr. Han, a toast to you.

940
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:35,720
Okay.

941
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,100
Wait.

942
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,050
Ms. Qiu,

943
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,790
you are so insincere.

944
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,070
You should at least have a love shot.

945
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:45,770
Right?

946
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:50,480
Love shot! Love shot!

947
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,160
Stop messing around.

948
00:35:51,160 --> 00:36:01,320
Love shot! Love shot!

949
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,170
Okay. Love shot.

950
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,470
Come on.

951
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,870
Drink it.

952
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,330
Enjoy yourself.

953
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
Drink up.

954
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,960
Qiu Hua did a good job in this case.

955
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,240
But

956
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,050
she may not be able to

957
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,200
transfer to the practicing attorney.

958
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,860
Qiu Hua,

959
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,630
it depends on how you do next.

960
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,180
Well,

961
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,310
Mr. Han, another toast, please.

962
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,280
I'll fill it up.

963
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,000
Wait.

964
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,700
You two just had a love shot.

965
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,560
You should have a big one this time.

966
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,510
That's right.

967
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,270
What's that?

968
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,540
Come on, Chao.

969
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,610
This is called big cross-cupped wine.

970
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,430
Come on.

971
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:11,960
Come on.

972
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,160
Okay. Let's do it.

973
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,800
You guys are not sincere.

974
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,660
Why didn't you send me your location?

975
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,220
I've been looking for you guys for ages.

976
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,060
Here, Mr. Han.

977
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,420
Sorry, I'm late. A toast to you.

978
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,200
Mr. Han, thank you

979
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,460
for giving us Wang Dafu's case.

980
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,870
You trust us so much.

981
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,990
Bottoms up.

982
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,550
Cheers.

983
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,810
Have a drink, too.

984
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,660
Here.

985
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:42,540
I heard you said

986
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,730
Qiu Hua made a great contribution in this case.

987
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:48,280
But you have to be fair.

988
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,700
I did my best as well.

989
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,820
You need to consider me

990
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,680
when there's an opportunity.

991
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,990
Cheers.
Okay.

992
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,920
Ms. Qiu.

993
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,850
Thank you for helping me with Wang Dafu's case.

994
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,310
A toast to you.

995
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,550
What did you say just now?

996
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,480
Love shot?

997
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,540
The big cross-cupped wine, right?

998
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,030
How to do it?

999
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,270
Tian, is this how we should do it?

1000
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:20,590
I'm sorry.

1001
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,080
I told you I'm not good at it.

1002
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,040
Look at me.

1003
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,980
This...

1004
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:26,850
It's okay.

1005
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:27,500
Oh no.

1006
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,580
Look at this mess.

1007
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,840
I'll take you to the bathroom. Let's deal with it.

1008
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,510
I'm sorry.

1009
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,670
Let's drink.

1010
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:36,530
Let me pour you another cup.

1011
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,290
Let's drink.

1012
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:38,850
Come on.

1013
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,270
Ms. Qiu, I'm really sorry.

1014
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,730
It's okay.
Your blouse gets wet.

1015
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,240
No worries. It's very cheap.

1016
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,450
It will dry soon.

1017
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:53,770
Yingzi,

1018
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,640
thank you for helping me out.

1019
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,700
Have a seat.

1020
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:01,260
I failed just now.

1021
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,660
I should have splashed it on Han's face.

1022
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:08,560
Mr. Han said you wouldn’t come tonight.

1023
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,660
Why did you come here suddenly?

1024
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,360
Ms. Qiu.

1025
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,190
My husband took out more than one loan.

1026
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:18,000
I just found out.

1027
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,350
He took out four to five loans.

1028
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:22,630
The total amount is almost 5 or 6 million.

1029
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,820
Gosh.

1030
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,700
What are you going to do now?

1031
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,860
My priority now

1032
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,940
is to prove that the money he borrowed

1033
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,190
is not for our living expenses,

1034
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,640
but his personal debt.

1035
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,170
But as you know,

1036
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,290
I filed for divorce proceedings

1037
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:38,900
in the court earlier.

1038
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,200
However, the court's procedure

1039
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
is to resolve the service of process

1040
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,060
before a trial can be scheduled.

1041
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,310
But he's abroad.

1042
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,980
I don't know his address.

1043
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:50,470
Well, that means there's no telling

1044
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,470
when this trial date will be.

1045
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,340
Ms. Qiu,

1046
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:57,480
can I get rid of these loans first by suing?

1047
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,990
These small loan companies

1048
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,660
are hard to get rid of.

1049
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,030
Even if you can,

1050
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:04,760
it will take a long time.

1051
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:07,150
The longer it takes, the higher the interest will be.

1052
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,150
There's nothing they dare not do.

1053
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,550
If you can't pay them back,

1054
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,010
they may come to our firm.

1055
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:16,110
A group of people will block the door of the law firm

1056
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,840
and ask you for money every day.

1057
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:20,690
Do you think our firm will still keep you?

1058
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,720
It's hard to find evidence

1059
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,060
that it's not your joint debt.

1060
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,440
Even if you find it,

1061
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:29,750
will they admit it?

1062
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,830
If they were reasonable,

1063
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,630
they wouldn't do this business.

1064
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,730
That means I have to pay the loans back.

1065
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,160
But I don't have that much.

1066
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,330
By the way,

1067
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:46,160
you agreed to be my lawyer...

1068
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,930
I have no problem with that.

1069
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,870
But an intern lawyer can't take cases alone.

1070
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:51,660
I think

1071
00:40:52,290 --> 00:40:54,340
you should ask Mr. Han for help.

1072
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
He is your mentor.

1073
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:59,280
He has the obligation to help his apprentice.

1074
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,610
Besides, if he becomes your lawyer,

1075
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,750
he will support you in the firm.

1076
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,950
I don't want to ask for his help.

1077
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,680
I'm serious.

1078
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:08,920
As long as he can help you.

1079
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,280
You don't have to care about his character.

1080
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,910
It's not about his character.

1081
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,400
If something goes wrong,

1082
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,110
do you think he can protect me?

1083
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,870
And as for Wang Dafu's case,

1084
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:18,290
what was his attitude?

1085
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,590
He responded to the case passively.

1086
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,220
It was just a formality.

1087
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,930
If he's my lawyer,

1088
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:24,480
he's going to screw me over.

1089
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,650
I'd better call her.

1090
00:41:56,360 --> 00:42:00,520
[Luo Yingzi]

1091
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,800
Hello, who is it?

1092
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,020
Luo Yingzi, it's Chen Shuo.

1093
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,090
You haven't saved my number yet, have you?

1094
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,530
Sorry, I didn't save it.

1095
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,130
What's the matter? I'm busy.

1096
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,320
The more I think about the Qin Ailian case,

1097
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,070
the more strange it seems.

1098
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,890
Then hurry up and solve it.

1099
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,800
I hope you can solve the case soon.

1100
00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:24,450
She hung up on me.

1101
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,270
How rude.

1102
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:28,850
What happened? Who is it?

1103
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:30,550
Mr. Chen, the lawyer.

1104
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,000
He asked me to investigate

1105
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:35,160
the real murderer of Wang Dafu's case.

1106
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,160
He thought I didn't know what he was planning.

1107
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,390
He even wants to earn 500,000 from Wang Dafu.

1108
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,470
If the murderer is rich,

1109
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,830
he would want to make a fortune.

1110
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,870
You think too much about his way of making money.

1111
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,300
There's no need for Mr. Chen to do that.

1112
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,300
He's done some pretty good jobs on his previous cases.

1113
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,360
Let's discuss

1114
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,830
who else we can ask for help.
