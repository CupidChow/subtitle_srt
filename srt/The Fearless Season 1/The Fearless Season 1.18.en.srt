[Episode 18]

4
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,830
Yesterday he asked me to book tickets

5
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,090
for his business trip.

6
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,130
This time, he plans to take me with him.

7
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,070
I'm really sacred that

8
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,750
something might happen on the way.

9
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,550
I can't think of any solution.

10
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:44,410
I don't know who to turn to either.

11
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,900
I understand.

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:49,630
So, Guo Yu, are you here today

13
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,280
to seek legal advice

14
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,070
or do you intend for a lawsuit?

15
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,220
I don't know.

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,630
I don't have any relatives

17
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,890
or friends in Jingbei.

18
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,590
I couldn't talk to my family about this.

19
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,520
So after thinking it over,

20
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,070
I came here.

21
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,430
Guo Yu.

22
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,130
I'm a lawyer.

23
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,430
So I only look at evidence.

24
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,280
Everything I am saying now

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,440
is based on what you just told me.

26
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,870
If what you're saying is true,

27
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,000
then Yang Weida's behavior

28
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,480
has constituted severe sexual harassment.

29
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,150
With substantial evidence in your hand,

30
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,010
he might be liable for molestation charges.

31
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:29,740
But...

32
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,870
but though he was physically inappropriate with me,

33
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,370
I don't have any evidence of it.

34
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,829
Is there any evidence of sexual harassment?

35
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,490
I have the message he sent me.

36
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,790
Can you show me?

37
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,760
Have some water.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,790
The meaning is not clear.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,510
It can be interpreted in various ways.

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,080
Guo Yu, if you use this as evidence

41
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,110
to accuse him of sexual harassment,

42
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:14,900
it definitely won't be enough.

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,010
What should I do?

44
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,310
He wouldn't do such things

45
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,100
openly in front of others.

46
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,060
This is

47
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,110
a dilemma in workplace sexual harassment.

48
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:24,980
Because,

49
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,790
firstly,

50
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,800
it's difficult to provide evidence.

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,410
Without

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,900
any written records,

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,010
videos, or audio recordings of the incident,

54
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,230
it's challenging to prove the harassment.

55
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,110
Secondly,

56
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,520
referring to previous similar cases

57
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,750
they were mostly settled

58
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,670
with a simple apology and compensation.

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,800
Thirdly,

60
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,180
in situations like this,

61
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:53,840
victims' losses

62
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,880
may be

63
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,390
even greater than those of the perpetrators.

64
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,829
Do you understand?

65
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,980
Mrs. Luo, are you suggesting that

66
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,760
I should just endure it and let it go?

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,920
Well... no.

68
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,270
I can't...

69
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,360
I didn't mean that.

70
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,820
So, what did you mean then?

71
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:09,860
I...

72
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,920
Well, Guo Yu,

73
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,100
how about waiting here for a while?

74
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,980
I'll step out for a moment,

75
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,720
and be right back, okay?

76
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,779
Wait for me.

77
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,280
Xia Shu.

78
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,780
Can you do me a favor?

79
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,630
What is it?

80
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,360
Could you help me check online

81
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,710
to find out how our country legally defines

82
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,690
sexual harassment?

83
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,820
Sexual harassment?

84
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,800
No need to check.

85
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,030
There's hardly any way.

86
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,150
Doesn't matter, just check it for me.

87
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,020
Please check everything related.

88
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,550
Thanks, I need it urgently.

89
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:07,550
Is there a case?

90
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,900
Just check for me first.

91
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,470
I'll be in the consultation room.

92
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:10,980
Okay.

93
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,910
Those are the exact words

94
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,960
he said to me.

95
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,570
He said what you wrote

96
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,700
makes the law feel like you're acting.

97
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,380
Mr. Tian.

98
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,159
Have you seen Ms. Qiu?

99
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,790
Ms. Qiu might have gone to the archive room.

100
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:37,830
Thank you.

101
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,000
Mr. Han, please don't do this!

102
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,480
Who do you think you are talking to?

103
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,920
Do you think you've attached yourself to Mr. Han?

104
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:21,930
Ms. Fang.

105
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,690
Okay.

106
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,590
Qiu Hua,

107
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,580
Ms. Fang asked us to come over.

108
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,030
Did the girl in the reception room leave?

109
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,710
Not yet.

110
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,659
It is OKay. Leave it to me.

111
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:45,560
Come in.

112
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,200
Ms. Fang.

113
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,670
Come, Yingzi.

114
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,350
Sit.

115
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,260
The situation with your case

116
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,390
involving the Civil and Commercial Bank

117
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,830
seems a bit unfavorable.

118
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,130
What happened?

119
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,760
I just received the notice from the court.

120
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,230
We have to exchange evidence next week,

121
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,310
which means

122
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,800
the case is going to trial.

123
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,070
The lawyer, Chen Shuo,

124
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,980
from the Civil and Commercial Bank

125
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,380
didn't really help much.

126
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,090
The bank case will go to court

127
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,620
and reach a verdict before the divorce case,

128
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,690
and it's a settled matter.

129
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,310
This is very unfavorable for us.

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,710
I called you here today

131
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,860
to ask if you intend to

132
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,960
report Liu Ming to the police for fraud.

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,470
This is your last chance to save the house.

134
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,570
What will be the outcome

135
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,350
if the report is filed?

136
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,650
The police may file the case,

137
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,190
or they may not.

138
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,370
But I think,

139
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,540
this case involves a large amount of money.

140
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,080
After Liu Ming borrowed the money,

141
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,020
he immediately transferred it abroad.

142
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,020
The intent of fraud is very obvious,

143
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:58,560
so the likelihood of filing a case is high.

144
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,150
Once the case is filed, Liu Ming

145
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,470
will be put on

146
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,230
the police's online wanted list.

147
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:05,150
We are well

148
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,910
aware of

149
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,390
his whereabouts and address abroad.

150
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,420
The police might

151
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,310
bring him back.

152
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,310
At this point,

153
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:21,710
you still have hope in him?

154
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,310
No.

155
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,580
I always feel

156
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,030
there may be reasons I don't know about.

157
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,430
So until I figure it out,

158
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,940
I can't be ruthless with him.

159
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,600
Oh, women.

160
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,929
Okay, that's settled then.

161
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:38,990
Qiu Hua.

162
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,250
You stay here for a moment.

163
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,620
Let's prepare for the upcoming court.

164
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,320
Okay.

165
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,820
By the way, Ms. Fang,

166
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,590
there's something else

167
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,440
I would like to seek your opinion on.

168
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,710
What do you want to talk about?

169
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,590
A girl came to the

170
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:52,750
consultation room just now.

171
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,750
She is still here.

172
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,510
She is facing sexual harassment

173
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:57,240
from her boss in the workplace,

174
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,450
and has come to seek legal advice.

175
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,350
Is she looking to file a lawsuit?

176
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,960
I don't know.

177
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,950
She simply doesn't know what to do

178
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,400
and whom to ask.

179
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,100
As a lawyer,

180
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,430
you can't instigate clients to file lawsuits.

181
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,700
You just explain

182
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,150
the relevant legal provisions

183
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,080
and regulations

184
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,630
to her.

185
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,160
That's the completion of her counseling.

186
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,710
Since she has come to consult us,

187
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,480
let's approach it from the perspective

188
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,410
of protecting her best interests.

189
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,280
Let‘s prioritize harmony.

190
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,250
As for the specifics,

191
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,880
it's up to you to decide.

192
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,590
I see.

193
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,190
Ms. Fang, I'll go over first.

194
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:32,550
Okay.

195
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,550
In the 13th Session of

196
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,710
Jingbei People's Congress Standing Committee,

197
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,770
a draft was passed.

198
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,520
It contains specific provisions.

199
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,570
According to those regulations,

200
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,590
Yang Weida's actions towards you

201
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,390
can definitely be defined as

202
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:46,350
sexual harassment.

203
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,290
Furthermore,

204
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,340
considering the right to reputation,

205
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
according to Article 101

206
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:50,780
and Article 120

207
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,590
of the General Principles of Civil Law

208
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,990
citizens have the right to their reputation.

209
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,030
Citizens' personal dignity

210
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,160
is protected by law.

211
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,330
Prohibited to

212
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,470
harm the reputation of citizens

213
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,830
through slander, insults, and other means.

214
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,770
Citizens have the right to

215
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:00,750
demand the cessation of infringement,

216
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,710
restoration of reputation,

217
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,720
elimination of impact, an apology,

218
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,600
and can also

219
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,530
request compensation for losses.

220
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,070
Miss Xia.

221
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,510
Please come out.

222
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,480
I have something to say.

223
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,070
Okay.

224
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,350
Guo Yu, wait a moment.

225
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,900
What's wrong?

226
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,790
What are you here for?

227
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,650
Didn't you ask me to help you

228
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,510
look up the laws and regulations?

229
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,230
Okay.

230
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,910
Well, you can go back to playing your game.

231
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,610
What are you saying?

232
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,770
Am I wrong?

233
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,770
I'm here to answer the questions.

234
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,830
I'm on duty now.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,990
You can come again when it's your turn.

236
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,590
Okay?

237
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,140
Thank you for

238
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,260
helping me search for legal information.

239
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,920
Luo Yingzi.

240
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,000
When I was in school，

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,180
they called me the photocopier.

242
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,320
I can remember all the laws and regulations

243
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,530
after reading them once.

244
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,510
If you need to look up anything,

245
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,230
just ask me directly.

246
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,010
I don't need to read books.

247
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,010
Okay.

248
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:52,770
We can work on this case together, can't we?

249
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,480
There is no case.

250
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,120
But...

251
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,710
Hurry up and go back.

252
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,370
Didn't she say she was sexually harassed?

253
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,430
You should go back quickly. I'm busy.

254
00:10:59,280 --> 00:10:59,990
-Guo Yu. -Mrs. Luo.

255
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:01,120
Have a seat, Guo Yu.

256
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,910
Your water must be cold by now.

257
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,570
Let me get you another cup.

258
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,350
Mrs. Luo.

259
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,540
You don't know

260
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,600
how long I have hesitated about this.

261
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:13,950
If it weren't for

262
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,590
the business trip with him,

263
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,050
I wouldn't have come here.

264
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,520
I always feel like

265
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,760
I'm repaying kindness with enmity.

266
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,950
If it weren't for Mr. Yang's foundation,

267
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,890
I might still be working in the countryside,

268
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,730
and maybe，

269
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,590
I have already married and have children.

270
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,510
Guo Yu, don't think like that.

271
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,600
Even if their foundation

272
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,120
sponsored your college education,

273
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,180
he has no right to treat you like this.

274
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,290
In this matter,

275
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,720
he was definitely wrong.

276
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,870
But, Guo Yu, in the trial of civil cases,

277
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,470
there is a legal term

278
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,480
called "Whoever Asserts Must Prove."

279
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,240
It means

280
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,310
if you want to claim he harassed you,

281
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:49,130
you have to provide evidence.

282
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,260
-My phone is the evidence. -Yes, I know.

283
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,230
I saw it too.

284
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,530
But the

285
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,860
evidential strength of this text message

286
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,630
in court is very weak.

287
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,350
It can be interpreted in various ways.

288
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,110
So, if you really

289
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,970
want to accuse him of harassment,

290
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,390
you need to provide more solid evidence.

291
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,590
There is no evidence for this.

292
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,590
He wouldn't do such a thing

293
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,310
openly in front of others.

294
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,950
So, based on the existing evidence,

295
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,830
if it goes to litigation,

296
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:17,070
it would be hard to prove in court.

297
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,810
But it did happen.

298
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:23,420
Guo Yu.

299
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,470
If we can't handle it, we can avoid it.

300
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,090
Is it easy

301
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,130
to find a job in your hometown?

302
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,190
Mrs. Luo, are you from Jingbei?

303
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,470
I...

304
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,260
I'm not. I'm from Shandong.

305
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:39,370
Why don't you go back to work in Shandong?

306
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,460
I'm sorry, Guo Yu.

307
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
I didn't mean it that way.

308
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,480
Just forget what I said.

309
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,490
He asked me to book a ticket for him.

310
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:49,950
He has a business trip

311
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:51,280
the day after tomorrow.

312
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,620
What should I do now?

313
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,150
Why don't you go to the hospital,

314
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,800
and get a fake sick note.

315
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,800
Let's avoid it first.

316
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,180
Fine.

317
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,080
Thank you, Mrs. Luo.

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,630
I'll leave now.

319
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,070
Where do I pay the consultation fee?

320
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:14,060
Don't mention it.

321
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,380
Consider it a private conversation.

322
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,540
It's free this time.

323
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,830
No need.

324
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,160
I can afford the consultation fee.

325
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,830
I'll ask the receptionist.

326
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,370
Okay.

327
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,040
-Hello, Zhang. -Hello, Ms. Zhang.

328
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,680
Okay.

329
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:38,850
Please come in.

330
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:41,750
-This way. -Okay.

331
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,390
I think we had a good chat just now.

332
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah. But the price is a bit high.

333
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,190
But Zhang explained it to me just now.

334
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,400
I think it was quite good. It made sense.

335
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,310
Yes, it was clear.

336
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,630
But can they take this case?

337
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,600
Should we engage their services?

338
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,950
Let's think it over.

339
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,550
Okay.

340
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,360
What about the girl?

341
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:55,700
She left.

342
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:58,710
How did you reply her?

343
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,860
What could I say?

344
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,250
I couldn't persuade her to sue anyway.

345
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,180
I just comforted her.

346
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,470
And suggested her to change a job.

347
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,770
If it doesn't work,

348
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,370
she can go back to her hometown.

349
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,890
That's a good suggestion.

350
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:19,230
You actually

351
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,360
advised her to return to her hometown?

352
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,040
Thank you.

353
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,340
What else can we do?

354
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,270
If she continues to stay in Weida Group,

355
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,240
she won't escape the fate of harassment.

356
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,850
If we ask her to leave

357
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,450
because of this incident.

358
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,350
Do you think that person

359
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,550
would allow her to find a job in Jingbei?

360
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,470
Oh no!

361
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,350
A girl fell down the stairs!

362
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,020
Go and see if she is one of us.

363
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,220
Hurry!

364
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,120
Luo Yingzi.

365
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,800
I'll definitely work on the case with you.

366
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,500
My lady, which case are you talking about?

367
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,160
Can you give it to me?

368
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,870
I also want to earn some money.

369
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,690
Isn't it the

370
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:15,510
sexual harassment case we just discussed?

371
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,950
What sexual harassment?

372
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
She was just here for consultation.

373
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,350
Didn't you explain the legal regulations

374
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,230
to her?

375
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:23,440
She asked questions and then left.

376
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:23,990
But...

377
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,590
So what about the sexual harassment?

378
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,790
Did she just let it go?

379
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,320
What can we do?

380
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:29,520
Well...

381
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,400
Why is she so spineless?

382
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,900
Can you show some empathy?

383
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,310
Forget it.

384
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,480
She is not sensible.

385
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,500
Stop it.

386
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,070
Let it be.

387
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,070
Let's all disperse.

388
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,230
Ms. Qiu. Mrs. Luo.

389
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,000
The girl you were receiving in the waiting room

390
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,840
fell down.

391
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:46,170
Where did she hurt?

392
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,760
Excuse me, let me pass.

393
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,430
Excuse me. Excuse me.

394
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:52,350
Excuse me, let me pass.

395
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,710
Guo Yu, are you alright?

396
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,310
Guo Yu, are you alright?

397
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,470
Guo Yu, can you move?

398
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,070
No.

399
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:57,830
Let me touch it.

400
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,580
Don't touch it.

401
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,040
Call an ambulance! Hurry!

402
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,170
No, no, I don't have money.

403
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,440
Don't worry about it.

404
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,670
Come on, let's take her to the hospital.

405
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:06,750
Let me do it.

406
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,109
Xia Shu, just don't complicate things.

407
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,790
Okay.

408
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,810
Hello, is this the ambulance?

409
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,119
Someone fell down here.

410
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:20,950
[People's Hospital]

411
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,760
I've seen your X-ray.

412
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:21,359
Your ankle bone is fractured.

413
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,280
Nothing serious.

414
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,960
Just stay in the hospital for observation.

415
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,230
Thank you. Thank you.

416
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,069
Who is her family? Pay the hospital bill.

417
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:27,990
Nurse, I don't want to be hospitalized.

418
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,250
It's okay. I'll pay it.

419
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,060
Thank you.

420
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:30,790
Okay.

421
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:31,600
Mrs. Luo, I really...

422
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,440
Guo Yu.

423
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,550
Just lie down and listen to the doctor.

424
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,500
Let's wait a couple of days before going home.

425
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,590
Mrs. Luo, I can't stay in the hospital.

426
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm fine to go home now.

427
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,270
Don't move. Lie down.

428
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:41,950
You...

429
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,430
Let me pay the hospital fee.

430
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,630
I just paid the medical fee.

431
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,720
I know where to pay it.

432
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,100
Guo Yu, just lie down.

433
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,320
Since you have entrusted us,

434
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,310
you are our client.

435
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,040
We will be responsible for you.

436
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,080
Xia Shu.

437
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,280
Xia Shu, wait.

438
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,230
Just lie down.

439
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,390
Don't worry.

440
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,740
Do you know the workplace rules?

441
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,310
What rules?

442
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,170
As for Guo Yu's situation,

443
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,060
it might not be considered a case right now.

444
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,950
Even if it becomes one in the future,

445
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,880
the case is taken care of by Mrs. Luo and I.

446
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
It has nothing to do with you.

447
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:19,590
You don't need to pay for the hospitalization expenses.

448
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,510
We will pay it ourselves.

449
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:21,270
Just go back.

450
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,310
Mrs. Luo and I are here.

451
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,210
Qiu Hua, I don't want to take your cases away.

452
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,650
I just want to join you.

453
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,500
I know.

454
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,430
But we're not short of hands now.

455
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,370
How about this?

456
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,110
I'll pay Guo Yu's agent fee.

457
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,910
Let's work together on the case.

458
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,710
Are you kidding?

459
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:39,750
Do you think it is just spending money

460
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,350
to play, like playing a game?

461
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,850
There are lawsuits at the courthouse entrance

462
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,010
that one can't afforded to pursue.

463
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,520
Just pick one.

464
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,330
Quickly go back to your work.

465
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,810
If you need any help.

466
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,100
I'll call you anytime.

467
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,230
Go ahead.

468
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,560
Bye.

469
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,250
Bye.

470
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,340
You drove her away.

471
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,450
Why did you involve her?

472
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,940
I was anxious about Guo Yu‘ situation.

473
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,570
I just asked her to help me check a legal provision.

474
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,100
Didn't you say she is a legal textbook parrot?

475
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,730
I didn't expect to involve her in the case.

476
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,400
The hospitalization fees are quite high.

477
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,400
What should we do?

478
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:41,650
What can we do?

479
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,170
Let us pay it.

480
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,470
Guo Yu.

481
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,870
You are not able to move around easily.

482
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,270
Is there anyone taking care of you?

483
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,670
I can take care of myself.

484
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:03,150
Mrs. Luo,

485
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,620
let me have your WeChat.

486
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,440
I'll pay you back the medical fee.

487
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,990
The fee...

488
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,470
I can afford it.

489
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,240
Just let me have your WeChat.

490
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,970
I'll transfer the money to you.

491
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,230
Thank you, Mrs. Luo.

492
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,730
We should get going.

493
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,220
If you need anything later,

494
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,470
feel free to text me on WeChat.

495
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,090
Thank you.

Bye.

497

I'll take the file away soon.

567
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,650
What are you thinking?

568
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,910
These are my most profitable cases,

569
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,360
and you want them?

570
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,950
The audacity.

571
00:24:03,070 --> 00:24:03,650
Qiu Hua,

572
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,100
I'll take care of your future, OK?

573
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,400
If you will be mine,

574
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,580
we can work on my case together,

575
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:12,030
and we can be a husband and wife team.

576
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,430
How dare you record me?

577
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,430
What do you want?

578
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,290
I just want my cases.

579
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,640
You signed the agreements,

580
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,060
but I did all the work.

581
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,700
These are my intellectual work.

582
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,610
Qiu Hua,

583
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,380
you are so ungrateful.

584
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,670
Without me,

585
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:49,180
and just you alone,

586
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,100
how do you get into this law firm?

587
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,580
How do you get cases?

588
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:56,240
How do you get your license?

589
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:00,660
How dare you record me.

590
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,560
What are you going to do?

591
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,860
Make it public?

592
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,400
Sue me?

593
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:06,880
Fine.

594
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,190
Do as you wish.

595
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,040
Go sue me!

596
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,720
I just want those three cases.

597
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,890
I signed the agreements.

598
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,830
How can you take them away?

599
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,130
Luo Yingzi and I will handle it.

600
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,790
You'll get 30% of the attorney's fee.

601
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,480
You wish!

602
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,430
Sue me if you dare!

603
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,220
Mr. Han,

604
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,740
if I sue you,

605
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,300
you won't afford it.

606
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,140
I'll take these three cases.

607
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:05,590
By the way,

608
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,910
Mr. Liang has resigned,

609
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,040
Luo Yingizi and I will take his office.

610
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:12,180
So starting from tomorrow,

611
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
I won't be coming in your office.

612
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:29,370
Yingzi.

613
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,770
-You're here. -Morning.

614
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,270
Yingzi,

615
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,760
we won't work here anymore.

616
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,660
What happened?

617
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:46,970
Nothing.

618
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,440
Look at that office.

619
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,550
Mr. Liang has resigned.

620
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,480
The office will be ours from now on.

621
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,810
Is that so?

622
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,250
I’ve talked to Han.

623
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Let’s have a look.

624
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,660
Look at that. It's good.

625
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:05,880
Not bad.

626
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,580
This computer is ours?

627
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,510
OK.

628
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,270
And this TV

629
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,080
is ours too?

630
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,870
Of course.

631
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:14,840
Great.

632
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:19,760
Facing east.

633
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,030
Do you know what facing east means?

634
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,500
Getting rich.

635
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,400
Interesting.

636
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,230
It means you'll go solo with me.

637
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,580
I took these

638
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,460
three cases from him,

639
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,930
with each values around a million yuan.

640
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,500
But it's his signature

641
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,620
on the aggrements.

642
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:56,740
Did he agree?

643
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,600
He had to.

644
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,330
And my name is on it too.

645
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,140
I told him

646
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,620
I'll take these three cases with me

647
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,160
and give him 30% of the attorney's fee.

648
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,370
You will be working with me.

649
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,930
Forget it.

650
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,310
His name makes me sick.

651
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,200
By the way,

652
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,410
Mr. Wei called.

653
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,320
He asked us to meet...

654
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,880
he said we should meet his friend.

655
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,480
We have our own case now.

656
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,780
I'll bring my stuff in.

657
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,150
What happened?

658
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,260
You're fired?

659
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,210
What are you talking about?

660
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,120
Mrs. Luo has her own office now.

661
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,090
She's moving in.

662
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,230
Office?

663
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:08,480
That one.

664
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
You got promoted?

665
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,140
Let me help you then.

666
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:17,810
No need.

667
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,040
I can do it myself.

668
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,090
What happened?

669
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,300
How would I know.

670
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:41,510
If you want to know,

671
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,440
why don't you ask Mr. Han yourself?

672
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,900
Just put it in that place.

673
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:52,610
This one?

674
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:53,620
Over there.

675
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,140
OK.

676
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Finally,

677
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,360
a private office of my own.

678
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,110
Your own?

679
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,420
I'm also here.

680
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,870
Sooner or later, I'll kick you out.

681
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
You have a new office?

682
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,900
I brought you snack.

683
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,980
-What are you doing?
-Here, try some.

684
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,280
It's pretty nice.

685
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:24,800
Luo Yingzi,

686
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,380
I'll move in with you too.

687
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,620
Princess, your highness, please,

688
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:33,140
don't make more trouble for us.

689
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,590
Look, our office

690
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,770
has no elbow room.

691
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,550
With such a big partner office,

692
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,300
why are you squeezing in with us?

693
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,070
It's boring to be alone.

694
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,730
I want to stay with you.

695
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:44,470
Boring?

696
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,090
I have an idea.

697
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:48,790
What?

698
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:49,470
Here.

699
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,230
Let me tell you.

700
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,270
Call your dad.

701
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,180
Then,

702
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,380
ask him to hire a helper to play with you.

703
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:57,910
Go ahead.

704
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,150
But, the case...

705
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:00,810
What case?

706
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,240
-There's none. -Well...

707
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,620
See?

708
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,290
It's all your fault.

709
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:11,310
Here.

710
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,750
No.

711
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,610
You have to eat.

712
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,420
You know...

713
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,990
Your have this

714
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,980
prejudice against Xia Shu,

715
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,430
it's too obvious.

716
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,340
I have nothing against her.

717
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,170
I just don't like her.

718
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,790
She just has a good background,

719
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,090
not a bad intention.

720
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,380
[Guo Yu]

721
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,320
Hello?

722
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,080
Guo Yu.

723
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,230
How are you?

724
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,330
Is your leg better?

725
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,600
Mrs. Luo, can you do me a favor?

726
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,630
What is it?

727
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,400
If my company

728
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,860
sends someone to ask you,

729
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,380
could you tell them that

730
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,670
I was only consulting for the demolition

731
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,440
of my house back home?

732
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,550
But you're only here for legal counseling.

733
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:10,410
Why are you scard to let them know?

734
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,410
No.

735
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,480
Mr. Yang heard that I fell at your place,

736
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,490
and gets a little suspicious.

737
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,340
He came by today

738
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,940
and pried into what I was doing there.

739
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
I'm afraid he might find out.

740
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,110
Mrs. Luo,

741
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,610
please do me this favor.

742
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,570
I really can't lose this job.

743
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,280
Alright.

744
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,430
What happen to Guo Yu?

745
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,670
It's weird.

746
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,630
You see,

747
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,640
she is the victim here,

748
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,770
but she feels like a perpetrator.

749
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,630
Can't tell anyone or make any move.

750
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,290
She is afraid of being caught.

751
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,860
Well,

752
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,800
we should hurry up.

753
00:32:58,570 --> 00:32:59,300
Get ready.

754
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,310
Also, Mr. Wei

755
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,670
arranged for us

756
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,000
to meet his friend on Wednesday.

757
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,200
Before that,

758
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,960
we need to map out the strategy.

759
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,350
Hello.

760
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,090
Yes.

761
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,400
Who's this?

762
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,240
Guo Yu?

763
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,050
She came here by.

764
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,710
She asked about the demolition.

765
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:32,350
Who's this? How can I help you?

766
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,830
Your company really cares about employees.

767
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,340
OK.

768
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,180
Goodbye.

769
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,800
Is that Yang Weida's guy?

770
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,120
A woman.

771
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,380
Let's not talk about them. Move on.

772
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:50,820
Here.

773
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:52,020
Look at this,

774
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,930
the information of Mr. Dong's case,

775
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,530
he is Mr. Wei's friend.

776
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,850
I've read it.

777
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,780
The case value is pretty high.

778
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,030
For standard attorney's fee,

779
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,429
it will cost hundreds of thousands of yuan.

780
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,380
What's wrong?

781
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:15,880
Nothing.

782
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:25,739
Is it because

783
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,580
I talked Guo Yu out of lawsuit?

784
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
But you know

785
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,510
we can't win this case.

786
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:39,210
No, I didn't say anything.

787
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
I truly understand how Guo Yu feels.

788
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,550
Being bullied

789
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,230
but feels like a perpetrator.

790
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,760
But what can she do?

791
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,130
She came to Jingbei alone

792
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:06,070
with no resource, background or connection.

793
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,560
You may think that

794
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,720
everyone came to the big city

795
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:13,810
without any resources

796
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,410
background or connections.

797
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,900
But it's still different.

798
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:19,780
With a lawsuit on your back,

799
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,420
would you dare to buy a car with a loan,

800
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,330
get a facial,

801
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:25,760
or live a carefree life?

802
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,920
If it were me, I wouldn't dare.

803
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,710
Do you know the difference between us?

804
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,920
A sense of security.

805
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,140
No matter what you face outside,

806
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,250
no matter what situation you're in,

807
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:45,690
you know you're safe.

808
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,300
But we can't.

809
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:50,500
We have a bunch of people counting on us.

810
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,330
We can't get any support,

811
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:59,140
We carry the expectations of so many.

812
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,860
We can't afford any mistakes.

813
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,600
One slip, and it's not just ourselves,

814
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,520
the people behind us

815
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,980
will also go down for that.

816
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,440
No matter what we go through outside,

817
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,520
we can't tell them.

818
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,170
You persuade Guo Yu

819
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,930
to go back to her hometown.

820
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,690
Indeed, it might be a more comfortable

821
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,910
and simpler life there.

822
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,830
But don't we

823
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,580
deserve to have dreams?

824
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,040
I didn't mean that.

825
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:40,710
I'm just...

826
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,210
I don't know what to do.

827
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,580
I don't know how to persuade her.

828
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,830
Right.

829
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,900
If it were me, I'd tell her the same thing.

830
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,680
I'm just stating a very sad reality.

831
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,270
Reality isn't that sad.

832
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,170
At least, you're not that sad.

833
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,940
Maybe I'm even sadder than she is.

834
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:21,700
Hello, I'm Luo Yingzi.

835
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,910
Mrs. Luo.

836
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,040
My surname is Qiu.

837
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,690
Mr. Qiu.

838
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,490
Come on. Have a seat.

839
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:26,810
OK.

840
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,760
[President Dong Dacheng]

841
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,150
Thank you for your efforts.

842
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,790
It's OK.

843
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:35,780
You see, Wei

844
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,740
has been my partner for years.

845
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,190
He strongly recommended you to me.

846
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,920
I've read the representation strategy

847
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:43,650
you sent me.

848
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:44,930
Pretty good.

849
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:47,490
Very insightful. Full of ideas.

850
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,830
In comparison to our legal team,

851
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,980
you have greater level of competence.

852
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,400
More importantly,

853
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,390
your sense of responsibility

854
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,550
impressed me.

855
00:37:58,830 --> 00:37:59,430
Thank you.

856
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,330
But as you know,

857
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,710
we are running a listed company.

858
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,800
For any significant matter,

859
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,140
it must be decided by the board.

860
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,430
But don't worry.

861
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,880
I will send your personal information

862
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,490
and relevant materials

863
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:19,190
to the board as soon as possible.

864
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,590
Once approved by the board,

865
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,990
I'll sign the contract with you right away.

866
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,640
Meanwhile, I have an idea.

867
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,350
It's not only just this case.

868
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,980
I'm also considering entrusting

869
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,970
our legal matters to you. How's that?

870
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,480
No problem, Mr. Dong.

871
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,950
OK.

872
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,670
You see,

873
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:38,240
We have some more questions

874
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,450
to discuss with you.

875
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,470
OK, come on.

876
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,820
For a company like that,

877
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,550
the annual consultant fee

878
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:52,880
is at least hundreds of thousands of yuan.

879
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,160
With this kind of money,

880
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,220
we will be living a comfortable life.

881
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,510
If we have more cases,

882
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,540
they are going to get us rich.

883
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,370
Why are you smiling like that?

884
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,160
I admire you.

885
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:08,190
You always have the wildest dreams.

886
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,900
Why do I tend to think of things negatively

887
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,270
and they always come true in the end.

888
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,640
That's Murphy's Law.

889
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,440
You can dream wilder in the future.

890
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
It will come true.

891
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,410
You can't dream as wild you want.

892
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:24,070
What?

893
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,910
Do you have to pay for it?

894
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,280
Can't you just give yourself some

895
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:30,040
positive mental suggestions?

896
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,370
Enough about me.

897
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:36,510
By the way, Fang asked me to persuade you

898
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,830
to consider the criminal report.

899
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,550
If you lose the lawsuit again,

900
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,440
she'll be under a lot of pressure.

901
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,480
It seems that you really loved each other.

902
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,960
Did you really love him?

903
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,800
Since he suddenly took off,

904
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,670
I think

905
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,750
I don't know the answer anymore.

906
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,690
But Qiu Hua, think about it.

907
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:08,610
In this matter,

908
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,950
Wen Li is definitely involved.

909
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,540
But if I sue Liu Ming,

910
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,950
this might alert them.

911
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,910
Wen Li will find a way to escape.

912
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,300
Letting her go

913
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,510
is the least I want to see.

914
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,110
I think you should consider Fang Lihong.

915
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,920
You lost two lawsuits in a row for her.

916
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,490
She will be unhappy with you.

917
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,760
No.

918
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,600
Murphy's Law.

919
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,690
I won't lose that many lawsuits.

920
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,740
Fang Lihong will be very satisfied with me.

921
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,670
Very satisfied.

922
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,330
Here. I'll take your bag.

923
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,040
Your leg is injured.

924
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,760
Why are you still coming to work?

925
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,730
I won't get paid if I don't work.

926
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,210
Is the boss here?

927
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,710
Isn't he on a business trip?

928
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,910
Hasn't come back yet.

929
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,040
I am going out

930
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:22,270
to meet some clients.

931
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,630
If I come back late,

932
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:24,710
remind me

933
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:25,670
to clock out.

934
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,700
OK.

935
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,310
Go ahead.

936
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,120
Guo Yu.

937
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,790
Ms. Tian asked you to come to her office.

938
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,150
Ms. Tian wants to see me?

939
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,440
She's waiting for you in the office.

940
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,370
I know about this.

941
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:47,360
Ms. Tian, you want to see me?

942
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,310
Yes.

943
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,770
OK, that's all for now.

944
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,200
I have to go now.

945
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,390
OK.

946
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:11,590
See you.

947
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,510
Your legs...

948
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,500
Please sit down.

949
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,520
Does it still hurt?

950
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:28,640
No.

951
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,030
My friend

952
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,500
brought me new tea.

953
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,670
I like it very much.

954
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,040
Here, try it.

955
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,200
See if you like it.

956
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:43,990
Thank you, Ms. Tian.

957
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,920
You're welcome.

958
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:51,560
How did you fall down?

959
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,300
I heard your fell

960
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:56,320
in front of a law firm.

961
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,410
Why are you there?
