4
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:42,310
Lanlan, what are having for breakfast?

5
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,590
Toasted bread.

6
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,390
Didn't I ask you to throw this away yesterday?

7
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,110
You must have forgotten it.

8
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,750
Yingzi!

9
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,270
This key chain looks pretty.

10
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,900
I wanna keep it if you don't.

11
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,030
Okay.

12
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,390
Keep it for yourself.

13
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,040
Yingzi,

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,720
who was the guy that came here yesterday?

15
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,110
A hooligan.

16
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,710
Hooligan?

17
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,740
He seems gentle.

18
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,300
He's a gentle scumbag then.

19
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,800
Does he have a crush on you?

20
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,100
He came to our place for a key chain in the middle of the night.

21
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,220
He has a crush on me?

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,350
I feel as if I'm flattered, Lanlan.

23
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:19,410
I pray to God to never let that happen.

24
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,100
Why do you hate him so much?

25
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,380
How can I not?

26
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,150
Lanlan, do you know why

27
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:24,990
we were kicked out of our old place,

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,590
and had to move here?

29
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,050
It's all because of him.

30
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:29,550
Really?

31
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,340
Who is he?

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
He seems to have got some real stuff.

33
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,930
His name is Chen Shuo.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,440
He represents the bank.

35
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,930
That explains everything.

36
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,079
Yingzi,

37
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,340
I did some serious thinking last night.

38
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:53,320
What you said was right.

39
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,790
I was deceived by Zhou Houze.

40
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,230
I became weirdly obsessed with him.

41
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,230
But now I've made up my mind

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,360
to leave Zhou Houze.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,280
Is it true?

44
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,550
I applaud for you. My thumbs are up for you.

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,350
Have you really sorted things out?

46
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,430
Yes, I have.

47
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,220
Great.

48
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,780
Focus on your study then.

49
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,030
Now that I've broken up with Zhou Houze,

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,590
I don't have any money.

51
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,830
I plan to find a job

52
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,940
so that I can support myself.

53
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,470
Besides, I can't afford to study law anymore.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,000
Are you saying

55
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:24,650
that you won't go back to Ms. Mei's class?

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,829
Even if I keep taking lessons,

57
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,950
I'm not sure

58
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,010
when I'll be able to pass the bar exam.

59
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,430
Fine.

60
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,540
I'll explain to Ms. Mei about your decision,

61
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,270
and handle the procedures of your dropout.

62
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,870
Okay.

63
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,120
It's confirmed now, isn't it?

64
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,990
Before you get a job,

65
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,400
why don't you work for me?

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,340
At least, you'll be having an income.

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,300
Yingzi, I don't want to be a nanny anymore.

68
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,460
After all, now,

69
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,150
I'm a legal practitioner who has studied law

70
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,270
for several months.

71
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,510
I'd like to find

72
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,950
a law-related job.

73
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,020
Yingzi, is your firm hiring?

74
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,610
But you haven't passed the bar exam yet.

75
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,270
What qualification do you have?

76
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,280
What can you do in my firm?

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,270
I don't have to be a lawyer.

78
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,550
I can be an administrative assistant,

79
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,790
or something else.

80
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,670
Yingzi, do you need an assistant?

81
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,680
Lanlan,

82
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,860
you think too highly of me.

83
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:19,230
What level do you think I've reached as a lawyer?

84
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,680
Plus, I've just started handling cases on my own.

85
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,790
If I get myself an assistant,

86
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,390
what will others think of me?

87
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,660
Besides,

88
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,270
with my dinky salary, how am I supposed to

89
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,400
afford an administrative assistant?

90
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,030
Yingzi,

91
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,790
you have many friends in the legal profession.

92
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,909
Why don't you ask them

93
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:39,909
if they need an assistant?

94
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,770
Among all the lawyers in my firm,

95
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,710
I'm close to no one but Qiu Hua.

96
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,260
Her situation is similar to mine.

97
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,580
She needs to feed herself.

98
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,950
What about Mr. Chen,

99
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,460
the man who was here last night?

100
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,390
Didn't you say

101
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:01,350
he represented the bank?

102
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,970
He must be a great lawyer.

103
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,160
If I can work for him,

104
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,310
even just as an assistant,

105
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,240
I'll be able to learn a lot from him.

106
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,900
While I'm working,

107
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,590
I'll try to finish a legal course by myself.

108
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,610
In the next year, I'll take the bar exam.

109
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,490
When I pass it,

110
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,580
I'll apply for a job in your firm.

111
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,270
Isn't that good?

112
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:21,350
The problem is,

113
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,680
I need to be able to support myself now.

114
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,350
Chen Shuo

115
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:28,960
is indeed a competent lawyer.

116
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,110
If you become his assistant,

117
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,370
and work as hard as you can,

118
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,520
you'll learn a lot of good things.

119
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,200
You think she's not nice to you?

120
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,750
She's always mercurial like that, isn't she?

121
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,030
But I think

122
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,180
she's playing hard to get.

Unscrupulous Chen.

127
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,790
Righteous Luo.

Hello, famous hooligan.

129
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,050
Hello, courteous lady.

130
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,790
Good for you.

131
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,790
God knows why you can still laugh as you're about to be dead meat.

132
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,980
What do you want? Spill it.

133
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,110
Unscrupulous Chen,

134
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,780
Thank you for showing concern.

135
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,390
You even visited me yesterday.

136
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:21,790
I spent much time grieving at your departure.

137
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,520
Those who show care for me at this particular time are true friends.

138
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,730
I'll never forget them.

139
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,620
Thank you for reducing me to this situation,

140
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,750
Unscrupulous Chen.

141
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,590
You know

142
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,790
what a difficult time I'm about to have.

143
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:36,520
You've taken everything from me,

144
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,850
but at home,

145
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,950
there's a nanny financially relying on my.

146
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,960
I don't think in the future

147
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,990
I can afford to hire a nanny anymore.

148
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,350
So I thought of you.

149
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,730
Would you do me a favor?

150
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,710
A favor?

151
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:49,940
Sure.

152
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,909
My pleasure.

153
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,020
Tell me. What kind of favor?

154
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,210
What?

155
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,990
You want me to hire her as my assistant?

156
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,880
She is

157
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,480
no ordinary nanny.

158
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,320
She helped me a lot.

159
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,060
She knew my life was gonna be difficult.

160
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,230
So,

161
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,350
she decided to support herself.

162
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:14,090
I offered to find her a job.

163
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,110
I'd be worried if she works for a stranger.

164
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,630
Yesterday you stopped by, right?

165
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,160
That's how I thought of you.

166
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,330
You'll be homeless soon but you're still looking out for others.

167
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,030
Fine.

168
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,650
I've never had an assistant anyway.

169
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,460
Tell her to come to my office then.

170
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,790
It's a deal now.

171
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,990
I'll bring her to you later.

172
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,860
Thanks, Unscrupulous Chen.

173
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,400
Done!

174
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,510
Did you just introduce Lanlan to Chen Shuo?

175
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,350
Our firm won't hire her.

176
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,580
Chen Shuo is the only option.

177
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,640
Did you or she

178
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,990
suggest this idea?

179
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,300
It's suggested by Lanlan herself.

180
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,310
Luo Yingzi, I have to warn you about this.

181
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,990
You are playing with fire.

182
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,080
Have you seen a woman like her?

183
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,230
She's gonna lose her house,

184
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:03,820
but she still uses a nanny.

185
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,390
I wouldn't mind giving her a favor.

186
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:08,120
I see it as a way to help the poor.

187
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,850
If she doesn't want the nanny anymore,

188
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,600
why wouldn't she just sack her?

189
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,460
Why would she let her work for you?

190
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,520
She's shifting a burden. That's why.

191
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,690
No. No. No.

192
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,600
I don't think so.

193
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,630
This could be a huge opportunity for you.

194
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,110
You've set up many traps for her.

195
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,440
This time, she might actually fall in one.

196
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,970
What I said was correct.

197
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,890
No one can resist my charm.

198
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,470
Lanlan

199
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,760
is not an innocent girl.

200
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,090
She's quite ambitious.

201
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:37,659
Chen Shuo

202
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,169
is no regular guy.

203
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,740
Sending Lanlan to Chen Shuo is no different

204
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,470
than sending a sheep to a tiger.

205
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,470
As despicable as Chen Shuo is,

206
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,870
I don't think he'll target at a little girl.

207
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,770
Anyway, I've given you a reminder.

208
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:52,130
You have to be careful.

209
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,590
Lanlan could bring you tons of trouble.

210
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,510
I'll be more cautious

211
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,660
and keep an eye on them.

212
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,480
I'll be leaving after I tidy up my desk.

213
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,870
Where are you going?

214
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,000
Chen Shuo's office.

215
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,770
I'm bringing Lanlan to him.

216
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,950
Why do you stand in direct sunlight?

217
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,640
Let's go upstairs.

218
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,190
No. I need to be somewhere else soon.

219
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,830
Let me introduce you to each other.

220
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,570
This is Lanlan.

221
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,430
Her full name is...

222
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,760
My name is Zhang Shilan.

223
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,380
Lanlan,

224
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,810
this is Mr. Chen Shuo, a famous lawyer

225
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,000
working for Dazheng Law Firm.

226
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,500
I'll leave her to you then.

227
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,610
Lanlan, learn from Mr. Chen.

228
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,270
She used to teach herself law.

229
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,470
Please take care of her,

230
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,870
and impart wisdom to her.

231
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,430
Bye, Yingzi.

232
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:48,850
Bye!

233
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:49,720
I'll be right back.

234
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,360
Wait.

235
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,020
I've been talking to you about your house.

236
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,120
Have you given it some thought?

237
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,720
Are you really going to lose it in court?

238
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,050
What else can I do?

239
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,080
Do you have a solution to that?

240
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,310
Isn’t Fang Lihong representing you?

241
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,790
I don't believe

242
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,230
she'll sit and watch the worst happen.

243
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,910
She's not as slippery as you are.

244
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,090
Well...

245
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,810
Since your divorce isn't final yet, Mr. Liu is still your husband.

246
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:22,470
He took the money and fled. That's fraud, right?

247
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:25,730
And that loan agreement...

248
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,270
You insist that it is irrelevant to you.

249
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,350
So...

250
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,630
So what?

251
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,850
So, you suggest me call the police,

252
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,940
and turn it into a criminal case, right?

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,130
Unscrupulous Chen,

254
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
you're indeed quite unscrupulous.

255
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,430
You're trying to help the defendant

256
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,870
against the plaintiff that you represent.

257
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,790
Is that how you earn your bread and butter?

258
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,050
I didn't say anything.

259
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Then don't bother yourself with it.

260
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,990
I'm okay with losing the case.

261
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,630
Bye.

262
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,150
Please take care of Lanlan.

263
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,880
-See you, Lanlan.
-Drive safe!

264
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,830
Shuo,

265
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,810
shall we head to the office?

266
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,960
What did you call me?

267
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,590
Isn't your name Chen Shuo?

268
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,650
I called you Shuo.

269
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:31,400
You're my assistant and I'm your employer.

270
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,840
You should call me Mr. Chen.

271
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,700
Be respectful.

272
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,210
Plus,

273
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,590
since you'll work in my firm,

274
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:41,830
you'd better wear something appropriate, instead of this outfit.

275
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:42,510
From now on,

276
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,750
remember to dress properly.

277
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,040
What's inappropriate about this outfit?

278
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,080
Hello, Kitty.

279
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:14,110
Come on in.

280
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,270
Let me introduce you to each other.

281
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,440
This is Mr. Xue.

282
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,140
And you are Zhang...

283
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,650
Shilan.

284
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,410
Shilan.

285
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,190
You'll work for him too.

286
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,140
You'll report to

287
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:23,930
both of us.

288
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:45,820
Shuo.

289
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,220
Call me Mr. Chen.

290
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,210
What's up?

291
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:52,070
Shall I sit here?

292
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,930
Then we can be seated face to face.

293
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,700
You're an assistant.

294
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
You'll have a place downstairs.

295
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,510
But I'm supposed to look after you.

296
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,470
This office

297
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,330
belongs to me and Mr. Xue.

298
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,230
Do you understand?

299
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,310
We have something to discuss.

300
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:05,110
You may go now.

301
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:19,420
Is she Luo Yingzi's nanny?

302
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,660
She's got bad taste.

303
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,700
She doesn't have a good eye for clothes.

304
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,360
Her socks are no good, either.

305
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,550
That's what I thought too.

306
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,510
What's wrong with Luo Yingzi?

307
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,950
Obviously, tomorrow in court, she'll lose her house.

308
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,210
Why isn't she worried?

309
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,110
Are you feeling sorry for her?

310
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,090
You don't want to be cruel to her, do you?

311
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,770
It's easy.

312
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,030
You quit and I'll represent the bank alone.

313
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,360
Then we won't share the fees.

314
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,710
What crazy idea is that?

315
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,680
She doesn't care about her house. Why should I?

316
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,300
Here's a little reminder for you.

317
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
If you take that house away from her,

318
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,370
you'll never get a chance to date her.

319
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,510
I don't believe it.

320
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:58,110
As people say,

321
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,020
sometimes rivals turn into lovers.

322
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,080
Let's wait and see.

323
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,790
Wait and see.

324
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,410
Hey, what's wrong?

325
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,790
Gastric bleeding? How come?

326
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,060
Did you take her to the hospital?

327
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
Why can't she stay there?

328
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,870
What's the use of calling me now?

329
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,330
I'm nearly 700 kilometers away from you.

330
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,030
You should talk to the doctor.

331
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,830
Okay, I got it.

332
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,150
I'll fix that.

333
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,230
I'll call you back.

334
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,510
Okay.

335
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,280
[Zhang Quanquan]

336
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,470
No matter what our future relationship will be like,

337
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,070
I need you to call your dad now

338
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,950
and tell him

339
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,610
not to help my family anymore.

340
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,590
Relax. It's no big deal.

341
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,110
You must make this call.

342
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:34,790
Otherwise, I'll have to cut you out

343
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:35,620
from my life.

344
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:47,800
Qiu Hua, did you give me a call?

345
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,220
Yes. I did.

346
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,180
Is it a good time to talk now?

347
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,460
I'm terribly sorry. Well...

348
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,870
There's a family emergency

349
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,000
that I'm afraid I need you to help with.

350
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,910
My mom's experiencing gastric bleeding.

351
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,640
She is now in the county hospital.

352
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,230
She's not allowed to get in the ward, so she has to stay in the corridor.

353
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:08,230
Could you...

354
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,390
Help her?

355
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,580
-Wang Liang.
-Ms. Luo.

356
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,580
Wang Liang, thank you for coming.

357
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,540
No problem.

358
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:19,720
What's up, Ms. Luo?

359
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,380
Is there any news about Wen Li?

360
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,420
No.

361
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,100
I'm still trying to reach her.

362
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:26,890
I asked to meet you

363
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,120
because I wanted to know more about her.

364
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,530
Ms. Luo, here's the thing.

365
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,110
I know I helped her lie to you.

366
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:37,070
I regret it a lot.

367
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,680
That said,

368
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,990
I swear I have told you

369
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,590
everything I know about her.

370
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,650
You used to be in a relationship with her.

371
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,870
It's impossible that you know so little about her.

372
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:51,240
I did have a relationship with her.

373
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,240
However,

374
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,640
I really don't know a lot about her.

375
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,230
She

376
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,650
barely told me anything.

377
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,070
The fact that she wouldn't say anything

378
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,230
didn't stop you from asking her.

379
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,790
Of course I asked.

380
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:06,210
At that time,

381
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,859
I planned to marry her.

382
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,470
I asked her many questions

383
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,630
about her family,

384
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,680
and her parents.

385
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,950
I was even considering

386
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,730
taking her parents out for a dinner

387
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,010
with my parents.

388
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,630
She just gave me a bunch of excuses,

389
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,040
and never told the truth.

390
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,780
By the way,

391
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,810
speaking of her parents, I recall something.

392
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,170
Didn't I tell you that my father helped with

393
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,010
her permanent residence registration?

394
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,430
I have found on my phone

395
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,120
a photo of her ID card.

396
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,430
That's great. Show me.

397
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:34,970
Look.

398
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,110
She's from Qingyang.

399
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,490
She was born in 1986.

400
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:46,890
How could she treat me as if I was older than her?

401
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,390
Wang Liang, can you send this photo to me?

402
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,720
-Okay. I’ll send it to you now.
-Thank you.

403
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:53,910
Ms. Luo.

404
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,710
There's one more thing,

405
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,270
but I don't know if it's gonna help.

406
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,930
Just say it.

407
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,160
One time, on a date,

408
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,760
she received a call

409
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,940
in private.

410
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:05,910
I waited for her for a long time but she never came back.

411
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,510
So I started looking for her.

412
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,840
I saw her cry as she talked on the phone.

413
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,820
She even got mad at the caller.

414
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,160
That seemed to me

415
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:15,430
that she was talking with her mother.

416
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,230
And then?

417
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,390
Since she was crying, I didn't go up to her

418
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:19,710
in case the situation got more awkward.

419
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,370
Then I went back to where I was.

420
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:22,970
After a while, she came back as well.

421
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,190
It looked as if nothing had happened to her.

422
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,840
She chatted and laughed with me.

423
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,660
I guessed

424
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:27,910
perhaps

425
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,710
she didn't want me to know about that.

426
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,570
So I didn't ask.

427
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,030
You had put too much trust in her.

428
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,160
You didn't know

429
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,500
what a leech she was.

430
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,420
Alright.

431
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,700
Wang Liang, thank you.

432
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,990
If something happens,

433
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:41,950
I'll contact you.

434
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,430
Okay.

435
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,990
Okay.

436
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,990
I'll go back to work then, Ms. Luo.

437
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,950
Okay, thank you.

438
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,400
Bye.

439
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,210
So she's from Qingyang.

440
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,790
It says so on her ID card.

441
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,350
It should be true if her ID isn't forged.

442
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,990
What's your plan?

443
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:06,990
Qiu Hua.

444
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,320
Have you been to Qingyang?

445
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,520
I heard the noodles there are delicious.

446
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,710
Some time later,

447
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,030
I'd like to treat you to a trip to Qingyang.

448
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,510
We'll eat some noodles and taste the vinegar there.

449
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,520
It's gonna be a little vacation.

450
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,010
I can pay for myself.

451
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,850
Okay.

452
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,130
That settles it.

453
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,420
Leave that Qingyang trip aside.

454
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:30,910
You should think about the case we're doing.

455
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,280
Aren't we ready to lose?

456
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,620
What else can I do?

457
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,120
This has put much pressure on Fang Lihong.

458
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,990
She's gonna lose two rounds in a row.

459
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,990
Some people in the firm say

460
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,510
she'd give up everything for money.

461
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,140
For a lawyer like her,

462
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,320
dignity is more important than anything.

463
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,340
I think you should find a time

464
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,910
to explain to her,

465
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,860
so she'll have a deeper understanding.

466
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,630
What else can I explain?

467
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,730
I've explained everything.

468
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,350
I...

469
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,150
I'm tired of giving explanations.

470
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:00,610
I won't say anything more.

471
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,060
[Jingbei Court]

472
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,180
Lanlan.

473
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,420
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

474
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,300
Good to see you.

475
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,300
How's it going with your work?

476
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,560
Did Mr. Chen bully you?

477
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,460
Mr. Chen takes good care of me.

478
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,020
Righteous Luo.

479
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,060
Thank you for referring Zhang Shilan to me.

480
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,280
She's smart.

481
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,820
She always carries my bag for me.

482
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,730
Unscrupulous Chen,

483
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:51,430
I let my nanny work for you not because

484
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,550
I wanted her to carry your bag for you.

485
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,030
You've gotta teach her.

486
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,300
Ms. Luo,

487
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,240
I'm a paralegal now.

488
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:59,370
Stop calling me a nanny.

489
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,080
Alright.

490
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,000
My bad.

491
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,090
Unscrupulous Chen, don't you bully her!

492
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,780
Lanlan, we're gonna be opponents in court.

493
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,760
See you later.

494
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,430
Are you really gonna let the bank take your house away?

495
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,020
It's up to you.

496
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,200
If you want to do that, I can't stop you.

497
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,270
Mr. Chen,

498
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,510
Ms. Luo is quite a character.

499
00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:23,090
When you're her opposing counsel,

500
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,350
you'd better be careful.

501
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,340
How so?

502
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,900
When she found her husband had run away,

503
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,750
and left her with a load of debts,

504
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,910
the first thing she did was

505
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,900
sell the apartment

506
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,900
that her mother-in-law was living in.

507
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,160
Then she used the most part of that money

508
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,210
to repay private loans.

509
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,240
As for the rest of the money,

510
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,040
she bought herself a car with it.

511
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,710
She does sound like quite a character.

512
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:44,230
But you're better.

513
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,310
Call Mr. Xue. Ask if he's arrived yet.

514
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,310
The verdict is as follows.

515
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,080
The plaintiff, Civil and Commercial Bank Yunyang Branch,

516
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,760
shall be paid in priority by the defendants Liu Ying and Luo Yingzi

517
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,580
with the negotiated transfer of, or money made by selling or auctioning

518
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,600
the property under the defendants' names,

519
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,990
i.e., Room 1401 in Building D, Zone A of Blue Sea International real estate

520
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,710
in Yunyang District, Jingbei City.

521
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,710
The defendant will pay the litigation fee.

522
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,150
Sorry, Yingzi.

523
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:15,910
Ms. Fang,

524
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,760
the house is no longer mine.

525
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,830
Don't feel sorry about it.

526
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,430
I chose to forfeit the house.

527
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,720
Defendant, do you wish to file an appeal?

528
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,190
We'll discuss it.

529
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,110
Okay.

530
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,030
-Court adjourned.
-It's meaningless.

531
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,600
We should wrap it up as soon as possible.

532
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,930
We've still got 15 days.

533
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,380
We'll wait and see.

534
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:33,930
Thank you.

535
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:39,870
Yingzi,

536
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,110
what are you gonna do then?

537
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,910
I'll write him an e-mail

538
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,620
and tell him about the verdict.

539
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,510
I'll try to persuade him to come back.

540
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,820
He doesn't have strong opinions.

541
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,420
If Wen Li isn't with him,

542
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,040
perhaps he'll listen to me.

543
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,930
Don't tell him about Wen Li's relationship

544
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:58,930
with Sun Huading.

545
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,050
Don't worry.

546
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,180
Mr. Chen, Mr. Xue.

547
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,230
Congratulations!

548
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,560
You won another battle.

549
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,760
What's there to congratulate?

550
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,950
I've talked to you several times

551
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:09,950
about the house.

552
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:11,810
But you just didn't care about it.

553
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,430
I'm sorry that you lost it.

554
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,470
Don't be.

555
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,070
What else was I supposed to do

556
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,110
in the face of a competent and heartless lawyer like you?

557
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:20,670
Bye.

558
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,190
She didn't even frown when she lost a house.

559
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:29,890
Yeah.

560
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:31,020
How odd!

561
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,390
Here comes your coffee!

562
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:34,950
Thank you.

563
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:36,670
Zhang Shilan,

564
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,030
you said Luo Yingzi had sold an apartment before, right?

565
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,870
Other than that,

566
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,300
what else do you know about her?

567
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,620
In what aspect?

568
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,820
Never mind.

569
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,900
I was curious

570
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,110
why she admitted defeat so easily.

571
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,650
That's because you're an amazing lawyer.

572
00:23:58,420 --> 00:23:59,630
Can't argue with that!

573
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,240
Your bag!

574
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:03,860
Qiu Hua.

575
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,050
Zhang Quanquan.

576
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:06,910
Yingzi.

577
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,750
Let me introduce him to you.

578
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,210
What brought you here?

579
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,890
You did a good job today.

580
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,620
The flowers are for you.

581
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,200
You shouldn't have wasted money on these.

582
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,720
Let me introduce you to each other.

583
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,560
This is my work partner Luo Yingzi.

584
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,960
This is Zhang Quanquan from my hometown.

585
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,660
We went to middle school together.

586
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:23,530
-Hello.
-Hello.

587
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,660
I'm Zhang Quanquan.

588
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,930
Did you just lose the house like that?

589
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,330
I had no choice.

590
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,160
Maybe it's destined to be someone else's.

591
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,010
Qiu Hua,

592
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,200
I'm leaving.

593
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,190
Okay, bye.

594
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,750
Take care.

595
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,880
Let's have dinner together next time.

596
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,180
Quanquan, thank you.

597
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:49,080
Sorry for bothering you with my mom's illness.

598
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,040
Without you,

599
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,670
I wouldn't know what to do.

600
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,170
Stop saying that or I'll be mad at you.

601
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:56,250
As I've told you,

602
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,780
you can turn to me if your family needs help.

603
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,780
Can I take you out for dinner?

604
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,780
It should be my treat.

605
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,910
You've given me a huge favor.

606
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:08,460
Don't even mention that.

607
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
Let's go!

608
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,270
♫I'm following♫

609
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,360
♫Where the wind blows♫

610
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,180
Yingzi, now you've lost everything.

611
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,850
♫Chasing the sun and soil♫

612
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:54,710
♫Growing freely♫

613
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,730
♫But there will always be curves♫

614
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,860
♫More steps♫

615
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,190
♫Night is just the morning fog♫

616
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:14,380
♫Let him go♫

617
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,560
Liu Ming,

618
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,070
you blacklisted my WeChat and QQ accounts.

619
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,860
♫I have my stars to love♫

620
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,320
I can only contact you via e-mail.

621
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:21,120
As I'm writing you this,

622
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,150
♫I left in a hurry♫

623
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,200
I don't feel sad or happy,

624
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:24,220
resentment or regrets.

625
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,240
♫I'll be my own light♫

626
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,580
I just want to tell you some facts.

627
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:32,510
♫Share brightness with those who get lost like me♫

628
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,110
I came back from court not long ago.

629
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,740
The place that we used to call home

630
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,630
will be auctioned by court soon.

631
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:38,230
♫Accept all withering, and start again♫

632
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,880
The money will be used to repay

633
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,820
the 10 million and interest you owed the Civil and Commercial Bank when you left.

634
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,730
At this point,

635
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,260
♫I have my tomorrow waiting♫

636
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,780
all the bank loans you took out

637
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,510
and the private loans you borrowed

638
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,020
have been cleared by me.

639
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,130
♫Not in a hurry♫

640
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,280
And I have lost everything because of you.

641
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,790
♫Be your gentle light♫

642
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,670
Don't take what I say here

643
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,370
as accusations.

644
00:26:51,550 --> 00:27:01,020
♫Freedom♫

645
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,750
After all, we used to be husband and wife.

646
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,610
Sometimes when I think of what you've done,

647
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,410
I'm confused.

648
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,790
I wish I could see you one day.

649
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,120
Then we can sit and talk in peace.

650
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,230
I look forward to an explanation from you.

651
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,110
Don't bother.

652
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,720
Thank you.

653
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,360
You're welcome.

654
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,710
Well...

655
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:46,230
When will we meet up again?

656
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,120
I've been busy lately.

657
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,940
I'll call you later.

658
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:52,990
Okay.

659
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,500
I'm leaving then.

660
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,750
Wait.

661
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,620
Should your family needs anything,

662
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,810
just let me know.

663
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,590
Welcome back.

664
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:19,990
Qiu Hua.

665
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,100
I need to

666
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,430
tell you something.

667
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,080
Go ahead.

668
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,490
Are you sure

669
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,700
you wanna be with Zhang Quanquan?

670
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,310
I know

671
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,340
I shouldn't

672
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,580
interfere with your personal life.

673
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,120
I just think

674
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,640
you deserve better.

675
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,270
You know what?

676
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,340
My brother called me a few days ago.

677
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,100
My mom had acute gastric bleeding and was sent to the county hospital.

678
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,320
She had to stay in the corridor because the ward wouldn't let her in.

679
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,870
I called Zhang Quanquan.

680
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,180
In less than ten minutes,

681
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,110
my mom was taken to the best ward.

682
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,110
Is that what made you decide

683
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,610
to have a romantic relationship with him?

684
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,470
Romance is a real luxury for people like me.

685
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,120
Don't sell yourself short.

686
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:19,700
You fought your way out of the countryside to Jingbei.

687
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,560
You became an attorney at law in just a few years.

688
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:25,090
You've got several huge cases in your hands.

689
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,620
If you win these cases,

690
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,330
you'll make tens of thousands,

691
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,060
or even hundreds of thousands.

692
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,460
How many of our peers

693
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,010
can achieve what you have done?

694
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:35,140
You're entitled to have real romance.

695
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,570
And then God has led me to you.

696
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,740
I'm a lucky pup.

697
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,860
Real romance doesn't belong to me.

698
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,540
I'm different from you.

699
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,700
I'm not making money for myself.

700
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,950
As I've told you,

701
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:50,470
over these years,

702
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,990
I've done everything I can

703
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:53,550
to avoid returning to my hometown

704
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,280
because I know if that happens,

705
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,380
I'll never get a chance to realize my dream.

706
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,070
However, I can't sever all the ties.

707
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:04,200
That's where I was raised.

708
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:06,160
I'm obligated to give back.

709
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,050
With Zhang Quanquan in my life, I can solve the problem.

710
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,020
He is not an ideal lover,

711
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:18,310
but he is the most reliable one.

712
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,650
For me,

713
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,260
he's more suited than anyone else.

714
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,280
I understand.

715
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,480
If you insist,

716
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,240
I...

717
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,070
I have nothing to say.

718
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,250
I just hope

719
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,110
you'll really look at yourself,

720
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,970
and know that you deserve better.

721
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,510
I know in your eyes no one is good enough for me.

722
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,310
It's not true.

723
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,390
At least you should be with someone taller.

724
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,320
Thank you.

725
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,560
Thank you for thinking so highly of me.

726
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,590
I've thought about it.

727
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,610
Maybe I should spend some time with him.

728
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,050
Perhaps I'll fall in love with him.

729
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:07,470
What's up?

730
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,480
Hello, Ms. Luo, a client is here,

731
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,960
asking for you and Ms. Qiu.

732
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,890
Tell the client to wait for us in the meeting room.

733
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,100
We'll be right there.

734
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,510
Okay.

735
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,310
Thank you.

736
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,710
What did I just tell you, Qiu Hua?

737
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,320
A case is awaiting us.

738
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,840
A client has asked for us.

739
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,720
Let's go.

740
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:25,880
Really?

741
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,050
Have a fair assessment of yourself.

742
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:30,850
Hurry up.

743
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,440
[Owner of an online shop Ma Lili]

744
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,710
Hello.

745
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,960
Are you Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu?

746
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,860
I'm Ms. Luo.

747
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,750
This is Ms. Qiu.

748
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,590
And you are?

749
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,690
Nice to meet you, Ms. Luo.

750
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,390
Hello.

751
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,360
Hello, Ms. Qiu.

752
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,990
Hello.

753
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,890
You are so young.

754
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,930
But you look exactly as I expected.

755
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,840
Have a seat.

756
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,810
What brings you here today?

757
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,450
Let me introduce myself.

758
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,400
My family name is Ma.

759
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,660
My full name is Ma Lili.

760
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,900
Okay, Ms. Ma.

761
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,310
There's a huge case

762
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,180
I'd like you to work on.

763
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,610
What is it?

764
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,260
I came here

765
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:17,630
because of my ex-husband.

766
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,020
Ex-husband?

767
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,980
Do you believe in love?

768
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,370
If true love

769
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,740
does exist,

770
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,750
it must be what I have with Jianshe.

771
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,110
Are you referring to your ex-husband?

772
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,440
But in my heart,

773
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,830
he's the one and only man in my life.

774
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,800
Okay.

775
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,620
What happened to him?

776
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,480
This silly man was sentenced

777
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,910
to life imprisonment in the first trial

778
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:05,110
for the crime of intentional injuries.

779
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:08,460
I'd like you to represent him in the second trial.

780
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,870
Can you tell us more about the case?

781
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:14,530
If we were still together,

782
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,510
and hadn't divorced,

783
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,870
he wouldn't have been in such big trouble.

784
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,360
Now,

785
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:23,460
I own an online shop.

786
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,680
Five years ago,

787
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,920
I ran a food stall on the street.

788
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,260
That's when I met Jianshe.

789
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:34,960
I'm taking this away, ma'am.

790
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,400
Sure.

791
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,920
His job was about cables.

792
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,840
An egg, right?

793
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,430
Yes.

794
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:40,980
Okay.

795
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,620
Good to see you again.

796
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:46,380
Two eggs?

797
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,270
Right.

798
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,950
Soon, we got together.

799
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,230
Here you are.

800
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,380
This is yours, Mr. Xu.

801
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,080
Is there any soy milk left?

802
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,480
Sure. I kept some for you.

803
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:59,260
I liked how generous he was.

804
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:00,910
He liked how hard I worked.

805
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:03,830
Each of us had had a marriage

806
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,190
that ended up a failure.

807
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:07,690
We showed understanding for each other.

808
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,400
Not long after we met,

809
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,790
we got married.

810
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:13,900
Down it!

811
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
However, his mother didn't like me.

812
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,670
She figured that her son, a cable businessman,

813
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:21,429
should've married someone better than a street food seller.

814
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,900
She thought I wasn't good enough for him.

815
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,650
Mom,

816
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,620
may I propose a toast to you?

817
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,230
From the day we got married,

818
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,080
she never stopped giving me hard times.

819
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,130
She tried to break us up.

820
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,909
Jianshe respected her mother a lot.

821
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,780
He felt torn between me and his mother.

822
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,909
I hated to see him in misery.

823
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,469
I decided to help him out.

824
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,010
So, in less than a year after we married,

825
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:44,830
we split up.

826
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,800
I didn't know that

827
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,750
he would cause such huge trouble afterwards.

828
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,840
If I had foreseen that,

829
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,480
I'd rather let his mother torture me,

830
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,070
than divorce him.

831
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,590
I got it.

832
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,240
Ms. Ma,

833
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,480
about you and your mother-in-law,

834
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,560
we've heard a lot.

835
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,000
Can you elaborate on

836
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,570
Xu Jianshe's case?

837
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:16,600
Since the divorce,

838
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,470
Jianshe was always in a bad mood.

839
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,950
He often went out to drink with his friends.

840
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,670
One day,

841
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,870
he went out with his friends again.

842
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,040
It's just a girl.

843
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,210
A new one is coming your way.

844
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:32,760
Right.

845
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,530
Hey!

846
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:39,720
We want four more beers.

847
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,580
Let me get that.

848
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,580
I'd like four bottles of beer.

849
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:49,600
She seems great.

850
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,250
Watch. I'm gonna pat her butt.

851
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:51,850
Thank you.

852
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,630
You wanna die or what?

853
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,720
Gorgeous, why don't you drink with me?

854
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,430
What are you doing? Chubby, come!

855
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,550
Don't be shy!

856
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,440
What do you think you are doing?

857
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,290
It's very bold of you.

858
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,820
Do you know who this girl is?

859
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,760
I don't care.

860
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,700
I called dibs!

861
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,770
Where are you from?

862
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,830
Do you know who I am?

863
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,060
Do you know who I am?

864
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,110
Chubby! Chubby!

865
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,060
Don't fight! Please don't fight!

866
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,660
Stop it!

867
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:19,960
Don't move!

868
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,760
Chubby!

869
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,780
-Don't you mess with me!
-Chubby!

870
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,750
Chubby!

871
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,040
Chubby! Chubby!

872
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:26,790
Drop the stick!

873
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,530
Why do you stop me?

874
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,720
Jianshe said he followed the guys because he wanted to stop the fight.

875
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,780
But before he could realize it,

876
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,900
he and Chubby were left alone.

877
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:35,180
After that,

878
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,140
they told different stories.

879
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,170
At last,

880
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,360
a man named Li died in the woods.

881
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,020
There was no witness.

882
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,280
After the fight,

883
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,380
Jianshe went home and slept.

884
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,870
The next morning,

885
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,260
Chubby came to him

886
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,870
and said Li had died.

887
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,750
That scared Jianshe.

888
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,230
Then he ran away at night.

889
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,390
What he didn't know was,

890
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,310
though he ran away,

891
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,460
Chubby didn't.

892
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,710
Chubby turned himself in to the police.

893
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,870
He claimed that Jianshe killed that man.

894
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,470
The police issued a warrant.

895
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:21,370
I didn't know it was so serious until I saw the warrant.

896
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:22,980
I tried to reach Jianshe.

897
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,000
Then he contacted me secretly.

898
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,170
I found out he had escaped to a village.

899
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,470
So I sent him 1,000 yuan.

900
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,870
I persuaded him to come back

901
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,270
and confess to the crime.

902
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:35,570
It came as a shock to us

903
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,960
that in the first trial

904
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,480
the court ruled

905
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,320
that Li was killed by Jianshe.

906
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,630
Since Jianshe voluntarily surrendered himself,

907
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,430
and the victim was also at fault,

908
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,240
Jianshe was given leniency and sentenced to life imprisonment,

909
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,570
whereas Chubby was sentenced to 12 years.

910
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,190
In fact,

911
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:55,210
I have divorced Jianshe.

912
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,890
This matter shouldn't concern me.

913
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,350
But upon hearing about the case,

914
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,380
Jianshe's mother fell sick.

915
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:05,080
If I leave Jianshe alone,

916
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,480
no one else will help him.

917
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,090
Even if I'll have to spend all my money,

918
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,370
I must help him out.

919
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,720
The attorney I hired for the first trial isn't good enough.

920
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,520
That's how Jianshe ended up with a heavy sentence.

921
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,500
Prior to this meeting,

922
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,030
I read about the sexual harassment case

923
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,150
and the rape case you did.

924
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,830
You two are amazing.

925
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,550
That's why I'm came to you.

926
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,760
Ms. Ma, have you brought

927
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,520
the verdict of the first trial?

928
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,590
Yes.

929
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,830
If you agree to take on this case,

930
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,530
I'll show you.

931
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,360
It's okay if you don't show it to us.

932
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,370
We just want to know what the court

933
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:45,170
thought of the facts of the case.

934
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,490
Alright.

935
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,650
Ms. Ma,

936
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,260
would you mind giving us a minute?

937
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,840
Ms. Qiu and I would like to talk in private.

938
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:56,990
We'll be right back.

939
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:57,930
Okay.

940
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:58,600
Alright.

941
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,970
Have a rest here.

942
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:00,770
-Have some water.
-Okay.

943
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,480
Thank you.

944
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:02,990
Just a minute.

945
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,340
This is the kind of case

946
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,400
that shows the value of lawyers.

947
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,000
Doing non-litigation and some particular cases all the time

948
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,330
has made me feel like I'm a businesswoman.

949
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,880
What kind of person would say that

950
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,590
right after losing a house?

951
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,830
Do you not want to handle a criminal case?

952
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,890
It's not like that.

953
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,930
Ma Lili seems odd to me

954
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,290
but I don't know why.

955
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,300
Who cares?

956
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,860
We'll only focus on the facts and evidence.

957
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,980
Our plates are full now.

958
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,120
This kind of criminal case

959
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,230
is risky and difficult.

960
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,580
If the facts check out

961
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:48,160
with what she said,

962
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,300
the ruling in the first trial wasn't fair.

963
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,390
I agree.

964
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,410
If the case comes down to

965
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:57,460
Chubby's and Xu Jianshe's testimonies

966
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,200
without other evidence,

967
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,610
then it's just Chubby's words against Xu Jianshe's.

968
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,610
They have conflicts of interests.

969
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,460
Yes.

970
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,420
What's more,

971
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,100
Chubby

972
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,350
was arrested and sentenced.

973
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,470
The confession of another criminal involved can't be used as decisive evidence.

974
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,500
There is some wiggle room.

975
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,280
Qiu Hua, how about this?

976
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,300
We won't take her word for it.

977
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,720
Instead, we'll ask her to show us the written judgement of the first trial.

978
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,830
If it aligns with what she said,

979
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,550
we'll take on the case.

980
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:25,920
I wanna do this case.

981
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:29,110
Okay. We'll do it as long as you want to.

982
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,070
Mr. Liu,

983
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,290
I hope you could attract more publicity

984
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,680
for Jianshe's case.

985
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:35,070
I promise your hard work will be rewarded.

986
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,800
Good. Keep in touch.

987
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,630
Ms. Luo. Ms. Qiu.

988
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:39,290
Ms. Ma.

989
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,850
We just talked about your case and...

990
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,310
Will you take on this case?

991
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,070
Have a seat.

992
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,800
Here's the thing.

993
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,050
We haven't seen

994
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,400
the written judgement.

995
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,780
We can't just take your word for it.

996
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,490
I was telling the truth.

997
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,000
But we still haven't seen

998
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,310
the written verdict of the first trial.

999
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,420
What if you refuse to take on the case

1000
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,900
after I show you the file?

1001
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,020
We might not do the case after we read it.

1002
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,260
We bear responsibilities not only given by you,

1003
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,180
but also by our profession.

1004
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,110
No matter what case it is,

1005
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:13,280
no lawyer can decide whether to take it or not

1006
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,310
before reading relevant files.

1007
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,710
Plus,

1008
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:21,480
the verdict is not confidential, is it?

1009
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,830
Fine.

1010
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,410
I hope you will take on this case.

1011
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,260
Given the sexual harassment case you did,

1012
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,190
I regard you as righteous lawyers.

1013
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:42,350
Ms. Ma,

1014
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,650
we'll charge you by hour for this case.

1015
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:46,310
The fee is roughly estimated at 500,000.

1016
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,150
You need to pay 300,000 first.

1017
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,070
When the second trial takes place,

1018
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:51,860
you'll pay the rest 200,000.

1019
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,470
That's a large sum of money.

1020
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:55,980
As you know,

1021
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,040
I just own a tiny online shop.

1022
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,870
Though my husband was in cable business,

1023
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,060
when we divorced,

1024
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,020
I left everything behind

1025
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,680
and never took a dime from him.

1026
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,700
I'm determined to save Jianshe,

1027
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,730
regardless of the cost.

1028
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,500
I'll try to get the money.

1029
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,600
However, paying 300,000 right now

1030
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,530
is hard for me.

1031
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,740
Can we do it in a different way?

1032
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,910
I'll give you 200,000 first.

1033
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,790
When the second trial happens,

1034
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,590
I'll pay the rest 300,000.

1035
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,190
Look.

1036
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:29,330
We will study

1037
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:32,080
the written judgement of the first trial.

1038
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,640
Then we'll decide whether to take it or not.

1039
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,650
One more thing, Ms. Ma.

1040
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:39,610
Given that you and Xu Jianshe have divorced,

1041
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,530
even if we're willing to take this case,

1042
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,500
the authorization must be given

1043
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,700
by Xu Jianshe's mother, instead of you.

1044
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,520
His mother passed away.

1045
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,350
Soon after the incident,

1046
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,700
his mother fell ill.
