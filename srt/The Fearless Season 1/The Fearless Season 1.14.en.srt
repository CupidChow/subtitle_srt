[Episode 14]

4
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,060
Did you get the certificate?

5
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,680
Yes.

6
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,560
Qiu Hua,

7
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,560
come in.

8
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,050
Mr. Han, what's up?

9
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,840
Close the door.

10
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,170
Tian.

11
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,310
Mr. Tian,

12
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,070
your statement should be based on evidence.

13
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,550
Someone saw it.

14
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,030
Han hugged Qiu Hua in the office.

15
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,829
Impossible.

16
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,070
Think about it.

17
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,720
Qiu Hua

18
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,920
has no resources or background.

19
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,140
She comes from a village.

20
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,110
If she wants to make any development,

21
00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,310
she has to rely on Han.

22
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,630
How will you thank me for the certificate?

23
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,750
That's the second time you say so.

24
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,660
I don't know how to reply.

25
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,750
Come here.

26
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,190
Why are you standing so far away?

27
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,510
I won't eat you.

28
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,740
Come here.

29
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,860
You don't know how to reply. Huh?

30
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,040
Just give me a little benefit.

31
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,220
I know you didn't prepare it,

32
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,820
but I did.

33
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,400
I opened an account for you.

34
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:13,710
The password is tacky.

35
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,310
Six eights.

36
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,480
No, Mr. Han.

37
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,529
Well,

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,279
my salary is enough.

39
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,790
We are adults.

40
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,220
Don't be shy.

41
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,080
Qiu Hua.

42
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,650
Mr. Han,

43
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,150
let's try to talk calmly.

44
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,410
Don't do it in this way.

45
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,130
Do you still want to work here?

46
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,150
Don't do this.

47
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,350
Mr. Han.

48
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,790
Luo Yingzi, right?

49
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,030
Did you get the certificate?

50
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:49,909
-I got it. -Congratulations.

51
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:50,590
Thank you.

52
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,090
I have something to talk about with Qiu Hua.

53
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,970
Qiu Hua, I'm helping Mr. Han

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,100
deal with Liu Qi's case.

55
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,110
I need to

56
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,310
read the files again.

57
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,510
OK.

58
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,910
I'll send them to you after I find them.

59
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:03,480
Okay.

60
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:25,840
Here are the documents you want.

61
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,400
Qiu,

62
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,780
I have something to tell you.

63
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,890
What do you want to say?

64
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:42,710
What do you think about the proposal

65
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,790
I told you before?

66
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,790
What is it?

67
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,990
We work independently with the lawyer's practicing certificates.

68
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:53,310
We can open our own business and find cases.

69
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,930
Then we can make a living ourselves.

70
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,230
I'm sorry.

71
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,670
I don't want to do it now.

72
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,440
Why?

73
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,590
We are now qualified to handle cases independently.

74
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,110
If we still follow others

75
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,130
to solve cases,

76
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,790
how much can we get in the end?

77
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,410
It's not that easy.

78
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,840
You don't have any case now.

79
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,590
Who dares to use two newcomers?

80
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,990
It depends on our ability.

81
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,120
I don't believe it.

82
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,480
If others can get cases, why can't we do it?

83
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,630
I don't want to.

84
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,050
Let's talk about it later when you have a case.

85
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,030
I'm leaving.

86
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,470
Everyone knows what she relies on.

87
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,630
Stop it.

88
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,270
Can we compete with her?

89
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,380
She has a big weapon. What do you have?

90
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,460
A big weapon? What is it?

91
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,850
You have no idea, right?

92
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,409
They had an affair in the office during the daytime,

93
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:48,640
and were caught by others.

94
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,510
Really?

95
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,390
Yes.

96
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,460
You don't know, right?

97
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,470
That day, our colleague…

98
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,420
Yingzi, your case.

99
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,110
Thank you.

100
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:01,050
Speak of the devil.

101
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,320
We are appointed

102
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,150
all the donkey work.

103
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,550
This is for you by Mr. Han.

104
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,510
Thank you.

105
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,880
There are the cases Mr. Han assigned to you.

106
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,120
Take a look

107
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,950
and write the agency idea as soon as possible.

108
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,040
Okay, don't worry.

109
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,350
Come on, everyone, work is coming.

110
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,480
It makes a turn. Huh.

111
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,580
Where are Tian and the others?

112
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,710
In the archive room.

113
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,780
She and Han have an affair.

114
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,730
If you were a woman, you also could have.

115
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,290
Yes.

116
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,590
There are two other women in our department.

117
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,750
Then we'll never have our day.

118
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,480
Yes.

119
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,070
Let's distribute the cases.

120
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:56,860
Mr. Han asked you

121
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,990
to learn about this case

122
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,650
and write your defense ideas.

123
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:00,790
Qiu,

124
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,160
were cases assigned like this before?

125
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,600
Where are you throwing it?

126
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,200
I didn't throw it. It's you who didn't catch it.

127
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,260
Who are you talking to?

128
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,180
What do you mean, Cheng?

129
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,360
Who are you talking to?

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,720
Do you think you lean on a moneybag?

131
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,350
Who are you talking about?

132
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,590
The one knows it.

133
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,430
Shameless!

134
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,590
How dare you hit me?

135
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,450
Who are you calling shameless?

136
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,510
If you don't say it clearly today,

137
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,230
I won't let you off. Try it?

138
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,190
I'm not talking about you.

139
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:36,590
Enough.

140
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,830
You are shameless!

141
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,950
If you say one more word,

142
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,190
I'll rip your mouth.

143
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:41,350
I'm not talking about you.

144
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,000
How dare you?

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,059
Mrs. Luo. Mrs. Luo.

146
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,740
Cheng

147
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,940
has been here for three years.

148
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,990
He hasn't turned into a certificated lawyer.

149
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,230
He's outraged.

150
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,030
Is there anyone standing in his way?

151
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:54,310
The useless man vented his anger on a woman.

152
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,450
He deserved it.

153
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,110
Qiu, you go first.

154
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,250
Tell you.

155
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,300
Guys.

156
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:04,130
Stop gossiping behind others.

157
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,130
If I hear it again,

158
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,600
be careful on your way home.

159
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
Do you hear me?

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,180
-If she's not a woman, I... -Alright.

161
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,220
No need.

162
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,030
Alright.

163
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,270
Luo Yingzi.

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,640
What?

165
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,360
I have something to discuss with you.

166
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,970
Go ahead.

167
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,850
Mr...

168
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,660
Tian.

169
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,450
Tian.

170
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:14,830
Can you give me a seat?

171
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,180
I have something to talk with Mrs. Luo.

172
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,930
OK. Come on.

173
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,720
Sit down.

174
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,000
-I'm going to get some water. -Thank you.

175
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,270
Xia Shu, well done.

176
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,660
You occupy his seat,

177
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,350
and he has to smile a fawning smile.

178
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:30,470
Xia Shu, can you learn how to behave?

179
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,020
What's wrong with me?

180
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,480
I'm a formal lawyer now.

181
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,500
Let's work together in the future.

182
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,520
What can you do?

183
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,710
Play games with me?

184
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,520
I can bring cases here.

185
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
As long as we become partners,

186
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,920
I won't give anyone else

187
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,390
the cases brought by my father.

188
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,450
Let's handle them.

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,160
As long as they are criminal cases,

190
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,730
especially those to be executed,

191
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,720
I'll handle them.

192
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,870
As for the rest, no matter how much they are worth,

193
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,070
they will be yours, and I'll assist you.

194
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,160
Forget it, Xia Shu.

195
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,960
You should find others.

196
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,620
Fang Lihong. You can ask her directly.

197
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,740
She would love to.

198
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,090
Why would you hire us ineffective troops?

199
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,470
I don't like them.

200
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,750
I only like you in the whole law firm.

201
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,400
Sorry, I can't agree.

202
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,550
I know you want to help me.

203
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,910
I can't accept it.

204
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
I didn't mean that.

205
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,870
Absolutely not.

206
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,330
I think you're amazing.

207
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,450
I admire you.

208
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,590
But I can't accept it.

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,590
You know

210
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,470
my colleagues who fail to be certificated lawyers

211
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,600
are very against me.

212
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,560
If we become partners,

213
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,350
they will curse me in the back.

214
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,360
I have no background.

215
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:47,980
Honey.

216
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,310
I can't stand the pressure.

217
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,650
So...

218
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,510
So I can't consider

219
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,790
the partner proposal.

220
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,510
Got it?

221
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,000
Who has a complaint about you?

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
No, no.

223
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,550
-Who complained? -No, no, no.

224
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,220
Which one?

225
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,680
No.

226
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:05,310
Is it you?

227
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,070
-No. -Do you have a complaint?

228
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,300
No.

229
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,850
Is it you?

230
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,470
No.

231
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,280
Honey, I beg you.

232
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,150
I appreciate your kindness, okay?

233
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,040
How about this?

234
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,410
If you need any help,

235
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,360
just let me know.

236
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,190
It's my duty, okay?

237
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:21,920
Fine.

238
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,000
Think about my proposal.

239
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,150
I'll read the case analysis first.

240
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,220
I'll go then.

241
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,480
I'm leaving.

242
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:44,290
Think about it.

243
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,570
Think about it.

244
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,660
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

245
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,470
No need.

246
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,880
Don't you want to say anything?

247
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,340
Say what?

248
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,270
I don't want to say anything.

249
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,120
Whatever.

250
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,350
But you can't be bullied.

251
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:12,550
Next time, if someone talks nonsense in front of you,

252
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,520
just slap him.

253
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,320
You have the qualifications to do so, but I have not.

254
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,590
Why not?

255
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,540
We are the same.

256
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,180
No.

257
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:25,490
You can find another one after losing this one.

258
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,440
I can only hang myself on this tree.

259
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,510
Don't pity me.

260
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,320
Just go.

261
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,350
Miss Xia,

262
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,470
over the past year,

263
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,890
made many contributions

264
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,370
in business development

265
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,710
to our law firm.

266
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,110
Everyone knows it, right?

267
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:12,850
After the discussion of the Management Committee and the Supervisor Committee

268
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:14,500
and all partners' voting,

269
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,750
Miss Xia

270
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,650
will be our new partner.

271
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,650
Congratulations, Miss Xia.

272
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:23,420
Now let's welcome our new partner's joining.

273
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,300
Miss Xia,

274
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,700
do you have anything to say?

275
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,100
Nothing.

276
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,350
Ms. Fang,

277
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,880
the Internet speed of our firm is too slow.

278
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,190
It's inconvenient for us to work.

279
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,350
Can you speed it up?

280
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,490
Good idea. Yes.

281
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,040
We must speed it up.

282
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,990
Tao Zheng,

283
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,350
you'll be in charge of it.

284
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,950
I'll do it.

285
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,460
Is your dad doing well?

286
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:52,630
Yes.

287
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,070
When he is coming,

288
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,500
I'll treat him to dinner.

289
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,470
The promotion is too fast.

290
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,540
What promotion?

291
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,160
Don't you know that?

292
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,910
Xia Shu was promoted to be a partner.

293
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,330
What?

294
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,950
The law firm is so shameless.

295
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,250
Of course it is.

296
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,770
Her dad got promoted and managed the industrial affairs.

297
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:15,630
Think about it.

298
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,900
She's coming.

299
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:27,770
Mr. Tian, are you busy?

300
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:29,930
Miss Xia.

301
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,880
I'm going to get some water.

302
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,510
Thank you.

303
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,260
Looks like I have to continue to congratulate you.

304
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,020
For what?

305
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:39,640
Didn't you become a partner?

306
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,180
Boring.

307
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:43,900
Luo Yingzi.

308
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,230
I know you don't want to be my partner,

309
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,230
but I have a case here. Do you want it?

310
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,880
Is it from your father?

311
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,710
You shall give it to the firm first.

312
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,430
No.

313
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,400
This is from my classmate.

314
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,410
He studied abroad

315
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,370
and couldn't find a decent job when he came back.

316
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,030
So, he served as a case broker,

317
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,780
who specially introduced cases

318
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,420
and got the commission.

319
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,310
I'm not interested in playing with him. Do you want it?

320
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,710
Yes.

321
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,070
What case?

322
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:10,130
A divorce case.

323
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,210
Divorce case?

324
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,950
Yeah, it must be boring.

325
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,470
Never mind.

326
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,070
If you don't want it, I'll introduce it to the Civil Affairs Department.

327
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,070
No, no, no.

328
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,160
As I think,

329
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,370
it's improper to look down upon tiny cases.

330
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't have the right to be picky right now.

331
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,880
Tell me about the divorce case.

332
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,830
Mr. Yang?

333
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,560
Hello, I'm Luo Yingzi, a lawyer.

334
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,750
Yes, I'm recommended by Miss Xia.

335
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,960
OK.

336
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,420
Yes, I'd like to learn about your case.

337
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,390
Can you introduce it to me?

338
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,470
Okay.

339
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,069
Wei

340
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,750
Tongren.

341
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:10,160
Chairman.

342
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:11,720
General Manager.

343
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,339
No.

344
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,339
I always smile.

345
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,000
Okay, go on.

346
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,859
Okay.

347
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,240
Don't worry.

348
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,180
We know the rules.

349
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,790
If I

350
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,890
take this case,

351
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,230
we can discuss the commission.

352
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,300
We still have Miss Xia.

353
00:17:28,329 --> 00:17:28,970
Okay.

354
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,380
Thank you. Bye.

355
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,010
Chairman.

356
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,490
Then I must win you.

357
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,970
Tongren Road and Bridge Company.

358
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,420
[Brief Introduction of Tongren Road and Bridge Construction Co., Ltd.]

359
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,750
The market value is 1.1 billion.

360
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,890
Are you out of your mind?

361
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,110
Wei Tongren.

362
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,690
Bro, you are so rich.

363
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,870
[Wei Tongren, Chairman of Tongren Road and Bridge Construction Co., Ltd.]

364
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:10,670
What's the use of your divorce?

365
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,560
Xia Shu. Xia Shu.

366
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,770
The case you introduced

367
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,570
involves a large amount of money. Let's take it together.

368
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,900
I'll work with Qiu Hua,

369
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,230
and you take most of the legal fee.

370
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,090
I'm not interested. I won't do it.

371
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,130
Is this okay?

372
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,470
Hold on. I'm testing.

373
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,530
What are you doing?

374
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,200
The firm is so slacking off.

375
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,860
I complained about the slow Internet speed

376
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,200
and asked them to speed it up.

377
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,940
They want to

378
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,310
install one router for my office.

379
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,370
What about others?

380
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,380
Be content.

381
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,110
Are you sure not to take it?

382
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:41,860
Yes.

383
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,210
I didn't study law to solve a divorce case.

384
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,800
This is not an ordinary divorce case.

385
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,860
I checked it.

386
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,170
The client

387
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:52,430
has a company worth billions.

388
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,130
Ten billion is also money.

389
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,020
I won't take it.

390
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,630
Please check the Internet speed.

391
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,560
Okay, let me see.

392
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,090
Do you like playing games?

393
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,670
Okay, I'll give you some sets of game skins later.

394
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,450
Good.

395
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm leaving.

396
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,490
Are you sure you won't take it?

397
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:11,430
I'm leaving.

398
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:11,850
Bye.

399
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,980
What's wrong?

400
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,280
I have something important to tell you.

401
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,420
Close the door first.

402
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,960
That's a big case.

403
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,170
Congratulations, Yingzi.

404
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,890
But it is too valuable,

405
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,180
and I can't do it alone.

406
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,990
Why?

407
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,190
At our age,

408
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,700
when we come out to deal with cases independently,

409
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,230
the clients won't trust us.

410
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:56,230
Qiu Hua.

411
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:57,870
Let's work together.

412
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,390
We can't add our age together.

413
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,900
No.

414
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,450
You have a trustworthy face.

415
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:07,740
Unlike me, I have a short-tempered face.

416
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,790
Nonsense.

417
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,010
I know you want to help me.

418
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,610
I'm not trying to help you.

419
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,960
I'm begging you to help me.

420
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,090
Just like last time.

421
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,160
Fine.

422
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,650
This time, you take the case.

423
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,990
-And our agency fee will be… -50-50.

424
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,510
30-70.

425
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,190
You get 70, and I get 30. Huh?

426
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:28,990
Just kidding.

427
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:29,550
I know.

428
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,420
40-60.

429
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,770
Stop bargaining. Deal.

430
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,200
Ok, thank you, Yingzi.

431
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:35,290
You're too polite.

432
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,240
I'll call the broker right away.

433
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,670
We have to meet him.

434
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,590
By the way,

435
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,310
can you take a leave?

436
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:42,670
Yes.

437
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,050
I'll tell him.

438
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:12,820
Here

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,480
Yang...

440
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,990
Are you Mr. Yang?

441
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,000
Are you

442
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,110
Mrs. Luo?

443
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,450
Yes, I am.

444
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,440
Hello.

445
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,840
This is my partner, Qiu.

446
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,360
Hello.

447
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,660
Okay, then.

448
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,660
Let's talk over there.

449
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,190
OK.

450
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,670
This is Xia Shu's classmate

451
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,710
from abroad.

452
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,050
Yes, he is like that.

453
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,740
A law major doesn't be a lawyer but a broker.

454
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,840
He scared me.

455
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,940
Hello, what would you like to drink?

456
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,360
A cup of coffee, please.

457
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,030
What do you want? Order by yourselves.

458
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:48,520
I...

459
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,400
I want orange juice.

460
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,480
Orange juice.

461
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,770
Mineral water, please.

462
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,900
Okay, wait a moment.

463
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,560
Mr. Yang,

464
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:59,360
thank you for your trust.

465
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,080
Could you

466
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,680
introduce us

467
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,790
the situation of this case?

468
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:05,600
Wait.

469
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,560
I have a question.

470
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,410
Have you

471
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,070
had a lawsuit?

472
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,410
Of course.

473
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,700
This year,

474
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,430
I have dealt with six cases.

475
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,890
And they all won.

476
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,780
The same goes for Qiu.

477
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,840
Xia Shu told me

478
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,530
that you two won

479
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,350
Wang Dafu's case.

480
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm sorry.

481
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,630
I don't suspect you,

482
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,340
but Mr. Wei

483
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:42,310
always asked me to find

484
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,310
a sophisticated lawyer.

485
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:46,830
He thinks a sophisticated lawyer is like

486
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,470
an old doctor.

487
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,500
Experience is important.

488
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,310
Of course,

489
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,620
the case is crucial

490
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,080
to him.

491
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,510
It's a matter of life and death.

492
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,230
So,

493
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,000
he can't take it lightly.

494
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:00,550
Mr. Yang.

495
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,440
Mr. Yang,

496
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,790
don't worry.

497
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,060
A lawyer

498
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,740
treats all cases equally.

499
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,540
Actually, today, we're here

500
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,030
as vanguards.

501
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,950
We still have our mentor,

502
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,220
who will handle the case with us.

503
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,830
Right?

504
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:20,310
Our mentor

505
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,510
is a domestic authority,

506
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:24,220
and has never lost a lawsuit.

507
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,850
How about this?

508
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,840
Ask your mentor out

509
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,470
and have a talk with Mr. Wei.

510
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:33,870
You see.

511
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,550
I'm just a broker.

512
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,870
Well...

513
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,470
about the final candidate and the way of choosing,

514
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:38,730
it's

515
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,770
up to Mr. Wei.

516
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,910
Yes.

517
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,150
I understand, Mr. Yang.

518
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,390
How about this, Mr. Yang?

519
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,190
Now that our mentor sented us out,

520
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,190
it's awkward for us to go back empty-handed.

521
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:51,700
Please introduce this case

522
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,980
to us.

523
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:56,070
We'll report to our mentor later.

524
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,790
After that,

525
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,850
we won't talk vaguely and generally,

526
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,470
but be more targeted.

527
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,610
Then we can get straight to the point.

528
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,720
OK.

529
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:09,100
This is all the information about Mr. Wei's case.

530
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,030
Take it back and read it carefully.

531
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,180
This case is significant.

532
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,130
If we fail,

533
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,070
Mr. Wei will lose all the fruits

534
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,110
made in most of his life.

535
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,720
Look forward to seeing your mentor soon.

536
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,280
Okay, let's meet again.

537
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:27,800
Okay.

538
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,030
Goodbye, Mr. Yang.

539
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:29,390
Okay.

540
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,100
Bye.

541
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,500
How could you say that? Do we have a mentor?

542
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,950
We'll see.

543
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,010
Let's talk about it later.

544
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,170
It's pretty close.

545
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,470
I want to say something serious.

546
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,070
From tomorrow,

547
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,990
we

548
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,990
should wear shabby clothes,

549
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,810
and show a gloomy expression.

550
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,080
Being envied

551
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:16,070
may get us killed.

552
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,500
Yingzi, I really envy you.

553
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:20,690
For what?

554
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,440
You can live

555
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,740
so happily at any time.

556
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,750
You need to live no matter cry

557
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,550
or smile.

558
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,910
Why don't you live with a smile?

559
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,510
Qiu Hua,

560
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
you are too serious.

561
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:32,980
Coming.

562
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,520
Have you decided what to eat for lunch?

563
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,550
Let's eat at the convenience store.

564
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,630
Let me tell you.

565
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:47,030
A Japanese restaurant just opened. It is 50% off.

566
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,090
I heard that the chef came from Japan.

567
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,680
Sushi, my treat.

568
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,050
I don't want you to spend money.

569
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,280
Where are you going?

570
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,270
Get to work.

571
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,420
Xia Shu.

572
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,960
I told you so many times.

573
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,430
I don't want to go. Why must I go?

574
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:08,260
What do your parents have to do with me?

575
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:10,570
I'm hanging up.

576
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,260
What's going on?

577
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,370
Boyfriend?

578
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,980
Isn't he annoying?

579
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,710
He asked me to go home to visit his parents.

580
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,030
His parents' home is in the countryside.

581
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,630
How can I live there?

582
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,470
Besides,

583
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,970
I have nothing to do with his parents.

584
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,150
Why must we meet?

585
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,270
Don't you know the relationship

586
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,970
between you and his parents?

587
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,200
I've never met them.

588
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,900
What relationship do we have?

589
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:35,310
No.

590
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:37,320
Don't you want to get married in the future?

591
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,030
After marriage, they will be your parents-in-law.

592
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,710
If you agree to marry,

593
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,080
you have to meet them.

594
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,170
Miss Xia looks down on us villagers.

595
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,710
No, how is that possible?

596
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,960
The thought of meeting his parents

597
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,440
makes me a headache.

598
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,840
But

599
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:56,540
a wife has to meet her parents-in-law sooner or later.

600
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,670
If you don't,

601
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,360
as Qiu said,

602
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,310
your boyfriend

603
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,110
will think you look down on them.

604
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,080
Why is it so tiring?

605
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,620
I'll go, okay?

606
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,810
Where are you?

607
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,130
Downstairs?

608
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,310
Okay, I'll go downstairs.

609
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:24,140
He's been calling downstairs.

610
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,000
I'll find him.

611
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:26,710
Xia Shu.

612
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,940
We're here for the case.

613
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,460
We met Mr. Yang

614
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,470
and intended to take this case.

615
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,500
Take it, then.

616
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,850
Yes, we will.

617
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,360
But you introduced this case.

618
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,490
It's all thanks to you.

619
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,690
So the commission...

620
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,200
Don't tell me that.

621
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm not a broker.

622
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,080
Don't say that.

623
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,920
The money you earn is all yours.

624
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,570
It has nothing to do with me.

625
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm leaving.

626
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:49,660
Xia Shu.

627
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,640
You

628
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,890
don't need this office for the time being, right?

629
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:55,120
Can we discuss the case

630
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,470
here?

631
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,050
Help yourselves.

632
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,540
Okay, thank you.

633
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,070
Bye.

634
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,600
Why does she find

635
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,820
such a boyfriend?

636
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,590
I met her boyfriend once.

637
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,270
I heard that this boy

638
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
was Xia Shu's father's secretary.

639
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,470
And then

640
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,670
he won Xia Shu's heart.

641
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,510
In my opinion,

642
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,170
he has thought it through.

643
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,960
He is not after Xia Shu,

644
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,030
but her father.

645
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,810
No wonder

646
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,500
he acts like an office attendant in front of her.

647
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:31,670
Anyway,

648
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,370
he is young and handsome.

649
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,480
Which one do you want?

650
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,610
That one.

651
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,780
Let's analyze it.

652
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:49,580
Mr. Han.

653
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,160
Why haven't you brought the case analysis I asked for?

654
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,400
I'm busy right now.

655
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,350
What are you busy with?

656
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,660
I'm busy, too.

657
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
Bring it to me now.

658
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,080
Okay.

659
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,850
I heard him. Go ahead.

660
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,350
I'll be back soon.

661
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,470
I'll deal with it.

662
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,890
I'll wait for you here.

663
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:09,380
Okay.

664
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:25,870
Mr. Han.

665
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:27,670
I'm sorry.

666
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:29,130
I've been busy these days.

667
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,030
Mr. Han, I need to tell you.

668
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,150
Luo Yingzi's divorce case

669
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,400
is about to trial.

670
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:39,270
I have to discuss the case with her these days.

671
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,400
I may have to go to visit Ms. Fang often.

672
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,670
What do you mean?

673
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,610
You are climbing up the big shot upstairs

674
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,040
and looking down upon me, right?

675
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
No.

676
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:50,070
Her own case

677
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:51,820
takes up our department's work time.

678
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,550
How are we going to settle this?

679
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:55,190
Well,

680
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,040
how about you discuss it with Ms. Fang?

681
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,500
I'll go back to work.

682
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,790
How ungrateful.

683
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:08,950
You've become ungrateful

684
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:11,100
after turning into a certificated lawyer, haven't you?

685
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:11,990
I have so many…

686
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,420
Qiu Hua,

687
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,290
an inspiration hits me again.

688
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:31,820
I'm hesitating.

689
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,840
If we want Mr. Wei

690
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:35,960
to hire us,

691
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,550
then we have to make him

692
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,500
a complete defence idea

693
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,200
to show our strength.

694
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,120
What if

695
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,610
he doesn't hire us?

696
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,610
It's all in vain.

697
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,890
And if he takes it to others,

698
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,390
we can't make money.

699
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,830
I don't think that will happen.

700
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:54,920
Anyway, we just do what we should do.

701
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,930
Leave the rest to fate.

702
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,770
How did Wei

703
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,810
become a chairman?

704
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,410
He is in a mess now.

705
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,920
If he can behave himself in his private life,

706
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,450
he wouldn't have done that.

707
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,000
I'm almost done.

708
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:15,960
One last bite.

709
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,300
Hurry up.

710
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,160
Wei Tongren

711
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,120
started a business with the original wife

712
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,170
and established the Tongren Road and Bridge Company.

713
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,830
Men become bad when they are rich.

714
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,330
Wei Tongren found a mistress,

715
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,520
who is his current wife, Qiao Lianfeng.

716
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,380
Qiao Lianfeng lied to him that she was pregnant

717
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,990
and forced him to divorce his wife.

718
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,580
Then, Qiao Lianfeng went from being his mistress to his wife.

719
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,470
After Qiao Lianfeng married Wei Tongren,

720
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,130
she put Wei Rongren under strict control,

721
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:45,840
and let others

722
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,680
follow him around the clock.

723
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,510
Wei Tongren couldn't stand it.

724
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,240
Then, he had another mistress.

725
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,240
Their adultery was caught by Qiao Lianfeng.

726
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,000
At the same time,

727
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,690
Qiao Lianfeng got the evidence that Wei Tongren had evaded taxes

728
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,210
and bribed officials.

729
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,250
She threatened Wei Tongren

730
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,160
and forced him to sign the equity transfer agreement

731
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,730
and transferred all the shares of the company

732
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,410
to her.

733
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,860
Wei Tongren thought

734
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,590
he could feel a sense of relief.

735
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,390
But Qiao Lianfeng changed her mind immediately after getting the agreement.

736
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,820
She swept Wei Tongren out

737
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,320
and took his company.

738
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,690
To keep Wei Tongren's property,

739
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,100
we have to make the equity transfer agreement invalid.

740
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,990
But in this contract law,

741
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,740
there are only a few cases in which a contract is void and voidable.

742
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,670
We can say

743
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:30,550
Wei Tongren was threatened.

744
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,070
There was a threat to his personal safety.

745
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:35,080
The agreement is not what he meant.

746
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,590
Then, the contract might be invalid.

747
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,070
Can the judge believe it?

748
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,430
Wei Tongren is a strong man

749
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:41,430
while Qiao Lianfeng is a weak woman.

750
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,700
Mr. Wei's behaviours make me speechless.

751
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,660
What should we do?

752
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,470
If we want to protect his business,

753
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,270
we only have one method.

754
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:55,710
Qiu Hua, how about making a comprehensive statement?

755
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,610
For example,

756
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,970
before Wei Tongren

757
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,730
married Qiao Lianfeng,

758
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,420
he had set up a family business

759
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,350
and had a great personal property,

760
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:03,950
right?

761
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,010
Then we can sort out

762
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:08,430
the evidence that Qiao Lianfeng

763
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,210
threatened him and his family for a long time.

764
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:12,290
Wei Tongren was forced to sign the equity transfer agreement

765
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,490
after being threatened for a long time. What do you think?

766
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,430
Let's follow the idea and try it.

767
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,230
Wipe all these.

768
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,660
Why are you still staying here?

769
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,630
It's almost ten o'clock.

770
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,640
I've been waiting to lock the door.

771
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:31,710
I'm sorry.

772
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,930
Why don't you leave first?

773
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,260
We can lock the door

774
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,490
when we leave.

775
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,830
I'll leave first.

776
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,720
Thank you.

777
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,260
♫They said people only come into the world once♫

778
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,440
♫They said there's no boundary between good and bad♫

779
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,920
♫The only constant is change♫

780
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:21,659
♫They said everyone will die♫

781
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:25,929
♫Why ask for the truth?♫

782
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:30,540
♫There is not only ever in forever♫

783
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,510
♫Learn to say goodbye for the sake of honor♫

784
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,850
♫Look forward to tomorrow♫

785
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,250
♫Embrace the hole in your heart♫

786
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,889
♫Be passionate♫

787
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:53,440
♫Look, they're still here♫

788
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,670
♫Do you dare to love♫

789
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,780
♫Let go and start over♫

790
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,450
♫Yesterday's tears have dried up♫

791
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,000
♫There's an answer♫

792
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,540
♫When I'm halfway through my life♫

793
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:14,870
♫Turn around, and those obstacles♫

794
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:19,370
♫Become laughing matters, dear me♫

795
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:27,700
♫Like pendulum, only seeing the future♫

796
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:31,910
Let's do it.

797
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,320
As long as we can get enough evidence,

798
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,750
we can win.

799
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,670
But can we get enough evidence?

800
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,540
Didn't Mr. Yang say that

801
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:44,760
Mr. Wei has all the messages

802
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,450
sent by Qiao Lianfeng?

803
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,470
And those text messages

804
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,400
are full of criticism and threats.

805
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:53,020
Whose phone is ringing?

806
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,510
Is it yours?

807
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,020
Here.

808
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,100
Mr. Yang.

809
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,030
Mr. Yang.

810
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,170
Yes.

811
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,080
We're thinking about meeting with Mr. Wei.

812
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,120
We already have

813
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,000
the initial agenda to defend him.

814
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,170
We want to discuss this with Mr. Wei.

815
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,250
Sure.

816
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,240
When?

817
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,630
Okay.

818
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,470
Okay.

819
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:31,940
Okay.

820
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,310
Well,

821
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,650
thank you, Mr. Yang.

822
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,430
Let's meet and talk.

823
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,200
At 12 noon tomorrow,

824
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,550
East Red Hotel.

825
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,240
Lucky Hall.

826
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,400
Mr. Wei is superstitious.

827
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,990
Yingzi,

828
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,180
who can we ask for help tomorrow?

829
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,710
Mentor.

830
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,120
We can ask Fang Lihong for help.

831
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,390
She can handle the situation.

832
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,840
Have you forgotten that she had flown abroad

833
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,310
for the case of Binhai Group?

834
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,670
Besides, she is aloof.

835
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,550
She won't treat someone to dinner

836
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,480
just because of a case.

837
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,080
I don't think she'll do this.

838
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,520
We need to find someone that can handle the situation

839
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,810
and is glib-tongued.

840
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,810
It's better to find someone that won't take this case halfway.

841
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,520
You want me

842
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,430
to take you two into this case?

843
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,800
No, no.

844
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,190
You are so busy.

845
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,830
We don't need your help for such a small case.

846
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,810
We want to ask

847
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,400
whether you have time

848
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,770
at noon tomorrow.

849
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,720
Tomorrow noon,

850
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,690
please join us

851
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,400
for lunch with the client.

852
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,520
If he can sign the contract,

853
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,090
we'll report to you then.

854
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,240
Unfortunately,

855
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,680
I have an appointment with my client tomorrow noon.

856
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,720
Why don't you

857
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,320
ask others for help?

858
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,030
Okay.

859
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:02,730
Okay.

860
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:04,320
Sorry.

861
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,760
I have something to do at home tomorrow.

862
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:08,260
I'm not available.

863
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,340
Please ask others for help.

864
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,130
I have no choice.

865
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,540
Ms. Shan, the client is here.

866
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,760
Hello, Ms. Shan.

867
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,880
Hello.

868
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:20,780
Sorry, I can't help you.

869
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,210
I have a lot to do in the office.

870
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,020
Go ahead, please.

871
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:24,620
Come on.

872
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,720
Please.

873
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,200
What the hell!

874
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:31,990
I knew it.

875
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,190
It's an arduous and thankless task.

876
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,320
No one wants to do it.

877
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,190
I don't believe we can't find help.

878
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,270
You're experienced.

879
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,990
Please help us out.

880
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,070
Now,

881
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:44,310
I'm not qualified to be a lawyer.

882
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,520
If I present myself as a lawyer,

883
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,640
I am cheating your client.

884
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,690
I'm not going.

885
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,380
Ms. Mei,

886
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,560
without a mentor,

887
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:55,910
we wouldn't be able to take this case.

888
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,040
Luo Yingzi,

889
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,990
are you confident about this case?

890
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:02,680
Ms. Mei,

891
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,250
we've made a complete agenda.

892
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,350
This is the only way to win.

893
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,780
We are fully confident.

894
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:14,200
Then, show your strength

895
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,030
to the client,

896
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
move him

897
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,920
and get the case.

898
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,450
But...

899
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,910
Forget it.

900
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,350
Ms. Mei, we're leaving.

901
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,410
Let's find another way.

902
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,470
Yingzi,

903
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:34,820
wait a minute.

904
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,930
Zhang Shilan

905
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,500
always falls asleep in class.

906
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,490
And now,

907
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
she often hangs out with people in society.

908
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,830
Do you know?

909
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,500
No.

910
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,540
Who was she with?

911
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
She's often picked up in a limousine.

912
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,470
What's more,

913
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,490
she had a lot of jewellery on her.

914
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,800
You are the one who introduced her here.

915
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,400
I have to tell you about that.

916
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,530
I know. I'll talk to her.

917
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,450
Yingzi.

918
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,540
I'll let you guys talk.

919
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,590
Goodbye, Ms. Mei.

920
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,730
Yingzi, it's you.

921
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,280
I saw your car downstairs when I was going out.

922
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:19,270
How are you doing here?

923
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,750
Not bad.

924
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,370
Yingzi,

925
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,250
do not talk too much with that old witch. She's mean.

926
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,090
Lanlan, mind your words.

927
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,070
Ms. Mei is a very respected teacher

928
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,750
in the legal profession.

929
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,990
Then why is she teaching here?

930
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,410
You have no idea

931
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,900
that she always scolds me.

932
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,030
You are the one that should be scolded.

933
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,860
You want to study law.

934
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,160
She is your teacher.

935
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Qiu Hua,

936
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,090
I need to talk to her.

937
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,670
Have a seat.

938
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:10,970
What's wrong?

939
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:17,050
Have you been in touch with Mr. Zhou recently?

940
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,840
How did you know?

941
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:23,490
Did he tell you about that?

942
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,370
No.

943
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,800
Why are you

944
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,060
so shy?

945
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,510
We're together.

946
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,470
Together?

947
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,170
What do you mean?

948
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,460
What did you do?

949
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:42,530
I plan to

950
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,210
give him a baby.

951
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,430
Lanlan,

952
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:49,520
Mr. Zhou has a family.

953
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,700
I know.

954
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:53,810
So I have to do it step by step.

955
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,320
Step by step?

956
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,970
What are you talking about?

957
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,530
I'll give him a baby first.

958
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,030
He can't let his child be illegitimate.

959
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,910
Then, I'll ask him to divorce his wife.

960
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,530
Lanlan, you are ruining his family.

961
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,460
Do you know that?

962
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:10,440
What are you talking about?

963
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,090
We are true love.

964
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,400
What is true love?

965
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
Who is Mr. Zhou?

966
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,500
He is a sophisticated man,

967
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,400
who makes Internet loans in Jingbei.

968
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,910
How could he be trapped by a little girl?

969
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,340
Even if you have his baby,

970
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,000
what if he refuses to divorce?

971
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,490
Are you raising the child on your own?

972
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,480
Don't worry, Yingzi.

973
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:33,790
Since I can give birth to his child,

974
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:35,750
I can let him divorce his wife for me.

975
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:37,110
If he refuses to divorce,

976
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,170
I won't let him off.

977
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:40,810
Lanlan, you are too naive.

978
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,440
You are a moth to a flame, you know?

979
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:44,570
It's too dangerous.

980
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,000
Sure,

981
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:47,790
Mr. Zhou is a married man.

982
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,220
He is a scoundrel to do so.

983
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,070
But Lanlan, listen to me,

984
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,050
leave him now.
