[The Fearless Season 1]

3
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,720
[Episode 21]

4
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,310
Our plaintiff

5
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,410
couldn't tolerate

6
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,050
the constant threat of violence from the defendant.

7
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,270
-He had no choice -What did he say? What violence?

8
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,670
but to go hide

9
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:40,789
in the hotel room.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,030
Yet, our defendant

11
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:44,630
still went after him to scold and hit him.

12
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,700
Therefore...

13
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,150
We can imagine

14
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,700
the circumstances

15
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,470
under which our plaintiff

16
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,630
was forced to

17
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,440
sign this agreement!

18
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,530
Just like you said,

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,860
"imagine." You can only imagine it.

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,330
Because you still can't prove

21
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,670
that the plaintiff was forced to sign it.

22
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,150
Go on.

23
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,120
Evidence from No. 22 to No. 37

24
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,340
are notarized chat records.

25
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:09,150
Of course,

26
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,669
some of the content

27
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,410
is indeed indecent.

28
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:14,670
I'm a bit embarrassed to

29
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,170
read them in court.

30
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,840
Don't read those that are indelicate.

31
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,170
We also have a copy here.

32
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:22,990
Okay.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,500
I'll choose a few to read.

34
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,430
-On March 12, 2015, -Why didn't you tell us about it? He didn't come to me.

35
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,590
at 21:03 p.m.,

36
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,070
"Wei Tongren.

37
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,230
You old bastard!"

38
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,590
"Where are you and your little..."

39
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,880
I omitted one word here.

40
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,110
"Hiding!"

41
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,280
"You'd better hide well,

42
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,829
and make sure I can't find you."

43
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:45,870
"Or

44
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll cut you open."

45
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,460
On April 21, 2015,

46
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,870
at 2:32 a.m.,

47
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,240
the text content was

48
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,060
that "You can run away, but not your home."

49
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,829
"I can always find your mother."

50
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:00,710
"Go home tomorrow and check

51
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,670
if your mom is still alive."

52
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,870
On July 9, 2015,

53
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,280
at 1:52 a.m.,

54
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,630
"I think you don't want to live anymore."

55
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,800
"I'll give you ten days."

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,480
"If you don't sign it,

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,550
I'll send the letter to the Commission of Discipline Inspection right away."

58
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,230
"By then,

59
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,990
wait for the police to come to you."

60
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:16,400
Next.

61
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,070
On August 22, 2015...

62
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,140
I'd like to interrupt here, Your Honor.

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,170
From that text,

64
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,150
the messages provided by the plaintiff

65
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,750
were sent after the agreement had been signed.

66
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:26,960
We believe that those messages

67
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,020
are meaningless in proving the case.

68
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,770
Okay.

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,870
Don't read the rest.

70
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,829
The defendant, do you have any objections to the texts he read?

71
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,390
Yes.

72
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,210
Qiao Lianfeng.

73
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,470
You mentioned that you wanted to send a letter
to the Commission for Discipline Inspection.

74
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,360
What letter do you want to write
to the Commission for Discipline Inspection?

75
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,290
I want to report.

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,829
I want to report Wei Tongren's corrupt behavior

77
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,230
of having a mistress!

78
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,560
The defendant, watch your behavior.

79
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,150
-Calm down. Sit down. -Sit down. Calm down.

80
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,829
Qiao Lianfeng,

81
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,890
can you tell us why you want to report

82
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,510
on Wei Tongren's corrupt lifestyle
to the Commission for Discipline Inspection?

83
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,370
Because I don't know whom to go to.

84
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,710
I called the police.

85
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,390
But the police said that dealing with

86
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,440
marriage problems is not their job.

87
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,470
Who should I go to?

88
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,420
You tell me.

89
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,030
Okay.

90
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,290
Who should I go to? Who!

91
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,590
Alright.

92
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,800
Your Honor,

93
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,680
our client admitted

94
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,589
that she did send rude messages to Mr. Wei.

95
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:23,910
That's because

96
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,160
of Wei Tongren's immoral activities,

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,710
especially his affair.

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,170
And he simply didn't go home when my client found out about it.

99
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,860
My client couldn't find him.

100
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,640
Desperate, she sent those messages!

101
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,100
In fact,

102
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,310
these are just the insulting remarks of a couple

103
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,950
in the heat of the moment.

104
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,270
It can't prove that my client

105
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,600
coerced and threatened

106
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,350
the other party's safety.

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,900
Just like Wei Tongren's mother mentioned in the message.

108
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,310
In fact, Wei Tongren's mother

109
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,970
is still alive and doing well.

110
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,470
This is not good.

111
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,210
Qiao Lianfeng.

112
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,710
What's your height?

113
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,390
1.65 meters.

114
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,470
What about your weight?

115
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,350
45 kg.

116
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,440
The plaintiff,

117
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,230
how tall are you?

118
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,160
1.86 meters.

119
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,230
Weight?

120
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:14,990
86 kg.

121
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,790
86 kg.

122
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,790
45 kg.

123
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,230
The plaintiff's weight

124
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,470
is nearly twice that of the defendant.

125
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,030
Now, the plaintiff claims

126
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,150
that the defendant

127
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,630
used coercion and violence

128
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,430
to get him to sign this equity transfer agreement.

129
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:36,480
Let's not think with our professional legal knowledge.

130
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,030
Let's just speculate using common sense.

131
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,500
Is that possible?

132
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:46,820
Your Honor.

133
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,150
Judging from the evidence we just presented,

134
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,770
before this agreement was signed,

135
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,830
it's clear that the defendant and the plaintiff

136
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:57,070
had issues in their marriage.

137
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,110
But the defendant

138
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,990
tried to work things out with the plaintiff,

139
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,430
while the plaintiff was preoccupied with cheating.

140
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,650
Therefore, he didn't have time for his business,

141
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,160
which caused significant issues with the company's operations.

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,390
In order to prevent the company from going bankrupt,

143
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,670
the couple had to let go of their conflicts

144
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,350
-and solve the problem together. -What should we do?

145
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,290
The trial might be over by the morning.

146
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,980
Which means

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,670
that he believed in my client's ability.

148
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:25,090
That's why he willingly signed

149
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,970
the equity transfer agreement.

150
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:40,930
Your phone.

151
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,290
Order in the court!

152
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,530
[Chen Shuo]

153
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,920
It's from my son.

154
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,880
Your Honor. It must be urgent since my son called.

155
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,810
I have to take it.

156
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,550
Hello?

157
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,350
I'm here.

158
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm in court now. Go ahead.

159
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,870
Why did you get beaten up again?

160
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,710
Counselor for the plaintiff,

161
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,370
I repeat, this is a court,

162
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,710
not a place where you can answer your phone.

163
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,310
I'm sorry. Please continue.

164
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,200
I can't hear you!

165
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,230
Why is he answering his phone in court?

166
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,470
Is he chatting?

167
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,200
What's wrong with you?

168
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,930
How can you always get beaten up by the same group?

169
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,830
Why do they always bully you?

170
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,110
You should go to the teacher for help.

171
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,470
I'm not with you.

172
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,240
It's useless to call me now.

173
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,710
Can you hear me?

174
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,470
Hello? Hello?

175
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,020
My signal is fine.

176
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,680
-It’s your signal. -Silence!

177
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

178
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,350
The plaintiff's counselor is still talking on the phone,

179
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,790
ignoring your order.

180
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,670
Isn't he in contempt of court?

181
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:34,470
Bailiff!

182
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,400
Take him out!

183
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,590
Mr. Xue, please leave.

184
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,470
I can walk on my own. I know.

185
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,150
Son,

186
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,020
I can't help you now!

187
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,730
You have to solve it on your own!

188
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,670
Oh no.

189
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,240
You have to solve the problem yourself!

190
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
This is bad.

191
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,490
I repeat the court's discipline.

192
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,590
No one shall interfere

193
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,909
with the trial like him again.

194
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:58,830
The plaintiff

195
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,270
and the defendant,

196
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,150
do you hear me?

197
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,120
Of course.

198
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:04,350
We have always abode by the court's discipline.

199
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,030
Mr. Chen,

200
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
is everything still under control?

201
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:07,940
Yes.

202
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:09,390
Unlike someone else...

203
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,200
I'm sorry.

204
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,270
We won't do it again.

205
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,270
We won't do it again.

206
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,660
Will we lose

207
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,550
before this morning's trial finishes?

208
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,410
The defendant,

209
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,210
do you have any other evidence?

210
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:19,940
Yes.

211
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,060
One last item.

212
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,870
Tian.

213
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,780
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

214
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry, the defendant's counselor.

215
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,100
I'd like to remind you.

216
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,630
Go ahead.

217
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,760
Your Honor, you have repeatedly

218
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,910
requested our compliance with court protocols.

219
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,970
But what was dropped from your bag,

220
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,570
the defendant's counselor?

221
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,810
Is that a recording device?

222
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,510
Your Honor.

223
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,940
This is a headset.

224
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,710
Are you sure there's no recording device in your bag?

225
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,370
No.

226
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,350
No, absolutely not.

227
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,050
Your Honor, I suggest that the bailiff check his bag

228
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,470
to see if there are any recording devices.

229
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,720
The court prohibits

230
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,530
bringing recording equipment into the courtroom.

231
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:12,860
Your Honor, this is really just a headset.

232
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,600
It can't record anything.

233
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,510
Your Honor, I suggest we let the bailiff

234
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:18,490
check whether this device can record!

235
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,200
Alright.

236
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,400
Attorneys of both parties,

237
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,200
could you be more professional?

238
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,650
Adjourned!

239
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,710
I'll hear it

240
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,470
at 1:30 p.m. this afternoon.

241
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,440
Everything is under control.

242
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,300
Bailiff,

243
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,460
pick up his headset and check it.

244
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,110
This is really just a headset.

245
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,200
Sir, you know it.

246
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,750
I didn't bring any recording equipment.

247
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,820
I can't bring a recorder to court.

248
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,380
You're really something, Unscrupulous Chen.

249
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,790
If I lose the case because of you,

250
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,700
I won't let you off.

251
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,950
Mrs. Qiao,

252
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,150
it's still too early to say that.

253
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,710
I want to ask you.

254
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,310
Why didn't you show us

255
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:07,270
the messages the plaintiff

256
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,910
submitted in court today?

257
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
I asked Mr. Tian to warn you.

258
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,030
You can't hide anything from your lawyers.

259
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,760
Otherwise, you'll face the consequences alone.

260
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,230
He used a stalling tactic

261
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,900
to delay the trial until the afternoon.

262
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,020
But if all he has is the evidence showing in the morning,

263
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,350
it's hard to convince the judge

264
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,590
that the plaintiff was forced to sign the agreement.

265
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,470
He must have figured out a way.

266
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:36,230
Wait for the show tomorrow.

267
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,510
Don't even blink,

268
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,990
so you won't miss any wonderful moments.

269
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,470
Mr. Chen,

270
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,670
you're so bad.

271
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,830
Are you stalling?

272
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,110
How come?

273
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,230
Lianfeng.

274
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,340
We're still a couple, right?

275
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,830
How about

276
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,690
you let me go home?

277
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,760
Get lost.

278
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,750
-The defendant. -What?

279
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,860
-Don't talk to the plaintiff. -Get lost?

280
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,470
Get lost!

281
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,930
You're living in my house.

282
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,830
You want to take my asset from me

283
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,350
and go live with your gigolo?

284
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,090
-Listen! You wish! -What gigolo?

285
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:20,850
What gigolo?

286
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,710
Say that again! Gigolo?

287
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,480
Everyone knows that.

288
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,390
The man, your driver!

289
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,590
Isn't he your gigolo?

290
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,750
You had two abortions for him!

291
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Everyone knows that.

292
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,030
Don't do that!

293
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,110
Nonsense!

294
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,550
Stop!

295
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,290
Don't hit him!

296
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,710
I'll kill you!

297
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,710
I'll kill you!

298
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,730
Say that again!

299
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:51,270
Stop!

300
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,760
Are you crazy...

301
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,750
Mrs. Qiao!

302
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,430
Mrs. Qiao! Stop!

303
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,310
Your Honor!

304
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,510
The plaintiff and defendant are fighting over there.

305
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,240
Then call security.

306
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,570
They are from your case.

307
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,110
The plaintiff and defendant in your court.

308
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,630
My court?

309
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,590
Yes, hurry up and go have a look.

310
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,990
The trial isn't over yet. What's going on?

311
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,630
Stop beating him!

312
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,560
Mrs. Qiao!

313
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:18,630
Stop! You can't hit him here!

314
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,600
What are you doing?

315
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,510
Stop hitting him!

316
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,110
Mrs. Qiao!

317
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:24,830
Stop!

318
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,300
Stop! Stop!

319
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
Stop!

320
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,930
She not only threatened me

321
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,030
but also beat me up.

322
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,220
She even threatened

323
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,190
that she would beat my mother up.

324
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,620
The defendant

325
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,870
burst into the room

326
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,230
with five musclar men.

327
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,350
She rushed to my mother's house

328
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,110
and beat me up in front of my mother.

329
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,590
My mother has a heart condition.

330
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,350
My mother was so scared,

331
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,470
lying on the floor.

332
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,200
They went to the house at 8:10 a.m.,

333
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,590
but they came out

334
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,750
at 10:30 p.m..

335
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,470
She said

336
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,070
that she would beat me again

337
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:07,830
if I didn't sign the agreement.

338
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,110
Our No. 41 evidence

339
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:11,850
can prove it.

340
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,350
And this equity transfer agreement

341
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,870
was signed on that day.

342
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,870
Are you still a human?

343
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,430
-You’re worse than a beast. -Shameless!

344
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,230
You just made that up!

345
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,590
How shameless you are!

346
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,790
Don't. Stop talking.

347
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:23,990
All rise.

348
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,830
The court rules that,

349
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,400
according to Article 54 of the Contract Law

350
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,740
and other relevant legal provisions,

351
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,830
the equity transfer agreement in question

352
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:41,070
wasn't signed voluntarily

353
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,830
and shall be revoked in accordance with the law.

354
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,230
This court is adjourned.

355
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:45,930
Court adjourned!

356
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,390
Your Honor.

357
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,900
You're so unfair!

358
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,640
How did you lose?

359
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,700
I gave you so much money.

360
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,470
Mr. Chen!

361
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,710
I'm asking you.

362
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,220
I gave you so much money.

363
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,920
Give me back my money!

364
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,430
Mr. Han.

365
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,480
Mr. Han.

366
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,750
I really didn’t expect that.

367
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,230
Don't take it to heart.

368
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,690
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

369
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,080
That Chen Shuo

370
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,920
is just a hooligan.

371
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,080
Right, Mr. Han.

372
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:22,990
Don’t let him off easily.

373
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:24,070
You must appeal

374
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,600
and fight him until the end.

375
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,790
Don't be so mad.

376
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,110
Han.

377
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,950
Are you leaving just like that?

378
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,610
You took 500,000 yuan from me.

379
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,670
You gave me back that 500,000.

380
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,270
Mrs. Qiao, you can't slander us like that.

381
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,160
Mr. Han represented you for free.

382
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,830
Free?

383
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,350
He said that he represented me for free?

384
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,230
He would do a pro bono case? Don't listen to him!

385
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,160
Stop right there!

386
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,120
Stop! Give me back my 500,000!

387
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,220
Give me back my 500,000!

388
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:47,830
Lost.

389
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,310
Han is so shameless.

390
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,640
He deserves it.

391
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,400
It's worth it.

392
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,240
Unscrupulous Chen.

393
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:05,770
You're leaving?

394
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,650
Don't you know that I helped you?

395
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,590
Yes.

396
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,590
If it weren't for you,

397
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,470
the judge would have left through the side door.

398
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:12,230
But it's okay.

399
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,490
Even if the judge left,

400
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,510
I could still take the fight

401
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:17,290
from inside to outside for him.

402
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:19,370
Mrs. Luo.

403
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,100
Thank you so much

404
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,080
for introducing Mr. Chen to me.

405
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,610
It's my pleasure, Mr. Wei.

406
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,250
In this case,

407
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,830
our interests are conflicted.

408
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,250
But there won't be in your next case.

409
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,180
How about you give us the next case?

410
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,310
You haven't finished your pleasantries,

411
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,590
and you're poaching my client.

412
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,830
How am I poaching your client?

413
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,480
Mr. Wei's cases were ours.

414
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,360
Right, Mr. Wei?

415
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:38,930
Yes.

416
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,110
Well, you're right.

417
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,110
I really wanted you to represent me,

418
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:43,750
but I have no choice.

419
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,580
What's wrong?

420
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,810
Did he kidnap you?

421
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,270
Kind of.

422
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,470
I don't think Mr. Chen

423
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,990
is as kind as you two.

424
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,470
We have already

425
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:53,310
signed the representation contracts

426
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,170
for both cases.

427
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,230
Good for you.

428
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,760
Qiu Hua, did you see that?

429
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,310
One should be afraid of sophisticated hooligans.

430
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,240
Is your car here?

431
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,340
Yes, at the door.

432
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,930
I'll be the gentleman and walk you out.

433
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,510
-Let’s go. -Okay.

434
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,810
-Bye. -Mr. Wei, please wait for me.

435
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:05,290
Bye.

436
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,470
Mrs. Luo, please wait a moment.

437
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,360
Mrs. Qiu wants you to come to the meeting room when you arrive.

438
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,980
There's a guest waiting for you.

439
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,910
Okay, thank you.

440
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:28,990
Guo Yu.

441
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,200
Mrs. Luo.

442
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,020
What's wrong?

443
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,350
Guo Yu didn't want to accept

444
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,980
the terms of the Weida Group.

445
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,250
She still wants to sue him for sexual harassment.

446
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,170
Guo Yu had already decided

447
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,630
to accept it.

448
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,470
But when she went to the company to collect compensation,

449
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,800
she was insulted by Yang Weida once again.

450
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,430
Guo Yu.

451
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,420
Can you tell me what happened?

452
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,369
I thought that since the law

453
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,910
couldn't do anything about him anyway,

454
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,050
I could only suck it up,

455
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,599
and took the money and left.

456
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,599
I could find another job.

457
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,520
When I went to the company to collect the money,

458
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,400
I didn't want to see him.

459
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,109
But he sent someone to ask me to his office

460
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,250
and said a lot of insulting words.

461
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,050
He...

462
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,710
What did he say?

463
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,570
If you want to tell us...

464
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,060
Don't worry. We're all your lawyers.

465
00:17:58,550 --> 00:17:59,250
He said...

466
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,790
He said that this money

467
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,610
was the money to keep me for the whole year

468
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,910
and that even a feet-washing girl at Jingbei Feet SPA

469
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,830
was more expensive than me.

470
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,710
There's something worse than this.

471
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,460
In the end...

472
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,640
In the end, he molested her.

473
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:30,910
He said that he couldn't just let her leave with the money

474
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,900
without getting anything back.

475
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,070
Judging from the last quarter,

476
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,880
the number of cases has increased compared to the previous season.

477
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,110
But the income

478
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,320
has dropped by two percent.

479
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,430
This has something to do with some lawyers

480
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,230
taking cases for kicks at the expense of the firm.

481
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,290
Tao Zheng, who are you talking about?

482
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:00,420
I just pointed out the matter.

483
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,150
You're talking about the case of Tongren Road and Bridge, right?

484
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,100
A law firm shouldn't only see the money,

485
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,270
but also take on its social responsibility.

486
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,030
I took this case

487
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:15,580
to protect women's rights.

488
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,580
Did you protect their rights?

489
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,050
Have you never lost a case?

490
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,600
Alright.

491
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,670
Social responsibility is important,

492
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,850
and so is our income.

493
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,990
If the law firm were broke,

494
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,720
how could we fulfill our social responsibility?

495
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,070
Hello.

496
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,940
Mrs. Fang.

497
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,730
Qiu Hua and I are at the door of the meeting room,

498
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,030
and we want to discuss something with you.

499
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm in a meeting. Let's talk after the meeting.

500
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,240
No.

501
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,460
This is very important.

502
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,530
Can you come out?

503
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,360
Excuse me.

504
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:53,870
Tao Zheng.

505
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,720
Go on.

506
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,630
Besides,

507
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,020
the departments we have set up

508
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,000
are designed to bring together professional expertise

509
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,150
and encourage collaboration

510
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,970
among lawyers in different fields.

511
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,590
Mrs. Fang.

512
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,000
What is it?

513
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,150
We have a case that we'd like

514
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,510
to discuss at the partners' meeting.

515
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,410
Which case?

516
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,850
Guo Yu's sexual harassment case.

517
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,490
Hasn't it been solved yet?

518
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,760
She came back today.

519
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:21,190
She was insulted by Yang Weida again.

520
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:23,850
She insists on suing him for sexual harassment.

521
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,410
Come in with me.

522
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,530
I'll give you five minutes

523
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,730
to explain this case.

524
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,310
Partners,

525
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,950
we have a case

526
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,070
that we want your opinions on.

527
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,310
This client is a college graduate

528
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,990
from the countryside.

529
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,680
She was subjected to long-term sexual harassment

530
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,550
by Yang Weida, the boss of Weida Group.

531
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,710
She approached us a while ago.

532
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,160
Then with the analysis and assistance of Mr. Tao Zheng,

533
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,890
who personally convinced her,

534
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,950
she agreed to

535
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,350
drop the lawsuit against Yang Weida

536
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:10,380
for sexual harassment and instead

537
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,420
opted for labor arbitration with Weida Group.

538
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,310
But when she came back to claim compensation,

539
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,360
she was verbally insulted

540
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,650
by Yang Weida again,

541
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:24,510
who also made another attempt

542
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,980
to sexually harass her.

543
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,290
So our client decided to forgo financial compensation

544
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,660
and instead sued him for sexual harassment.

545
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,200
Partners,

546
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,430
we admit

547
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,710
that there is very little evidence

548
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,800
regarding this case.

549
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,510
Even if we bring the case to court,

550
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,030
the chances of winning are slim.

551
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,190
And once we go to court,

552
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:53,750
it may become the focus of public opinion.

553
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,590
Inevitably,

554
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:58,170
it will also affect the firm.

555
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,680
So, we think it's necessary

556
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,120
to report to you

557
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,110
during the partner meeting.

558
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,300
Okay.

559
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,520
We understand the situation.

560
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,410
You can go back first.

561
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,410
We'll discuss it.

562
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,430
Okay.

563
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,140
They're still young.

564
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,270
We were young once.

565
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,550
Everyone,

566
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,950
what do you think about this case?

567
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,770
Why aren't you saying anything?

568
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,830
We are discussing it.

569
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,140
What's there to discuss?

570
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,080
As lawyers,

571
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,910
it's our duty to uphold the law and ensure justice.

572
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,310
Shouldn't we support

573
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,460
and protect her rights

574
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,790
after seeing her being bullied like that?

575
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:08,820
I know the details of this case.

576
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,610
Coming to this point

577
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,990
means that the boss

578
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:15,340
has really gone too far.

579
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,070
I support them.

580
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,450
After all, we all

581
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:21,940
had the courage to fight for justice

582
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,940
when we first entered the business.

583
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,500
Can we

584
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:30,000
win this case?

585
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,680
Haven't you heard?

586
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,790
The client doesn't care about winning or losing.

587
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,050
She just wants an explanation.

588
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,460
It's just a small case.

589
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,140
Fine. Let's take it.

590
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,140
Young people.

591
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,790
Give them a chance to fight.

592
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,650
They have this drive.

593
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,610
Come in.

594
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,230
Mrs. Fang.

595
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,950
Sit.

596
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,550
Most partners

597
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,850
support you in taking this case.

598
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,600
Thank you.

599
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,910
But I still disagree.

600
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,200
Why?

601
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,920
Luo Yingzi, I was once young.

602
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,640
I once

603
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,470
fought for justice and truth

604
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:18,810
despite everything.

605
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,470
But when I grew up,

606
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:22,650
I realized

607
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,280
that sometimes this kind of passion for justice

608
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,360
will only ruin things.

609
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,540
What is maturity?

610
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,190
Being mature is not about

611
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,790
doing things regardless of the consequences and costs,

612
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,030
but about doing the most suitable things.

613
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,670
For this matter,

614
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,390
what you need to do

615
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,000
is make the best choice for your client,

616
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,550
rather than solely focusing on

617
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,430
your personal sense of justice.

618
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:56,170
This is the basic professional ethics for lawyers.

619
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,990
The first professional ethic of a lawyer

620
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,880
is to respect the wishes of the client.

621
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,870
No.

622
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,430
It's to protect the interests of the clients.

623
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,470
In this case,

624
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,260
the client has no money

625
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,450
or financial backing.

626
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,850
Isn't it much better

627
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,810
to get enough financial compensation

628
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,470
rather than a case that everyone loses?

629
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,270
But Mrs. Fang,

630
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,460
do you know what's the worst

631
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,730
for her in the end?

632
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,230
After receiving the financial compensation,

633
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,360
she would always look down on herself.

634
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,760
That's what your customers should be saying.

635
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,150
All choices

636
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,070
should be made by the clients.

637
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:35,990
Yes.

638
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,390
She chose to sue him for sexual harassment.

639
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,230
Luo Yingzi.

640
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:40,950
She's angry right now.

641
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,930
Do you know what she would think once she calms down?

642
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,870
Because of the lawsuit, she loses her every penny,

643
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,230
her job,

644
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:50,270
and has no place to stay.

645
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,750
She would only go back to her hometown.

646
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,390
What would happen when she got back?

647
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:57,660
The rumors about sexual harassment are all over her hometown.

648
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,710
Can she stay there?

649
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,110
Can she find another job?

650
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,910
Do you know

651
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,260
if she would regret it by then, Luo Yingzi?

652
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:08,560
Qiu Hua?

653
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,630
As long as Guo Yu doesn't back down,

654
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,490
I'll insist on representing her.

655
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,520
I'm in the middle of something. I’ll call you later.

656
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,050
Mrs. Fang, Mrs. Mei is here.

657
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,320
What is she doing here?

658
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,920
Isn't she here for the equity bonus agreement?

659
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,120
I forgot about that. Wait.

660
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,530
Mrs. Mei.

661
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,850
Mrs. Mei.

662
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,510
Mrs. Mei.

663
00:26:56,570 --> 00:26:57,190
Lihong.

664
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,440
Why are you here alone?

665
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,420
Just give me a call.

666
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,550
I'll send the firm's car to pick you up.

667
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,060
I'm just a former lawyer who was fired from the firm.

668
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,990
Is it necessary?

669
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,680
I'm just going to sign an agreement.

670
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,020
Please come to my office.

671
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,860
I'll ask the financial staff to send it to you later.

672
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,930
No. No.

673
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:12,950
I still have some...

674
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,150
It's been a long time.

675
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,730
I was going to visit you.

676
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,870
But I'm busy.

677
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,370
Come to my office since you're here.

678
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,230
Let's go.

679
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,020
Mrs. Mei, please come in.

680
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:34,150
Mrs. Mei, why are you here?

681
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,250
Hello, Mrs. Mei.

682
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,520
Why are you here?

683
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,260
They are so excellent.

684
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,170
We were discussing a case.

685
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:43,120
It's a sexual harassment case.

686
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:45,060
Sexual harassment case?

687
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,570
Yes.

688
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,170
A case that has almost no chance of winning

689
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,430
and may even cause the client

690
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,130
to pay a heavy price.

691
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,980
Then, why do we do it?

692
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:58,910
Our client insists.

693
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,970
Because she has nowhere to go forced by the other party.

694
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,400
I personally disapprove of them taking this case.

695
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,390
It's not just because we won't make any money from it,

696
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,950
but also for the client.

697
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,240
I think,

698
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,030
getting the economic compensation

699
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,360
through labor arbitration is the best option

700
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,890
for the client.

701
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,360
You're discussing a case.

702
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,680
I should stay out of it.

703
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,460
The finance staff is waiting for me.

704
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,550
No, Mrs. Mei.

705
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,620
You are the founder of the firm.

706
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,480
All the partners know that you are here.

707
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,280
So, we want to treat you to lunch.

708
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,600
I really have something to do.

709
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Next time.

710
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:34,910
OK.

711
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,390
Yingzi, are you free?

712
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,080
I have something to tell you.

713
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,210
Okay.

714
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,950
Okay, bye.

715
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,370
Mrs. Fang, I'll go to her first.

716
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,090
Let me sign the agreement first.

717
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,870
Then, let's find a place.

718
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,900
I want to hear

719
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,450
about that case.

720
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:55,920
Okay.

721
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,950
Mrs. Mei, I'll go get my bag.

722
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:02,800
This case.

723
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,830
We hesitated

724
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,360
when the client approached us.

725
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,280
Later, we also went through a lot.

726
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,650
But we took the case in the end.

727
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,900
And we want to sue the man

728
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,270
for sexual harassment.

729
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,300
It's mainly because Yang Weida

730
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:19,340
is too arrogant.

731
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:22,370
He really pushes us and our client

732
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:23,860
to this point.

733
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,130
I think if I didn't take this case,

734
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,270
I might

735
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,080
look down on myself.

736
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,750
It's up to you

737
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,320
whether you take it or not.

738
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,480
I just want

739
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,850
to remind you.

740
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:42,950
Go ahead.

741
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,300
The clients are often

742
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,790
the most unreliable partners for a lawyer.

743
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,520
Mr. Han

744
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,080
said

745
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,770
something similar.

746
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,280
Han Zhitong.

747
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,120
What else did he say?

748
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,040
He said it when I first came to the law firm.

749
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,860
He said that as a lawyer

750
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,540
the first one you should be wary of

751
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,860
is your client.

752
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,930
The second one to be wary of

753
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,860
is the attorney representing the other party.

754
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,140
The third is...

755
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:16,840
the judge.

756
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,210
Han Zhitong.

757
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,590
He has many problems.

758
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,230
But what he said

759
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,630
is true.

760
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,360
Especially the first one.

761
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:30,670
Your client

762
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,080
has never met you.

763
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,630
He comes to you when he is in trouble.

764
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,960
You negotiate the fees,

765
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,800
sign the contract,

766
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,910
and become partners.

767
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:42,450
Why would he trust you?

768
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,740
You become partners because of interests.

769
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,430
If

770
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,640
he can gain more benefits,

771
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:51,620
why doesn't he betray you?

772
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,390
If his problem is solved,

773
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,780
he needs to stop his losses as soon as possible.

774
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,580
The first thing he will deal with

775
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,440
is also you.

776
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,350
The client

777
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,380
doesn't expect his lawyers to solve the problem.

778
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:08,040
He just uses a lawyer to intimidate the other party.

779
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,500
You agree to be his lawyer,

780
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,030
actively negotiate with the other party,

781
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,470
and represent him in court.

782
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,750
However, he

783
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,790
uses you to threaten the other party

784
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,720
to make a deal with them in private.

785
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:23,330
Once he achieves his goal,

786
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,480
he will immediately abandon his lawyer.

787
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,840
Some of them will terminate the contract.

788
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,520
That's the best-case scenario.

789
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,920
The worst

790
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,360
is that he will blame everything

791
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,550
on the lawyer.

792
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,940
In my case,

793
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:43,870
my clients suddenly changed their story

794
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,940
and accused my husband and me

795
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,250
of teaching them

796
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
to commit perjury

797
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,120
and alter their testimony.

798
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:01,200
In the end, they received a lenient sentence.

799
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,120
But we...

800
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,040
We

801
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,630
ended up like this.

802
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,960
My dad once told me

803
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,080
that no matter what happens in the future,

804
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,720
you have to have faith in humanity.

805
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:28,840
Yingzi.

806
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,280
Big hope

807
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,980
is born

808
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,570
in the darkest of darkness.

809
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,360
You can try to have no faith

810
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,450
in humanity.

811
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:47,910
And then,

812
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,770
you will often find that

813
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,150
humans

814
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,890
are quite cute animals.

815
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,410
I support you in taking this case.

816
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,390
I'll go

817
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,220
talk to Fang Lihong.

818
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,590
Come in.

819
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,710
Come, Yingzi.

820
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,610
So,

821
00:33:29,490 --> 00:33:31,150
you're still going to take it?

822
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,390
Yes.

823
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,200
Without evidence,

824
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,370
how are you going to win this case?

825
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,820
We have the messages and the texts

826
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,030
on Guo Yu's phone on WeChat.

827
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,050
Some of the implications are already clear.

828
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:47,640
I saw them.

829
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,270
Sexual harassment.

830
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,060
Although the sentence to it is light,

831
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:53,350
this is

832
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,600
quite a serious accusation

833
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:56,730
against a person.

834
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:01,190
Besides, these messages and texts from WeChat

835
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,360
are not enough for the judge

836
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,920
to rule against the defendant.

837
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,790
Even if

838
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:10,250
he knows it might be true.

839
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,659
What should we do?

840
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,530
If you can find more people

841
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,949
who were harassed by him

842
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,719
to sue him together,

843
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,850
there is hope

844
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,230
to win this case.

845
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,060
Thank you, Mrs. Fang.

846
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:31,489
Go.

847
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,400
Luo Yingzi,

848
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,040
Qiu Hua.

849
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,699
I want to join your case.

850
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:47,290
There is not even a case.

851
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,600
I want to do it with you.

852
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,760
You don't know.

853
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,330
I was the first one to support you

854
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,580
at the partner meeting.

855
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:54,429
I did it just for Guo Yu.

856
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,200
I want to fight against that pervert until the end.

857
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,440
Don't you only take criminal cases?

858
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,470
No matter what the case is,

859
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:01,730
I want to do it with you.

860
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,050
I want to fight for justice and fairness!

861
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:05,470
Well... here's the thing.

862
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,350
We were in the middle of

863
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:08,510
work, and you...

864
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,440
Why don't you wait for us

865
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,790
to finish this?

866
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,300
-Okay. -Give us ten minutes.

867
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,900
Qiu Hua, I think what you were saying...

868
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,920
is just... that...

869
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,110
Should we agree to let her join us?

870
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:20,600
No.

871
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:23,030
Actually, I don't want to either.

872
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,000
But I've been running around for cases lately.

873
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,060
I can't even afford

874
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,100
the parking fee.

875
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,090
Then ride a shared bike with me.

876
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,000
Sis,

877
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,670
can I

878
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,310
ride a bicycle in this dress?

879
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,790
I still ride one wearing a dress.

880
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,390
Right.

881
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,940
It's windy down there.

882
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,600
I heard that she bought a new car recently.

883
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,040
Let's enjoy it.

884
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,270
Let her be our driver.

885
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,760
We won't let her talk.

886
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,620
Okay?

887
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:50,180
It's decided then.

888
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:51,480
Xia Shu.

889
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,950
You drive.

890
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,240
Okay.

891
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:56,070
But I have to tell you something.

892
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,210
Here are the rules.

893
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,510
You have to behave yourself.

894
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,500
Don't talk or move while you're over there.

895
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:00,940
Okay.

896
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:08,150
I really don't know whom else he harassed.

897
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,960
After I became his secretary, my female colleagues in the company

898
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,450
all looked at me weirdly.

899
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,960
At first, I didn't know why,

900
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,460
but later I realized it.

901
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,610
But I don't know

902
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,300
whether they were harassed.

903
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:24,820
I can't ask them that either.

904
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:27,190
Think about it.

905
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,180
We have all the time. We'll think of someone.

906
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,910
Four more Americanos.

907
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,390
No, thanks, I don't want one.

908
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,190
I don't like it.

909
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:35,980
What would you like?

910
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,180
Bubble tea, juice,

911
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:38,090
or milk?

912
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:40,080
Just sit there.

913
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,510
Don't worry about that.

914
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,660
I don't want anything. Thank you.

915
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:45,550
Guo Yu.

916
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,160
Do you know

917
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,020
who was the secretary before you?

918
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,280
Can you remember that?

919
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,060
The last one...

920
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,150
Wang Aiping.

921
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:58,770
I remember now.

922
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,320
She should have the same experience as me.

923
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,790
She was also a student from the village

924
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,470
sponsored by the Weida Fund.

925
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:08,110
After graduating, she worked

926
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,630
as Yang Weida's secretary at the Weida Group.

927
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,510
Later,

928
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,910
she suddenly quit

929
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,720
and went back to her hometown.

930
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,850
She is from Juning, Shandong.

931
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,050
She went back to Shandong.

932
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,990
She was also a sponsored student

933
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,960
who gave up a job in Jingbei

934
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,250
and went back home.

935
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:35,160
Madam, your coffee.

936
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,990
Thank you.

937
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:42,950
Well, this small city is built quite well.

938
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:45,950
It's good,

939
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:47,680
but

940
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,960
young people still prefer to work in big cities

941
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,790
rather than stay here.

942
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,630
Look. People who stay here

943
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,880
are either elderly people

944
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,680
or those who are about to retire.

945
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,410
It's really well-built.

946
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,010
It's a great place to retire.

947
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,530
It's horrible.

948
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,470
What?

949
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,470
My boyfriend

950
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,790
wants me to work in grassroots with him.

951
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,850
If I really came to such a small city,

952
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,000
the only thing I could do would be dancing in the square

953
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,680
with the grandmas.

954
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:18,750
There's no future for me at all.

955
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,590
Imagine Xia Shu square dancing.

956
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,630
Doesn't your boyfriend work in the state organs?

957
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,030
Why would he come to work at the grassroots?

958
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,860
He thinks that Jingbei is too big,

959
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,250
and he won't be able to show up there and get promoted.

960
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,600
He wants to be a leader

961
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,870
in a small place.

962
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,820
He said,

963
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,810
"Rather be a chicken head than a phoenix tail."

964
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,410
Are you going to

965
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,130
come with him as a couple?

966
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,320
No way.

967
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:48,960
I don't even know whether I'll get married or not.

968
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,440
Besides, following him to a small county,

969
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,550
people treat me like the boss's wife every day.

970
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,330
It freaks me out just thinking about it.

971
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,950
Xia Shu, listen to me.

972
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,990
You're not cut out for small-town life.

973
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:03,710
If your boyfriend really comes to work in a small city,

974
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,310
you'd rather break up with him than go with him.

975
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,470
Rather tear down ten temples than ruin a marriage.

976
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,500
You're not the one getting married, right?

977
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,630
Do you think Xia Shu understands this?

978
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:15,070
We have to tell her.

979
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,870
We're older than she is, aren't we?

980
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,400
Right?

981
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,180
Yingzi, I'll listen to you.

982
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,380
You must listen to me.

983
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:21,990
Is it her?

984
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,630
It looks like her.

985
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,530
I'll come out soon.

986
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,000
Okay.

987
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:42,730
Hello, are you Wang Aiping?

988
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:43,630
Yes.

989
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,450
You're here.

990
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:44,870
Hello.

991
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:46,410
Guo Yu told me over the phone

992
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,760
that you came to Juning for something.

993
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,930
Do you need my help? Just tell me.

994
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,820
Have a seat.

995
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,730
Please, have a seat.

996
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,020
What would you like to drink?

997
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,550
No, I'll just drink water.

998
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,770
Hello, what would you like to drink?

999
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,580
Just water.

1000
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,200
Thank you.

1001
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:02,250
Have some cake and fruit.

1002
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:03,540
Thank you.

1003
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,400
That's your husband and your child?

1004
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,690
My child is almost three years old.

1005
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,490
He's so mischievous at this age.

1006
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:16,390
He's so cute.

1007
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,970
Are you planning to live here forever?

1008
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:21,950
Because Guo Yu told me

1009
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,880
that you all worked at Weida Group.

1010
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,550
It's a good job,

1011
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,100
and then you quit.

1012
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,670
My husband works here,

1013
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,220
and my child is in kindergarten here.

1014
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,170
So, I came back.

1015
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,350
It's a good and convenient place.

1016
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,150
It's convenient for me to take care of my parents.

1017
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,110
Are there no other reasons?

1018
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,000
Miss Wang, here's the thing.

1019
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:46,420
After you resigned,

1020
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,990
Guo Yu became his secretary.

1021
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:51,530
But when she was his secretary,

1022
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,570
she was sexually harassed by Yang Weida.

1023
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,490
So, she decided to sue Yang Weida now.

1024
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,760
We don't think

1025
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:59,910
she is the only one.

1026
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:03,150
So, we want to ask you.

1027
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,760
When you were his secretary...

1028
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,370
What do you mean?

1029
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,260
Nothing.

1030
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,670
We just want to ask

1031
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,800
-if you were... -No.

1032
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:15,210
Nothing happened.

1033
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,670
Guo Yu...

1034
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,300
She didn't tell me on the phone

1035
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,230
that it was about this.

1036
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,200
When I was working as Mr. Yang's secretary,

1037
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,680
he showed me a lot of respect.

1038
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,160
Nothing like that happened.

1039
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,520
Then why did you resign?

1040
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,740
Didn't I tell you?

1041
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,990
My husband and child both live here.

1042
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,200
Well,

1043
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,250
my husband and child are waiting for me outside.

1044
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,760
I'm sorry. I have to go.

1045
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,670
Miss Wang,

1046
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,070
think about the girls

1047
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,670
who are like you.

1048
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,110
Because no one dares to testify against him,

1049
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,730
he is so bold

1050
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,990
that keeps doing evil.

1051
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:52,310
Are you willing to endure it for the rest of your life?

1052
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,570
Enough. Stop talking.

1053
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,990
Also, don't come to me again.

1054
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:55,820
If you come to me again,

1055
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,160
I'll sue you for harassment.

1056
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:57,560
You...

1057
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,160
Xia Shu.

1058
00:41:58,670 --> 00:41:59,310
Xia Shu.

1059
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,260
Sit back. You were too loud.

1060
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,320
I didn't mean it.

1061
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,000
Why is she like this?

1062
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,040
She has no self-consciousness at all.

1063
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,640
She must have been harassed.

1064
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:10,960
Look how excited she is.

1065
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:11,450
Look.

1066
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,050
We should have thought of this before we came here.

1067
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,900
She has a family with a child,

1068
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,390
and she lives in a small city

1069
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,290
where everyone knows each other.

1070
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:26,690
The smaller the place is,

1071
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,160
the more sensitive they are about this kind of matter.

1072
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,830
Even if this happened,

1073
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,850
her husband and her in-laws wouldn't know about it.

1074
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,000
What's in it for her if she tells us?

1075
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,830
If this thing gets out,

1076
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,590
how can she still live here?

1077
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,110
Do you expect her to sacrifice her life

1078
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,150
to cooperate with us for the lawsuit?

1079
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,610
But it's not her fault that she was harassed.

1080
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,440
Why did she feel so guilty?

1081
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,070
Waiter, check, please.

1082
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,150
We... Hurry up.

1083
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:54,910
Don't waste the food. Let's eat.
