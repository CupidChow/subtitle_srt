[The Fearless Season 1]

00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,780
[Episode 12]

4
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:14,960
Lanlan,

5
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,270
since you call me sister,

6
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,800
I want to remind you

7
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,150
as your older sister.

8
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,820
If you choose to live in this city,

9
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,900
you need to learn

10
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,500
the lifestyle of the locals.

11
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:34,160
This city is an unfamiliar society to you.

12
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,170
People keep a certain

13
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,900
distance and boundaries.

14
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,560
Let me take you and Mr. Zhou as an example.

15
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,450
You are not that close.

16
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,670
There's no special relationship between you two.

17
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,030
Under the circumstances,

18
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,030
you asked him

19
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,090
to arrange a job for your brother.

20
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,970
I just want to know

21
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,740
how will you repay

22
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:59,070
such a big favor?

23
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,080
I know a few people in this city.

24
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,100
If I didn't ask him for help,

25
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,630
I would never be able to find a job for my brother.

26
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,430
That means

27
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,370
you haven't made a foothold here.

28
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:16,010
You can't even protect yourself now,

29
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,950
but you've already thought about helping others.

30
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,210
So you'll get yourself in trouble later.

31
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,300
As the saying goes,

32
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,100
if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

33
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,390
I've been quite busy with work lately.

34
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,640
I have a lot of materials to prepare

35
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,360
for the interview of practicing lawyers.

36
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,460
So I hope

37
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,820
in the next few days,

38
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,140
don't disturb me at night.

39
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,130
Yingzi, you don't want me to study the law, do you?

40
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,990
Why do you think so?

41
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,980
You can read every book at home.

42
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,800
I can hardly understand them,

43
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
but you don't want me to disturb you.

44
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,070
You want to study the law,

45
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,310
I didn't stop you, did I?

46
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,840
But I have to prepare for the transfer.

47
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:16,430
I need to prepare a lot of materials.

48
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,959
I'm super busy with my work.

49
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,430
I also need my own space.

50
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,350
This is what I just told you.

51
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:27,690
People who live in cities should keep a certain distance from each other.

52
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,070
I hope we can

53
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,680
have our own space.

54
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,360
Most importantly,

55
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,030
I don't think I can

56
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,630
cultivate a lawyer,

57
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,180
you know?

58
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,730
I really don't have that ability.

59
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,990
Mr. Qin.

60
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,160
Hi, Mr. Xue.

61
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,120
Hi, Mr. Xue.

62
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,660
Mrs. Qin.

63
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,790
Have a seat, please.

64
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,610
You are dining, aren't you?

65
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,780
Have you had lunch?

66
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,060
No, it's too hot to eat.

67
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,710
My wife said

68
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
I should find you.

69
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,560
She wondered why there was no news of you and Mr. Chen

70
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,670
since you left.

71
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,590
Although we didn't contact you,

72
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,270
we haven't had a moment to spare.

73
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,970
We were over-fatigued.

74
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:49,909
Look.

75
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,510
Look at my shoes.

76
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,930
My shoes are worn.

77
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:53,760
Right?

78
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,360
It's true.

79
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,590
What have you been busy with?

80
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,060
I assisted the police in solving the case.

81
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,150
You know,

82
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,880
the police are so busy now.

83
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,740
Your sister's case is a cold one.

84
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,160
How can there be so many police to investigate it?

85
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,820
Chen Shuo and I are the only ones working on that.

86
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,520
Thankfully, it's worth it.

87
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,820
And we've almost found the culprit.

88
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,990
You found the culprit?

89
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,680
Oh no, I shouldn't have told you.

90
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,360
I'm too old to hide the truth.

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,390
Before the police solve the case,

92
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,070
no one can be sure about the result.

93
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,830
But I can assure you that

94
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,380
we are getting closer to the truth.

95
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,350
But

96
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,680
something happened

97
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,590
now.

98
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,350
At this critical moment,

99
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
Chen Shuo quit.

100
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,470
She's terrible at the basics.

101
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:46,840
Can she understand the knowledge?

102
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,920
Mrs. Mei, I've told her

103
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:51,220
what she should know.

104
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,640
But she just wants to learn the law.

105
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,730
I think it's not bad to love studying now.

106
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,240
Right?

107
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,810
Skill is no burden.

108
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:02,230
What if she can learn something?

109
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,060
Fine.

110
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,270
Human effort is the decisive factor.

111
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,350
It's up to her.

112
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,850
Okay.

113
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,190
Thank you, Mrs. Mei.

114
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,950
I will also supervise her.

115
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,000
Please take care of Lanlan.

116
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,350
It's a great amount of money for one year.

117
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,350
Can you afford it?

118
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,310
My parents knew about what happened to me.

119
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,050
They constantly gave me money.

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,890
I'm almost 30 years old.

121
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,920
I'm still living off my parents.

122
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:31,550
Fine.

123
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,100
You're not suffering.

124
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,780
Work hard.

125
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,840
Mr. Chen is not a fool.

126
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,380
Based on the agreement we signed last time,

127
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,840
even if the case is solved,

128
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,750
we can't get our commission.

129
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,590
Mr. Chen

130
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,750
is so particular about life.

131
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,520
He wouldn't like to do this.

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,980
He can't work for nothing.

133
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:01,630
Didn't we agree on this last time?

134
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,470
Yes.

135
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,830
But you both knew what was going on that day.

136
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:05,670
He agreed

137
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,520
only because I encouraged him.

138
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,270
In the end, you probably  signed the agreement

139
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,830
out of anger.

140
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,740
When I recalled it peacefully,

141
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,600
I think it shouldn't have been like that.

142
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,460
But don't doubt

143
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,630
Mr. Chen's ability

144
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,110
after hearing what I said.

145
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,390
All the clues were found by him.

146
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,980
I think

147
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,590
we should

148
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,110
motivate Chen Shuo.

149
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,710
I guarantee that

150
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:33,559
if Chen Shuo continues to

151
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,440
investigate the case,

152
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,380
it'll probably be solved.

153
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,220
I have a suggestion.

154
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,030
Go ahead.

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,789
Since we have finished

156
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:44,900
the previous agreement,

157
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,230
let's sign another one.

158
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,590
If this case is solved,

159
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,230
we will

160
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,390
require civil compensation

161
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:55,170
from the murderer's family.

162
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,430
No, no, no.

163
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,620
So you mean

164
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,290
the 20,000 we paid doesn't count?

165
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:04,630
Mr. Qin,

166
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,990
how can you call it in vain?

167
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,530
We've been searching for clues.

168
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,240
We didn't delay

169
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,220
all these tasks.

170
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,280
Let's sign a new agreement.

171
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,230
If this case is not solved,

172
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,690
or the other party can't afford civil compensation,

173
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,270
let's put the contract aside.

174
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,150
As for Mr. Chen,

175
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,890
I'll comfort and convince him. Don't worry.

176
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,780
But if

177
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,930
this case is solved,

178
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,630
and we can get civil compensation for you,

179
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,520
then you should pay

180
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,230
30% to our law firm.

181
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,190
Thirty percent?

182
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,590
No way.

183
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,760
This is an official price.

184
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,380
Stop eating.

185
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,480
It's so hot.

186
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,250
Get Mr. Xue some water. Hurry.

187
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm a little thirsty.

188
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,680
I'll go and talk to her.

189
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,240
How about agreeing with him?

190
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:57,670
No way.

191
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,700
Do you know how much it will be?

192
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,390
If he doesn't give the clues to the police,

193
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,610
this case will never be solved.

194
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,590
If it can't be solved,

195
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,720
we won't get a penny.

196
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,090
Look at him.

197
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,750
His shoes are worn out because of us.

198
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,750
You know nothing!

199
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,080
Mineral water is fine.

200
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,910
I don't like sweet drinks.

201
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,820
Thank you.

202
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,440
Mr. Xue,

203
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,150
30% is too much.

204
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,170
Do you think

205
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,030
15% is acceptable?

206
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:31,910
It's hard.

207
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
To be honest, the ratio

208
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:35,870
is what I can get

209
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,490
for you from Chen Shuo.

210
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,120
Chen Shuo planed

211
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,070
to take 50%.

212
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:48,450
How about this?

213
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,870
You can

214
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
sleep on it.

215
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,530
I'll go back first.

216
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,070
Let's

217
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,470
keep in contact.

218
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,070
I'm off.

219
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,670
Wait.

220
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,790
Mr. Xue.

221
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
Let's sign it.

222
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:10,950
We'll sign

223
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:12,290
the agreement.

224
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,670
Yes.

225
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,190
Yes.

226
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,270
That's all I know.

227
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,850
Anyway, I've reported

228
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,120
to the two officers.

229
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,510
Don't worry, Rui.

230
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,370
I've told them everything I know.

231
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,150
What do you think?

232
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,610
Am I doing great this time?

233
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,270
I can be considered a model enthusiastic citizen,

234
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,790
right?

235
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,670
Shouldn't I take credit?

236
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,150
Okay.

237
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,750
Oh, one more thing.

238
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,480
Well,

239
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,030
my partner, Xue...

240
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:50,670
Yes.

241
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,530
Most of the clues this time

242
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,890
were found by him.

243
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,410
Shouldn't we give him credit

244
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:57,470
when the case is solved?

245
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,470
Okay.

246
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,310
Okay.

247
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,030
Talk to you later.

248
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,860
That's it.

249
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,150
Officers,

250
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,200
I've told you

251
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,510
what I know.

252
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,270
Is there anything else you want to know?

253
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:14,870
No.

254
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,750
We'll report to Mr. Wang

255
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,160
and check the clues as soon as possible.

256
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:20,150
Thank you.

257
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,470
You're welcome.

258
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:22,630
Thank you.

259
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,260
Thank you.

260
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,910
Bye.

261
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:28,910
Shuo.

262
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,040
So this case is going to be solved?

263
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,430
Is it Wu Hang?

264
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,890
It should be him.

265
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,910
Back then,

266
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,950
he hid the fact that he hurt his hand.

267
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:41,190
It wasn't decisive evidence,

268
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,350
but he deliberately hid it,

269
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,350
it meant he felt guilty.

270
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,150
That's right.

271
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,520
Wang Rui must have found a breakthrough.

272
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,550
So he sent two officers

273
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,190
to get more information here.

274
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,270
Look.

275
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,220
What did I say?

276
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,610
I knew it was him from the very beginning.

277
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,670
I can really do something great.

278
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,510
You did?

279
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,400
There's one more thing.

280
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,150
The Qin family and I

281
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,680
re-signed a contract.

282
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,620
It's not an easy task

283
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,020
to get the 30% of their civil compensation.

284
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,270
You have no idea.

285
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,760
It's tiring

286
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,150
to deal with this couple.

287
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,380
It's extremely exhausting.

288
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,980
You are always complaining.

289
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,510
Why don't we

290
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:17,930
stop the previous 2-8

291
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,960
or 3-7 ways of sharing the commission.

292
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,550
How about

293
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,780
taking fifty-fifty?

294
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,860
Xue,

295
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,160
you're the only one whom I admire.

296
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,670
If I can't find Wu Hang,

297
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,050
what's the use of signing a new agreement?

298
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,110
Yes, you're right.

299
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,630
Fifty-fifty is fine.

300
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,270
Anyway, in front of justice,

301
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,670
I don't think it's a loss to make less money.

302
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,190
So generous.

303
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,530
I bet

304
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,710
there's only one place for the transfer this year.

305
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,410
That's too little. Maybe two?

306
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:00,990
That's impossible.

307
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,750
Just one.

308
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:02,150
What's the bet?

309
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,350
Let's bet on milk tea.

310
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,120
At most,

311
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,230
only one can pass.

312
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,050
Definitely.

313
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,960
How long has the meeting begun?

314
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,620
40 minutes.

315
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,130
40 minutes? That's quite long.

316
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,590
It's like this every year.

317
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,390
So strict.

318
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:19,330
Have you got

319
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,220
the materials for this interview ready?

320
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,880
Not yet. I'm still preparing.

321
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,150
Our firm has increased the requirements this year.

322
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,020
Everyone needs to

323
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,660
take part in five cases

324
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:29,680
and earn 50,000 yuan for our firm.

325
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,740
You don't need to worry. But what about us?

326
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,140
Han takes turns using us.

327
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,140
Not to mention the five cases,

328
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,710
making a profit is impossible.

329
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,590
The requirement is so funny.

330
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,060
Intern lawyers

331
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,760
are not qualified to investigate independently.

332
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,160
Right.

333
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,950
How do they measure five cases?

334
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,930
Working under a director like Han

335
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,040
is impossible to earn 50,000 yuan.

336
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,100
That's funny. They're making things difficult for us.

337
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,480
That's right.

338
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:52,720
Do you think they are so willing

339
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,200
to let intern lawyers switch to practicing lawyers easily?

340
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,400
It's not that simple.

341
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,870
Once they become practicing lawyers,

342
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:01,030
their standard of social insurance, housing fund, and basic salary must be raised.

343
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,100
They won't be as obedient as they were.

344
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,390
But will the profit they make

345
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,270
be higher than the one during their internship period?

346
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:08,200
I don't think so.

347
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,670
Even so,

348
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,790
it concerns

349
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,830
the future of every young lawyer.

350
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,960
I think the future of experienced lawyers is more important.

351
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,020
According to my personal experience,

352
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,930
no practicing young lawyers

353
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,930
work better than intern lawyers.

354
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,320
Those are ungrateful.

355
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,130
They will think they've grown up after being practicing lawyers.

356
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,940
If they don't run their law firm, that means they have a conscience.

357
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,650
Han,

358
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,380
no one became a practicing lawyer in your team last year.

359
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,540
You're so cruel.

360
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
What do you mean?

361
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,670
If we prevent

362
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,970
these young intern lawyers

363
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,150
from being practicing lawyers,

364
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,690
people will say that Liangcheng Law Firm

365
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,260
doesn't train young people.

366
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,270
It will be hard to recruit

367
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,070
in the future.

368
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,990
He didn't let anyone pass last year?

369
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,630
Exactly.

370
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,210
There were only two nominations.

371
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,670
One of them was his nephew.

372
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,600
I heard

373
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,120
Han personally went to the partner meeting

374
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,000
and said he didn't agree.

375
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,800
His nephew went to another firm then.

376
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,580
Three years working here was in vain.

377
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,190
No way.

378
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,300
He can't always suppress his subordinates.

379
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,270
So I guess

380
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
we should have at least one this year.

381
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,150
Otherwise, it's too unreasonable.

382
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,610
Let me remind you, Yingzi.

383
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:20,370
We definitely have no chance.

384
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,390
But you have to mind

385
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,870
Qiu Hua.

386
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,260
She must be the one to pass

387
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,350
if there's only one place.

388
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,990
Why?

389
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,280
She's his assistant.

390
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,190
Let me express my thoughts.

391
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,500
I've checked the list of the interview.

392
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,790
I don't think the eligible people are many.

393
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,320
I don't have my own disciples,

394
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:57,150
so I can be objective.

395
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,660
I mean

396
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,150
we should let everyone

397
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,770
participate in the interviews of our firm and the law association.

398
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:04,030
If they pass them both,

399
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,640
we can let all of them become practicing lawyers, OK?

400
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:13,470
Fang,

401
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,380
it is easy for you to say.

402
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,510
I have five subordinates who are eligible.

403
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,099
If I let them pass all,

404
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,390
then I have to support five more people.

405
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,020
Is my Criminal Defense Department

406
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,030
a nursing home

407
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,109
or a welfare house?

408
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,750
Mr. Han.

409
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,370
Don't put it this way.

410
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,540
There are five subordinates

411
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,940
who are eligible.

412
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:36,290
That means

413
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:38,320
your caseload and workload are very much.

414
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,070
If you let them all work as practicing lawyers,

415
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,040
your team will be much more stronger.

416
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,610
Why didn't you do this

417
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,070
in your team?

418
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,050
Once on shore, one prays no more.

419
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,830
Tao.

420
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
Did you forget what happened six years ago?

421
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:54,560
I didn't stop the four of my disciples

422
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,760
from applying for practicing lawyers.

423
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,570
What did I get?

424
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,630
All of them hopped to other firms, right?

425
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,160
They all left Liangcheng Law Firm.

426
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,500
They even stole three cases from me before they left.

427
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,980
These ungrateful guys.

428
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,590
Are you busy?

429
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm preparing the materials for practicing lawyers.

430
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,150
By the way, I was about to talk to you.

431
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:19,370
The court summons of your bank case

432
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,120
has been issued.

433
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,850
The trial date is approaching.

434
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,150
We guess

435
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,320
the bank

436
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,050
worried that once the divorce case

437
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,710
is beneficial to you,

438
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,820
it may affect

439
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,420
the definition of this loan.

440
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,200
So they've been urging the court

441
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,600
to open a court session as soon as possible.

442
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,950
I guess

443
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:37,580
the bank did such a wicked thing

444
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,350
out of Chen Shuo's bad idea.

445
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:43,390
I think he's quite funny.

446
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,580
Did I dig their ancestral grave

447
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,980
or smashed their big pot?

448
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,270
Why does he hate me so much?

449
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,490
It probably is a professional behavior.

450
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,220
No, Qiu Hua.

451
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,250
Let me tell you.

452
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,760
I have

453
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,070
a sign of menopause.

454
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,080
I panic sometimes.

455
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,030
I don't even remember

456
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,240
things of  my case.

457
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,950
Anything else?

458
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,730
I heard that

459
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,990
we have to apply for and hand in our materials to our firm too.

460
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,320
And the requirements

461
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,630
for practicing lawyers are  raised as well.

462
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,290
Not really.

463
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,380
It should be the same as last year's.

464
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,630
Five cases are required.

465
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,830
It counts when your name

466
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,910
is on Mr. Han's cases.

467
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,230
I forced Mr. Han

468
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,680
to put my name

469
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,210
on the cases I assisted him.

470
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,980
So even if it's based on this standard,

471
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,880
I'm eligible.

472
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,640
That's good.

473
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,150
Mr. Han treats you well.

474
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,230
What do you mean?

475
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,060
Nothing.

476
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,130
I'm just talking.

477
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,830
Didn't you say he signed it for you?

478
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:43,830
I said it was good.

479
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,730
Didn't he write your name

480
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,550
on the cases you handled for him?

481
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,590
Of course, he must do it.

482
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,030
I did all his work.

483
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,430
Why can't he sign my name?

484
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,200
I heard that

485
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,750
he has been suppressing his subordinates

486
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,830
and didn't allow anyone to be a practicing lawyer.

487
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,990
I don't care.

488
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,430
No matter what will happen,

489
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,860
I must be a  practicing lawyer this year.

490
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,430
You know my situation best.

491
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,880
I can't even survive.

492
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,190
I can't afford my rent

493
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,590
with this little salary.

494
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,080
I can only live with the money left from selling the house.

495
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,880
Anyway, I have to be a  practicing lawyer this year.

496
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,360
Why are you telling me this?

497
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,700
I heard he will only provide one place.

498
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
Qiu Hua.

499
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,420
I don't want us

500
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,460
to fight against each other.

501
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,330
Do you know what is hard to survive?

502
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,350
At least you have your own car,

503
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,480
your own apartment,

504
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,380
and your parents to rely on.

505
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,940
I have nothing.

506
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,190
I've been living on credit cards

507
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,210
and overdrafts.

508
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,370
I have to rob Peter to pay Paul.

509
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,320
I must be a practicing lawyer too this year.

510
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,270
Even if I have to fight with you.

511
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,460
Did you get me wrong?

512
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,260
That's not what I meant.

513
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,590
Don't put away these cards.

514
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,560
I don't care about others.

515
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,110
But I think

516
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,480
we have to force Han

517
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:19,910
to give us another place.

518
00:21:20,290 --> 00:21:21,750
Both you and I have to pass.

519
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,290
Han is so stubborn.

520
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:28,320
It is less likely to happen.

521
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,610
Why?

522
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,840
No one is stupid.

523
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,550
It's okay.

524
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,650
I'll figure it out.

525
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,670
Just cooperate with me.

526
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,510
By the way,

527
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,190
if we both become practicing lawyers this year,

528
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,260
we can set up a law firm

529
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,320
and work together.

530
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,110
Think about it.

531
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,990
Take your time. Sleep on it.

532
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,150
These five are all eligible.

533
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,190
If you don't let them participate in the interview,

534
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,250
you're obviously suppressing them.

535
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,710
I think

536
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,630
everyone has to participate in the interview.

537
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,660
As for whether to let them pass or not...

538
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Aren't you in the assessment group?

539
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,280
What do you mean?

540
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,830
You mean

541
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,910
you want me to suppress them

542
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,060
during the interview of our firm, right?

543
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,380
Then they will remember

544
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,980
and bear a grudge against me.

545
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,850
You're giving me a hard time.

546
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:27,520
I didn't say that.

547
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,160
Every member of the assessment group

548
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,400
is guided by the principles of

549
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,610
openness, fairness and impartiality.

550
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,220
Right?

551
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,820
I don't think the same way as Mr. Han does.

552
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,450
More lawyers in our department

553
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,050
will bring high efficiency.

554
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,150
Productivity will lead to a great benefit.

555
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,830
Right?

556
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,410
I have three subordinates who are eligible.

557
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,920
I agree to let them all attend the interview.

558
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,160
Ms. Fang,

559
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:54,920
we have to

560
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,590
consider it carefully.

561
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,120
Ms. Shan has three at a time.

562
00:22:58,700 --> 00:22:59,830
There's only one eligible

563
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,030
in my group.

564
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,760
No matter how hard I push,

565
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,270
we can only have one to pass.

566
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,100
If there are three in their group,

567
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,230
and we only have one,

568
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,530
how will the young in my group feel?

569
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:11,630
I have an idea.

570
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,300
Let's talk about this internally.

571
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,610
One department

572
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,180
can only have one place.

573
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,890
Another place will be given

574
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,060
for the next centralized submission.

575
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,390
Let's give them a goal

576
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,490
so that these young people

577
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,150
can be motivated to work hard.

578
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,280
Isn't this great?

579
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,110
I don't care how many people you want.

580
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,710
I have many subordinates

581
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
and a lot of cases.

582
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,070
So if I only let one of them pass

583
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,170
it will be unacceptable.

584
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:35,740
So I

585
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,470
at least need two places.

586
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,370
Do you want to be the exception?

587
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,770
Mr. Han.

588
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:46,510
I think you have a lot of subordinates.

589
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,960
You can have two as well.

590
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,140
No.

591
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,080
What do you mean?

592
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,820
So you mean

593
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:57,420
we are oppressing the young?

594
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,910
I didn't say that.

595
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,090
Stop arguing.

596
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:03,950
Tao Zheng has enough practicing lawyers already.

597
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,070
Besides, Tao Zheng is the director of the Management Committee.

598
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,620
How about this?

599
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,140
Tao Zheng.

600
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,470
You can have two places.

601
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,670
They can work for the Affairs Department and the Management Committee

602
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,530
respectively.

603
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:13,690
Is that okay?

604
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,760
I don't know what kind of deal they are discussing.

605
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,130
Every time this happens,

606
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,190
it's always a battle between the different factions

607
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,240
in the firm.

608
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,230
Mr. Han.

609
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,310
You called me?

610
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,900
Play another round with me.

611
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,240
It's midnight now?

612
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:02,670
Why aren't you sleeping?

613
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,470
Didn't I tell you

614
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:04,930
to...

615
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:05,760
Xia Shu.

616
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,050
Go to sleep first. I'll talk to you later.

617
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,110
What's the matter?

618
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,610
Have a seat here.

619
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,620
Okay.

620
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,810
Well,

621
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,820
your internship

622
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,960
will end soon.

623
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,080
Are you joining the interview this time?

624
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,520
Why should I worry about that?

625
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,830
I haven't solved a case this year.

626
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,880
Why should I attend that?

627
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,310
Besides, it's tiring.

628
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,380
Why are you working here

629
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,110
if you don't want to be a lawyer?

630
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,200
I’m not really fond of working here.

631
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,320
My dad forced me to.

632
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,900
Every law firm in China

633
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,340
is boring.

634
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:39,930
Look at these people.

635
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:41,290
All they do is make money.

636
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,980
They have no dreams or ambitions.

637
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,550
Boring.

638
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:44,480
Well,

639
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,440
please

640
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,540
do me a favor.

641
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,730
What is it?

642
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:51,430
I want you to ask around.

643
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,320
What's the plan of our firm

644
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,990
for this interview?

645
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,510
How many people can pass?

646
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:57,610
No problem.

647
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,960
I'll ask Ms. Fang.

648
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,400
No.

649
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:01,450
If you want to ask,

650
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,270
you have to ask

651
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,570
Mr. Tao.

652
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,190
Mr. Tao?

653
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,460
Why can't I ask Ms. Fang,

654
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,460
but Mr. Tao?

655
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,140
It's just intuition.

656
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,240
The case my dad introduced

657
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,750
was taken by Mr. Tao.

658
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,300
No problem.

659
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,240
I'll go find him.

660
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,310
Okay, I'm leaving.

661
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,250
Luo Yingzi.

662
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,040
Do you want to apply for the practicing lawyer this year?

663
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,890
I can help you.

664
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,910
How are you going to help me?

665
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,750
I can force them to vote for you.

666
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,350
Forget it.

667
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,160
I'll help myself.

668
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,400
Please help me ask around.

669
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,070
But...

670
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,480
don't speak for me.

671
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:42,380
Okay.

672
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,840
Bye.

673
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:45,770
Let me go out first.

674
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,380
You can go out later.

675
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,550
Okay.

676
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,480
Thanks.

677
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,190
Qiu Hua.

678
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,030
This time, there will be only one place in our Criminal Defense Department

679
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,430
for the interview for practicing lawyers.

680
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:04,770
I'm going to give it to you.

681
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,210
Thank you, Mr. Han.

682
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,350
I've finished the argument of defense you asked me to write.

683
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,080
Show it to me.

684
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:31,970
Qiu Hua.

685
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,500
I like you so much.

686
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:38,270
How are you going to thank me?

687
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,340
You are my mentor.

688
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,210
But I'm a normal man.

689
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,100
I have feelings.

690
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,120
Qiu Hua.

691
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,090
If I let you pass,

692
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,870
how will you thank me?

693
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,510
So you mean...

694
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,560
You knew what I meant.

695
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:22,960
Qiu Hua,

696
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,400
I sincerely have feelings for you.

697
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,740
As long as you are with me,

698
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,980
I can give you anything

699
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,100
except marriage.

700
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
As long as you are with me,

701
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,790
you'll have a bright future.

702
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:44,660
What do you want me to do, Mr. Han?

703
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:48,910
Tonight...

704
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,210
What's

705
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,440
for tonight?

706
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,290
Let's be together tonight.

707
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,020
Hello?

708
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,210
Is this the Xunhua Hotel?

709
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,930
Hello.

710
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,970
I want to book a room

711
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,250
with a king-sized bed.

712
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,390
My surname

713
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,120
is Han.

714
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,480
The room number is...

715
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:29,780
Okay.

716
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,630
Thank you.

717
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,380
Room 302 of Xunhua Hotel.

718
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,080
See you at 8 pm.

719
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,370
Luo Yingzi,

720
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,050
I...

721
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:25,200
Got it.

722
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,690
I'll bring it to you later.

723
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,650
I'll bring it to you later.

724
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,140
Okay.

725
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:50,260
Gosh.

726
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,720
She even asked me to get a glue stick for her.

727
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,360
Come in.

728
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,360
Close the door.

729
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,060
Okay.

730
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:03,750
Let me do it.

731
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,030
I have some information for you.

732
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,830
What's wrong?

733
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,070
He didn't want to tell me at first.

734
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,630
But I was so good at spying.

735
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,280
I got the answer I needed after a couple of questions.

736
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,390
Han Zhitong from your department is really bad.

737
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,070
I know that.

738
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:17,660
And?

739
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,230
But you don't know

740
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,840
even Tao Zheng got two places for his men.

741
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,920
Han refused.

742
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,500
He only wanted one place.

743
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,670
They will ask all the eligible ones

744
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:28,750
to attend the interview.

745
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,510
But only one can be left

746
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:34,190
during the evaluation process of our firm.

747
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,230
Okay.

748
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,590
I got it.

749
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,880
Xia Shu, thank you.

750
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,850
You're welcome.

751
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,250
Han only asked for one place.

752
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:44,450
Will he give it to you?

753
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,040
Probably won't.

754
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,010
If I go to Fang Lihong, she will let you…

755
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,470
Forget it.

756
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:52,450
Don't make enemies of me.

757
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,530
It's my own business. I can manage it myself.

758
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,360
Xia Shu, I'm gonna run.

759
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:55,800
Okay.

760
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,360
Luo Yingzi,

761
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,220
call me if you need anything.

762
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,470
In the whole law firm,

763
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm the one who supports you...

764
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,870
Just come to me.

765
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:06,940
Okay.

766
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:24,880
What's wrong?

767
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,030
Got bullied?

768
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,850
Nothing.

769
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:32,190
I'll go in and talk to him.

770
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,500
I'll talk to you later.

771
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:38,840
Mr. Han.

772
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,420
I'm sorry.

773
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,540
I have no choice.

774
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,710
That's how lawyers are.

775
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,900
Sudden business trips are inevitable.

776
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,380
Yes.

777
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,130
I'll drive.

778
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,000
I'll drive safe.

779
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:52,750
Honey.

780
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,780
I miss you.

781
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,910
Don't forget to miss me, too.

782
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,630
Wait for me.

783
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,150
Come in.

784
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,280
Mr. Han.

785
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,540
I'm sorry.

786
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,250
I rushed in just now.

787
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:10,960
Something's up?

788
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:11,690
By the way,

789
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,929
I'm here

790
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,790
to ask you

791
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:14,900
something about

792
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:16,989
the transfer to practicing lawyers.

793
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,840
You know my status.

794
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,489
I am perfectly suitable for this transfer.

795
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:22,739
Besides,

796
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,840
you also made a promise to me.

797
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,179
Did I?

798
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:32,469
Why don't I remember?

799
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:34,620
Luo.

800
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,320
Work hard.

801
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,590
What should come will come sooner or later.

802
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,199
Mr. Han, have you forgotten

803
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,230
about Wang Dafu's case?

804
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,719
You promised me back then.

805
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,090
I can promise you,

806
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,370
but I don't want to lie to you, Luo.

807
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,260
The place is very rare this time.

808
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,790
I promise to try,

809
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,270
but I can't guarantee.

810
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,680
Many intern lawyers

811
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,060
who came earlier than you

812
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:18,190
haven't been practicing lawyers yet.

813
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:20,080
Just focus on your work.

814
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,990
Mr. Han,

815
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I don't want to compete with others.

816
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:25,970
Look.

817
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:27,040
In this year,

818
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,160
I assisted you with six cases.

819
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,180
Like Wang Dafu,

820
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,370
he would have been sentenced to death.

821
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:34,840
But he was acquitted at last.

822
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,650
With such an influential case,

823
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,900
who can beat me

824
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,680
if I want to compete with others?

825
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,190
Based on

826
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,990
what you've known about me,

827
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,510
you should let me

828
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,900
pass no matter what.

829
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,280
Are you threatening me?

830
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,320
There are few places.

831
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,660
Even if you attend the interview,

832
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,610
what will you do if you can't pass?

833
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,320
Places are negotiable.

834
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,750
But I have to pass this year.

835
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:12,830
I won't bother you now.

836
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,750
I'm out of here.

837
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,320
Who do you think you are?

838
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,120
How dare you threaten me?

839
00:36:58,770 --> 00:36:59,370
Thank you.

840
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:02,650
Why were you crying just now?

841
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:05,270
Nothing.

842
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,160
I was just depressed.

843
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,530
After going through so many things,

844
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:16,870
I suddenly understood a principle.

845
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,720
It's useless to cry.

846
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,060
It can only show your weakness in front of those bastards.

847
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:26,840
In this world,

848
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,890
no matter what you encounter,

849
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,980
you can only save yourself in the end.

850
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,800
I see.

851
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,060
Thank you, Yingzi.

852
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,040
I've made an appointment with him.

853
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:47,840
See you tonight.

854
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:07,370
Hello.

855
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,620
I booked a room.

856
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:12,730
Han Zhicong
Okay.

857
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,230
Excuse me, sir.

858
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,970
You booked the room at the last minute.

859
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,000
We only have rooms

860
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,160
with no windows.

861
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:21,780
I wonder if you can accept it.

862
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,030
Yes, I can.

863
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,580
Okay, I'll check in for you.

864
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,600
[Here I am]

865
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,430
Half an hour before...

866
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:30,230
Hello.

867
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:31,820
Where are you?

868
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,000
You're not coming?

869
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,070
Are you kidding me?

870
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,600
Do you want to get the place?

871
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,610
Which client?

872
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,160
Hurry up.

873
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,140
Wang Dafu?

874
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,810
Have you served the Qianlong cabbage?

875
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,050
Yes.

876
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:52,040
I remember the customer urged us several times.

877
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,340
He said it was not served.

878
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:53,890
Hello.

879
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:55,390
Where is the Room 218?

880
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,920
Let me take you there.

881
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,310
Thank you.

882
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,310
This way, please.

883
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,230
Hello, Miss Luo.

884
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,110
The guest you invited is here.

885
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,200
Tell me.

886
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,350
Where did the 30,000 yuan go?

887
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,660
Let me tell you.

888
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:24,810
I'll go in myself.

889
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:25,830
A fox may turn gray, but never kind.

890
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:26,550
Okay, thank you.

891
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,280
I should have

892
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,570
let them

893
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:30,850
shoot him to death.

894
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,390
What are you talking about?

895
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,530
You're always suspicious.

896
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,660
Aren't you afraid of being laughed at?

897
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,900
Wait a minute.

898
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:37,890
Calm down.

899
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:38,860
Mrs. Sun,

900
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,320
you suspect your husband,

901
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,610
Mr. Wang has an affair with another woman.

902
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,850
You need evidence to prove it.

903
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:44,750
Do you have evidence?

904
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:46,300
Do I need any evidence?

905
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,870
Ladies,

906
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,270
I'm not afraid of you laughing at me.

907
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,400
When he was in there,

908
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,470
I worked very hard

909
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,300
to earn money

910
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,100
and finally saved 30,000 yuan.

911
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,290
When he came out,

912
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,350
the money was gone.

913
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,890
What did he do with the 30,000 yuan

914
00:41:58,890 --> 00:41:59,670
if he didn't have an affair?

915
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,330
How many times have I told you?

916
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,600
I gave the money to Mr. Han.

917
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,250
Nonsense.

918
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,740
Mr. Han said

919
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,900
our case is a legal aid on.

920
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,170
Do you know what it means?

921
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,580
It's free.

922
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:14,230
Let me make it clear.

923
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,930
Don't be angry, please.

924
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,740
Wang Dafu,

925
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,990
your case was a legal aid one.

926
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,200
Legal aid case is pro-bono.

927
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,510
But you saved

928
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,930
my life, right?

929
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,220
I should be grateful.

930
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,110
I have to repay.

931
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,580
After I came out,

932
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:29,050
I met Mr. Han.

933
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:30,200
Mr. Han said

934
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,910
that it was not easy

935
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,950
to investigate the case.

936
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,830
He even paid tens of thousands of yuan.

937
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:34,470
Well,

938
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,590
since he told me this,

939
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,910
I had to be grateful.

940
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:39,460
So I...

941
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,670
I...

942
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,150
I paid Mr. Han 30,000 yuan.

943
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:43,870
You can't talk nonsense.

944
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,910
You have to be responsible for what you just said.

945
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:47,670
Do you understand?

946
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,370
Do you know that you're accusing Mr. Han?

947
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,160
Let alone the legal aid case,

948
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,490
