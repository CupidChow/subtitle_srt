4
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:33,990
What's wrong?

5
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,830
Nothing.

6
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,190
I'll never expose my back to you

7
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,030
in my life.

8
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,600
This one.

9
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:50,970
Ma'am, sir, please.

10
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:51,830
Please come in.

11
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,270
Two bowls of beef noodles.

12
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,630
Just two bowls of beef noodles?

13
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,950
Yes.

14
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:00,040
Ma'am, here is the thing.

15
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,110
There's a minimum charge

16
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,710
for private rooms.

17
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,979
Here's a hundred.

18
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,270
I'll pay for the noodles separately later.

19
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,420
I should only use it

20
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:16,320
for half an hour.

21
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,829
It won't take long.

22
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,420
Okay.

23
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,150
Thank you.

24
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,090
Please come in.

25
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,350
Say it. What is it?

26
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,020
What are you doing?

27
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,510
Get up and speak.

28
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,740
If you don't listen to us,

29
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,670
we won't stand up.

30
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,530
If you don't stand up, I'll leave.

31
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,860
Yingzi.

32
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,110
Let's get up.

33
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,880
Yingzi.

34
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:53,870
Yingzi.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,070
We were wrong.

36
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,390
The bank asked us to testify

37
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,790
that you took out the loan with Liu Ming.

38
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,270
We know we were wrong.

39
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,120
We apologize to you.

40
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,020
We came here this time

41
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,970
and regret it even more...

42
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,490
after finding out that Liu Ming is on the fugitive list.

43
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,840
We are wondering

44
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:21,560
if you can say to the police

45
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,880
that you made a mistake

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,200
and ask the police to withdraw the case.

47
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,920
I filed a false report.

48
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,550
And then the police come to arrest me, right?

49
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,090
No.

50
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,350
Well.

51
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,380
Liu Ming

52
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,070
knows he is on the fugitive list.

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,100
He is freaking out.

54
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,950
He regrets it so much.

55
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,950
He wants to come back

56
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,220
and apologize to you in person right away.

57
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,270
He knows he was wrong.

58
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,270
Can you spare him this time,

59
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,190
for our sake?

60
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,430
Liu Ming is dead to me.

61
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,690
When you made false statements to the police,

62
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:03,400
accusing me

63
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,700
of coming with Liu Ming to cheat on the loan,

64
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,560
did you ever think that you would be begging for my forgiveness today?

65
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,470
Yingzi,

66
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:13,390
I'm

67
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,260
begging you.

68
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,910
He is our only son...

69
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,940
Do my parents have two children?

70
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,610
Anything else?

71
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,510
If nothing else, I'm leaving.

72
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,430
I've ordered food for you. Finish it before you go back.

73
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,300
Luo Yingzi!

74
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:30,480
I've groveled.

75
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,350
Are you still going to harm my son?

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,530
I won't let you off!

77
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,420
It's okay.

78
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,770
By the way, Xia Shu,

79
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,350
I need a favor from you.

80
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:56,030
What is it?

81
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,300
Can you ask your classmate in America

82
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,050
to report Liu Ming

83
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,350
to the USCIS and tell them

84
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,610
that he is on the fugitive list of the Chinese police

85
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,690
and that he is suspected of committing crimes in China?

86
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,350
Okay, that's what I like to do.

87
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,110
Miss Xia.

88
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,970
Why isn't Miss Xia here?

89
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:33,909
Have you met Miss Xia?

90
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,550
Didn't you ask me

91
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,790
to sign a supplementary agreement

92
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,110
to add her

93
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,030
as my lawyer?

94
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:44,050
Today, Miss Xia has been working on other cases.

95
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,140
But we share the same opinion.

96
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,030
Mr. Xu, we're here to remind you

97
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,730
that you must demonstrate

98
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:54,710
your deep remorse

99
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,110
in court.

100
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,270
I know what you want to say.

101
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,150
But without any evidence,

102
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:03,470
we have no means to persuade the judge.

103
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:05,830
Mr. Xu.

104
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,380
It's already very hard to get a retrial.

105
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
You must cherish this opportunity.

106
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,780
By the way, Mr. Xu,

107
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,340
have you made up your mind about the compensation?

108
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,940
How much are you going to pay?

109
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,590
During the first trial,

110
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,030
the court found that you were the principal,

111
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,320
while Zhang Yulin was just an accomplice.

112
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,030
Zhang Yulin has paid 600,000 yuan

113
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,350
to the victim's family.

114
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,710
So our suggestion is

115
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,590
that your compensation

116
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,500
should be at least higher than that.

117
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,270
Do you agree?

118
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,030
If you don't agree now,

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,600
we won't be able to approach the victim's family

120
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,200
and seek their forgiveness.

121
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,600
It's not good for your sentence, either.

122
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,230
Let me think about it.

123
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,480
But this is our only chance

124
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,909
to see each other before the retrial.

125
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:56,230
If you decide now,

126
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:56,980
we can still

127
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,860
persuade the victim's family.

128
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,560
Alright.

129
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,390
It's up to you, whether you want to or not.

130
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:16,590
You know our defense strategies.

131
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,150
Ms. Qiu will plead not guilty,

132
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,500
and I will plead for a misdemeanor.

133
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,470
So that we will be able

134
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,710
to help you get the best defense outcome.

135
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,040
Do you agree?

136
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:32,590
Can I defend myself in court?

137
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,390
Yes.

138
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,180
But we don't recommend you do it.

139
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,270
Mr. Xu.

140
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,909
You're cut off from the outside world

141
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:41,659
behind the bars.

142
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,220
We don't think

143
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,650
it's a good idea for you to defend yourself.

144
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,420
Of course,

145
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,970
as your lawyers, we have the obligation to tell you.

146
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,760
You can choose this option.

147
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:02,640
Don't you think his attitude today is very weird?

148
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:05,150
He's even a little hostile towards us.

149
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,990
Hostile?

150
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,230
No way.

151
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,100
Why would he be hostile towards us?

152
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,420
But he was softened up last time

153
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,390
and was willing to plead guilty.

154
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,850
But this time, he has become firm once again.

155
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,710
Could it be

156
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,310
that someone sent him some wrong information?

157
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,370
But it shouldn't be.

158
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,370
He can't meet anyone except us.

159
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,310
Anyway, he has agreed to our two-pronged defense strategy.

160
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,200
That's not bad.

161
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,460
I don't understand.

162
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,950
Xu Jianshe owns several houses.

163
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,770
If he just sells one of them,

164
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,460
he will have the money to compensate the victim's family.

165
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,320
Why is he so determined not to pay?

166
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,350
Maybe he's really innocent.

167
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,070
He must be innocent to be so insistent.

168
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,750
It must be.

Before I was arrested,

179
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,700
I lived in Unit D, Building 27,

180
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,430
Wanghai Garden, Chengxi District, Jingbei City.

181
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,430
We believe

182
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,910
that there was a debt dispute between the defendant and the victim.

183
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,470
The defendant had planned to kill the victim

184
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,310
and fought over trivial matters with him.

185
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,360
The defendant disregarded the law

and fatally assaulted the victim with a stick.

187

188
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,240
he displayed a bad attitude,

and has refused to apologize to the victim's family to this day.

191
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,190
The defendant should be punished severely according to the law.

192
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,050
The defendant,

193
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,770
did you hear the prosecutor's case against you?

194
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,350
Yes.

195
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,950
Do you have any objections

196
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,220
to the facts and charges stated in the indictment?

197
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,070
You can't plead guilty.

198
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:26,630
Jianshe.

199
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,370
Jianshe!

200
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,520
I'm talking to you.

201
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,680
You can't confess.

202
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,430
I'm telling you, the officials all cover for one another.

203
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,110
They just want to pin the shit on you.

204
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,380
-Don’t plead guilty. -Bailiff.

205
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,480
-Expel her from the court. -Jianshe!

206
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:35,870
Listen.

207
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,230
They just want to make you a scapegoat.

208
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:39,500
If you admit it, you'll be screwed, Jianshe!

209
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,750
Do you understand what I said?

210
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,830
Don't plead guilty!

211
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,710
You can't be the scapegoat. Jianshe!

212
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,310
Jianshe!

213
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,030
Jianshe, you can't plead guilty, Jianshe!

214
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,610
Jianshe! Don't plead guilty! Jianshe!

215
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,810
The defendant.

216
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:56,590
Do you have any objections

217
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,670
to the charges and facts stated in the indictment?

218
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,560
I plead not guilty!

219
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,480
I'm innocent!

220
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,950
I demand that you recuse!

221
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,410
I want everyone to recuse!

222
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,960
All of you!

223
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:19,230
The defendant!

224
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,190
You can speak when we allow you!

225
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,230
Listen!

226
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,070
There's no way you can frame me!

227
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,920
I won't admit it. I won't admit it, even if you kill me!

228
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,850
Bailiff, take the defendant away.

229
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,870
Sentence me to death if you have the guts!

230
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,200
Otherwise,

231
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,380
sooner or later,

232
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:36,590
I'll come after you when I get out!

233
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,550
I didn't do it!

234
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,390
I won't admit it. I won't admit it, even if I die!

235
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,300
Xu Jianshe.

236
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,070
Didn't we reach a consensus

237
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,950
before the retrial?

238
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:11,350
Aren't you digging yourself a grave

239
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,870
by acting like that in court today?

240
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,990
Cut the crap.

241
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,390
You are not someone good either.

242
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:19,380
What do you mean by that?

243
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,360
Mr. Xu, we are your lawyers.

244
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,990
Please show us some respect.

245
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,090
You provoked the victim's family today.

246
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,830
They have relinquished their claim for compensation

247
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,350
and asked the court to punish you severely.

248
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,950
You're not doing yourself any favors.

249
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,630
They're no better.

250
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,930
They're after my several houses.

251
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:37,590
Mr. Xu,

252
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,460
the court hearing will be held again soon.

253
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,350
If you're going to go out of control like you did today

254
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,350
during the next trial,

255
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,190
you're likely to receive a life sentence in prison.

256
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,830
How did I lose control?

257
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,710
I wanted to say it a long time ago.

258
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,870
I knew you were in cahoots with them

259
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,470
before the retrial!

260
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,430
You were going to pin the shit on me!

261
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,950
There is no way

262
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,880
you can play me for a sucker!

263
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,720
Xu Jianshe.

264
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,710
You knew it before the trial.

265
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,850
Did someone say something to you?

266
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,560
None of your business.

267
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,950
I just know

268
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,600
that I don't need you to represent me anymore.

269
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,030
M-M-Mr. Xu,

270
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,200
is that what you want?

271
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,460
Yes.

272
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:22,630
Xu Jianshe.

273
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,350
I repeat.

274
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:27,470
The court will reconvene soon.

275
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,370
If you choose to change your lawyers now,

276
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,800
you have to think about the consequences.

277
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,620
I'd rather die in court with my chin up

278
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,710
than be played by you.

279
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,070
I'm officially telling you.

280
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:41,990
I...

281
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,600
want a new lawyer!

282
00:13:56,780 --> 00:14:03,530
[Jingbei City Chengxi District Detention Center]

283
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,640
Why do I feel like we've been set up?

284
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,190
I think so too.

285
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,480
I can't believe it.

286
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,190
Look.

287
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,120
When Ma Lili was in court,

288
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,310
she clearly hinted at Xu Jianshe.

289
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,800
But Xu Jianshe was also cooperative.

290
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,830
But they didn't

291
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,340
have the chance to meet each other.

292
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,230
And why did Ma Lili

293
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:21,510
do that?

294
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,470
Xu Jianshe doesn't know what's going on because he is in jail.

295
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,580
But she knows.

296
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:24,990
Yes.

297
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,070
Doesn't she know

298
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,110
what she was doing to Xu Jianshe?

299
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,980
What's wrong? Did it go well?

300
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,710
It went well.

301
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,630
It went so well that we got fired.

302
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:33,950
How could it be?

303
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,590
-Let's talk in the car. -Luo Yingzi.

304
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,310
I...

305
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,670
Let's get in the car first.

306
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,060
Xia Shu.

307
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,510
Did Ma Lili ask you to do something?

308
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,740
Tell us. Don't leave it there!

309
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:53,750
Well,

310
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,950
I can explain.

311
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,830
After meeting Ma Lili that day,

312
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,350
she suddenly asked me

313
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,340
to meet her at the café in front of our firm

314
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,060
and asked me to take a message to Xu Jianshe.

315
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:04,830
What?

316
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,110
Go. Let's talk over there.

317
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:12,860
And then?

318
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,620
She told me a lot.

319
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,960
She kept begging me.

320
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,130
I thought she really loved Xu Jianshe.

321
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:19,640
It was not easy for them.

322
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,730
So, I went to see Xu Jianshe once.

323
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,590
Why didn't you tell us

324
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,870
that Ma Lili asked you out?

325
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,080
You should have discussed this with us

326
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,590
before you went to visit Xu Jianshe.

327
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,310
I couldn't come to you.

328
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,750
You were in the detention center at that time,

329
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,310
and Qiu Hua was busy with your case.

330
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,350
And I didn't think it was a big deal.

331
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,750
Not a big deal?

332
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,280
What did you tell Xu Jianshe?

333
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
Tell us.

334
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:41,870
I said,

335
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,710
"I believe you're innocent too."

336
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,000
"You have to believe in the law."

337
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,510
"We will fight for you."

338
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,350
No way.

339
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,360
If that's what you said,

340
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,950
how could he fire us?

341
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,590
You must have said something else.

342
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,350
I said that since the case was remanded for retrial,

343
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,990
it meant that the judge of the second trial

344
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,110
did think there was something wrong with this case.

345
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,830
And I said that if he insisted on pleading not guilty,

346
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,590
he might be acquitted.

347
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,230
That's all I said.

348
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,830
Ma Lili asked you to see him, and so you did?

349
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,810
Do you have a brain in your head?

350
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,510
You're the only one with a mouth, right?

351
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:08,520
I'm sorry. I know I was wrong.

352
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,110
I just believe that he is innocent.

353
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,640
Xia Shu,

354
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,830
what do you think we are, the three of us?

355
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,030
Are we playing house?

356
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,070
Do you think we are a team?

357
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:16,990
I'm sorry.

358
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,160
-Luo Yingzi. -I'm really sorry.

359
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,390
This is the good teammate you found for us.

360
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,710
She only worked on two cases with us

361
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:24,240
and she ruined both of them.

362
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,990
Do you know how hard I worked

363
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,520
to have a life like this?

364
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,830
I will never allow

365
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,760
such a foolish teammate by my side.

366
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,390
-I’ll take the bus. -Qiu Hua.

367
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,750
I'm sorry. Don't go.

368
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,850
Luo Yingzi!

369
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,630
Qiu Hua.

370
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:52,990
I'm sorry.

371
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:57,230
Yingzi.

372
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,110
Do you think that Ma Lili

373
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,840
really wants Xu Jianshe to come out of the prison?

374
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,230
I can't figure it out myself.

375
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,030
We are divorced.

376
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,430
Why am I doing this?

377
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,069
To be frank,

378
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,670
his being in prison

379
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,390
will only be good for me.

380
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,240
Because he has no one outside to help him.

381
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,619
If something happened outside of prison,

382
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:20,130
he'd have to come to me.

383
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,099
I can just fool him around.

384
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,190
How many houses does Xu Jianshe own?

385
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,860
At least four, right?

386
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,660
The market value of these four houses

387
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,060
should be at least tens of millions of yuan.

388
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,190
They are divorced.

389
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,080
Without Xu's authorization,

390
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,590
Ma Lili can't dispose of his properties.

391
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:42,200
But he owns several houses.

392
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,100
Just sell one.

393
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,650
I can do anything with the money,

394
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,820
not to mention the legal fee.

395
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,520
Can you ask him to sign this?

396
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,650
Power of Attorney.

397
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:52,990
So, Ma Lili always wanted us

398
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,650
to help her get him to sign the power of attorney.

399
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,030
But we both refused.

400
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,930
So, she asked Xia Shu to send a message to him

401
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,340
in order to make Xu Jianshe lose trust in us

402
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,130
and fire us.

403
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:08,270
If Xu Jianshe couldn't get out after being sentenced,

404
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,060
she could visit Xu Jianshe

405
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,990
and get his signature,

406
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,360
so that she could transfer his assets

407
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,780
into her name.

408
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,490
If there is a great love

409
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,910
in this world,

410
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,270
it must be the love

411
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,800
that my Jianshe and I share.

412
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:27,740
She asked us to get him to sign the power of attorney.

413
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,520
We refused.

414
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,430
So she had her eye on the simple Xia Shu.

415
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:32,290
In the end, she burst out in court.

416
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,160
Actually, she was trying to incite Xu Jianshe

417
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,350
to not plead guilty

418
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
and provoke the victim's family

419
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,460
in order to make them demand a heavy punishment.

420
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,150
Sir.

421
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,600
Can you pull over the bus?

422
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,620
We have an emergency.

423
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,150
There's a station up ahead.

424
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:49,630
What's wrong?

425
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,360
I think

426
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,220
we should go back and meet Xu Jianshe.

427
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,550
Maybe it isn't too late.

428
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:55,190
But

429
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,680
he has already fired us.

430
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,130
It was just verbal.

431
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,220
Let's give it a try.

432
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,050
Let's look for another bus stop nearby.

433
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,190
Qiu Hua.

434
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,150
How about we get back to Xia Shu's mistake later?

435
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,610
Let's get in the car first.

436
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,510
Hurry.

437
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,150
Go.

438
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,920
Let's go.

439
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,430
Is it them?

440
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,150
Yes.

441
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,080
These are their credentials.

442
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,430
Xu Jianshe has terminated

443
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,750
your agency agreement.

444
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,210
He doesn't want to see you.

445
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,440
Officer,

446
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,310
we have something really important.

447
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,730
We must see Xu Jianshe.

448
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,950
Can you talk to him again?

449
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:23,430
He has made it very clear.

450
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,270
He doesn't need you to defend him.

451
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,130
You two are no longer his lawyers.

452
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,320
You have no right to meet him.

453
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,240
His family has hired new lawyers for him.

454
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:30,840
Go back.

455
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:32,790
No, officer.

456
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:33,510
Go back.

457
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,460
Officer, look.

458
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,470
Next.

459
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,070
Forget it. Let's go.

460
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:38,790
Let's go.

461
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,990
I never wanted to admit

462
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,430
that Han was my mentor.

463
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,110
But I have to admit it now.

464
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:06,520
Why?

465
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,430
Do you remember Wang Dafu's case?

466
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,430
Han said something at that time.

467
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,910
He said that, as a lawyer,

468
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,390
his first opponent

469
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,910
is his client.

470
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,390
Even though I nearly fell for

471
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,520
Wang Dafu's wife's tricks in his case,

472
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,230
I still didn't want to admit it

473
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:26,110
at that time.

474
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,990
I always tended to

475
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,680
trust my clients.

476
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,450
Now I know

477
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:35,870
that Han

478
00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:38,030
is indeed my mentor.

479
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:40,190
I didn't expect

480
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,670
that the first wise saying I got

481
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:44,190
in this industry

482
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,120
would actually come from him.

483
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,580
Xia Shu,

484
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,800
thank you for sending us back.

485
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,960
From now on,

486
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,200
you should go back to your partner's office.

487
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,200
You don't have to come to our office.

488
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,910
I'll quit if you still want her on our team.

489
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,390
I...

490
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,040
Xia Shu, I'm sorry.

491
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,560
Let's go back to the beginning.

492
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,250
The firm also organized a trip for young lawyers to observe this time.

493
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,660
This is so embarrassing.

494
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,620
Whatever.

495
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:04,030
After all, we had this case remanded.

496
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,150
Qiu Hua, let's hold our heads high and go in later.

497
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,190
Luo Yingzi.

498
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,590
Qiu Hua.

499
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,710
You did a good job in court.

500
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,880
It's okay.

501
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,650
We will meet all types of clients.

502
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,520
You'll get used to it.

503
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,370
Some battles you win, some battles you lose.

504
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,800
Mentor.

505
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,760
Thank you, my mentor.

506
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:02,300
Terminated?

507
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:03,260
Yes.

508
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,040
Is he in contact

509
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,930
with someone outside the prison?

510
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,480
He is...

511
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,400
He...

512
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:12,620
His ex-wife,

513
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:13,600
Ma Lili.

514
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,080
Didn't she give him hints in the audience?

515
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,780
Did she pay for the retrial?

516
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,090
Nothing.

517
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,960
Ma Lili said she had no money to pay us.

518
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,820
We agreed that after the retrial,

519
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,660
and once we legally got Xu Jianshe's signed power of attorney,

520
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,840
she would help him sell a house

521
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,500
and use the proceeds to pay us.

522
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,720
But now...

523
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:37,870
Forget it.

524
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,870
Sorry, Ms. Fang.

525
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,430
This case has reached this point.

526
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,990
What's the point of saying that now?

527
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:49,240
Take the lesson.

528
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:51,160
Get back to work.

529
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,390
Okay.

530
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:19,290
Such a good case

531
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,430
ended like this.

532
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,200
I can't accept it.

533
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,930
If she doesn't hire us,

534
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,220
whom would she hire?

535
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,840
Someone who can be manipulated by her.

536
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,670
Someone who can help her get what she wants,

537
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:40,890
and keep Xu Jianshe in prison for the rest of his life...

538
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,970
And find a way to help her get his properties.

539
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,990
[Jingbei Court]

540
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,250
I saw him and Chubby rushing to the front.

541
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,910
He kept shouting,

542
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,200
"Kill him! Kill him!"

543
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,950
During that time, Li Zhanjun

544
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:01,990
looked for Xu Jianshe everywhere

545
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,980
in order to ask him to pay him back.

546
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,980
He had no money,

547
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,270
so he went hiding everywhere.

548
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,260
It was three o'clock in the morning.

549
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,920
He suddenly knocked on my door

550
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,030
and said that something had happened.

551
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,520
Later, we saw him and Chubby

552
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,920
emerging from the grove.

553
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,370
He still held the stick.

554
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,550
He swung his stick

555
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,860
as if trying to shake off the blood on it.

556
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,390
One time, he hid in my place

557
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,210
and said that Li Zhanjun was not a good friend.

558
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,070
He also said,

559
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,480
"Or, I can just kill him."

560
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,370
He said that he had killed someone,

561
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,230
so he had to run.

562
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,750
He asked me to lend him money.

563
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,360
I gave him 300 yuan at home.

564
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:34,470
Attorney,

565
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,530
any objections?

566
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,490
Yes.

567
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,900
Well...

568
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,720
Are you sure you want to withdraw your claim for civil damages?

569
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,320
Yes.

570
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,290
We strongly request that the defendant be sentenced to death.

571
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,430
All rise.

572
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,590
Upon review, the court found

573
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:29,030
that the defendant, Xu Jianshe, disregarded the law and discipline.

574
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,150
Due to a debt dispute with the victim,

575
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,160
the defendant seized the opportunity to retaliate

576
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,390
and intentionally caused the victim's death.

577
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:35,870
According to Article 234

578
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:38,630
of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,

579
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:41,590
the defendant, Xu Jianshe, has been found guilty of committing the crime of intentional injury

580
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:43,070
with particularly serious circumstances.

581
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,600
Hereby, I sentence him to life imprisonment.

582
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,890
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

583
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,650
Congratulations, Mrs. Ma.

584
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,200
What do you mean by that?

585
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,510
Isn't this exactly what you wanted?

586
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,490
You've finally gotten what you wanted.

587
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,820
Your ex-husband can't come out of prison.

588
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,030
Didn't he do it to himself?

589
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,320
What does it have to do with me?

590
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,910
You see. Since he can't come out,

591
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,960
can his properties be yours?

592
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,450
He's in jail for life.

593
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,140
Why does he need so much money?

594
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,730
See.

595
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,750
If you ask me, Mrs. Ma is the most amazing woman.

596
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,930
Why so stubborn?

597
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,480
If you had joined hands with me,

598
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,080
you'd have gotten the money.

599
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,500
What a coincidence.

600
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,280
We are not interested in

601
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,630
taking advantage of others' misfortune.

602
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,070
You two lost

603
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:40,980
because you were too rigid.

604
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,150
Let's go.

605
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,220
I have a feeling.

606
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:47,190
What?

607
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,250
Our story with her isn't over yet.

608
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,710
Go back by yourself!

609
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,650
Let us help you.

610
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,190
Thank you.

611
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,210
You were

612
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,180
the defendant's lawyer, right?

613
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:09,830
We are lawyers as well.

614
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,500
Allow me to introduce myself.

615
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,440
I'm Luo Yingzi from the Liangcheng firm.

616
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,360
I'm Qiu Hua.

617
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,390
He Ming from the Fangzheng Firm.

618
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:16,890
You have a lot of stuff.

619
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,150
Why don't you put them in my car?

620
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,210
I'll send you back.

621
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,520
It's inappropriate.

622
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,210
Don't bother.

623
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,150
Why not?

624
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:22,890
Let's go. Come.

625
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:23,870
Let me help you.

626
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,190
Let's go.

627
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,190
He Ming, right?

628
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,190
Have you become a practicing lawyer yet?

629
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,640
No, I'm still an intern.

630
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:42,690
Ms. Qiu.

631
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:44,940
What did I say?

632
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,730
I guessed right.

633
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:48,710
What?

634
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:51,430
Mrs. Luo thought you might be an intern

635
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,780
and were bullied by your mentor.

636
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,160
It's nothing. It's just...

637
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,930
I think he has a car,

638
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,260
yet he still asked you to carry the heavy files

639
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,020
all the way back on your own.

640
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:01,640
Yeah.

641
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,800
Really.

642
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,620
Gosh.

643
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,860
It's okay. Just some physical labor.

644
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,460
Yes.

645
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,850
You're right.

646
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:11,150
It doesn't matter for us young people to do more work.

647
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,010
But if they ask us to do something illegal,

648
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,190
it'll be troublesome.

649
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,190
If something happens in the future,

650
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:18,360
it will be entirely your fault.

651
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:21,340
Well, what do you mean?

652
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,170
You don't know, do you?

653
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,700
We used to represent Xu Jianshe.

654
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,660
We are stupid.

655
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,580
We worked so hard

656
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,390
to get his life sentence case remanded

657
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,630
in the first trial.

658
00:30:36,090 --> 00:30:37,200
But because we refused

659
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,400
his ex-wife's illegal demands,

660
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,040
she fired us.

661
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,880
Later, we knew that they had come to you

662
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,620
and we thought she must have had some ulterior motives.

663
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,820
What do you mean by "ulterior motives"?

664
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,700
She didn't ask you to secretly get Xu Jianshe

665
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:55,680
to sign some power of attorney, right?

666
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,420
You didn't get permission

667
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,500
from the court and the police, right?

668
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:05,140
And they are divorced.

669
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,110
See.

670
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,840
I knew it.

671
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,080
Ms. Qiu,

672
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,400
what's the first clause of Article 306

673
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,630
of the Criminal Law?

674
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:23,050
The defenders shall be held criminally liable

675
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,070
for colluding with the clients to falsify evidence, right?

676
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,840
He definitely broke the law.

677
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,540
But do you think he'd go to prison because of it?

678
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,250
Mrs. Luo, don't scare Mr. He.

679
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,590
He,

680
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:37,990
you are a lawyer.

681
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,710
Although you're just an intern for now,

682
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,430
you should know

683
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,640
what you should do

684
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,100
and what you shouldn't do.

685
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,470
You don't have to tell us

686
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,590
the details.

687
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,340
We just want to remind you.

688
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,370
Whether it was your mentor who asked you to do it

689
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,810
or Ma Lili,

690
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,360
you'd better find some evidence

691
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,350
to avoid taking responsibility.

692
00:31:59,230 --> 00:31:59,790
This way,

693
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,910
if something happens in the future,

694
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,780
you will also be able to defend yourself.

695
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:10,920
Can I

696
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:13,150
talk to one of you?

697
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:14,470
Just one of you,

698
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,750
without your phone.

699
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,100
Let's go over there.

700
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,630
When did you meet Xu Jianshe?

701
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,590
We met him once at the detention center before.

702
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,270
But I don't know exactly

703
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,630
what they talked about.

704
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:52,020
Ma Lili went to them

705
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,240
before the retrial.

706
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,530
The retrial was held on August 9th.

707
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,320
They hooked up on August 1st.

708
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,660
His mentor

709
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,800
charged Ma Lili a high legal fee.

710
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,640
She had only one condition.

711
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,860
Do you know what it is?

712
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,230
Let Xu Jianshe sign

713
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,750
the document authorizing Ma Lili to handle his properties.

714
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,270
Yes.

715
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,650
They first met Xu Jianshe

716
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,170
on August 13th.

717
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,430
When He asked Xu Jianshe

718
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,270
to sign the agent agreement,

719
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,370
the power of attorney was mixed up in that agreement.

720
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:21,470
His mentor left first, using the pretext of making a phone call.

721
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,070
In other words,

722
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,470
his mentor placed all the blame

723
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,330
solely on him.

724
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,090
What a wicked mentor.

725
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,990
It's strange.

726
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,990
His mentor and Han

727
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,790
are like two peas in a pod.

728
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,960
His mentor only gives him 3,000 yuan per month.

729
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,290
Whether he can get a commission

730
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,950
depends on his mentor's mood.

731
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,790
Just like Han.

732
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,720
His mentor is always in a bad mood.

733
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,560
Everyone has to meet someone like Han

734
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,230
at work.

735
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,580
You should teach him how to deal with someone like Han.

736
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,180
We should offer help

737
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,220
to every victim of someone like Han.

738
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,240
I just had a quick chat with He.

739
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,030
I guess

740
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,850
he should have something in his hand.

741
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,510
Anyway, I asked him to handle it himself.

742
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,180
We warned him.

743
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,160
Let's not get involved in this.

744
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,510
Ma Lili is so vicious.

745
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,590
Everything went according to her plan.

746
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,310
Xu Jianshe will spend the rest of his life in prison.

747
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:15,239
All of his property belongs to her.

748
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,489
Since He and they took over,

749
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,989
Ma Lili insisted on pleading not guilty.

750
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,830
They even made empty promises to Xu Jianshe

751
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,590
in order to convince Xu Jianshe

752
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,139
that he would be acquitted.

753
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,560
A perfect match.

754
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,440
Xu Jianshe and Ma Lili

755
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:30,590
belong together.

756
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,690
Mrs. Luo means

757
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,370
that Ding is very likely to be Wen Li's

758
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:40,409
next target.

759
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,550
That's what Yingzi meant,

760
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,510
but I found it hard to believe.

761
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:46,920
Why?

762
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,020
I know Ding.

763
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,909
He's a workaholic.

764
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:52,739
He is a tough competitor

765
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:54,530
in business.

766
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,880
But he seems to have zero interest

767
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,170
in relationships.

768
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,960
You're being too absolute.

769
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,640
Every man has that within him.

770
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,550
Let me put it this way.

771
00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:05,880
Over the years,

772
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,430
there have been many women around Ding.

773
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,380
None of them succeeded.

774
00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:14,760
None of them succeeded.

775
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,310
Does he have any children?

776
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,830
He has only one son.

777
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,100
It seems to be his sore point.

778
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:23,230
When he sent his only son to America,

779
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:25,630
he wanted him to learn business management

780
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,820
so that he could eventually take over the family business.

781
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:28,310
But his son

782
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,000
doesn't seem to be interested in any of it.

783
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,620
All he wants is to join Hollywood

784
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,550
and make movies.

785
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,990
I also heard

786
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:35,660
that his son is back now.

787
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,900
What did you come for?

788
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:43,900
You don't owe me anything.

789
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,890
I'm going to do what I want to do.

790
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,190
Take care of you, cure you, and remain with you till that happens.

791
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:52,830
But you can't. You can't help hide a criminal.

792
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:58,400
I'm not going to jeopardize your standing as a doctor.
You're just getting started. I won't let you be stupid about it.

793
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,290
I couldn't bear it away from you.

794
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,030
I went through yesterday, holding my breath

795
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,430
as if I were being haunted.
I couldn't eat or work or do anything but think of you.

796
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,530
So I had to come.

797
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,680
I'll get a room on this floor. I'm here as your doctor only.

798
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:17,100
It has nothing to do with love.

799
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,200
So I had to come.

800
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,360
[Vice Chairman of Boshi Group, Ding Qiwei]

801
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,860
It has nothing to do with love.

802
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,830
Try remembering. Let your mind go back to your childhood.

803
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:34,870
Was it happy?

804
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,960
Whom did you know in your childhood?

805
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,350
I'm haunted

806
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,460
but I can't say by words.

807
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,330
Her target is not Ding,

808
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,740
but rather his son.

809
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,280
She's trying to get to know Ding first

810
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,610
to get to her real goal in a roundabout way.

811
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,120
Also,

812
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,850
did your ex-husband send that letter to Wen Li?

813
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,630
Yingzi asked him to write the letter.

814
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,600
But she said she has been busy recently.

815
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,650
When she's done,

816
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,730
she will ask him to send the letter.

817
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,890
Looks like, Mrs. Luo

818
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,380
leaves the opportunity for me to get credit.

819
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,960
Ms. Xiao, I understand

820
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,850
that you may not want to see your ex-husband,

821
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:18,780
but

822
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,280
can you take some time to visit him with me?

823
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,430
Let's discuss it with Sun Huading

824
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,960
to see how he should write to Wen Li.

825
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,560
Okay?

826
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,280
Okay.

827
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,630
Thank you.

828
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,920
It's not good. Too rigid.

829
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:40,020
Mr. Sun,

830
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,390
you have to make her think

831
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,750
that you were still in the dark

832
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:45,710
and that you still solely thought about being with her

833
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,240
after you got out of prison.

834
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,070
You have to write something romantic.

835
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,900
No need to mind Ms. Xiao.

836
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,100
You two are now a community of interest.

837
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,130
I don't think Mr. Xiao would mind

838
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,320
what you say or do.

839
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,190
Whatever you do right now, I'm okay with it.

840
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,740
Okay.

841
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,030
You need to write me a recommendation letter

842
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,560
to introduce me to Mr. Ding.

843
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,420
After I send this letter to Wen Li,

844
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,010
I'll go to Shanghai.

845
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,300
Mr. Ding, my name is Wen Li.

846
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,710
Mr. Sun, Sun Huading, introduced me here.

847
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:40,470
Mr. Sun.

848
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,270
Isn't he in jail?

849
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,050
You already knew that?

850
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:45,710
Have a seat.

851
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,330
It's been almost two years.

852
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,830
He can come out in less than a year and a half.

853
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,040
Mr. Ding.

854
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,490
This is a letter from Mr. Sun.

855
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,940
You're his secretary, right?

856
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:02,460
Yes.

857
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,600
I have been working for him

858
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,280
since he started his company.

859
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,030
It was really hard back then.

860
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,170
[Chairman of Boshi Group, Ding Zhaoguang]

861
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,930
I didn't expect

862
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,630
that Mr. Sun would have such a disaster

863
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,670
just as his company went on the right track.

864
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,820
After Mr. Sun was jailed, everyone else in the company left.

865
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,940
Even his wife divorced him.

866
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,880
But I worked with Mr. Sun from the beginning.

867
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,080
I can't leave him, no matter who leaves.

868
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,460
In the past two years,

869
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,320
I've often visited him in prison.

870
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,190
Mr. Sun helped me

871
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,650
open a real estate sales agency in Shanghai.

872
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,440
I'm thinking of building up some capital

873
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,200
to help Mr. Sun make a comeback.

874
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,010
Mr. Ding.

875
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,280
Mr. Sun told me

876
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:42,240
that you would definitely help me.

877
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,320
Did he say

878
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,710
how I should help you?

879
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,810
Mr. Sun means

880
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,680
that he wants me to

881
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,960
sell the properties you develop for you.

882
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,070
But we already have dealers.

883
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,260
Mr. Ding.

884
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,390
I'm just a little woman.

885
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,910
I used to do some scut work for Mr. Sun

886
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,180
and have little business experience.

887
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,380
I didn't want to take it over, either.

888
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,630
But after what happened to Mr. Sun,

889
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:17,060
his assets were divided

890
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,310
by other shareholders and his ex-wife.

891
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,510
If I didn't help him,

892
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,030
he'd have nothing once he came out.

893
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:29,670
I don't know if he can make a comeback in his life.

894
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:31,640
I...

895
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,760
I don't know why I'm helping him.

896
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,670
It's all his own doing.

897
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,320
Am I right?

898
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,720
How about this?

899
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,800
I'll introduce you to my vice president.

900
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:49,160
You talk to her.

901
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:50,730
Okay?

902
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,550
Okay.

903
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:53,610
Dad.

904
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:55,310
Dad!

905
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,110
Dad!

906
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,590
What do you mean?

907
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:58,940
Why did you fire Huang

908
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,220
and Lin in my office?

909
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,280
Can't you see I have a guest here?

910
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,740
They are my men.

911
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,630
If you want to fire my men,

912
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,970
at least you should say something to me beforehand.

913
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,780
They're not suitable to work for our company.

914
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,910
They are my friends!

915
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,520
Qiwei.

916
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,100
You should know that we are a business company

917
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,700
with a strict management system

918
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,730
and operational rules,

919
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,710
not a gang.

920
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,470
I know.

921
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:21,970
You just think that they are all like me,

922
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,250
like filming movies

923
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,800
instead of doing business.

924
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,070
You

925
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,320
just want to separate me

926
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,580
from my film-making partners.

927
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:30,110
Yes.

928
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:31,850
You're right.

929
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,140
You're the vice chairman of the company,

930
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,490
not an amateur actor.

931
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,220
All right, get out.

932
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,280
I have a guest here.

933
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,730
Okay?

934
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,070
Dad.

935
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:44,190
Dad!

936
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:45,820
Dad!

937
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,840
Dad. Dad.

938
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,420
You have to bring them back.

939
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,800
They can do nothing

940
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:52,130
other than make movies.

941
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,070
If you fire them,

942
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,370
they won't even have enough money to eat.

943
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,990
All the more reason why I have to fire them.

944
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,180
I don't run a charity institution here,

945
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,780
nor is this a place where just anyone can get in.

946
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,580
Inhumane!

947
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,720
Hello, Gu.

948
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,410
I have a friend

949
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,310
who was introduced to me by Sun Huading. She is...

950
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,310
My surname is Wen.

951
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:19,390
Miss Wen.

952
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,310
She has just established...

953
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,650
a real estate sales company.

954
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,510
She wants to collaborate with us.

955
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,040
I'll send her to you.

956
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
You talk to her.

957
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:33,110
Okay, that's all.

958
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,130
Okay, you can go to her now.

959
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,280
Her office is over there.

960
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,030
Ms. Gu, you'll know once you ask.

961
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:39,970
Thank you, Mr. Ding.

962
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:40,880
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

963
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,070
Okay, go.

964
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:52,860
Hello.

965
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,880
I heard that Sun Huading

966
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,590
was in jail because of a woman.
