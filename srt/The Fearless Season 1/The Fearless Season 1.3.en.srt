Yes.

Nothing else.

Well,

we still have to discuss the case,

10
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,720
so we won't keep you.

11
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,759
Well, one more thing.

12
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,910
See if you can

13
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,820

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,570
No, we can't.

15

Hmm...

16
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,870
The content of this letter is nothing special

17
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,000
but just a few words,

18
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,110
mainly telling him that

00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,110
the kid is doing well at home.

20
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,330
Tell him not to worry.

What's more,

22
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:02,930
uh, in that court,

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,590
don't admit what he shouldn't admit.

24
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,800
Okay. How about this?

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,190

Mr. Han.

41
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,680
If a witness is found,

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,790
it means that Wang Dafu didn't have time to commit the crime.

43
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,250
Can we overturn the case then?

44
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,110

47
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,630
When you sent her out yesterday,

48
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,830
did you tell her

49
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,120
to find a witness?

50
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:03,870
Yes.

51
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,360
Didn't she say yesterday Wang Dafu

52
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,190
was with her at that time ?

53
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:08,890
Then...

54
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,170
Do you want to kill me?

55
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,030
You've only studied law for a few days.

56
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,830
Is there no one in the whole law firm as capable as you?

57
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,630

58
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,280
You what?

59
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,620
Do you know what you're doing now

61
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,950
Mr. Han, I don't understand.

62
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,329
You don't understand?

63
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,320
Qiu Hua, explain it to her.

64
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,280
Witnesses and testimony

65
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,550
are actually very unreliable.

66
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,390
Sun Xiaoe  is determined to save her husband.

67
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,360
and she also knows the importance of another witness.

68
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,270
she will definitely ask the villagers to help her make false testimony.

69
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,340
If the villagers can't bring themselves to reject her,

70
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,250
they will agree to testify for her.

71
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:46,430
But this kind of testimony can't stand the court's cross-examination.

72
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,579
When those witnesses meet the police,

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,570
and know that making false testimony is illegal,

74
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,829
they may change their testimony.

75
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,590
Think about it.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,140
When they meet the police,

77
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,450
and know that making false testimony is illegal,

78
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,610
who will they blame for perjury?

79
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,010
Do you know Article 306 of Criminal Law?

80
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,660
Yes.

93

became like this?

94
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:42,820
This law firm

95
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,510
was founded by her, her husband

96

and Fang Lihong.

97
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,960
Afterwards, the couple took on a case,

98
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:53,880
thinking they had obtained the testimony

99
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,710
that could overturn the nature of the case.

100
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,130
However, in court,

101
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:02,350
the witness insisted

102
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,900
she instigated them to make false testimony.

103
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,700
Her client also said in court

104
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,820
that she had incited them to change their guilty confession.

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,930
They were accused of

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,530
violating Article 306 of Criminal Law.

Mei Daliang's lawyer's license was also revoked.

110
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:35,780
Mei Daliang was originally named Mei Qin,

111
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,990
and she changed her name

112
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:41,150

00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,290
my relationship with Qin Ailian

168
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,270

my wife also quarreled with me,

174

and then she went back to her mother's home.

175
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,550

176

whether to call my wife back or not.

177

and said that my wife hadn't been to work all day,

192
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,670
and if she didn't go to work again, she would be fired.

193
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,150
I was shocked.

194
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:02,850
So I hurried out

195
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,240
to find my wife.

196
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,470
I left at 1 p.m.

197
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,730
[1 p.m., July 12]

198
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,630
And when I came back, it was 7 p.m.

199
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,590
When I came back,

200
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,710
she was already dead.

201
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,540
[7 p.m., July 12]

202
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,340
So I called the police.

203
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,490
Then they insisted

204
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:36,930
that I killed him.

205
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,390
Well, counsels,

206
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,130
you have to help me.

207
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,630
If I wanted to kill her,

208
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,350
why would I

209
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:44,770
kill her in my own house?

210
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,870
What's more, what happened between Qin Ailian and me

211
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,590
was known to my wife.

212
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,110
So I didn't need to...

213
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:51,860
You know?

214
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:56,130
The legal term for that is motive.

215
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,880
[Wang Dafu 500,000 yuan]

216
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,290
I have no motive.

217
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,220
I haven't...

218
00:09:58,250 --> 00:09:59,240
I haven't had a motive.

219
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,170
No motive.

220
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,020
Okay.

221
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,290
We got it.

222
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,720
When the police asked you,

223
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,840
did you tell this to them?

224
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,790
Yes.

225
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,990
Wang Dafu.

226
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,190
Now the prosecution believes that you killed the person,

227
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,620
and the evidence is quite sufficient.

228
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,760
we will bring up what you said

229
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,630
when we defend you.

230
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,490
But in my opinion,

231
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,450
it's almost impossible

232
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,560
to put on a non-guilty defense.

233
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,420
Well, why is it impossible?

234
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,610
Counsels...

235
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,710
If you plead guilty with a good attitude,

236
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,950
repent sincerely,

237
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:37,650
actively compensate the victim,

238
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,410
and get forgiveness from the victim's family,

239
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,760
it'll be helpful for your sentence reduction in the end.

240
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,350
Well, counsels,

241
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,240
I really didn't kill her.

242
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,350
The civil litigator proposed that

243
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:54,700
if your family could offer 500,000 yuan,

244
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:58,230
the victim's family will issue a letter of understanding,

245
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,480
which will be very helpful for your sentencing.

246
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,240
Where could I get the money?

247
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,420
No.

248
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,630
Well, uh...

249
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,540
Let's sort it out.

250
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,010
I didn't kill her.

251
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,640
Why should I compensate her?

252
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,240
Do you have any evidence

253
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,990
to prove what you said?

254
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:17,850
No.

255
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,380
I can't remember.

256
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,750
You just said

257
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,240
you went out at 1 p.m.

258
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,530
But there's no surveillance footage of it.

259
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,930
How can you explain that?

260
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,600
How did you leave?

261
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,520
The place where we live,

262
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,800
the urban villages on the edge of the city

263
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:37,210
are mostly illegal buildings.

264
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,520
They may be demolished at any time.

265
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,460
How could there be surveillance footage?

266
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,320
Wang Dafu.

267
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,240
Lawsuits are all about evidence.

268
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,990
If you say you didn't kill anyone,

269
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,830
you have to

270
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,270
find evidence that you didn't kill anyone.

271
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,770
You can think about it again.

272
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,160
If you think of anything,

273
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,400
tell us in time.

274
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,660
-Yes. Yes.
-Seize your time.

275
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,600
Well,

276
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,720
Well, counsels, please don't go.

277
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,850
I'm innocent.

278
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,880
No, don't go, counsels.

279
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,260
Luo Yingzi, what do you mean?

280
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,040
What I said to you on the way was all in vain.

281
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,550
Mr. Han, let me explain.

282
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,550
Explain what?

283
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,450
Do you know what you're doing is very dangerous?

284
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:28,190
He's in prison now.

285
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:30,520
What's in it for him if he lies?

286
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,300
Mr. Han,

287
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,430
I’ve studied this case carefully.

288
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:37,010
At first glance, it seems to form a chain of evidence.

289
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,280
But after thinking about it carefully

290
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,720
and listening to what Wang Dafu said,

291
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
I don't think

292
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,390
there's anything wrong with this case.

293
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,510
We know Wang Dafu

294
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,580
can't prove

295
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,060
when he went out or came in.

296
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:47,190
But now the police

297
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,750
can't find the surveillance footage of him going in and out, right?

298
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,830
So is it possible

299
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,700
that Wang Dafu is telling the truth?

300
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,110
And Wang Dafu's neighbors said

301
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,510
they heard them quarrel just after noon.

302
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,640
He said he left at 1 p.m.

303
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,850
He called the police at 7 p.m.

304
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:02,900
During these five or six hours,

305
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,350
evevrything Wang Dafu and Sun Xiaoe said

306
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,480
could have happened in their home.

307
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,940
Get in.

308
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,350
All I said is right.

309
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes. Right.

310
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:18,110
Open the door!

311
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:20,450
Sorry. I'm sorry.

312
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:37,360
I haven't slept well for several days.

313
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,650
I tell you that the clients

00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:39,810
are getting smarter and smarter,

315
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,930
so it's hard to make money from them.

316
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,260
My target has appeared,

00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,930
bye for now.

Are you in our firm?

336
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,300
It's really unfortunate.

It's okay. It's my fault.

I wanted to meet you at your convenience.

intentional homicide case,

346
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:14,400
The victim's family has decided

347
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,760
to give up all civil claims for damages.

348
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,060

I'm sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

How about this?

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,040
I'll ask my assistant

Weren't you supposed to see Mr. Chen?

Remember.

We can't let his client

give up the claim for compensation.

Mr. Han, this Liu Dahuai...

I don't know anything about this case.

366

It's just an intentional homicide case.

But Liu Dahuai is rich.

He paid his representatives a lot.

If Mr. Chen' s client

370
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,970
gives up the claim for compensation and insists on seeking justice,

371
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,390
it'll be hard for us to explain to Liu's family.

372
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,290

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,650
No worries. It's easy.

377
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,680
Oh yes, he's also in charge of Wang Dafu's case.

378
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:32,990
This man.

379
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:34,370
He doesn't get up early without profit.

380
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,400
He was assigned to Wang Dafu's case.

381
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm sure he wouldn't spend much time on it.

382
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,460
He must care about Liu Dahuai's case.

383
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,260
So you must coax him.

384
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,140
Understand?

385
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,040
Go now.

386
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,190
Mr. Han,

387
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,400
this... this is for you.

388
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,040
Okay.

389
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,570
Hurry up, hurry up.

390
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:47,900
Okay.

391
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,330
Come in.

392
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,330
Hello. Mr. Chen.

393
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,050
Hello.

394
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,600
Mr. Han is busy.

395
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,830
What brings you here?

396
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,359
Isn't it that enemies always meet?

397
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,280
Because of you,

398
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,910
I have to pay more for my car insurance next year, you know?

399
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:11,670
You deserve it.

400
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,839
You hit me first.

401
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,010
But then you blocked my car on purpose.

402
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,410
If you don't offend me, I won't offend you.

403
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,470
Alright, let's get down to business.

404
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,200
My name is Chen Shuo.

405
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,290
How should I address the beautiful lady?

406
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,550
Don't be so frivolous.

407
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,660
I'm Luo Yingzi.

408
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:27,390
What brings you here today?

409
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,840
Liu Dahuai' s case?

410
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,000
Or Wang Dafu' s case?

411
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,130
Wang Dafu' s case.

412
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,770
Han Zhitong is in the firm, right?

413
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,440
Didn't you come back together?

414
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,360
I saw it.

415
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,840
Is he avoiding me on purpose?

416
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,830
I have no choice.

417
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,080
I have to bait him with Liu Dahuai's case.

418
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,040
You're the victim's civil litigator.

419
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,150
Do you think there are any doubts about this case?

420
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,830
How would I know?

421
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,850
Isn't there a prosecutor for the criminal part?

422
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,150
The reason I came here is to ask

423
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,040
if Wang Dafu could pay more for damages.

424
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,410
You're a lawyer.

425
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,750
You don't even think about

426
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,530
if there are any doubts about this case.

427
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,050
You only think about money first.

428
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,260
What else?

429
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,950
It has nothing to do with me.

430
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,800
I'm in charge of the civil part.

431
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:05,930
If you have doubts, go to the police and the prosecutor.

432
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,400
Last time I asked Mr. Han

433
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,610
for 500,000 yuan.

434
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,420
He didn't agree.

435
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,490
I'm in charge today.

436
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,690
Beautiful lady, 400,000 yuan.

437
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,490
Can we settle it at 400,000 yuan?

438
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,020
What do you mean it has nothing to do with you?

439
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,260
What if

440
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,150
my client didn't kill her?

441
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,230
Why should my client compensate your client?

442
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:21,870
So what?

443
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,870
If you think there's something suspicious,

444
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,710
you need to do what the police do.

445
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,120
Are you going to investigate the case?

446
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,080
I really think

447
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,310
there's reasonable doubt in this case.

448
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,690
You're just starting out, aren't you?

449
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,490
What's wrong?

450
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,270
I was just qualified as a pupil.

451
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,060
This is my first case. Any problem?

452
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,710
I see.

453
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,540
No problem.

454
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,620
Silly lady.

455
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,600
What are you talking about? Show some respect.

456
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,840
Beauty.

457
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,380
Call me Luo Yingzi.

458
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,170
Okay.

459
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,600
Ms. Luo, dear new comer,

460
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,620
I must be a few years older than you.

461
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,230
So I give you a piece of advice.

462
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,150
We have to be cautious in criminal cases.

463
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,270
Words like reasonable doubt...

464
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,950
Don't say it so easily.

465
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,510
I've studied the case,

466
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,800
especially the dossier.

467
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,930
I read it carefully.

468
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,250
Basic facts are clear.

469
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,390
The basic evidence is solid,

470
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:04,140
so there's no problem.

471
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,120
As lawyers of both sides,

472
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,130
here's what we can do:

473
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,650
you urge them to pay more for damages,

474
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,270
and I'll ask the victim's family

475
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,230
to write a letter of understanding as soon as possible

476
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,560
to keep Wang Dafu alive.

477
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,730
Then the case can be closed.

478
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,750
The lawyer's duty has been fulfilled.

479
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,230
What do you mean by basic?

480
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,490
Basic facts are clear.

481
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,900
The basic evidence is solid.

482
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,100
He can be basically sentenced to death.

483
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:25,910
Are you so careless about lives and cases?

484
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,180
But what else do you want?

485
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,410
Yes, that's it.

486
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,090
What's your attitude?

487
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:37,180
What do you mean?

488
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,280
Are you going to overturn the case?

489
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,430
If my client didn't kill the person,

490
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,340
why can't I overturn it?

491
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,650
Beauty, it's impossible.

492
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,950
We won't know until we try.

493
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,830
What are you looking for in a legal aid case offering only several hundred yuan?

494
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,290
Of course people like you can't understand.

495
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,070
You're really funny.

496
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,000
You're a lawyer.

497
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,080
When we talk about law,

498
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,240
you tell me about conscience.

499
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,370
You're really cute.

500
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:54,860
Fine.

501
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,210
Then I'll see

502
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,020
how much your conscience is worth.

503
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
What can your conscience leave you?

504
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,150
In your law firm,

505
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,050
your mentor Han Zhitong is like this.

506
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:04,310
You are also like this.

507
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,710
What do you mean?

508
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,540
How arrogant!

509
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,330
How annoying!

510
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,770
I didn't argue well.

511
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,930
Wait and see.

512
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,120
I should have just scolded him.

513
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,430
I'm so mad.

514
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,930
You're back.

515
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,370
Dinner is ready. Wash your hands and eat.

516
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:51,840
Okay.

517
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,260
It's troublesome. Here.

518
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,660
You can eat now.

519
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,470

529
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,960
Yingzi, don't throw it away.

If you don't want it, I'll send it back to my hometown.

531
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:34,680
Okay?

00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,840

Nothing suspicious.

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,250
The detention center called to say

563
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,650
Wang Dafu needs to see us.

564
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,140
Did the detention center make the call?

565
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,270
Yes, when we went there yesterday,

566
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,470
I gave them my number.

567
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,190
Qiu Hua.

568
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,790
Qiu Hua, come in.

569
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,350
I have something to tell you.

570
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,610
You go with Luo Yingzi.

571
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,110
Remember.

572
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,510
You can only listen to him.

573
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,640
Don't say anything.

574
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:29,920
Okay.

575
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:38,870
Sorry for troubling you.

576
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,660
It's okay.

577
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,970
But it's useless for us to go there.

578
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,670
Why?

579
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,140
Pupils

580
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,960
can't meet clients alone.

581
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,220
The detention center won't let us in.

582
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,670
Then, why did Mr. Han ask us to go?

583
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,750
He's afraid of trouble.

584
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,890
We'll meet the client only once before trial.

585
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,290
It'll be a failure and we'll soon come back.

586
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:01,600
Wait.

587
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,680
Wait, Ms. Qiu.

588
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,320
Mr. Han,

589
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:14,830
I'm afraid you have to come here in person.

590
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,200
Pupils can't meet clients alone.

591
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,670
Just come back if you can't meet him.

592
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,570
We've already been there.

593
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:20,850
You'd better come.

594
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,540
Maybe we'll see him only this time before trial.

595
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:24,820
I'm busy right now.

596
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,840
So should I tell them

597
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:30,900
the suspect wants to meet the lawyer,

598
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,190
but the lawyer refuses to come?

599
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:33,950
The lawyers know that pupils can't meet clients alone.

600
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,620
I'll call you back.

601
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,900
But he still sends a pupil there.

602
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,760
Luo Yingzi.

603
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,610
You've grown up.

604
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,280
I'll drive.

605
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,810
We'll be back soon.

606
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,320
Ms. Qiu.

607
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,190
Mr. Han, so I don't need to go.

608
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,270
Let's go together.

609
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:05,350
Let's go, Ms. Qiu.

610
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,480
You wait here.

611
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,990
[Meeting Room]

612
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,050
I remember one thing.

613
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,850
When I went out,

614
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,480
I ran into my next-door neighbor, Niu.

615
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,240
He and I are quite close.

616
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
He was an illegal taxi driver.

617
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,050
When his child was sick,

618
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,300
I gave him 100 yuan.

619
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,160
So when Niu saw me, he said

620
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,450
he could give me a ride.

621
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,030
Okay.

622
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:42,850
Wang.

623
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,600
What happened to your face?

624
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,000
A long story.

625
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,500
Let's go. Go.

626
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,650
Okay.

627
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,180
Wang, fasten your seat belt.

628
00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:57,870
Later I thought

629
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:01,130
my presence in the car would affect his business.

630
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:03,650
So I lied.

631
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,550
I said I had arrived

632
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,780
and I got off early.

633
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,990
After getting off,

634
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,850
I was on the way to my wife's house.

635
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,640
There was a dump truck on the road.

636
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,750
Someone was fixing the truck underneath it.

637
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:17,710
When I passed by,

638
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,310
he asked me to get him a spanner.

639
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,070
So I gave him a favor.

640
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Is this it?

641
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:22,920
Yes.

642
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,990
Okay, thank you.

643
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,980
At that time,

644
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,790
I didn't know

645
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,800
how to explain the injury on my face to my wife.

646
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,230
I was pondering on one side

647
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,720
and on the other,

648
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,830
I just chatted with him casually.

649
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:39,070
It should be around 2 p.m at that time.

650
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:40,390
That...

651
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,570
The car mechanic.

652
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,220
He can help me prove where I was then.

653
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,290
What's his name?

654
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,530
Where is he from?

655
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,170
I don't know.

656
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,210
He's just a stranger I bumped into.

657
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,150
I didn't ask.

658
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,560
What about the license plate number?

659
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,600
I really didn't notice it.

660
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,960
After he came out,

661
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:01,560
we exchanged cigarettes

662
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,430
and had a chat.

663
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,460
Then I left.

664
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,910
I really didn't notice the plate number.

665
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,390
Well...

666
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,260
Niu can testify for you.

667
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,400
That's why I'm unlucky.

668
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,590
When I went home,

669
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:16,090
I saw a bunch of people surrounding Niu's house.

670
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,330
So I went up and asked.

671
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,140
That's when I found out that Niu,

672
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:21,220
who drove an illegal car,

673
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,510
happened to run into people checking illegal taxis that afternoon.

674
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,710
He drove away.

675
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,450
In a moment of inattention,

676
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,460
he and his car

677
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,800
flipped off the bridge

678
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,710
and into the ditch.

679
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,190
So...

680
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,320
He was drowned.

681
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,060
Wang Dafu.

682
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:36,950
Anything else?

683
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,350
Well...

684
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
When I left my wife's house,

685
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:43,520
it was around 4:00 p.m.

686
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,930
I heard

687
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,230
someone playing the woodwinds on the side of the road down the mountain.

688
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:49,150
It was an old song

689
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,710
called "Lift the Bridal Sedan".

690
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,400
Did you see who was playing it?

691
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:57,690
No.

692
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,920
It was quite far away.

693
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,740
Is there anything else?

694
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,270
And my wife.

695
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,920
My wife...

696
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,180
She should be able to hear

697
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,200
the that sound as well.

698
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,890
You can ask my wife.

699
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,010
Wang Dafu.

700
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,800
Wang Dafu.

701
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,450
The victim proposed

702
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,870
if your family

703
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:17,820
would offer 500,000 yuan,

704
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:21,670
the victim's family can submit a letter of understanding.

705
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:23,870
With this letter,

706
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,690
there's a higher chance that you won't be sentenced to death.

707
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:28,860
Can your family pay the money?

708
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,320
Well, Mr. Han...

709
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,650
I didn't kill her.

710
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:34,290
Why should I compensate her?

711
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,610
Okay.

712
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,540
I see.

713
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:38,600
No.

714
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,630
This thing.

715
00:29:41,310 --> 00:29:43,070
We've already informed you of that.

716
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:43,960
Yes. Yes. Yes.

717
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,230
No.

718
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,000
No.

719
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,550
Let's go.

720
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:48,330
This...

721
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,440
Wait, why? Why do you leave again?

722
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,990
Wait, Mr. Han.

723
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,570
Mr. Han. I really didn't kill this person.

724
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,900
Wait, Ms. Luo, you can look into this matter,

725
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,090
and it will become clear.

726
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,670
I really didn't kill this person.

727
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:01,790
I'm innocent.

728
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,080
I need to meet a client.

729
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,700
You two go back by yourselves.

730
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,160
Mr. Han,

731
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,560
I still want to talk to you.

732
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,100
Do you think we can

733
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,820
ask Wang Dafu's wife

734
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:19,070
if she heard the music?

735
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,380
Why wouldn't you just listen to me?

736
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,280
I...

737
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Qiu Hua, tell her.

738
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:25,250
Don't ask her.

739
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:27,310
If you do, she'll definitely say yes.

740
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,770
What should we do?

741
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,130
We have no choice.

742
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,260
There's nothing to defend about this case.

743
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,440
Of course, you can raise your doubts.

744
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,900
The court won't accept it.

745
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,280
I'll say this again:

746
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,070
in this case,

747
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,710
he will be lucky enough

748
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,040
not to be executed immediately, you know?

749
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,650
Okay, you can go back.

750
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,040
Ms. Qiu.

751
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,950
Listen to him. Is this what a lawyer should do?

752
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,470
Mr. Han has always been a lawyer like this.

753
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,510
But shouldn't we

754
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,910
be responsible for the interest of the client?

755
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,720
He's responsible enough

756
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,120
to come with you today.

757
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,260
Let's go.

758
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,540
He's struggling in desperation,

759
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:30,060
trying to use his lawyers to buy him time

760
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,680
as long as possible.

761
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,470
What he said

762
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:37,580
shouldn't be mentioned in the statement of defense.

763
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:40,710
The trial is coming up.

764
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,240
Next Monday,

765
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,360
you'll write up that defense and give it to me.

766
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,600
Six days left. Go.

767
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,280
Mr. Han,

768
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,500
it's not that I'm stubborn.

769
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,800
I just feel that

770
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,950
Wang Dafu doesn't seem to be lying to us.

771
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,650
What kind of lies can't he tell?

772
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,690
He insisted on saying these unreliable things.

773
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,740
Doesn't he know

774
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,950
it's useless if we can't prove it?

775
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,150
When people are desperate,

776
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,900
they can come up with any idea.

777
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,680
If he says something reliable,

778
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,810
we find it doesn't happen.

779
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,630
He knew we couldn't find it out.

780
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:12,550
If we believe him, we will ask for an extension

781
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,390
and keep investigating.

782
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:15,120
Then his goal will be achieved.

783
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,390
There are plenty of ways for a client

784
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,790
to fool the lawyer.

785
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,900
Learn the lesson.

786
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:26,100
Mr. Han.

787
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,480
Well,

788
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,590
you just mentioned there's still a week left.

789
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,920
Why don't you let me

790
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,320
use this week to investigate?

791
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,720
You're so stubborn.

792
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,160
I just feel uneasy.

793
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,540
I don't think he's lying to us.

794
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:41,640
Fine.

795
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,930
Go ahead if you want to.

796
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,780
No.

797
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,310
Not a week.

798
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,240
Only six days.

799
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,090
No.

800
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,960
You have to leave me one more day

801
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:50,540
to revise the defense you wrote.

802
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,980
So you only have five days.

803
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,710
Understand?

804
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,640
Thank you, Mr. Han.

805
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,330
Are you still investigating?

806
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,240
Yes.

807
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:09,340
A woodwind player.

808
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,290
A dump truck.

809
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,330
Where can I find it?

810
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,590
Hello.

811
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,450
Hello.

812
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,449
I can't afford to take on cases on my own right now.

813
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:17,280
Ms. Qiu, I need to...

814
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,330
I need to talk to you.

815
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,389
Can you come out?

816
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,679
Mom, I am busy now.

817
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,840
I'll call you later.

818
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,620
What's wrong?

819
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:30,580
What happened?

820
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,239
Ms. Qiu.

821
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,929
Something happened to me.

822
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:35,150
What's wrong?

823
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:39,050
I don't know who I can ask for help.

824
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,739
I thought of you.

825
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,670
Can you help me?

826
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Go ahead.

827
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,090
To put it simply,

828
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,800
my husband and a woman I know

829
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:51,929
sneaked off together.

830
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,820
They went to America together.

831
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,320
Didn't you tell us you're divorced?

832
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,860
Yes.

833
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,690
I did file for a divorce.

834
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,740
But I just found out

835
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,270
he borrowed money from others.

836
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,210
The creditor has called me for repayment.

837
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,340
Who is the creditor?

838
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,480
It's a quick loan. A personal loan.

839
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,660
They told me

840
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,190
he's borrowed hundreds of thousands yuan before

841
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,820
and he's been paying back the interest.

842
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,900
Then he ran away

843
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,770
and never paid it back.

844
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,580
So it's already gone to 800,000 yuan in a few days.

845
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,910
The High Court of Justice has an interpretation of Article 24 of the Marriage Act.

846
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,180
Did you know that?

847
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,370
The creditors

848
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,500
claiming rights to debts

849
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,630
incurred by one of the spouses in his or her personal name

850
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,870
during the marriage

851
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,230
are treated as joint debts of the spouses.

852
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,270
However, it doesn't work if one of the spouses can prove that the creditor

853
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,760
and the debtor have explicitly agreed that it is a personal debt

854
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,470
or can prove that it is one of the cases

855
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:50,650
stipulated in the third paragraph of Article 19 of the Marriage Law.

856
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,520
In other words,

857
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,990
if the spouses have agreed that

858
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:57,350
the property acquired during the marriage will be owned by each of them,

859
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,690
the debts incurred by one of the spouses,

860
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,550
if a third party is aware of the agreement,

861
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:04,950
will be settled with the property owned by one of the spouses.

862
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,110
There must be no such agreement between you two.

863
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,670
Even if there is,

864
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,550
he would say he didn't know this agreement.

865
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,150
Right?

866
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,940
How did I know

867
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,980
I had to guard against my husband like thieves when I married him?

868
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,470
Do you have money to pay the debts now?

869
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,600
Private loans are changing every day.

870
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,550
No.

871
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,250
He has transferred all the money.

872
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,290
What do you need me to do for you?

873
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,990
Ms. Qiu,

874
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:38,960
right now,

875
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,500
the most urgent thing for me is

876
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,460
to solve the problems about these debts.

877
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,200
But I don't want to lose

878
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,040
Wang Dafu's case.

879
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,520
But I really have no time.

880
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,390
Because Mr. Han said

881
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,010
he'll only give me five days.

882
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,580
Ms. Qiu, can you do the work for me?

883
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,820
I just came to this law firm.

884
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,370
I'm not familiar with anyone.

885
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,540
You're the only one who knows something about this case.

886
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,140
If you are willing to help me,

887
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,670
I’ll tell Mr. Han

888
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,960
that we're doing this case together.

889
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,300
Your own matters are so urgent.

890
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,830
Are you still thinking about Wang Dafu's case?

891
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:14,910
If we can't find

892
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:16,950
the woodwind player and the truck

893
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,570
that Wang Dafu mentioned in 5 days,

894
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,780
I'll give up then.

895
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,550
Can you do it, Ms. Qiu?

896
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,480
Sure.

897
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,690
But I have one condition.

898
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:29,680
Go ahead.

899
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,160
You've filed for a divorce, right?

900
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,720
Yes.

901
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,940
Did you hire a lawyer?

902
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,950
No.

903
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:37,390
No matter who you hire in the future,

904
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:38,470
let me join you,

905
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,260
okay?

906
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,100
But Ms. Qiu, I have to tell the truth.

907
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,820
I have no money.

908
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,430
What I need is the case.

909
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,190
Okay.

910
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,010
Deal.

911
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:53,490
The two things Wang Dafu mentioned,

912
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:54,750
I will try to find them.

913
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,120
I think you should focus

914
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,720
on your own matters.

915
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,210
The current judicial explanation is not good for you.

916
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,770
You should prepare yourself for the worst.

917
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,110
Anyway, I only have this one life.

918
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,500
Where there's a will, there's a way.

919
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,400
Thank you, Ms. Qiu.

920
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,800
But how are you going to apply for leave from Mr. Han?

921
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,820
Don't worry about that.

922
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,950
This is my business.

923
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,000
I'm leaving.

924
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,240
You're not going back?

925
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,710
You go in first.

926
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,990
I want to take a breath.

927
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,150
Don't worry.

928
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,850
Don't cry. Don't cry.

929
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,310
Don't cry.

930
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,530
Did Liu Ming borrow private loans outside?

931
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,940
What are you doing here again?

932
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,250
Didn't you say you wouldn't disown us any more?

933
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,260
Did Liu Ming borrow private loans outside?

934
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,950
Why did he do this to me?

935
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,390
Why did he plot against me?

936
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:11,850
Ask him about his affairs.

937
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:13,760
We don't know.

938
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,870
Let me ask you.

939
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,390
How much did he borrow?

940
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,290
I don't know.

941
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,900
Dad, tell me

942
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,950
how much he borrowed.

943
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,870
Don't ask him.

944
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,220
He doesn't know either.

945
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,990
Then give me his phone number.

946
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:29,510
I'll contact him.

947
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:31,350
I don't have his number.

948
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,370
He's your son.

949
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,470
How can you not have his phone number?

950
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,420
If you don't tell me,

951
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,850
I can only give your contact information

952
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:41,170
to the debt collectors.

953
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,580
Anyway, I've never seen the money

954
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,880
Liu Ming borrowed from outside.

955
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,230
He didn't bring a penny home.

956
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,290
I can't pay it back.

957
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,920
Even if Liu Ming borrowed money,

958
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,200
he did it for you.

959
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:50,940
For me?

960
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
For what?

961
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,520
When did I see the money he borrowed?

962
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,320
Liu Ming started his company for you, right?

963
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,140
Liu Ming never gambles or patronizes prostitutes.

964
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,630
He borrowed money for the company

965
00:39:58,630 --> 00:39:59,830
and your family.

966
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,810
Why don't you speak with a conscience?

967
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:02,590
He doesn't gamble or patronize prostitutes.

968
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,390
When did he find a woman outside?

969
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,170
When did he bring

970
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,780
the money he earned home?

971
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,680
Didn't the family

972
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,190
spend my salary?

973
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,830
Don't tell us that.

974
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:13,180
Tell the debt collector.

975
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:13,730
What?

976
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,930
The debt collector has called me

977
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,260
They're already asking for money.

978
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,000
If you don't tell me,

979
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,560
this is the only place they can come.

980
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,940
You are the ones who will be in trouble at last.

981
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:21,880
I know you're trying to protect yourselves,

982
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:22,590
but you should also tell me

983
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,790
how much he borrowed outside

984
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,660
and from whom.

985
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,760
I can know what's going on.

986
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,360
I know how to redeem the loss.

987
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,630
We don't know about your affairs.

988
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,020
You don't have any regrets, right?

989
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,060
Regret what?

990
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,360
What I regret the most is that

991
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,700
Liu Ming found a jinx like you.

992
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,740
If it weren’t for you,

993
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,670
he wouldn't have left his family and gone abroad.

994
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,740
Find him abroad if you can.

995
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,220
Go find him.

996
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:53,920
Remember what you said today.

997
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,160
Hello, who is it?

998
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,430
Ms. Luo Yingzi?

999
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,200
Let me remind you again.

1000
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,380
Your husband, Liu Ming, has been overdue on his loan with us

1001
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,580
for three months now.

1002
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,830
The 800,000 yuan I told you about.

1003
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,180
We'll check it again.

1004
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,750
Please pay us back as soon as possible.

1005
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,350
Get lost!

1006
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,500
Whoever lent you the money, ask them for it.

1007
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,360
Liu Ming has run away.

1008
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,730
Ran away. Did you hear that?

1009
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,330
That human scum has run away.

1010
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,130
Sir, I want to ask you something.

1011
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,780
Are you from the village ahead?

1012
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,350
Yes.

1013
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,110
Do you know in July last year

1014
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,850
if anyone had a wedding?

1015
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,000
I don't know.

1016
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,160
Really?

1017
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:56,890
No.

1018
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,120
Is there a drum and music band nearby?

1019
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,050
I'd like to find a woodwind player.

1020
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,610
Hello, Ms. Qiu.

1021
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,120
Have you found any clues?

1022
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,040
Hey, Luo Yingzi.

1023
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,680
No.

1024
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:18,770
I'm looking for it.

1025
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,230
I just thought of you out of the blue.

1026
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:21,350
I want to remind you.

1027
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:22,810
I don't know if it'll work.

1028
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,880
Tell me. Go ahead.

1029
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,800
Those private loan companies

1030
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,780
would do anything

1031
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,540
for collecting the debts.

1032
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,540
So you must not

1033
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,020
let them go to the law firm.

1034
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,680
If you can't reach your husband now,

1035
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,210
I suggest you

1036
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,030
figure out the situation of those companies first

1037
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,270
and see if there's anything

1038
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,200
you can use against them, legally.

1039
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,850
Ms. Qiu.

1040
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,340
I do think so.

1041
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,370
Well,

1042
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,390
I've checked the company online.

1043
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,550
They have an ugly record.

1044
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,480
I've also read a new report

1045
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,740
about them sending gangsters

1046
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,020
to collect debts.

1047
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,900
They've caused some serious trouble.
