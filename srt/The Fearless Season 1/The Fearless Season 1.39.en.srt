[Episode 39]

4
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,990
If they have to sacrifice me to make the connection,

5
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:36,080
then so be it.

6
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,500
I'm doing better than other kids, anyway.

7
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,030
If I had no moral obligation whatsoever,

8
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,110
I would be another Wen Li,

9
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,840
desperately seizing anything good for me

10
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,390
within my reach.

11
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,910
Then, turn to the next target

12
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,470
without hesitation.

13
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,460
Not me.

14
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,009
I can't do that.

15
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,710
What I can do is

16
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,410
not go back to the previous environment,

17
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,190
live independently,

18
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,440
and do whatever I can to support them.

19
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,810
Does your sacrifice

20
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,740
also include your love?

21
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,920
Forget about love.

22
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,270
It's simply a practical necessity.

23
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,390
Anyway, for me right now,

24
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,590
Zhang Quanquan should be my top choice.

25
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,230
I think

26
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:43,800
if you even choose love so rationally,

27
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,310
it's too...

28
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,410
Anyway, you don't have to do that.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,920
You have already left there,

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,450
and now you're getting better and better.

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,070
You deserve someone better.

32
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,490
I have no choice.

Human beings are the summation of all social relations.

34
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you done already?

35
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,400
It doesn't need to take long.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,480
Come on.

37
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,579
I've made your bed for you.

38
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,840

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
Are you aware of that?

42
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,380
Are you kidding me?

43
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,590
The bystander knows.

44

I saw it clearly.

45
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,920
So, is he a sadist?

46
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:08,990
He loves me and sent me to jail.

47
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:13,270
I don't think he has anything to do with that matter.

48
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:15,820
Even if there is, it's just a coincidence.

49
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,170
Otherwise, he wouldn't have

50
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,980
given us the CCTV footage.

Everything is under control.

You must keep an eye on her.

63
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:18,110
Don't let her escape so easily.

64
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,720
I have a feeling.

65
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,040
I think

66
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,150
that if we can't catch her this time,

67
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,700
we may never find her again.

We listened to her childhood stories.

74
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,230
She must have lived a very miserable life when she was young,

75
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,090

I hope you can put down your work,

81
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,540
keep an eye on her in Shanghai,

82
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,140
and wait for me to come there.

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,480

Thank you. Bye.

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:25,790
Sir,

94
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,850
I'm not going to Pudong Airport.

95
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,050
Turn around at the next traffic light intersection and go back to the hotel.

96
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,760
Do you believe that some people are born with criminal personalities?

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,270
But I don't think Wen Li is.

98
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,600
Every person who's worked their way up from the bottom

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,070
goes through the same struggles as her,

100
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,900
and some of them have even endured more hardships than her.

101
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,909
But why did she become so vicious?

102
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,180
I think

103
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,510
maybe it's because other people

104
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,030
can feel more or less love

105
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,550
from society or from others,

106
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,010
while she never feels loved by others

107
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,410
except for her mother.

108
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,110
No.

109
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:18,530
You helped her.

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,160
And those men who were her prey

111
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,240
loved her and gave her their love.

112
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,960
Could it be that she lost her empathy

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,620
when she met me and my husband?

114
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,840
Anyway, I feel sorry for her now.

115
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,230
How pitiful and horrible it is for a person

116
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,500
to lose the ability to feel love.

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,810
You still know that?

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,140
What?

119
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,110
It's pitiful to lose the ability to feel love.

120
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,500

122
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,790
Can't you feel it?

123
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,290
Not even a bit?

124
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,280
I can only feel money now.

125
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,030
And I'm seriously short on sleep.

126
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,090
I want to take a nap.

127
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,410
How did you know that we came to Shanghai?

128
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,590
How could you not come when Wen Li is in Shanghai?

129
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:24,030
Besides,

130
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,960
I'll know once I check the flights.

131
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,460
You feel so full of yourself.

132
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,220
Is she that important to me?

133
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,070
I don't know if she's that important to you,

134
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,730
but I'm very important to you.

135
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,950
Who gave you the right to talk nonsense?

136
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,210
Give me your suitcase.

137
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,330
You have a car in Shanghai?

138
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,390
It's rented.

139
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,930
Thank you.

140
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,480
Look at you two.

141
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,610
I told you to fly first class to watch me fight.

142
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,470
You wouldn't listen to me.

143
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,900
You have to fly coach and exhaust yourselves.

144
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,740
Why bother?

145
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,870
Save money for me?

146
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,350
No need.

147
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,880
I make a ton of money. I'll reimburse you for the plane tickets.

148
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,280
How's it going over here?

149
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,920
I told you.

150
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,990
We didn't need to bring this to court.

151
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,230
Just two meetings.

152
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,170
Two meetings,

153
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,310
and I got her to transfer the 31 million yuan

154
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,370
to Ms. Xiao's account.

155
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,640
Am I awesome?

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,480
You found the account she used to transfer the money?

157
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,410
I looked into it.

158
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,630
It's just an account from a third party.

159
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,590
It has no connection to Wen Li,

160
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,950
and there is only one bank transaction.

161
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:47,620
It must be an account that is used to transfer money.

162
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,880
Do you hear that, Qiu Hua?

163
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,760
How cunning.

164
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,430
What is she doing now?

165
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:55,510
On one hand, she has been encouraging Ding Qiwei

166
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,950
to take over the company's sales department.

167
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,430
However, she didn't expect

168
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,490
that his father would want

169
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,090
to groom his son to take over the firm,

170
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,470
yet he wouldn't give it to his son so easily.

171
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,310
On the other hand,

172
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,770
she always wanted to sign the sales agency contract

173
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,560
with Ding Qiwei's father.

174
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,590
But his father won't budge.

175
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,830
So she's in a dilemma now.

176
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,170
One step forward,

177
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:17,890
and she doesn't know if she can take Ding Qiwei's father.

178
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,910
If she takes a step back,

179
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,670
she doesn't want to make a losing deal.

180
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,830
After all, she has lost

181
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,320
31 million yuan.

182
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,590
Anyway,

183
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,860
even if she can't take Ding Qiwei's father,

184
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,390
she has Ding Qiwei wrapped around her finger.

185
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,160
This hotel is actually quite nice.

186
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,870
Most importantly, Wen Li lives in the hotel across the street.

187
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,510
You can see her in your room.

188
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,990
I've arranged everything in the room.

189
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:50,750
I'll go upstairs with you later

190
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,340
-and explain to you in detail.
-No need.

191
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,540
Thank you, Chen Shuo.

192
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,510
We can handle it ourselves from here.

193
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,670
Shall we take a break?

194
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,370
Sure.

195
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,010
Okay.

196
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,480
We'll contact you tomorrow

197
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,350
and discuss the next strategy.

198
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:07,830
Fine.

199
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,190
Okay.

200
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,820
[Ding Qiwei]

201
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,820
Hello, Qiwei.

202
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:58,560
Wen Li.

203
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,940
I got a text from the bank.

204
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,000
You transferred 2 million yuan to me?

205
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,830
Yes.

206
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:06,560
Didn't we agree

207
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:07,880
that I gave you some startup funds?

208
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,440
Wen Li!

209
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,130
What should I say?

210
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,710
I'm so lucky.

211
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,400
I finally met you

212
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,970
during my pursuit of art.

213
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,540
Where are you now? I want to see you.

214
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,540
Now?

215
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,570
It's getting late.

216
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,830
Why don't we meet another time?

217
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,580
No.

218
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,630
I'm so excited now.

219
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,290
I need to see you now.

220
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,580
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,470
I haven't been feeling well, both physically and emotionally, lately.

222
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,400
I was feeling incredibly lonely in my apartment,

223
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,660
so I moved to a hotel.

224
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,870
Which hotel are you staying at?

225
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,530
Can you send me your location?

226
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,600
Okay.

227
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,810
I'll send it to you now.

228
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,680
Okay, I'll be right there.

229
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:36,700
Wen Li.

230
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,080
Is it too late...

231
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,840
How about...

232
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,800
He's coming.

233
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,030
Beauties, how did you sleep?

234
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,880
Unscrupulous Chen.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,350
Let's get down to business.

236
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,550
Tell me what you know.

237
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,650
Okay, let me know if you have any news.

238
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,180
I've been busy with your business all morning.

239
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,690
You didn't even say something nice to me first.

240
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,890
So straightforward.

241
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:25,130
Am I right, Ms. Qiu?

242
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:30,190
Aren't you tired of being so uptight?

243
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,050
No.

244
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,690
I feel tired for you.

245
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,980
Wen Li

246
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:42,280
is speeding up her pace.

247
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,180
I met someone last night.

248
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,390
Wen Li spent 30,000 yuan on him.

249
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,030
Wen Li could even spend money on others?

250
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,860
She bought a movie script from him.

251
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,300
You should know

252
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,060
who currently has the script, right?

253
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,860
Ding Qiwei. Who else could it be?

254
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,960
Wen Li...

255
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,290
has turned herself into a screenwriter.

256
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:03,410
For money,

257
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
she really goes to great lengths.

258
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,270
Mr. Chen,

259
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:08,190
didn't you say that Ding Qiwei

260
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,450
is the head of Boshi's sales department?

261
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,310
Then why did Wen Li

262
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,109
still play these little tricks?

263
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,890
Qiwei is just a rich kid.

264
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,829
Ding Zhaoguang knows his son well.

265
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,910
So Qiwei

266
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,790
is the sales director, nominally.

267
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,750
Looks like, Wen Li knows that as well.

268
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,140
She's trying another way.

269
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:26,869
Definitely.

270
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,840
Yingzi and I think

271
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,710
that we should meet Ding Zhaoguang.

272
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,040
Let's be more discreet.

273
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,110
My informant told me

274
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,230
that Ding Qiwei went to his father today

275
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,180
and asked him to transfer himself to Jingbei,

276
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,240
in charge of the branch office there.

277
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,850
Good job, Mr. Chen.

278
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:44,510
No.

279
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,930
Unscrupulous Chen.

280
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,620
You've even planted a mole around him.

281
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,470
Didn't I tell you

282
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,760
that no one can escape me?

283
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,590
Stop there. That one is too much.

284
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,630
You have just taken over the sales department.

285
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:01,890
Why do you suddenly want to go to Jingbei?

286
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:02,790
Dad,

287
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,260
the sales department has Ms. Gu.

288
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,890
Dad,

289
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:10,890
I've been thinking about it at home these days.

290
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,020
I was

291
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,920
well taken care of by everyone.

292
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,880
That's why I can't be independent.

293
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,070
This time,

294
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,720
I want to go to Jingbei alone

295
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,880
to improve myself.

296
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,400
You're in your 30s.

297
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,140
When I was your age,

298
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,390
I'd been working in the business for five or six years.

299
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,300
You should try to take over an office yourself.

300
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,670
But if you go to Jingbei now,

301
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:40,530
I think it’s too big of a place for you.

302
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,430
Why don't you

303
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,510
start by going to a small place first?

304
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,230
By the way,

305
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,070
we just bought a piece of land in Hainan.

306
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,040
No, Dad.

307
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,020
Wait a minute.

308
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:49,480
I think,

309
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,900
with my current abilities,

310
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,380
if you were to ask me to set up a stall and start from scratch,

311
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,310
I think that I...

312
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,880
Right?

313
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:58,040
Uncle Liang

314
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,480
has been in Jingbei for two years.

315
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,180
The foundation is almost done.

316
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,370
If I were to take over that branch office now...

317
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,370
What do you think?

318
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,180
Yes.

319
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:10,350
Yes.

320
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,640
You reminded me well.

321
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,470
That's it.

322
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,080
As you said,

323
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,990
let Uncle Liang go to Hainan first.

324
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,600
You take over his office.

325
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,520
Really?

326
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,020
That's great!

327
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:26,510
Dad, listen.

328
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,230
I’ve been dreaming

329
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,360
of going to Jingbei and managing the office there alone.

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,450
How about this? Dad.

331
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:35,380
I’ll go to Jingbei tomorrow.

332
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,090
Then,

333
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,520
I'll familiarize myself with the company's business over there.

334
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:38,980
After that,

335
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,290
I'll ask Uncle Liang to go to Hainan,

336
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,530
and I'll take over the Jingbei branch from him.

337
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,530
What do you think?

338
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:43,880
Sure.

339
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,000
You've grown up.

340
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,530
You finally know what to do.

341
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,230
By the way,

342
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,020
has that Wen Li...

343
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,350
been coming to you lately?

344
00:19:59,340 --> 00:19:59,890
Yes.

345
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,710
I took over the company's sales department.

346
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,180
She wants to be our sales agent.

347
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,510
We only talked about business a few times.

348
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,390
Be careful.

349
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,500
I don't think that girl is decent.

350
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:15,060
I don't know if she has anything to do

351
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,730
with what happened to your Uncle Sun.

352
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,090
Wasn't she introduced by Uncle Sun?

353
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:22,780
That's why she's so suspicious.

354
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,540
Think about it.

355
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,730
Your Uncle Sun is in prison.

356
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,680
He still sent me a letter asking me to take care of her.

357
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,360
Why would he care so much about her?

358
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,380
Aren't you tired

359
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,820
of being on guard all day?

360
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:36,690
I'm going.

361
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:37,920
Qiwei.

362
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,710
If you don't know how to be wary of others,

363
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,800
you'll end up exhausted.

364
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,190
Look at her,

365
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,340
so antsy.

366
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,580
She must be waiting for Ding Qiwei.

367
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,390
Probably.

368
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,270
If it's true,

369
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,770
I suppose they will do something.

370
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:30,900
Unscrupulous Chen.

371
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,030
Righteous Luo.

372
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:34,520
Another message from my informant.

373
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,730
Ding Zhaoguang agreed to let his son go to Jingbei.

374
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,180
Then it must be Wendy's way of fooling him,

375
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,800
saying that all movie makers are in Jingbei.

376
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,880
Is the branch in Jingbei big?

377
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,810
Is it enough to satisfy Wen Li's appetite?

378
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,210
I've searched for it online.

379
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,600
They've developed two buildings there

380
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,130
worth billions of yuan.

381
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,110
They're developing the third one.

382
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,870
Unscrupulous Chen.

383
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,660
I saw Ding Qiwei.

384
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,590
They're hugging.

385
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,040
Just a few meters away from me.

386
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,680
I can't stand it.

387
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
That’s right.

388
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:16,790
They should set off for Jingbei right away.

389
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,590
I think we should meet Ding Zhaoguang.

390
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,240
Mr. Ding.

391
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,420
Come in.

392
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,530
Please.

393
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,130
Thank you.

394
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:45,760
-Mr. Ding. We meet again.
-You’re here.

395
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,490
Sorry to bother you.

396
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,690
Let me introduce you.

397
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,110
This is Mrs. Luo.

398
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,030
Hello, Mr. Ding.

399
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:50,430
Hello.

400
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,060
This is Ms. Qiu.

401
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,540
Hello.

402
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:51,960
Hello.

403
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,990
We're here today

404
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:57,710
to talk about Wen Li and your son.

405
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,900
Wen Li?

406
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,230
That woman who has been coming to my company frequently?

407
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:02,830
Yes.

408
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:04,870
What's going on between her and my son?

409
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,350
As we speak, your son

410
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,970
has arrived in Jingbei, accompanied by Wen Li.

411
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,630
Here.

412
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,460
Uncle Liang!

413
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,360
Uncle Liang.

414
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,810
Qiwei.

415
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,810
I haven't seen you in months.

416
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,310
You seem to have grown taller.

417
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,400
Don't say that.

418
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,910
I won't grow younger.

419
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,710
Let me introduce you, Uncle Liang.

420
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:42,510
This is Wen Li.

421
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,630
He's my business partner.

422
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,570
[General Manager of Boshi Group Jingbei Branch, Liang Weidong]

423
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,700
Nice to meet you.

424
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,560
Partner?

425
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,630
Are you also in the real estate industry?

426
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,360
Uncle Liang.

427
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,170
She's my partner in making movies.

428
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:50,840
She is a scriptwriter.

429
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
I'm the director.

430
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,990
Uncle Liang, I'm looking forward to working with you.

431
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,270
You said that Sun Huading

432
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,810
was in jail because of her.

433
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,470
But when I met Ms. Xiao a while ago,

434
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,770
she didn't mention it.

435
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,440
Yes.

436
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,940
It's because...

437
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,580
Mr. Ding.

438
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,630
We need to apologize to you.

439
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,040
It's okay. Go ahead.

440
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,880
We were afraid we'd alert Winry,

441
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,780
so we asked Ms. Xiao to hide it from you temporarily.

442
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,390
I hope you can understand.

443
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,750
Does Sun Huading know that he has been cheated?

444
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,290
He already knows.

445
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,790
Since he knows, why did he...

446
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,950
We also asked Mr. Sun to do this.

447
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,550
Because we all know

448
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,090
that Wen Li is committing a crime.

449
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,950
But now all her crimes

450
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:36,030
are done for her by men.

451
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:38,050
She has been hiding behind the scenes.

452
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,330
We need evidence of Wen Li's crimes.

453
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,630
So, we asked Mr. Sun to write a letter of introduction

454
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:45,240
for Wen Li to come to you.

455
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,030
What does she want

456
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,950
from my son?

457
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,450
She wants your property.

458
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,440
From what we know about Wen Li,

459
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,750
she doesn't spend too much time

460
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,880
on a man for too long.

461
00:24:58,930 --> 00:24:59,990
After she squeezes every penny from one target,

462
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,790
she will turn to her next target.

463
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,300
Now your son is her target.

464
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,430
Hello, Mr. Liang.

465
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,890
This area was designed by Mr. Liang himself.

466
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,610
You have good taste, Uncle Liang.

467
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,500
I'm old.

468
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,990
-Let's go.
-Hello, Mr. Liang.

469
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,750
Let's check out your new office.

470
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,010
After I leave, this office will be yours.

471
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Do you know

472
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,390
what she did to my son?

473
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,350
She recently transferred 2 million yuan to your son.

474
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,780
I don't get it.

475
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,460
What does my son need the 2 million yuan for?

476
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,190
Make a movie.

477
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,580
No wonder he went to Jingbei.

478
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,080
How is it?

479
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,130
It's good, Uncle Liang.

480
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,480
Uncle Liang. Don't worry.

481
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,140
I'll take care of the company.

482
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,990
Children will grow up eventually.

483
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,520
Miss Wen,

484
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,200
please excuse us for a moment.

485
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,330
I have something to tell Qiwei.

486
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,330
No, Uncle Liang.

487
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:10,250
Wen Li will be our partner from now on.

488
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,950
We don't have to hide anything from her.

489
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:12,950
It's better for us

490
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,870
to discuss the company's business privately.

491
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:17,230
Miss Wen.

492
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,430
Qiwei, I'll wait for you outside.

493
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,260
They are in Jingbei now.

494
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:26,960
But Mr. Ding,

495
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,700
they might go to the US later

496
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,280
and then to Hollywood...

497
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,450
Sorry.

498
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,430
Let me call Jingbei first.

499
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,240
Wait for me for a minute.

500
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,770
Mr. Ding.

501
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,700
Everything is under control, so there is no need to panic.

502
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,000
Let's wait for her to get what she wants

503
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,990
so that we can gather conclusive evidence of her crime.

504
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,920
No, don't worry.

505
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,730
My people in Jingbei are reliable.

506
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,530
As long as they are aware of this,

507
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,430
they won't be scammed.

508
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:55,610
Okay, sit.

509
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,670
I want to break up with Yuru.

510
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:00,730
What?

511
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,710
Your father has long regarded Yuru

512
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,270
as his daughter-in-law.

513
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,580
How can you break up with her at will?

514
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,130
I don't want to listen to my dad anymore!

515
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:16,690
Hello?

516
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,020
Are Qiwei and that girl beside you?

517
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,460
Qiwei is here.

518
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,240
Let's talk privately.

519
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,330
Uncle.

520
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,430
You've been on the phone with my dad for so long.

521
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,560
Is everything okay?

522
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,410
Come, sit down, Qiwei.

523
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:42,070
Nothing.

524
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,570
Your dad has asked me

525
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,700
to hand over our branch in Jingbei to you

526
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:50,320
and let me stay here as the CFO.

527
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,750
We don't mean anything else.

528
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:54,730
It's because you're not familiar with the business yet.

529
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,970
Your father has asked me to help you

530
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,310
become familiar with the business

531
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,110
and to take care of it for a while.

532
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,800
CFO?

533
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,370
Qiwei.

534
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,610
Your dad gives you the branch in Jingbei,

535
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:10,550
but he doesn't give you the authority to handle money.

536
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,110
Well...

537
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,670
It's nothing.

538
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,660
We're not here for money, anyway.

539
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,920
Besides,

540
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,450
with Uncle Liang here to take care of the company,

541
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,250
we will have time to film a movie.

542
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:20,990
I've agreed.

543
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:26,020
What do you mean?

544
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,370
Give her some money?

545
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,850
Why?

546
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,340
To get evidence of her crime.

547
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,990
Based on what we know about her,

548
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,650
she won't keep the money in China.

549
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,910
She'll try to transfer the money abroad.

550
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,710
Now,

551
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,510
we've got all of Wen Li's

552
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,910
legal company accounts.

553
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,700
But we still haven't found out

554
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,080
the accounts of her own company yet.

555
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,160
We need to locate this hidden account

556
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,440
and trace her entire transfer chain

557
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,240
in order to report her for fraud.

558
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,030
What if we can't get the money back

559
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,030
once she has transferred it abroad?

560
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,480
So, no.

561
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:02,910
I earned every penny

562
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,660
through my hard work.

563
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,340
I can't waste it on her.

564
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,740
That's right.

565
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,220
Right?

566
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:09,730
Yes.

567
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,240
Mr. Ding.

568
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,710
Actually, we understand

569
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,270
that you value your wealth.

570
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,800
With your wealth,

571
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,460
you have such a big firm

572
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,650
with a lot of employees.

573
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,450
I understand.

574
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,420
But this is

575
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,430
about your son, after all.

576
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,470
As far as we know,

577
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,430
you are usually very strict with him.

578
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:28,090
Why are you so strict with him?

579
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,790
You want him to make it

580
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:31,580
and take over your business.

581
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,380
But Wen Li

582
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,750
is frantically plotting ways.

583
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,880
When they are together,

584
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,840
Qiwei may get hurt.

585
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,200
But it's okay, young man.

586
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,010
He'll grow up after this.

587
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:45,780
Right?

588
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,400
If he gets hurt, bad things will turn into good.

589
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,220
Maybe he will come back.

590
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,280
You get what you want, right?

591
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,580
Am I right?

592
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,520
Just say it.

593
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
What's your plan?

594
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,230
30 million.

595
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,520
Lend us 30 million yuan

596
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,500
to put on a show.

597
00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:07,110
Just for show.

598
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,100
Let Wen Li think

599
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,000
she has 30 million yuan to transfer.

600
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,980
She's an idiot?

601
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,890
There is a sum of money, but she can't touch it.

602
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,150
Will she fall for this?

603
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,270
You're right.

604
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,180
So, we'll consider

605
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:21,970
giving Wen Li a chance to transfer the money.

606
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,640
And this time, we only need two million yuan.

607
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,840
That means

608
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,310
we'll use 30 million yuan as bait to keep her on the hook

609
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:37,370
and two million yuan to make her believe she can get her hands on the money.

610
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,370
Can you gather the evidence during this period?

611
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:42,140
We will do our best.

612
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,910
As long as we find

613
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,170
this hidden account,

614
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,930
we can report her to the police.

615
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,040
Fine.

616
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,070
I'll only give you two million yuan.

617
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,600
Whether it succeeds or not,

618
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,280
I won't pay any more.

619
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,750
Okay, thank you.

620
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,400
I think

621
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,060
Wen Li should actually go after Ding Zhaoguang

622
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,700
instead of his son.

623
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,990
They are a perfect match.

624
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,190
Hold on.

625
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:23,620
What?

626
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,390
Okay, this way, please.

627
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,120
What's wrong with those security guards?

628
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,430
Why do they have to report to someone

629
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,910
when I come to the company?

630
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,230
Don't panic.

631
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:01,760
You can't panic.

632
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,070
If you panic, all of your efforts will be in vain.

633
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,300
What's wrong with Uncle Liang?

634
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,230
He's the CFO,

635
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:11,670
so I can't get a penny.

636
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,550
Did they notice something?

637
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,300
Or has that 30 million yuan been exposed?

638
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,550
Maybe I should go.

639
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,180
It'd be troublesome if they already knew.

640
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,070
But

641
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,810
he is almost about to take the bait.

642
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,200
Go for it.

643
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:47,630
If he can still get his hands on the money,

644
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,690
it means it's fine.

645
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,700
If he can't...

646
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:54,360
Wen Li, I'm sorry.

647
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:56,670
I know the two million yuan are yours.

648
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:58,470
If you have any other ideas...

649
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,580
Qiwei.

650
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,910
Aren't we determined

651
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,520
to make a great film?

652
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:04,920
If we make it in a hurry,

653
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,340
what's the point?

654
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,880
That's true.

655
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:12,960
But my dad doesn't support me making movies at all.

656
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,760
He won't give us any money.

657
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:19,510
Qiwei.

658
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,440
Let's go to America.

659
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,030
Go to Hollywood for further study.

660
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,450
When we become more mature in art,

661
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,280
we can make the movies we want

662
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,100
at that time.

663
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:30,150
But

664
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,830
I don't think there are many opportunities

665
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,690
for Chinese people in Hollywood.

666
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:35,630
How come?

667
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,070
Director Ang Lee is also Chinese.

668
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:40,270
If we want to do it,

669
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,950
we must become the world's best director and scriptwriter.

670
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,680
But I'm afraid

671
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,990
that if I want to reach the level of Ang Lee...

672
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,310
In my eyes,

673
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,180
you're Ang Lee.

674
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:57,270
You're going to America to open a business?

675
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:58,870
Qiwei.

676
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,830
You're not familiar with the business here yet.

677
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:02,350
You...

678
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,380
Uncle Liang, which side are you on?

679
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,070
If you side with my dad,

680
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:07,310
I'm quitting now.

681
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,250
And I will go to America right away with Wen Li.

682
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:09,980
Okay.

683
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,510
Let me think about it.

684
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,750
Let me think about how to report to your dad.

685
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,010
Hurry up, Uncle Liang.

686
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,050
I'll go back and wait for your news.

687
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:46,370
Hello.

688
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,639
They really took this step.

689
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,510
Fine.

690
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:00,560
You answer him like this...

691
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,470
Have my cameras arrived yet?

692
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,990
No, Mr. Ding.

693
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,320
Tell me when they arrive.

694
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
Okay, Mr. Ding.

695
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:08,870
Wen Li.

696
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,600
Qiwei!

697
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,410
No one asked about who I was when I came to the company.

698
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,270
Why did the security guards have to call someone during these times?

699
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,270
Did they call you?

700
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,920
No.

701
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,400
I guess they called Uncle Liang.

702
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,520
It doesn't matter.

703
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,890
Wen Li, I have good news.

704
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,390
My dad has agreed

705
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,920
to send us money to America.

706
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,510
That's great.

707
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,110
And my dad said he would give us 30 million yuan.

708
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,560
But he transferred the 30 million yuan

709
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,290
to Uncle Liang for now.

710
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:40,340
Uncle Liang only transferred 2 million yuan to me.

711
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,280
But Uncle Liang said

712
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,810
that he could transfer the rest to us anytime.

713
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,510
That's great.

714
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,780
Qiwei,

715
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,920
your dad still cares about you.

716
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:52,620
He asked Uncle Liang to give us so much money.

717
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,830
He doesn't want you to have a hard time dealing with something

718
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,090
when you go to America.

719
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,880
I talked to them

720
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,710
very seriously this time, okay?

721
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,600
I think

722
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,030
I should be tougher with them in the future.

723
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,110
Yes.

724
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,460
We have to stick to our dreams.

725
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,400
You can do it! I trust you!

726
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,910
Wen Li

727
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,710
gave us an account in her name.

728
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,470
Is this that account?

729
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,020
Wen Li is too cunning.

730
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,920
[Company Account, Business to Business]

731
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,920
[Jingbei Ming Xin Information Technology Co.]

732
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,840
She transferred Ming Xin's money a long time ago.

733
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,990
I thought she wouldn't use this account anymore.

734
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,920
I didn't expect her to use it again.

735
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,630
No.

736
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,050
I can't let her use this account anymore.

737
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:38,450
We might need your help later, Uncle Liang.

738
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,070
Does she agree to transfer only 2 million yuan to her this time?

739
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,600
She wouldn't dare to say no.

740
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,350
She's still after our Qiwei.

741
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,070
If she acted too eagerly,

742
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,990
she would scare Qiwei.

743
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,630
Our Qiwei

744
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,120
is such a silly kid.

745
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,910
Do you know

746
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,310
what they are going to do?

747
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,720
Kaiwei is busy filming a movie in America.

748
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,580
Wen Li seems a bit hesitant.

749
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,610
I think

750
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,220
that she's supposed to be waiting for the money

751
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,000
to be deposited into her account.

752
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,910
This woman is really greedy.

753
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,800
It's okay.

754
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:17,030
We'll follow the plan later.

755
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,160
Is there anything else I can do?

756
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,930
Let's keep in touch.

757
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,220
Okay.

758
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,420
-I gotta go.
-Okay.

759
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,840
Qiwei has been busy

760
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,280
booking tickets.

761
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,560
Wen Li hasn't shown up at our company for days.

762
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,130
Could she have run away?

763
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,350
Don't worry.

764
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,960
Wen Li won't let Qiwei off easily.

765
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,640
You just have to keep an eye on Young Master Ding.

766
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,540
Okay.

767
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,040
I'll leave now.

768
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Let me see you off.

769
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,200
Now it's Liu Ming's parents' turn.

770
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:58,870
Coming.

771
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,200
Uncle, Auntie.

772
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,530
Xia, how could you let her in?

773
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:08,040
What are you doing here?

774
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,590
I really don't want to be here.

775
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:10,160
But I think

776
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,020
I have to remind you of something.

777
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,030
You, Liu Ming, and Wen Li

778
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,980
have registered a company called Ming Xin Company.

779
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,600
Your company's account

780
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,420
has been emptied.

781
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,190
What?

782
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,750
What did you say?

783
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:22,270
What?

784
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,730
Emptied?

785
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,690
What do you mean by that?

786
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,880
Take a look.

787
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,920
Do you know the person in this photo

788
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,490
and where the place is?

789
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,870
Isn't this...

790
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,760
Wen Li?

791
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,320
Shanghai.

792
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,540
Impossible.

793
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,550
The daughter-in-law you had in mind

794
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:41,630
has returned to China.

795
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,360
How can your precious son, Liu Ming,

796
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,590
manage to have a baby

797
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,040
on his own in the US?

798
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,150
No way.

799
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,790
Liu Ming and she are both in the US now.

800
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:51,380
Yes.

801
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,120
They played tricks on me

802
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,790
and transferred all of my money to the account of that company.

803
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,720
Go check

804
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:58,290
that company's account for yourself.

805
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:00,320
If you don't trust me, check

806
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,410
if there's any money in your account.

807
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,320
See where the money has been transferred to.

808
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,670
I can do the rest.

809
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,130
You know where to find me.

810
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,550
Why did Wen Li come back?

811
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,350
Hurry up!

812
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,770
What happened to the money?

813
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,700
Check the account.

814
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:16,830
Using the computer.

815
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:17,340
Yes.

816
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,720
Xia, power on the computer.

817
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,860
We are humans.

818
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:32,260
We should learn to be compassionate towards the suffering in the world.

819
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:33,830
Forget it, Dad.

820
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:36,990
You're back to your old ways, returning good for evil.

821
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,070
I think

822
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,890
Chen Shuo is right about this.

823
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:42,930
Indulging bad people

824
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,130
is the greatest cruelty to good people.

825
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:49,030
Yingzi.

826
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,830
You have always mentioned Chen Shuo since you came back.

827
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,250
What does he do?

828
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,030
Do I always mention him?

829
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,490
You always mentioned him.

830
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,190
Chen Shuo is...

831
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,950
Maybe he's helping me with Wen Li's case.

832
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,360
He's a lawyer

833
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,920
from another law firm.

834
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,040
I think

835
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,760
you like him.

836
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:16,990
Dad.

837
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:18,390
No.

838
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:20,040
How could I like him?

839
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:21,390
You like him.

840
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,670
I can feel it.

841
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:25,790
Yingzi.

842
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,360
Your relationship with Liu Ming

843
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,970
no longer exists.

844
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,060
As soon as the trial starts,

845
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,580
you two are no longer

846
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,440
married to each other.

847
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,420
You should consider moving on.

848
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:41,510
I'm not going to think about being in a relationship for now.

849
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:44,370
I'm going to think about getting married even more.

850
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,390
You should have faith

851
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,060
in love and family.

852
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,420
Should I?

853
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,700
Dad, to be honest,

854
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,800
I'm already scared.

855
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,110
You have to.

856
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:01,980
Look.

857
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,640
Your mother, I, and you.

858
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,590
The three of us

859
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:08,040
have been living happily

860
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,050
for so many years.

861
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,890
Isn't this the best relationship

862
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,590
in the world?

863
00:41:13,830 --> 00:41:14,390
Dad,

864
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:18,190
I'm really lucky

865
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,580
to have grown up in such a loving family.

866
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,690
That's because I have a father like you.

867
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,110
You believe that people are kind.

868
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,390
But after going through so many things,

869
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,410
I can no longer be like you.

870
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:32,960
But

871
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:36,150
we still need to have a family.

872
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,200
How many scammers

873
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,110
like Liu Ming are there in the world?

874
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:41,630
Dad.

875
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,690
It doesn't matter that I have my own family.

876
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:45,670
I have you and my mom, and that is enough.

877
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,530
Marriage is even less important.

878
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,030
My ultimate goal

879
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,470
is to learn how to take control of my own life,

880
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,670
right?

881
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,440
By then,

882
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,690
even if I meet someone like Liu Ming again,

883
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:58,750
I'll not be afraid.

884
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,390
Hello, Qiwei.

885
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:17,390
Wen Li, when are we going to the US?

886
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,760
My visa is ready.

887
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,240
I've checked the flights.

888
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,510
What's the hurry?

889
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,880
We have too little money.

890
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,330
We won't have enough money for the movie.

891
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,730
Have you mentioned this to Uncle Liang?

892
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:31,830
Yes.

893
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,010
But Uncle Liang said

894
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:33,590
that we have to wait

895
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,270
until we really need money,

896
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,330
and then he will give it to us.

897
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,830
We haven't done anything yet.

898
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,470
He can't give us more money.

899
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,580
You can't do business like this.

900
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,320
If we were in urgent need of money,

901
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,680
wouldn't things get delayed?

902
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,420
Are your dad and Uncle Liang playing you?

903
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:49,580
Why would they do that to me?

904
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,900
Okay, there's no need to rush.

905
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,220
We'll talk about it till the money comes in.
