[The Fearless Season 1]

[Episode 26]

4
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,620
That's it.

5
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:39,970
We made it!

6
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,990
We can get one million or even more.

7
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,270
Yingzi, this time

8
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,750
Let's work on it together.

9
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,750
We'll split at a 40/60 ratio.

10
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,000
But this time, I'll get 60% and you get 40%.

11
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,100
Don't worry.

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,720
I'm sure that

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,020
Yang Weida will agree

14
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,259
to his wife's request

15
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,670
and give up his shares to keep his reputation.

16
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,980
After all, he made his fortune from his reputation.

17
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,820
We can sign the agreement tomorrow.

18
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,350
What's wrong?

19
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,490
Why aren't you talking?

20
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,950
So that's it?

21
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,390
But what about those girls

22
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,500
who were sexually harassed by him?

23
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,460
Didn't we help them

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,829
punish Yang Weida?

25
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,590
But the humiliations they suffered

26
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,630
were silently skipped over?

27
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,420
Not really.

28
00:02:49,329 --> 00:02:50,520
We've tried.

29
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,150
The law can't do anything to him.

30
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,550
Besides,

31
00:02:53,829 --> 00:02:55,430
we'll strip him of his property.

32
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,250
Isn't that enough?

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,050
What do you mean?

34
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,420
It's just transferring his property

35
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,280
to his wife,

36
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,390
with his reputation well-preserved.

37
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,060
As long as he has a good reputation,

38
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,240
he can make more money

39
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,930
when he's back on his feet.

40
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,670
By then,

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,330
he can use his reputation and money

42
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:14,180
to hurt other girls again, right?

43
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,820
But those girls who were harassed

44
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,520
didn't want to disclose it.

45
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,079
It's not that they didn't want to.

46
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,950
It was because they knew

47
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,400
the law couldn't do anything to Yang Weida.

48
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,390
And in this way,

49
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,700
what he's done

50
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,270
was turned into a marital dispute.

51
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,510
Maybe the public

52
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,829
would think

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,390
it was caused by Guo Yu's entanglement.

54
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,750
In this way,

55
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,500
Guo Yu and the other girls

56
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,740
will get hurt for the second time. Right?

57
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,670
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,900
I have a headache from drinking.

59
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,620
I think...

60
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,670
Why don't we...

61
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,950
talk another day?

62
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,350
I'll go back and have a good rest.

63
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:56,760
What should we do now?

64
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,110
Actually, I have no idea.

65
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,480
If I knew,

66
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,110
I wouldn't get drunk alone.

67
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,330
Are you going to do this case or not?

68
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,960
If you are not doing it, I'll ask someone else to do it.

69
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,560
I'm going to do it anyway.

70
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,440
You can say

71
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,360
the problem that can be solved with money is not a problem.

72
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,170
But for me,

73
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,310
no matter what problems I encounter,

74
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,980
I have to solve them with money.

75
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,220
Then why did you

76
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,710
return the case

77
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,440
you took from Han?

78
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,540
That's because I lost my mind. OK?

79
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,900
There's a price to pursue justice.

80
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,380
I can't afford it now.

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,560
If you don't do it, I'll do it myself.

82
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,690
I won't give up this one million.

83
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,940
Qiu Hua.

84
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:49,030
You got this case

85
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,710
by your own intelligence.

86
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,600
You should take it.

87
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,090
But

88
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,680
I'd better quit.

89
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:58,230
I can't get over that.

90
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,810
Sorry.

91
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,590
For what?

92
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,320
Do you know how much I hate you?

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,010
Apologize again.

94
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,620
Don't pretend to be a moral model in front of me.

95
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,060
You know I'm not qualified to be one, right?

96
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,000
Qiu Hua, can what you said

97
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,020
make you happy?

98
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,590
Or do you think I am happy to hear that?

99
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,390
I just can't get over it.

100
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,920
You knew very well

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,270
how much Guo Yu's case has irritated me.

102
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,110
Speaking of which,

103
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,710
is there anyone less qualified than her?

104
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,670
She entrusted everything to me.

105
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,480
What did I do?

106
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,710
I lost the lawsuit

107
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,230
and I lost it so shamelessly.

108
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,230
She just left.

109
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:33,909
How can I

110
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:34,590
turn a blind eye to what had happened to her?

111
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,470
I feel so bad.

112
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,230
Can't you let me take a few days off?

113
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,470
You should take it.

114
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,560
Don't listen to me.

115
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,600
I'm talking about myself.

116
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,390
Hello, Ms. Tian.

117
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,870
Ms. Qiu.

118
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,680
My aunt wants to check

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,350
if we can sign the agreement today.

120
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,320
We can sign it today.

121
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,790
But my suggestion is not to rush.

122
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,270
I still need to see the evidence

123
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,470
before discussing

124
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,550
the negotiation plan.

125
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,230
My aunt said you could see the evidence,

126
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,590
but you had to go to her place.

127
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,210
You can only see it, not copy it.

128
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:20,520
Okay.

129
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,160
I'll arrange my schedule.

130
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,730
Please ask Ms. Tian to

131
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,320
set up a time to meet.

132
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,830
Okay?

133
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,620
Sure.

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,060
keep in touch.

135
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,910
Bye.

136
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,870
I'm shameless to ask it back.

137
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,280
We'll be busy.

138
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,240
We've suffered so much.

139
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,790
The patent knowledge

140
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,810
has come in handy.

141
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,990
Mrs. Yang just called

142
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,510
to see if we can sign the agreement today.

143
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,930
Are you asking me?

144
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,670
I dare not say anything.

145
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,150
Of course, you can.

146
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,100
Why not?

147
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,370
Qiu Hua,

148
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,430
I don't think you should be affected by what I said.

149
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:32,130
I've thought about it again.

150
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,179
You should take it.

151
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,350
We can't punish Yang Weida now.

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,230
It's good if someone else can.

153
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:39,630
You take this case,

154
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,830
and get the money you should earn.

155
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,480
I won't take it.

156
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,990
If possible,

157
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll teach him a lesson in the future.

158
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,710
It's a win-win situation.

159
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,360
It's good for both sides.

160
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,990
Then I'll sign the agreement with her.

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,830
Go ahead.

162
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,760
Hurry up.

163
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,830
If Unscrupulous Chen knows this,

164
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,630
he'll definitely snatch it from you.

165
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,230
He won't even hesitate.

166
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,760
That's why he's called Unscrupulous Chen.

167
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,480
Ms. Tian,

168
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,340
we…

169
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:25,920
Qiu Hua.

170
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,120
Have you heard of a centipede fable?

171
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,370
There was once a centipede.

172
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:36,830
It had 36 pairs of legs.

173
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,500
It had been moving freely.

174
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,990
One day,

175
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:44,990
it met a frog with an ulterior motive.

176
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,110
The frog said,

177
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,710
"Croak, croak.

178
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,850
When your second pair of legs move,

179
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,070
what are your 16th pair of legs doing?"

180
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,520
The centipede

181
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,430
started to think hard about it.

182
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,110
Guess what happened in the end?

183
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,990
The centipede couldn't walk.

184
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,930
Bingo!

185
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,600
I mean you shouldn't think too much.

186
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,540
Just think of yourself

187
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,400
as the dare-to-die corp in our group.

188
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,390
Lead the way.

189
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,470
That's it.

190
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,570
Hello, I'm Luo Yingzi.

191
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,350
What?

192
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,760
Okay.

193
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,470
We'll be right there.

194
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,110
Someone wants to meet us.

195
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:32,600
Who is it?

196
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,950
Hello, are you Mr. Wang?

197
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,950
Yes, you are Ms. Luo.

198
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:46,110
-Yes.
-This is Ms. Qiu.

199
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:46,830
Yes.

200
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,710
Hello, Mr. Wang.

201
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,110
Hello.

202
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,110
Have a seat.

203
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,790
What kind of legal issues

204
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,400
do you want to consult?

205
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,590
I'm not here for consultation.

206
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:57,830
My name is Wang Jianliang.

207
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,750
Xia Linlin's ex-husband.

208
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,620
Were you listening

209
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,290
during the trial that day?

210
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,350
Yes.

211
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,350
After all,

212
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,510
we had a marriage before.

213
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,240
Xia Linlin was really unfortunate.

214
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,750
Mr. Wang, you are here today...

215
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,660
What Xia Linlin said is true.

216
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,220
Of course, we believe her.

217
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,470
But the problem is

218
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,880
there is no way to prove it.

219
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,630
I have evidence.

220
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,350
The evidence of Yang Weida's rape of Xia Linlin.

221
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,560
That's all.

222
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,380
Is it enough?

223
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,350
Can it prove he raped her?

224
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,670
Mr. Wang,

225
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,760
how did you get

226
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
this video?

227
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,610
I used to like Linlin very much.

228
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,480
With my conditions,

229
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,660
I was extremely lucky to be with such a beautiful girl.

230
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:21,780
I really didn't know how to love her more.

231
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,220
But after we got married,

232
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,020
she had been emotionally unstable.

233
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,590
She often cried and made a scene.

234
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,630
She also had nightmares at night.

235
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,380
I asked her what happened.

236
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,730
She told me everything in the end.

237
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,350
I think you should understand.

238
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,830
I'm a man.

239
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,590
After what happened to my wife,

240
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,630
I felt like I ate a fly.

241
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,820
I found that hotel behind Linlin's back.

242
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,590
What a coincidence.

243
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,630
I have a friend who is the head of security there.

244
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,150
He found this for me.

245
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,560
I copied it.

246
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,130
It's like a thorn in my heart.

247
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,320
My relationship with Linlin

248
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,510
started to be bad since then.

249
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,190
Then we got divorced.

250
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,190
After we divorced,

251
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,070
I heard she was on drugs.

252
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:12,800
I know.

253
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:14,600
I can't keep in touch with drug addicts.

254
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,750
So I lost contact with her.

255
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,310
Later,

256
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,900
I got married again.

257
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,700
I heard

258
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,000
someone sued Yang Waida and she testified in court.

259
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,950
I remembered this video,

260
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,680
so I followed her secretly.

261
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,620
It's been only a few years since I last saw Xia Linlin.

262
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,400
I didn't expect her to be like that.

263
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,490
It's Yang Weida's fault.

264
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,680
After all, she was the one I loved.

265
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,430
I'm sad.

266
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:44,990
It's impossible to

267
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,230
watch that old rascal Yang Weida

268
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,390
escape justice.

269
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,270
That's why I came.

270
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,190
But

271
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,460
I have a condition.

272
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,880
What is it?

273
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,470
I told you

274
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,060
I got married again.

275
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,990
So this should be just between us.

276
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:04,950
Don't let anyone else know

277
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,190
where you got this video.

278
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,470
I don't want to get involved in this.

279
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,270
Ms. Fang,

280
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,510
we found the evidence.

281
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,640
Ms. Fang.

282
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,740
How is it?

283
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,130
You look so happy.

284
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,510
Of course.

285
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,590
We can finally catch him.

286
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,010
But the nature of this case has changed.

287
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,660
This is a rape case.

288
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,640
It's a public prosecution.

289
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:55,220
I'm afraid we can do nothing with it.

290
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,190
But we won't let him escape justice

291
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,320
even though it's a case of public prosecution, right?

292
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:03,920
Of course.

293
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,230
This is the evidence of Yang Weida's crime.

294
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,810
We can't cover up for him.

295
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,640
But I think there's

296
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:14,860
something important.

297
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,500
Because this matter

298
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,240
will affect our cooperation with Mr. Dong.

299
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,330
As far as I know,

300
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,830
Mr. Dong and Yang Weida are very close.

301
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,210
Besides, he's our big client now.

302
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,120
So I need to figure out

303
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:39,720
how to communicate with him about this.

304
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,390
But you just said they were close in private.

305
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,350
Could it be...

306
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,030
I don't think so.

307
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,550
Mr. Dong is not a fool.

308
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,510
I don't think he will choose

309
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,230
to stand with a rapist.

310
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:57,700
Okay.

311
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,870
I'm out of here now.

312
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,680
I'll wait for your news.

313
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,130
By the way, I have to take this away.

314
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,839
Can I have a copy of it?

315
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,950
No.

316
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,760
We made a promise to the source.

317
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,020
That's what a lawyer should be like.

318
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:11,880
Ms. Fang, I'm leaving.

319
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,460
Wait for my message.

320
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,990
I just told Ms. Fang.

321
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,470
She said

322
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,910
she had to pacify Mr. Dong first.

323
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:31,910
That makes sense.

324
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,070
After all, Mr. Dong's company

325
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,460
is our biggest client.

326
00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:37,510
Our interests will be affected, too.

327
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,010
I know what you're thinking.

328
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,710
Mrs. Yang's evidence will be meaningless.

329
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,470
Yes.

330
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,540
The evidence proves that it is sexual harassment.

331
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,400
Now it has turns into a rape.

332
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,990
If it becomes a case of public prosecution,

333
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,130
the evidence she has will be useless.

334
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,080
That's what Ms. Fang said.

335
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,370
But Qiu Hua,

336
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,330
the sexual harassment case we took

337
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:14,310
has been like this from the beginning.

338
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,650
We should support Xia Linlin in reporting the case.

339
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,440
Right?

340
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,070
We can't let that rascal

341
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,550
get away scot-free

342
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,290
after hurting so many girls.

343
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,590
Right?

344
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,350
I'm wondering

345
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,220
if there is a perfect way.

346
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,540
Wang Jianliang repeatedly asked us to keep it a secret.

347
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,190
Xia Linlin is in the drug rehabilitation center now.

348
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,610
We can

349
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,500
take Mrs. Yang's divorce case first.

350
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,540
After that,

351
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,620
I'll ask Xia Linlin to report the case with the evidence.

352
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,990
That way, after depriving Yang Weida of his property,

353
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:59,190
we can still

354
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,500
send him to prison.

355
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,600
It's a win-win situation.

356
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,370
We see eye to eye.

357
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:07,630
This...

358
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,360
Keep it and make a copy.

359
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,560
I'll tell Fang Lihong now.

360
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,990
Let's go.

361
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,790
Mrs. Yang is waiting in the meeting room.

362
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,050
Why should I go?

363
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,700
[Agency Agreement]

364
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,880
[Qiu Hua, Luo Yingzi]

365
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:55,910
Why is my name on it?

366
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,950
I won't partner up with others.

367
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,950
We are a unit.

368
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,710
I'll only work with you.

369
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,290
I'll pay you 40% of the commission.

370
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,680
Let's go then.

371
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't keep Mrs. Yang waiting.

372
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,430
Hurry up.

373
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,550
Thank you for your trust, Ms. Tian.

374
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,310
Have some water, Ms. Tian.

375
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,220
Thank you.

376
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,820
Well,

377
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,160
let's talk about the case.

378
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,670
Mr. Tian,

379
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:27,060
you have to show us the evidence

380
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,900
you have.

381
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,070
No problem.

382
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,480
I can provide it.

383
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,430
But before that,

384
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,310
you have to sign a confidentiality agreement for me.

385
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,070
You have to promise

386
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,470
the evidence I provide

387
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,390
will only be used

388
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,120
for your private negotiations with Yang Weida.

389
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,120
It can't be disclosed to anyone else.

390
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,100
No problem.

391
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,990
But don't worry.

392
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,060
Even without this confidentiality agreement,

393
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,030
we lawyers have a duty of confidentiality.

394
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:52,710
Or, we can't be lawyers.

395
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,770
Ms. Tian,

396
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,490
what's your bottom line?

397
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,420
All of Yang Weida's shares?

398
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,070
Yes, I want them all.

399
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,290
Of course,

400
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,710
the lower the price, the better.

401
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,490
It can't exceed 50 million.

402
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,180
Considering the market value of Weida Group,

403
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,700
the negotiation is quite difficult.

404
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,230
That's why

405
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,510
I'm willing to pay a lot of money for you two.

406
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,930
Ms. Tian,

407
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,760
taking your goal into consideration,

408
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,890
our commission is too low.

409
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,660
One more thing.

410
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,990
You can do the preliminaries first.

411
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:32,870
As for the date you negotiate with him,

412
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,270
you can wait for my news.

413
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,460
I'll inform you.

414
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:36,890
Aren't you in a hurry to divorce?

415
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,300
Aren't you afraid that he will transfer his property

416
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:41,370
after hearing the news?

417
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,870
I'm not afraid of that.

418
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,070
Except you,

419
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,550
no one knows I want a divorce.

420
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,560
There's an unexpected emergency happening these days.

421
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,420
What is it?

422
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:57,070
Yang Weida's father

423
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:58,620
had a brain hemorrhage two days ago.

424
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,310
He's still in the hospital.

425
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:03,470
His father has 9% of the shares

426
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,070
of the company.

427
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:06,840
Got it.

428
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,580
How many children does his father have?

429
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,440
Only him.

430
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,480
Yang Weida lost his mother when he was young.

431
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,750
If his father dies,

432
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,710
Yang Weida will become the only heir.

433
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,960
Then his shares

434
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,230
will be raised from 35%

435
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,630
to 44%.

436
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:21,360
You want to get the 44% of shares with 50 million?

437
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,390
But when you offered Mr. Qiu a million,

438
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:29,560
his shares were only 35%.

439
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,440
Impressive.

440
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,270
You're so calculative.

441
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,140
Yes.

442
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,830
As long as you can

443
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,730
take 44% of his shares

444
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,990
at a price of no more than 50 million,

445
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,450
I'll give you another 200,000.

446
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,090
How about 12 million?

447
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,170
But his father is likely to recover, too.

448
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,670
It's impossible.

449
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,180
I talked to his doctor.

450
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,880
It should be in a few days.

451
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:05,750
Ms. Tian,

452
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,910
please

453
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,890
show us the evidence first.

454
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,530
What's the rush?

455
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,600
Let's wait until his father dies.

456
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,870
Except Wang Jianliang,

457
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,000
the security guard of the hotel,

458
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,750
Wang Jianliang's fellow-townsman

459
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:25,650
also knows it.

460
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:26,750
Ms. Fang.

461
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,360
If three people know a secret,

462
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,310
it won't be a secret at all.

463
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,610
And nearly everyone knows about this case.

464
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,050
If someone

465
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,920
wants to make use of this video,

466
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,040
will there still be Mrs. Yang's divorce case?

467
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,150
If Mrs. Yang's case is closed,

468
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,810
we'll lose our 1.2 million.

469
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,890
How is Yang's father now?

470
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,940
In half a year, or one year?

471
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,540
That's what the nurse said.

472
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,730
Ms. Fang.

473
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:53,220
Even if he becomes a vegetable,

474
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,840
he may still live

475
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,300
for eight to ten years.

476
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,000
It's indeed a long dream.

477
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,070
If someone recalls the video

478
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,180
in this process...

479
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,830
I think Wang Jianliang who provided this video

480
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:07,790
is very likely to do it.

481
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,030
This is the evidence of Yang Weida's crime.

482
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,720
I think he'll blackmail him

483
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,130
with this video.

484
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,470
Mrs. Yang is our client now.

485
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,480
We have the obligation

486
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,840
to give her a risk warning.

487
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,190
Tell her

488
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,190
no matter the negotiation or the divorce,

489
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:28,170
she'd better act immediately.

490
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,230
You can imply that

491
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,050
there's a video.

492
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,680
But remember,

493
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,790
you can't tell her clearly

494
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:37,980
that we have this video.

495
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,350
Qiu Hua.

496
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,510
I suddenly feel that

497
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,700
it's good that Liu Ming ran away.

498
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,070
Think about it.

499
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,400
Your spouse

500
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,380
set you up

501
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,720
without letting you know,

502
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,430
how scary it is.

503
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,370
Luckily, he ran away in time.

504
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,590
If he didn't,

505
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,660
things scarier would have happened.

506
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,610
You're the only one who can think this way.

507
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,660
This is your sense of security.

508
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:14,410
You're safer because you don't have enemies around you.

509
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,630
What is a husband?

510
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,620
The most dangerous lover.

511
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,580
Sorry, Ms. Tian.

512
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,680
We're late.

513
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:25,410
Hello, Ms. Tian.

514
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,990
What happened?

515
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,190
Didn't we agree

516
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:29,390
that we'd better not meet each other?

517
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,250
We'll be in trouble if Yang Weida finds out.

518
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,150
It's dangerous to meet.

519
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,910
It was the sense of imminent danger

520
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,550
that made us anxious to see you.

521
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,390
What is it about?

522
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,190
Here's the thing.

523
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,840
You know Yang Weida very well.

524
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,820
That day, Xia Linlin said she was raped.

525
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,460
Others may not believe it,

526
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,690
but you must know it is true.

527
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,630
If the rape is known

528
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:53,900
and verified by others,

529
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,430
the nature of the case will be changed.

530
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,430
What's wrong?

531
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:05,250
Does someone have the evidence?

532
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,050
We can't tell you the answer directly.

533
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,440
It's just a risk warning for you.

534
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:12,570
Ms. Tian,

535
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,530
although we lost the case a few days ago,

536
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,770
you know this case well.

537
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,030
If someone has the evidence,

538
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,310
I think the danger may be around the corner.

539
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,290
As lawyers,

540
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,250
we have to remind you.

541
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,130
Is it possible?

542
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:32,550
Yes.

543
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,260
How about this?

544
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,150
I don't want to wait anymore.

545
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,900
I don't want the 9%.

546
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,310
So you'd better negotiate with him

547
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,540
about the divorce now.

548
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,540
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow,

549
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,360
so I won't be present.

550
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,280
Call me when you're done negotiating.

551
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,240
I'll come back and sign it.

552
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,320
Also,

553
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,990
since I don't want the nine percent,

554
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,320
let's follow the original way.

555
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,420
I'll pay you one million.

556
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,750
No, it must be 1.2 million.

557
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,130
Don't forget

558
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,150
we gave you

559
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:11,540
a timely risk warning.

560
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,340
Sure.

561
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,460
I'll pay you 1.2 million.

562
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,120
It won't be a problem.

563
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,110
But hurry up.

564
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,650
Mr. Yang, two lawyers are here.

565
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,320
What made you here, ladies?

566
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,510
Mr. Yang, we represent your wife

567
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,750
to negotiate a divorce.

568
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,730
My wife?

569
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,700
She is on the plane now.

570
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,570
We have the entrustment procedure.

571
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,150
She'll come back

572
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:54,870
when we're done talking to you.

573
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,700
I'm not phoning her.

574
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,320
I'm calling my lawyer.

575
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,410
Hello, ladies.

576
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,000
Righteous Luo.

577
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,930
What's going on?

578
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,730
Now you even make money by destroying other's family?

579
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,630
I'm flattered.

580
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,350
I need to learn more from you.

581
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,020
Let's get down to business.

582
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,850
This is given by Mrs. Yang,

583
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,200
Ms. Tian.

584
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,050
She entrusted us

585
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,190
to negotiate a divorce with Mr. Yang.

586
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,670
A divorce?

587
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:38,360
Mr. Yang,

588
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,190
did Mrs. Yang

589
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,730
bring a divorce up to you before?

590
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,910
No.

591
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,770
So

592
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,840
divorce is a big deal.

593
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,900
Why isn't Mrs. Yang here?

594
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,920
Mrs. Yang is on a business trip,

595
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,600
so she entrusted us with full authority.

596
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,010
By the way, we can see

597
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,470
her determination to divorce.

598
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:00,610
Fine.

599
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,640
What are Mrs. Yang's requests?

600
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,540
Ms. Tian asked Mr. Yang

601
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,870
to transfer all his shares of the company to her.

602
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,910
As far as we know,

603
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,260
it's 35%.

604
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,000
The price should be no more than $30 million.

605
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:15,900
What?

606
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,470
Is she crazy?

607
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,630
I founded this company.

608
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:21,190
Why should I give it to her?

609
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,950
30 million?

610
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,660
It's no less than 300 million.

611
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,800
She should check

612
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,710
what the current market capitalization of this company is.

613
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,150
Ladies,

614
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,390
well...

615
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,340
What does Mrs. Yang mean now?

616
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,890
Mr. Yang,

617
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,280
your wife offered such a condition

618
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,090
because she has the confidence.

619
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,220
Your wife gave us something.

620
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,070
Do you want to see it?

621
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
It's a little stuffy here.

622
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,480
I need some fresh air.

623
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,270
Yes, it's a bit stuffy.

624
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,050
Let's go

625
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,670
and get some fresh air.

626
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,510
What is it?

627
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,240
What evidence do you think the two have?

628
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,690
What do you think?

629
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,910
I don't know.

630
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,410
It won't be something helpful.

631
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,540
His wife is quite mysterious.

632
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,260
She just sent two lawyers here.

633
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,110
It seems she's so confident to win.

634
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,760
Let's play it by ear.

635
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,490
Mr. Yang!

636
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,720
I'm sorry.

637
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,790
Will you accept her request?

638
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,980
I'll discuss it with my lawyers.

639
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,190
Okay.

640
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:01,850
It's your turn.

641
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,430
Good job, Righteous Luo.

642
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:07,080
But is it for justice this time?

643
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,520
Justice needs food too.

644
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:10,890
You're right.

645
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,550
I guess you'll soon become Unscrupulous Luo.

646
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,760
This woman is so vicious.

647
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,800
I thought

648
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,710
she sent her niece to my office

649
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,100
to spy on me.

650
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:27,490
It turned out that she installed CCTV

651
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,420
and took those videos.

652
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,820
What if those things are released?

653
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,990
Mr. Yang,

654
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,540
do you want to keep your reputation or money?

655
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,990
As a lawyer, I have to tell you

656
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,050
we should protect your reputation now.

657
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,840
If you lose your reputation,

658
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,250
your money will be gone.

659
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,080
Mr. Yang, calm down.

660
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,630
Let's analyze the situation.

661
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,640
Your wife

662
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,520
is not in a hurry to release these videos.

663
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,240
She just sent two lawyers

664
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,430
to negotiate with you.

665
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,980
That means there's a lot of room for negotiation.

666
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,230
She just wants you

667
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,400
to transfer all the shares to her.

668
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,860
Right?

669
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,050
So I guess

670
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,740
she will accept it if you just give half of them.

671
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,190
Because those videos

672
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,090
are only valuable

673
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,110
if they're kept secret.

674
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,770
If she releases them,

675
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,580
and once your reputation is damaged,

676
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,890
she won't get anything, right?

677
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,350
You don't know her.

678
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,160
Let me tell you what kind of person she is.

679
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:43,390
She's a woman who won't let you have

680
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,160
what she can't have.

681
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,180
I was on the phone with her just now.

682
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,410
My father is sick.

683
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:50,790
He's dying.

684
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,790
I asked

685
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,610
if we could do this in a few days.

686
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,100
She said, "No.

687
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,850
You have to do it now. Do it quickly."

688
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,040
She also said

689
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,940
even if she couldn't get the shares,

690
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,370
she was going to publicize it.

691
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,600
If it gets out, I'll be doomed.

692
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,960
The board will deprive me of my power.

693
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,760
She will control the company

694
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,889
and deprive me completely.

695
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,760
I'll be ruined.

696
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:20,880
Mr. Yang,

697
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,989
you said

698
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:24,199
your father was sick.

699
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,159
Brain hemorrhage.

700
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,600
It's all because of the lawsuit.

701
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:30,280
The doctor said he couldn't wake up.

702
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,469
He can only rely on nutritional supplements.

703
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,080
That's strange.

704
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,320
Why?

705
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,310
Mr. Yang.

706
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:43,730
You're the only kid in your family, right?

707
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,330
In other words,

708
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,800
you're the only heir to your father, right?

709
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,880
Of course.

710
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,690
As far as I know,

711
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,560
your father's shares in your company

712
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:55,949
is nine percent.

713
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,220
You just said

714
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,360
your wife wanted to deprive you of it completely.

715
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,090
In that case,

716
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,580
why does she leave the nine percent?

717
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,870
What do you mean?

718
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,500
I mean

719
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,760
they should have other evidence.

720
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,880
Evidence that you don't know.

721
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,080
The evidence

722
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,900
will bring you greater danger.

723
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,140
And this danger

724
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,550
can't even be controlled by them.

725
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,200
Mr. Yang,

726
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,710
I don't want to ask you a question,

727
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,000
but I have to.

728
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,950
Besides harassing girls,

729
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,230
did you do other things?

730
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,240
How about this, Mr. Yang?

731
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,890
If you can solve the problem with money,

732
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,260
then please prevent disaster with financial loss.

733
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,240
If it can't be solved...

734
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,500
Let's put it this way,

735
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,210
if it has to go to court,

736
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,680
as your lawyer,

737
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,950
I will do my best

738
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,200
to provide full legal services for you.

739
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,050
Xue, we've gotta run.

740
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,730
Let Mr. Yang digest it himself

741
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,790
and sleep on it.

742
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,860
See you.

743
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,670
Sorry to keep you waiting.

744
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,910
You look confident to win.

745
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:30,640
How much can you earn from this case?

746
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,360
I'm afraid you'll feel bad if I tell you.

747
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,500
Why would I be upset?

748
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,820
No more than one million, right?

749
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,560
Two million?

750
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
Yang Weida is waiting for you inside.

751
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,350
Go in.

752
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,210
Aren't you going to join the negotiation?

753
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,150
No need.

754
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:51,510
My commission is high.

755
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,480
I'll save some money for him.

756
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,660
Bye.

757
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,540
He doesn't want to get involved in this mess.

758
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,010
He's been involved a lot.

759
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,210
I can accept her requests.

760
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,070
But I must know

761
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,210
what other evidence she has.

762
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,480
You've seen it.

763
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:13,920
She still has something else.

764
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,030
What do you think it will be?

765
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:24,790
Can we draft the divorce agreement now?

766
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,020
Yes.

767
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,430
I can transfer all the shares

768
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,030
to her with 30 million.

769
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,560
But no matter what she has,

770
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,190
she mustn't let the cat out the the bag.

771
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,560
It must be highly confidential.

772
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,240
She agrees.

773
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,650
Why did Yang Weida

774
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,220
hesitate at the last moment?

775
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:56,790
I think there's a possibility.

776
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,990
He might know

777
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,020
his wife doesn't have the video.

778
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,090
Chen Shuo probably reminded him.

779
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,400
Unscrupulous Chen!

780
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,450
And that Wang Jianliang,

781
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,590
I don't like him either.

782
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,020
Could it be that

783
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:16,160
he went to Yang Weida with that video back then?

784
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,410
It's yummy, isn't it?

785
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:26,500
Look.

786
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,900
Hello, Mr. Wang.

787
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,660
Who are you?

788
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,510
Our boss wants to talk to you.

789
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:38,640
I'm busy. Step aside.

790
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,360
Have you spent all the 50,000?

791
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,790
What do you mean?

792
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,630
Do you think we should talk somewhere else

793
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,510
or at your house in front of your wife?

794
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,390
There's a teahouse in front of our community.

795
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:57,370
Wait for me there.

796
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,730
I'll go to you after I send my kid home.

797
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,150
You gave it to someone else, didn't you?

798
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,280
Power off your phone.

799
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,300
Are you afraid that I'll record it?

800
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,020
I'm not as despicable as you.

801
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,840
It's off.

802
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,850
You broke our promise

803
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,340
and gave it to someone else.

804
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:43,180
Did I?

805
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,170
I don't think I did.

806
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,470
Don't play dumb with me!

807
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,110
And what you gave me is a copy.

808
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,210
You should have thought of it back then.

809
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,510
But we agreed

810
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,730
not to give it to others.

811
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:54,920
But I had a condition.

812
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:56,630
You didn't do what I required.

813
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,910
I've already given you 50,000.

814
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:59,780
It's worth more than 50,000!

815
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:07,900
Are you trying to blackmail me?

816
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,510
I can sue you for extortion.

817
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,280
But our agreement says

818
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,150
you should pay for my wife's therapy.

819
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,430
Xia Linlin and I weren't divorced at that time.

820
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,060
Because of what happened between you two,

821
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,310
she was very sick.

822
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,150
What a rogue.

823
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,400
How can you use this word

824
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,660
to describe others?

825
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,240
I just want to know

826
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,480
whom you gave it to?

827
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:52,240
I told the two female lawyers.

828
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,310
Wait.

829
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,470
One more question.

830
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,790
Does Xia Linlin know about this?

831
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,460
No.

832
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,700
Because of what happened between you two,

833
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,240
I already wanted to divorce her.

834
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,650
So

835
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,160
I went to you without telling her.

836
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,960
You're really a hooligan.

837
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,390
I admire you.

838
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,470
You're back.

839
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,080
It's time to come back.

840
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:06,720
It's not easy for us to be a couple. We'd cherish it.

841
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:19,990
No wonder

842
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,790
the show went off the air all of a sudden.

843
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:25,830
Well,

844
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,530
you were penniless when you married me.

845
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:30,910
And now?

846
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,400
You're worth hundreds of millions.

847
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,360
What else do you want?

848
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,410
When I married you,

849
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,530
I wanted nothing else

850
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,040
except you.

851
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,250
After I married you,

852
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,940
I want everything

853
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,470
except you.

854
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:54,990
Okay, I promise you.

855
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:58,700
I'll give you all my shares.
