[Episode 25]

4
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,250
Keep calm and quiet.

5
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,560
Are you saying you taking drugs

6
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,830
is related to the defendant's insult?

7
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:41,550
Of course, it's related.

8
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,470
I'm the one who's insulted and harmed,

9
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,110
while he

10
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,830
continues to hold a high position,

11
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,670
making big money.

12
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,390
He can still maintain a good reputation

13
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,740
in society.

14
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,630
As for me,

15
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,970
no one understands my pain.

16
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,630
I could only tell my husband,

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,479
who then divorced me.

18
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,880
Why?

19
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,040
What's the justice in that?

20
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,250
Can someone tell me?

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,990
I want to make that heartless guy

22
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,120
pay for his actions.

23
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm done asking.

24
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,270
I don't think she can hold on much longer.

25
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,520
We should wrap it up.

26
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,400
Defense attorney,

27
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,160
do you have any questions for the witness?

28
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:26,040
Yes.

29
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,280
Witness Xia Linlin.

30
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,590
Is everything you said true?

31
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,110
No, let me put it another way.

32
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,370
Is everything you said

33
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:40,670
all the truth?

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,079
What does he mean?

35
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,630
Yes.

36
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,760
Xia Linlin didn't hide anything from us, did she?

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,760
You were harassed by the defendant,

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,070
lost your job,

39
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,030
your family, and marriage,

40
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,630
and even went to rehab

41
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,690
after using drugs.

42
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,720
It's truly a heartbreaking story.

43
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,510
Your Honor.

44
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,910
Defense attorney,

45
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,200
ask questions, don't make judgments.

46
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,790
Xia Linlin.

47
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,740
Besides sexually harassing you,

48
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,610
did the defendant do anything else?

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,010
He also raped me.

50
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,950
Why did the defense attorney ask this?

51
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,510
He's asking for evidence against our client.

52
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,600
Because he knows that there's no way to prove it.

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,270
I can't believe such things happen.

54
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,910
Can you tell us

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,030
how this happened?

56
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,930
Once he took me on a business trip,

57
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,100
and poured a lot of alcohol into me.

58
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,470
He made my secretary, Xia, drink for me.

59
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,270
Then he insisted on pulling me into his room.

60
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,600
I didn't want to go,

61
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,350
but he forced me.

62
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,140
That's when he raped me.

63
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,290
Was it rape

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,550
or consensual sex between two people?

65
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:10,470
It was rape.

66
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,230
Rape.

67
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,980
That was rape.

68
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,960
I repeatedly tried to escape,

69
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,540
but he dragged me back.

70
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,760
I begged him, but he didn't listen.

71
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,230
I even tried to fight, but I couldn't overpower him.

72
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,600
How was that not rape?

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,550
But there's no evidence

74
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,200
to prove he raped you.

75
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,590
But he did. He did rape me.

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,500
Your Honor.

77
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:31,820
Xia Linlin previously told the attorney

78
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,850
that Yang Weida raped her,

79
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,230
which is the most important reason

80
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,670
of the breakdown of her marriage.

81
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,020
However, the facts she stated

82
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,820
may involve criminal offenses,

83
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,110
and Xia Linlin is not the party in this case.

84
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,980
That's why we  didn't mention it in court.

85
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,840
Otherwise, we wouldn't be sitting in a civil court.

86
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:48,510
So,

87
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:50,390
I suggest the court not to testify

88
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,520
any evidence that has nothing to do with this case.

89
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,200
Your Honor.

90
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,310
Rape is a more serious charge than sexual harassment.

91
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:57,330
What I'm questioning now

92
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,030
is the reliability and objectivity of the witness's testimony.

93
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,030
My cross-examination

94
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,520
is highly relevant to this case.

95
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,770
Defense attorney,

96
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,310
you can continue questioning.

97
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,260
It'll be troublesome if he drags this on.

98
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,990
What a heartless beast.

99
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,350
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,030
Xia Linlin.

101
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,800
How many times have you been to a rehab?

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,840
Three times.

103
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,310
After coming out of rehab each time,

104
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,520
did you need to sign a pledge

105
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,880
with the rehab center and the community,

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,560
promising not to relapse?

107
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,030
Then why did you go in there three times?

108
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,000
Your Honor.

109
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,230
The questions the defense attorney asked

110
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,500
is irrelevant to the case.

111
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,190
Yes, it is.

112
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:37,909
What I want to prove

113
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,790
is that the witness has been untruthful.

114
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,360
If that's the case,

115
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,070
how can we believe

116
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,780
everything she said in court today?

117
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,440
Your Honor.

118
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,500
As we all know,

119
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,820
overcoming drug addiction is a very difficult process

120
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,140
once it becomes an addiction.

121
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,830
It has no direct relation

122
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,990
to the witness's character

123
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,560
or whether

124
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,710
she tells the truth.

125
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,350
Whether it's related to

126
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,230
the reliability of the witness's testimony

127
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,640
and her character,

128
00:06:58,670 --> 00:06:59,590
I believe the court

129
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,710
will make a fair judgment.

130
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,060
Please don't interrupt my questioning.

131
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,110
Xia Linlin.

132
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,140
I've read all the text messages

133
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,440
you submitted to the court.

134
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,640
I want to ask,

135
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,800
are these text exchanges between you and the defendant?

136
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,780
Yes.

137
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:19,470
Didn't Ms. Luo tell you

138
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,050
that these messages had been notarized?

139
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,090
But they only prove that this information

140
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,080
is from the phone

141
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,920
submitted to the notary office.

142
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,700
Is this phone yours?

143
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,790
Of course it's mine.

144
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,550
But as far as I know,

145
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,350
you would sell everything around you

146
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,710
for money to buy drugs,

147
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,170
including the phone you just mentioned.

148
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:41,870
I did sell it,

149
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,590
but I bought it back

150
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,630
right away,

151
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:45,670
because I knew

152
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,350
if I sold that phone,

153
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,550
I wouldn't have evidence

154
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:49,720
of Yang Weida harassing me.

155
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,150
That means this phone

156
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,230
has not always been with you?

157
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:55,730
So, it went through the second-hand market.

158
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,130
As we all know,

159
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,970
when we sell a phone,

160
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,810
we usually

161
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,030
delete all personal information beforehand,

162
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,670
right?

163
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,470
I was in a hurry to get money,

164
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,530
so I forgot to erase it.

165
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,500
Forgot?

166
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,850
But those people who sell used phones

167
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:14,590
would delete it.

168
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,670
The first thing they do

169
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,790
is to erase all the information

170
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,920
from the phone,

171
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,590
right?

172
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:20,930
When I sold it,

173
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,470
I bought it back immediately,

174
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,910
so he didn't have time to erase it.

175
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:26,000
Anyway, these messages are still here.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,870
Alright, let me ask you another question.

177
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,630
Are these

178
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,090
all the messages

179
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,419
between you and the defendant?

180
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,120
Oh no.

181
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,980
Is there anything else?

182
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,110
Didn't she tell us that's everything?

183
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,370
Your Honor.

184
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:52,570
We have new evidence to present to the court.

185
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,830
Your Honor, the deadline for presenting evidence has passed.

186
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,040
Plaintiff's attorney,

187
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,190
you've always emphasized

188
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,640
bringing in new witnesses to testify.

189
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,790
According to the Supreme People's Court's provisions on the application

190
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,620
of the Civil Procedure Law

191
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,350
of the People's Republic of China,

192
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,110
Article 99, Paragraph 3,

193
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,560
the application to present rebuttal evidence

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,620
is not limited by the previously determined deadline.

195
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,650
Your Honor.

196
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,750
Do I need to reapply for an extension to present evidence?

197
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,310
You can submit it in court.

198
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,720
Your Honor.

199
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,710
This is the record of the text messages

200
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,930
between the witness and the defendant in 2016,

201
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,160
duly notarized.

202
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,350
From this record,

203
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,870
it's clear

204
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,310
that the witness,

205
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,780
using alleged sexual harassment as an excuse,

206
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,850
repeatedly extorted my client,

207
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,990
with the amounts

208
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,550
escalating each time,

209
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,780
reaching an astonishing one million in the end.

210
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,500
Secretary.

211
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,410
Please show the evidence to the witness.

212
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,510
Witness.

213
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
These messages are from you, right?

214
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,260
Yes.

215
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,470
After Yang Weida raped me,

216
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,260
he lied,

217
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,050
saying his relationship with his wife was bad

218
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:31,050
and he would divorce her to marry me.

219
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,690
Then he tricked me

220
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:37,150
into having relations with him repeatedly.

221
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,680
But later,

222
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,830
I found out he had no intention of marrying me.

223
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,110
Instead, he fired me from the company.

224
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,770
I just wanted to find him

225
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,660
and claim some compensation for mental distress.

226
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,590
Your Honor.

227
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,430
The evidence presented by the defendant

228
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,590
precisely proves

229
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,990
that the defendant deceived the witness with lies

230
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,240
and engaged in an improper sexual relationship with her.

231
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,870
Before the sexual relationship occurred,

232
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,190
the defendant had subjected the witness

233
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,590
to prolonged sexual harassment.

234
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,000
No.

235
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,710
These text messages can at most prove

236
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,310
that they had a sexual relationship.

237
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,680
As for who harassed whom

238
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,050
or who seduced whom

239
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,830
before the relationship,

240
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,890
that's uncertain.

241
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,510
Plaintiff's attorney,

242
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,190
you presented the later text messages between them

243
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,320
after they had a sexual relationship.

244
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,480
We obtained the earlier messages.

245
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,710
These two parts, combined together,

246
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:22,710
clearly outlined the development of their relationship

247
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:24,440
—harassment first, then rape.

248
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,360
You can't only acknowledge the latter part as rape

249
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,460
and ignore the prior sexual harassment.

250
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,470
No, we have never admitted the rape.

251
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,360
We only acknowledge

252
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,420
that they had a sexual relationship.

253
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,950
As for the two parts of the messages

254
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,110
you mentioned,

255
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,470
I'd like to remind the court

256
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,760
that they can't be proved

257
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,230
to come from the same phone.

258
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,630
As I questioned earlier,

259
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,950
the witness's phone went through the second-hand market.

260
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,670
Also, we checked with the communication company,

261
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,870
and the messages provided by the other party

262
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,330
have no original records,

263
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:52,930
while ours

264
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,450
do.

265
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,740
Defense attorney, any further questions?

266
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,990
Yes.

267
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:21,840
Your Honor.

268
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,680
Yang Weida is not a perfect man.

269
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,110
He couldn't resist temptation

270
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:28,710
and had a sexual relationship with the witness.

271
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,770
That was his fault,

272
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,720
but he immediately

273
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,920
confessed to his wife

274
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:34,770
and gained her forgiveness.

275
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,710
Now, looking at the witness,

276
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,880
she deliberately seduced Mr. Yang Weida

277
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,530
and extorted him repeatedly,

278
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,020
receiving a total of 250,000 yuan

279
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,360
from him.

280
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,600
She spent all this money

281
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,990
on drugs,

282
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,460
and in fact,

283
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,320
the witness's behavior constitutes extortion, a crime.

284
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,900
If it weren't for Mr. Yang Weida's leniency

285
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,420
and overlooking her past actions,

286
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,230
she would have been reported to the police long ago.

287
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:58,080
In that case,

288
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,430
she wouldn't have the chance

289
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,720
to sit in court today,

290
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,070
confidently committing perjury.

291
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:03,110
Your Honor.

292
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,990
The opposing attorney is not questioning the witness.

293
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,650
He's expressing his opinion.

294
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,580
Defense attorney, do you have any more questions?

295
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,640
Yes.

296
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:18,970
Witness.

297
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,780
Did you come to testify today

298
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,110
because you ran out of money for drugs?

299
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,430
-That's why you want to get some from Yang...
-Your Honor.

300
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,590
The opposing attorney is attacking the witness.

301
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,190
No.

302
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,070
Yang Weida raped me.

303
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,780
I was raped.

304
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,710
Yang Weida

305
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,350
is a beast.

306
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,860
What a real drama.

307
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,480
[Jingbei Court]

308
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,980
The court believes

309
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,070
there isn't enough evidence

310
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,680
to prove the alleged sexual harassment by the plaintiff.

311
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,870
Therefore,

312
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:19,320
the court rules to

313
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,420
dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit

314
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,700
in accordance with the law.

315
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,920
The plaintiff is responsible for the case acceptance fee of 500 yuan.

316
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,940
The court is adjourned.

317
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,380
Guo Yu.

318
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,350
Explain it to us.

319
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,550
Explain it.

320
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,430
Are you still a human?

321
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,420
Why not?

322
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,470
Am I not Unscrupulous Chen?

323
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:39,340
What?

324
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,230
You came all the way here in the middle of the night

325
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:42,230
to scold me?

326
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,790
You deserve much worse than me scolding you.

327
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,710
How could you take Yang Weida's money

328
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,230
without a clear conscience?

329
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,240
Why can't I take Yang Weida's money

330
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,020
with a clear conscience?

331
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,270
I did my job.

332
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,220
I won the lawsuit

333
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,480
because of my ability.

334
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:57,370
Why did you come here to challenge me?

335
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,770
You're Yang Weida's lawyer. That's right.

336
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,140
It's your duty

337
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,410
to defend him.

338
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,830
But how could you

339
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,310
play such dirty tricks in court?

340
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,830
Your tactics against Xia Linlin were heartless.

341
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,190
Do you have any humanity left?

342
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,450
If I had humanity, I wouldn't be called Unscrupulous Chen.

343
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,480
Ms. Luo,

344
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,710
do you still not know

345
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,470
how you lost the lawsuit?

346
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,110
I admit

347
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,240
Xia Linlin hid the content of the messages from us.

348
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,580
It was our negligence at work.

349
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,400
But given how Yang Weida

350
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,500
harmed Xia Linlin,

351
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,600
you still forced her to embarrass herself in court.

352
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,870
Do you realize the additional damage

353
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,660
you caused to her?

354
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,830
Do you even have a conscience?

355
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,170
You're wrong.

356
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,880
Xia Linlin

357
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,130
was the witness you brought.

358
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,760
She's not the plaintiff.

359
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,680
Your client's name is Guo Yu.

360
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,990
You should prioritize

361
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,250
Guo Yu's interests.

362
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,490
Xia Linlin is pitiful, I admit,

363
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,430
so what?

364
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,960
You're a lawyer.

365
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:59,870
A lawyer

366
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,280
shouldn't let their sympathy

367
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,100
influence their judgment.

368
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:05,640
Xia Linlin

369
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,869
concealed

370
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,540
all the unfavorable message content.

371
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,160
It's understandable from a human perspective,

372
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,220
but what about you?

373
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:13,270
You're Guo Yu's lawyer.

374
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,000
Because you sympathized with Xia Linlin,

375
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,710
you ignored all potential risks

376
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:18,560
and failed to protect your client's interests.

377
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,040
It was your fault.

378
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,510
Also,

379
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,310
why are you here arguing with me?

380
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,780
What are you arguing for?

381
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,270
If you have time to argue,

382
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,410
why don't you persuade Guo Yu

383
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,610
to appeal?

384
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:33,070
If you think Yang Weida is guilty,

385
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,110
put your energy

386
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,550
into finding evidence to nail him,

387
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,510
instead of coming here

388
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,230
to seek for justice.

389
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:42,310
Also,

390
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,270
don't you call me Unscrupulous Chen?

391
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,470
Well, maybe I am unscrupulous.

392
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,800
I still have plenty of tricks up my sleeve.

393
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,210
You want justice, huh?

394
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,190
Put aside those

395
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,950
amateur overflowing sympathies.

396
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,510
Win against me first.

397
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,900
If you think Yang Weida is guilty,

398
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,960
put your energy

399
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,310
into finding evidence to nail him,

400
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,420
instead of coming here

401
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,070
to seek for justice.

402
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,660
Chen Shuo was right.

403
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,430
We indeed lost our judgment

404
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,710
because of Xia Linlin's evidence

405
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,310
and failed to make the best decision for Guo Yu.

406
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:26,750
I...

407
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,270
I even went

408
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,230
to give Unscrupulous Chen a piece of my mind.

409
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,830
Look at me.

410
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,620
What a solid comeback from him.

411
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,150
He left me speechless.

412
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,680
I wished I could find a hole

413
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,910
to crawl into.

414
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,670
I was acting I couldn't handle defeat, right?

415
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,670
Yeah, you're quite bad at handling defeat.

416
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,470
If I weren't Guo Yu's lawyer

417
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:50,920
and sitting in the spectator's seat,

418
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,830
I would've applauded Chen Shuo

419
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:55,880
for this splendid victory.

420
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,260
Let's toast to Unscrupulous Chen.

421
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,680
I wonder how Guo Yu is feeling tonight.

422
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,120
She must be going through a rough time.

423
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,980
I hope she can be stronger than us.

424
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,890
Why must she be strong?

425
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:26,550
It was our fault,

426
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,830
not hers.

427
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,990
Do you think she will appeal?

428
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,990
Probably not.

429
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,940
The case has already ended up like this. There's no need to.

430
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,880
It's just hard to accept.

431
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,290
Here she comes.

432
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,630
Guo Yu.

433
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,470
Guo Yu.

434
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:07,710
What do you want to say about this verdict?

435
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:08,570
Say something.

436
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,310
Guo Yu.

437
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,470
Say something.

438
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,840
We've been waiting for you.

439
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,460
What do you want to say? Say something.

440
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:16,950
Stop filming.

441
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,720
Excuse me. Stop filming.

442
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,990
Guo Yu! Guo Yu!

443
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,300
Guo Yu! Guo Yu!

444
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
Guo Yu.

445
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,230
I'm a lawyer.

446
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:24,910
My client

447
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,230
has no obligation to accept your interview.

448
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,690
Stop harassing her, okay?

449
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,800
Guo Yu, say something.

450
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,320
Guo Yu, say something.

451
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,400
Ms. Luo. Ms. Qiu.

452
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,800
Take a seat anywhere.

453
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,550
Guo Yu.

454
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,230
Are you

455
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,810
planning to pack up and return to your hometown?

456
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,470
Are you…

457
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,640
Are you going to give up?

458
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,270
I lost.

459
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:57,710
Guo Yu.

460
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:00,110
Actually, we still have a chance to appeal.

461
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:01,540
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

462
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,310
thank you for everything you've done for me.

463
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,910
I told you from the beginning

464
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:09,430
that I was prepared for this to be a lost case.

465
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:12,360
I just wanted to give myself some closure.

466
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,750
Now, I have it,

467
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,920
even...

468
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,770
more than expected.

469
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,790
I understand now.

470
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,460
An egg can't beat a stone.

471
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,670
Arms can't twist a thigh.

472
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,280
Thank you for choosing to stand by the egg's side.

473
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,300
But, even with your support,

474
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,210
it's still not enough.

475
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,750
So,

476
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,100
it's all over.

477
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,290
I'm going back to my hometown.

478
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,310
Guo Yu.

479
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,960
Lawsuits may end,

480
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:49,520
but you don't have to go back to your hometown.

481
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,750
How can I stay in Jingbei

482
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,910
after this case?

483
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,480
You don't have to stay in Jingbei.

484
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,560
You can go somewhere else,

485
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,490
but don't go back to your hometown.

486
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,630
Once you go back,

487
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,540
it means you choose your original life.

488
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,040
Can you really adapt to the original environment?

489
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,190
Let me think about it.

490
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,200
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

491
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,990
thank you.

492
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,100
Guo Yu, take some time to think it over.

493
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,590
If you have any thoughts,

494
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,290
you can contact us anytime.

495
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,570
This is the price of idealism.

496
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:40,910
Qiu Hua.

497
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:42,990
It was my fault.

498
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,090
You've always been more practical than me.

499
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,250
I dragged you down.

500
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,020
But it doesn't matter.

501
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:55,370
"If a man in the morning learn the truth, he may die in the evening without regret."

502
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,060
Besides, we're just first-year lawyers.

503
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,990
It's never too late to understand.

504
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,480
From now on,

505
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,940
I'll never take cases like this.

506
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,670
Idealism

507
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,760
and the grand concept of justice?

508
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,500
I won't touch them even if you smash them on my head.

509
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,800
If I make the same mistake again,

510
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,710
just kick me.

511
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,030
When we get back,

512
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,700
let's find Mr. Tao and get back that patent case.

513
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,150
We're already in the league of lawyers

514
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,750
earning a few hundred thousand a year.

515
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,130
As long as we don't mess up,

516
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,270
making a few million a year

517
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,750
is just a matter of time.

518
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,130
Aim higher,

519
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,750
in ten years or so,

520
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,530
surpassing Fang Lihong might not be impossible.

521
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,820
Come to think of it,

522
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,950
it's quite optimistic.

523
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:47,710
By the way,

524
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,960
who was the fan

525
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,170
that gave you flowers at the courthouse yesterday?

526
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,320
Your boyfriend?

527
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,360
Not now.

528
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:58,470
Maybe in the future.

529
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,040
How is he?

530
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:02,220
He's okay.

531
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,210
He's nice to me.

532
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,150
He's loyal.

533
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,230
Come on, Qiu Hua.

534
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,620
Being loyal is enough for you?

535
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,990
I might not have been satisfied before,

536
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,590
but now that I think about it,

537
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:22,270
it might not be bad.

538
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:23,950
Why?

539
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,870
Security.

540
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,990
Well, as long as you want,

541
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,710
you can earn hundreds of thousands a year.

542
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,350
How can you not feel secure?

543
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,550
Come on.

544
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,950
Look at me,

545
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,590
carrying over ten million in debt.

546
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,430
I'm different from you.

547
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,280
His name is Zhang Quanquan.

548
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,630
This name sounds quite secure.

549
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,080
It sounds complete.

550
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,290
Don't blame me for being straightforward.

551
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,470
I just think you deserve better.

552
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,420
After going through so many things,

553
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,470
if you could choose again,

554
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,930
wouldn't you consider security?

555
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,640
I'm being nosy.

556
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,170
My bad.

557
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,320
I won't ask again.

558
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,780
I know you care about me.

559
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,560
You'll get through this bridge in a while,

560
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,630
then drop me off at the subway station.

561
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,430
Where are you going?

562
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,690
I have something to do.

563
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,990
Fine.

564
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,850
I didn't agree to take this case from the beginning.

565
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:40,090
Now what's the result?

566
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,760
We ended up with a drug addict

567
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,050
testifying in court,

568
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,670
making our law firm a laughingstock.

569
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,950
What a bad influence it made

570
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,610
to our company's reputation.

571
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,830
Han, it's just a losing case.

572
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,240
It is a case,

573
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,940
but is it just a case?

574
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:03,430
We can lose a case,

575
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,550
but we have to lose with dignity.

576
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,080
This case has a huge impact.

577
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,270
When I was in the audience,

578
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,280
I wanted to find a hole to crawl into.

579
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,710
Losing a case

580
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,360
is inevitable,

581
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,370
but as a lawyer,

582
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,540
you must choose the most favorable outcome

583
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,220
for yourself

584
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,240
and the client.

585
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,760
This case,

586
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,230
we discussed it in our partner meetings.

587
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,160
Ms. Fang.

588
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,630
You knew the chances of winning were slim.

589
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,440
Since the chances were small

590
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,330
and losing it would have a big impact,

591
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:36,870
why did you agree to take the case?

592
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,230
Lawyers can lose cases,

593
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,330
but they shouldn't lose stupidly.

594
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,820
This case is just a stupid loss.

595
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,030
I didn't agree them to file a lawsuit for sexual harassment from the beginning.

596
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:48,560
Alright.

597
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,770
It was all my fault.

598
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,090
I apologized.

599
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,630
Ms. Fang, you did nothing wrong.

600
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,490
What’s wrong with standing up for justice?

601
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,750
Can't you have a bit of a sense of justice?

602
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,990
You know those girls

603
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:02,390
were sexually harassed.

604
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,430
Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu did their best.

605
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,340
How could you still say that?

606
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:06,980
Xia Shu.

607
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,390
We indeed lost this case.

608
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,710
So what?

609
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,780
The path of justice is never straightforward.

610
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,080
You've watched too many TV dramas.

611
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,970
You're the one who's watched too many TV dramas.

612
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:21,910
When things went awry

613
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,470
for Luo Yingzi in court,

614
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,590
you seemed the happiest.

615
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,690
Why were you so delighted when our own side lost?

616
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,230
I think you just wanted our law firm to lose face.

617
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:32,710
Why are you coming at me?

618
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,380
Me? Happy?

619
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,730
Don't think I didn't see it.

620
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,390
Your smile reached your ears.

621
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,130
I really look down on people like you.

622
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,410
Ms. Fang.

623
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:43,810
You can't admit fault. You're not wrong.

624
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,600
Xia Shu.

625
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,010
We're just summarizing our work.

626
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,630
We lost the case.

627
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,300
We need to learn from it.

628
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,090
Sit down.

629
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,840
I'm so disappointed in you.

630
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,400
Xia Shu.

631
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,910
Xia Shu.

632
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,890
Please don't mind.

633
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,850
She's still too young.

634
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,230
How could you make her a partner before she even matured?

635
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,380
Han, what do you mean?

636
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,490
If you don’t want her to stay in the Criminal Defense Department,

637
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,610
she can join me.

638
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,560
I want her.

639
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,440
What did I say?

640
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:23,470
What did you say?

641
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,750
We indeed lost the case,

642
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
but we had already

643
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:43,150
foreseen this outcome beforehand.

644
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:44,820
As a lawyer,

645
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,060
aside from making money,

646
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,890
it's more important

647
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:49,420
to uphold the fairness and justice of the law.

648
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,570
These young people

649
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,770
insisted on taking this case,

650
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:55,390
and I agreed

651
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,410
and supported it.

652
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,000
Whatever consequences arise,

653
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,530
I'll take responsibility.

654
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:03,150
Don't mock them.

655
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,100
The enthusiasm of the young

656
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,610
needs protection and support, everyone.

657
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:15,690
Ms. Luo. Ms. Qiu.

658
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,410
Ms. Fang wants to see you.

659
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,920
Okay. Thank you.

660
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:29,390
Ms. Fang.

661
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,350
Come in.

662
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
You want to see me?

663
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,690
Do you have anything to tell me?

664
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,200
I should have listened to you

665
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,750
and only let her testify,

666
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,430
not appear in court.

667
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,870
Ms. Fang.

668
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,710
I was wrong.

669
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:09,850
It's good that you've recognized it.

670
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,430
It's all in the past.

671
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,110
Let's focus on what needs to be done next.

672
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:21,360
But I still feel uneasy.

673
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,070
After all,

674
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,080
everyone knows this thing did happen, right?

675
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,210
It's not embarrassing enough for you?

676
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,990
It's all in the past.

677
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,040
Don't mention it again.

678
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,710
Even if the client comes back,

679
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,650
don't bring it up again, understand?

680
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,600
I'll leave then.

681
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:48,770
Ms. Fang.

682
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,160
on my first day here,

683
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,980
in the lobby,

684
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,880
you said those things to us.

685
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,910
You said…

686
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,390
Face the reality, Yingzi.

687
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:13,050

Let's discuss the next steps

696
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,920

697

698
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,320

I'll talk to you later.

700
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,500
Sorry, Ms. Tian.

701
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,270
Have you been working in Mr. Yang's company?

702
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,930
I was in another department.

703
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,860
I just transferred to Mr. Yang's office not long ago.

704
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:09,160
Aunt, did you get stuck in traffic?

705
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,030
It was fine.

706
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,310
Hello, Mrs. Yang.

707
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,410
Don't call me Mrs. Yang.

708
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,670
My surname is Tian. Just call me Ms. Tian.

709
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,850
Please have a seat.

Cheers, Mrs. Liu.

719
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,989
You scared me.

720
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,360
Don't touch me.

721
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,239
-I’ll sue you for sexual harassment.
-I’m sorry.

722
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,370
Another drink for her. It's on me.

723
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:36,810
Okay.

724
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,900
Thanks, but no thanks.

725
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,670
I can afford this little bar tab.

726
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,000
Waiter, I don't want it.

727
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,600
Give him a drink on my tab.

728
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,940
Everyone can pay for it.

729
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:47,770
Why do you always treat me like this?

730
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,179
Because of that case?

731
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,210
Come on. It's just a case.

732
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,489
How about this?

733
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,520
You take me as your mentor,

734
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,630
and I'll teach you how to handle lawsuits.

735
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,750
I think you have potential.

736
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,230
Teach me how to handle lawsuits?

737
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,980
Don't be so arrogant.

738
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,880
You're just unscrupulous.

739
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,510
It's easy to learn to be unscrupulous.

740
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,990
Is this how you lost a case without grace?

741
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,820
Chen Shuo.

742
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:13,810
A word?

743
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,230
You changed your girlfriend in only a few days.

744
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,150
I'm impressed.

745
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,470
Girls chasing after me are lining up.

746
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,840
I can't get rid of them.

747
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,740
What should I do?

748
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,970
What's her name this time?

749
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,850
Is it Lili or Fangfang?

750
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,610
Qianqian, a flight attendant.

751
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:28,780
Cool.

752
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,630
Changing so frequently,

753
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,290
aren't you afraid of getting struck by lightning?

754
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:37,550
I'm still enjoying it.

755
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,630
Chen Shuo.

756
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,040
Who's this?

757
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,790
Let me introduce.

758
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:45,250
No need.

759
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,240
Chen Shuo.

760
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,440
We've been separated for so long.

761
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:53,090
Can you stop pestering me?

762
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,190
Goodbye, Qianqian.

763
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,420
What?

764
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,040
She and I...

765
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,430
Hello, Qiu Hua.

766
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,550
Hello, Yingzi.

767
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,410
Where are you?

768
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,760
Come back quickly.

769
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,550
I have something to tell you.

770
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,760
Are you a psycho?

771
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,650
Don't you know what time it is now?

772
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,400
It's almost ten.

773
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,750
Why are you still working overtime?

774
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,410
Working is for a better life.

775
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,390
If you can't sleep,

776
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,650
I'll pick you up and have a drink with you.

777
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,780
Come back soon.

778
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,540
I'll wait for you in the office.

779
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,150
Hurry up.

780
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,300
You're really nuts.

781
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,050
Ms. Qiu.

782
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,470
Ms. Qiu.

783
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,300
You're back.

784
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,510
Listen.

785
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,580
You

786
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,320
should really learn from me.

787
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,770
Even if I got beaten up,

788
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,370
I still dressed up and went out for a drink.

789
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,760
Yang Weida is doomed.

790
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,870
What?

791
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,700
Yang Weida is doomed.

792
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,700
He'll be deprived of everything.

793
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,760
He'll be broke.

794
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,430
Why?

795
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:23,850
His wife.

796
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,050
Come on. Sit down.

797
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,240
I'm telling you.

798
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,080
We will have a big case.

799
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,990
If we handle it well,

800
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:35,420
we can make a lot of money.

801
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,280
Wait, who will pay for it?

802
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,080
Mrs. Yang.

803
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,170
Wait, Qiu Hua.

804
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,510
What are you talking about?

805
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,640
I don't understand.

806
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,220
Do you remember

807
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,690
when we went to meet Yang Weida,

808
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,770
he had a new secretary?

809
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:48,450
Tian.

810
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,920
Mr. Yang.

811
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,330
Serve tea for the two lawyers.

812
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,410
Okay.

813
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,350
You mean the girl surnamed Tian?

814
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:56,870
Yes.

815
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,720
It was her.

816
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,880
I noticed her back then.

817
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,900
If even Guo Yu couldn't escape

818
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,970
Yang Weida's harassment,

819
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,160
she definitely couldn't either.

820
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,430
So, I kept an eye on her,

821
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,380
checked her background in secret,

822
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,550
and asked Guo Yu privately.

823
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,510
It turns out,

824
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,600
she's Mrs. Yang's niece,

825
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,720
also surnamed Tian.

826
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,100
No way.

827
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,390
What's wrong with Mrs. Yang?

828
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,800
Isn't she feeding her family

829
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,040
into the lion's den?

830
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,320
Exactly.

831
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,670
There could be two possibilities.

832
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,560
One is that

833
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,960
Mrs. Yang knows nothing,

834
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,540
and the other is that she knew everything

835
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,230
and intentionally placed her niece beside Yang Weida

836
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,560
to monitor him.

837
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:35,670
Think about it.

838
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,920
Yang Weida's secretaries have been changing

839
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,460
like a revolving door these years.

840
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,150
Right,.

841
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:42,010
The security camera in his office

842
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:44,480
couldn't be installed by himself, right?

843
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,900
It must be installed by his wife.

844
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:50,050
This woman

845
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,790
is really ruthless.

846
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,530
Qiu Hua, you are a genius.

847
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,800
There's more.

848
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,450
I secretly contacted Mrs. Yang

849
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,030
through Tian.

850
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,950
At first, she didn't say anything.

851
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,720
As soon as our trial was over,

852
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,470
she contacted me immediately.

853
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,890
It turned out to be exactly as I guessed.

854
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,270
Mrs. Yang knew about Yang Weida's bad habits a long time ago.

855
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,850
She hid it

856
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,680
because she had her own purpose.

857
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,290
What's her purpose?

858
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,290
This company belongs to Yang Weida,

859
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:24,980
but she wants a divorce.

860
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,720
So she has to get evidence

861
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,750
of Yang Weida's cheating on her and sexual harassment.

862
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,010
That way, she can negotiate a good price.

863
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,880
That's it.

864
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,850
Yang Weida founded this company.

865
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,070
Yang Weida is a major shareholder,

866
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,590
with him as the majority shareholder holding 35%.

867
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:40,110
His wife holds 7%.

868
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:41,600
Divorce is not her goal.

869
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,630
Her true goal

870
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,560
is to strip him of all his assets.

871
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
This woman is really something.

872
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,870
She hesitated before

873
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,950
because she was afraid

874
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,990
it wasn't enough to strip him clean.

875
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:58,000
It depends on what you think, Ms. Tian.

876
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,200
Do you want to

877
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,190
spend the rest of your life

878
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:03,750
with a cheater,

879
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,460
or choose to leave him

880
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,500
and start a new life?

881
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:10,600
Actually,

882
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,370
marriage doesn't necessarily have to involve a real husband and wife relationship.

883
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,100
You can consider this marriage

884
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:20,590
as a joint venture.

885
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,410
As long as it maximizes the benefits,

886
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,670
everyone can go their separate ways.

887
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,190
It depends on the risks

888
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,150
your partner brings

889
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,020
to the joint venture.

890
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,310
This incident with Guo Yu

891
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,370
should be a risk warning.

892
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:38,250
As long as your husband doesn't change his ways,

893
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,930
this risk will always exist.

894
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,330
This time it's Guo Yu; next time, it could be someone else.

895
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:44,920
Will your husband

896
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,670
be so lucky next time?

897
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:47,770
Besides,

898
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,440
you might just feel that

899
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,790
the current public opinion is favorable to your husband.

900
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,180
But you should understand,

901
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,940
public opinion is a fickle thing.

902
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,830
It can change at any time.

903
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,240
Your joint venture could be in danger

904
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,300
when that happens.

905
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,030
That makes sense.

906
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,020
If I choose to divorce,

907
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:13,860
what can you help me get from him?

908
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,880
What do you want from him?

909
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,220
I want everything,

910
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,110
his shares,

911
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,600
all of them transferred to my name.

912
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,300
Can you do that?

913
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:29,200
It depends on how much evidence you have.

914
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:32,990
A lot.

915
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,070
More than just Guo Yu

916
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,160
has been harassed.

917
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,950
Anyone who entered his office alone

918
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,420
was harassed.

919
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,590
None of the girls funded by the Weidai Foundation

920
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,260
were spared.

921
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,290
Is this enough evidence?

922
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,340
If that's the case,

923
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,150
personally,

924
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,710
I suggest not going to court.

925
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,440
Negotiate with him privately.

926
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:06,950
I agree with that.

927
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,440
I know him.

928
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:13,160
You can't push him too hard;

929
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,000
otherwise, he might react recklessly.

930
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,560
He'll either protect his reputation

931
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,400
or his money.

932
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:20,950
As for what I want,

933
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,430
you know best now.

934
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,180
So, we can only negotiate with him privately,

935
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,450
and use this evidence to force him to give up his shares

936
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,310
and leave with nothing.

937
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,260
You're impressive.

938
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,720
Ms. Tian, you're even more impressive.

939
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,060
Are you willing to take my case?

940
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,660
Of course.

941
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,600
How much do you want?

942
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:45,610
