[Episode 32]

4
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,670
I know you're angry about

5
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:38,440
what the Liu Ming family did.

6
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,770
But don’t change yourself because of them.

7
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,560
Don't worry.

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,229
I live for myself,

9
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,850
not for others.

10
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:04,420
It's not even worth it for a family like theirs.

11
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,960
But we can't

12
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,990
let the bad people live so brazenly.

13
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,810
This is irresponsible towards my family

14
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,760
and even the world.

15
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,060
I won't be like them.

16
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:18,990
I'm a lawyer.

17
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,060
I know what I should and shouldn't do.

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,530
I'm a grown woman now.

19
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,050
I’ll appeal when I go back to Jingbei,

20
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,990
and I'll also file a police report.

21
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,720
I won't let those bastards get away with it again.

22
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,860
Coming.

23
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,930
Coming.

24
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:08,960
Who is it?

25
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,240
I don't know.

26
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,370
Who are you looking for?

27
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:12,670
Yue Xiuqin lives here, right?

28
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,130
Yes.

29
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,350
Uncle and Auntie, someone wants to see you.

30
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,150
Who is it?

31
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,120
Who allowed you to come in?

32
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,670
How did you find us here?

33
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,700
What do you want?

34
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,130
You're eating.

35
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,280
You have the audacity to eat?

36
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,210
What do you want?

37
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:35,270
Aren't you afraid you'll be stuffed to death?

38
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:37,400
What are you doing? What are you doing?

39
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,230
You came here to cause trouble, right?

40
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,790
Do you believe I'll call the police now?

41
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,360
Go ahead.

42
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,570
My mom is lying in the hospital bed now.

43
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,829
Hurry up and call them.

44
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,670
You think you don't need to pay

45
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,000
for what you did, right?

46
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,720
Do you think Liu Ming can run away for good?

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,370
I’m here to tell you

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,920
I'll make Liu Ming pay 100 times more for

49
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,990
what you have done to me

50
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:58,840
and my parents.

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,880
Do you believe it?

52
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,550
I'll come to the police later.

53
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,830
Didn't he say he wouldn't come back?

54
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,150
I'll ask the police to bring him back.

55
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,090
You're bluffing!

56
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,410
What are you going to report to the police?

57
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,130
Besides, he took out a loan from the bank

58
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,440
against that house back then.

59
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,600
So you know.

60
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,060
Of course, you would also know

61
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,830
that he has mortgaged this house

62
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:17,709
for private loans.

63
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,390
Get your body in shape.

64
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:22,300
You will suffer when you go to jail to visit him.

65
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,010
Yingzi, Yingzi!

66
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,630
Wait, wait.

67
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,250
For the sake of my age,

68
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,970
please allow me to say something.

69
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,790
I'm sorry

70
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,120
about your mother.

71
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,490
I've already criticized her.

72
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,570
Really, I did.

73
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,460
I hope you can forgive her this time.

74
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,409
And I hope

75
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
you won't take it out on Liu Ming.

76
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,090
Mr. Liu,

77
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,210
I have always respected you.

78
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,350
I always thought

79
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,110
you were a weak man.

80
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,490
I thought there was probably nothing you could have done

81
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,210
to stop this from happening.

82
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,820
But now I know

83
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,490
you are the best actor.

84
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,640
You're wicked and evil!

85
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,250
Don't you know

86
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:06,910
what your wife did to my mom?

87
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,350
My mom is lying in a hospital bed.

88
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,790
Have you called her once?

89
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,370
Have you visited her once?

90
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,560
Maybe you're the mastermind

91
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,530
behind everything they did.

92
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,390
Now that things have come to this point,

93
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,230
you're afraid that I'll harm your son.

94
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,150
So you're starting to play a pitiful act with me, aren't you?

95
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,150
You make me sick!

96
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,850
How could you say that?

97
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,790
He's older than your father.

98
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,350
You should respect the elderly!

99
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,910
People can't do evil just because they're old.

100
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,990
You've lived your whole life.

101
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,500
Haven't you wrapped your heads around this?

102
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,450
Poor thing.

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,320
Go and tell your son.

104
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,710
Ask him to go as far as he can,

105
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,640
and don't get caught by the police.

106
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,630
Yingzi, Yingzi!

107
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,790
Why did you have to mess with her mom?

108
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,700
You know she's not easy to deal with.

109
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,710
Stop talking about that.

110
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:55,810
Hurry and call Liu Ming.

111
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,680
Think of a way.

112
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,040
Don't let him come back.

113
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,220
Mom.

114
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,190
You must live well

115
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,490
to see the downfall of bad guys.

116
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,470
I have to go.

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,600
I'll come to visit you often.

118
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,770
Dad, I gotta go.

119
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,460
Let me walk you downstairs.

120
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,350
No need, Dad.

121
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,030
Stay with Mom.

122
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,040
Okay.

123
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,720
Drive carefully.

124
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,690
Bye.

125
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:33,990
I'm going to work.

126
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,460
Go.

127
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,400
Yingzi.

128
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,830
Xia Shu.

129
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,680
He is our boyfriend, Zhang, right?

130
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,650
Hello.

131
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,750
Your boyfriend is so filial.

132
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,190
Yingzi, I heard about that matter.

133
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,090
Is there anything I can help with?

134
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,090
No need, Xia Shu.

135
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,900
Shandong is not within your father's sphere of influence.

136
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,230
My dad is acquainted with officials in Shandong as well.

137
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,150
I can help.

138
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,880
Xia Shu, just take care of yourself.

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,210
Wait, who told you that?

140
00:07:58,409 --> 00:07:59,710
Didn't you say you wanted to appeal?

141
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:00,830
Qiu Hua told Ms. Fang,

142
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,090
and she mentioned it during the meeting.

143
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,680
You didn't see Han.

144
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,790
He was so gleeful.

145
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,850
What else do you expect

146
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,410
from a man like him?

147
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,910
The two most important things in life

148
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,600
are to make yourself happy,

149
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,170
and the other is to make those who hate you

150
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,280
less happy.

151
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,120
You're so right.

152
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:20,550
Yingzi, how can we make ourselves happy

153
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,740
and make those people unhappy?

154
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,700
Xia Shu, there are people who hate you in this world?

155
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,179
Morning.

156
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
You're back.

157
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,230
The appeal was officially filed yesterday.

158
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,300
I've been working on the defense strategies

159
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,790
for Xu Jianshe's case these days.

160
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,590
Have you made all the arrangements at home?

161
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,240
Yes.

162
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,710
Did you file a police report?

163
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,550
I'll report it later.

164
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,320
These are the lists of reporting leads and evidence

165
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,370
that I've collected for you.

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,200
Take a look.

167
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,700
Okay, I'll get some water first.

168
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,520
Qiu Hua.

169
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:23,900
I...

170
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,310
I said I didn't want to report it earlier

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
because I wanted to catch Wen Li as well.

172
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Now I know...

173
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,440
Actually, you still couldn't bear to go after Liu Ming.

174
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,900
Yes.

175
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,140
I'm too cheap.

176
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:42,140
Although I know I should hate him,

177
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,830
I just can't do it.

178
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:47,310
I always want him to explain everything to my face.

179
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,230
Ms. Fang wants to see you once you come back.

180
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,430
You told her last time

181
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,230
that you didn't report to the police to catch Wen Li.

182
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,160
Don't change your decision again.

183
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,010
I'll go see her now.

184
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,250
Can't you say more harsh words to me?

185
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,110
I dare not.

186
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:08,430
You need life to teach you lessons

187
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,090
so that you can learn and grow.

188
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,800
Then what if she asks me why I suddenly filed a police report?

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
What should I say?

190
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,060
It's up to you.

191
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,570
You are unbelievable.

192
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,030
I'm going.

193
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,610
Ms. Fang.

194
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,730
Have a seat.

195
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,980
How is your mother?

196
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,940
She's not doing well.

197
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,450
The doctor said

198
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:56,460
that she might never wake up.

199
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,080
Have you arranged everything?

200
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:01,980
Yes.

201
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,910
It won't affect my work.

202
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,130
Why did you suddenly decide to appeal?

203
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,250
I can't let the bad guy get away with it so easily.

204
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,230
Since you have appealed,

205
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,500
we need to find a way to achieve a different outcome.

206
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,030
If you don't call the police

207
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,740
to report that this loan

208
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,300
was not processed legally,

209
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,560
there won't be a different outcome from the appeal.

210
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,100
I'll file a police report.

211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:34,920
Okay.

212
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,720
Ms. Fang,

213
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,280
you're right.

214
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:42,720
The loan has a problem,

215
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,500
but it's almost impossible

216
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,230
to convince the court to rule that it's invalid.

217
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,090
I'm just buying myself more time.

218
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,070
So,

219
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,410
we'll most likely lose the second instance again.

220
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,750
So, I won't let you represent me in the second instance.

221
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,250
What?

222
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,000
Are you afraid that I can't afford to lose?

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,470
No.

224
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,840
You're still

225
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,240
my divorce lawyer.

226
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,430
You can represent me in the divorce court.

227
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,150
No.

228
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,280
I'll continue representing you for the second instance.

229
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,440
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

230
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,670
I'll draft a contract for...

231
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,250
I'll represent you for free.

232
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,090
All of these, right?

233
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,050
Yes.

234
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,220
I filed the report.

235
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:09,820
Qiu Hua.

236
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,570
Thanks to the list of evidence, you sorted out,

237
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,570
it went very well.

238
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,200
Don't worry.

239
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:20,380
There's a good chance that the case will be made.

240
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,560
That's it.

241
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,440
[Chen Shuo]

242
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,990
Unscrupulous Chen, what's up?

243
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,590
Righteous Luo, I just want to ask you one thing.

244
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,870
Why did you decide to appeal

245
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,030
at the last minute?

246
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,570
Haven't you lost enough?

247
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:57,120
No.

248
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,630
Anything else?

249
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,410
Fine.

250
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,200
Wait for me to beat you again.

251
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,910
I have faith in you, lad.

252
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,720
The police also hope

253
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,480
that we can provide more clues.

254
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,930
Liu Ming is in America for sure.

255
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,590
But what he did

256
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:23,050
isn't enough for an international manhunt.

257
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,630
But we have no clue about Wen Li whatsoever.

258
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,240
Yingzi, what's up?

259
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,630
Has your classmate in America

260
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,830
found anything about Wen Li yet?

261
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,080
He said he only saw

262
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,990
Liu Ming living there alone,

263
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,230
looking like hell.

264
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,510
He didn't find a woman by his side.

265
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,320
Where did she go?

266
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,200
[Jingbei City No. 2 Prison]

267
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,020
Yingzi.

268
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,570
Thank you for coming to visit me again.

269
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,260
Actually, you don't have to come.

270
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm a walking corpse

271
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,360
now that I've come to this point.

272
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,460
Sun,

273
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,000
I heard from the prison official

274
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,450
that you attempted suicide.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,030
You really don't have to do such a thing

276
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,340
for someone like her.

277
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:44,360
It's not worth it.

278
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:47,630
You only have a year and a half left on your sentence.

279
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,160
As long as you perform well,

280
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,320
you may be discharged in a year.

281
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,490
One year later,

282
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,110
you'll be a great man once more.

283
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,380
Great man?

284
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,420
Sun,

285
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,530
I really need your help now.

286
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,310
Although you are behind the bar,

287
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,880
if you are willing to help me,

288
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,540
we can still catch her.

289
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,410
How? Tell me.

290
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,410
The problem we have now

291
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:33,060
is that we've lost track of her.

292
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,190
She's not in the US now.

293
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,310
She disappeared.

294
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:38,110
Has she contacted you recently?

295
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,960
We think she might have returned to China.

296
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,440
I'm afraid we'll miss the chance.

297
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,560
I received a letter from her

298
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,230
a few days ago.

299
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,240
She's already back in the country.

300
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,770
She said she came back to save me.

301
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,030
To save me?

302
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:59,390
She didn't even come to visit me.

303
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,710
She asked me to introduce her to a friend of mine, Ding Zhaoguang.

304
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,319
The famous Mr. Ding

305
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,339
from the Boshi Group in Shanghai.

306
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,310
I guess

307
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,740
he is her next target.

308
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,270
She will be so wrong

309
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,040
if she's going to go after Mr. Ding.

310
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,069
Mr. Ding is not like me.

311
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,960
He’s a ruthless

312
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,020
and very strict man, too.

313
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,490
He won't fall for her tricks.

314
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,560
Did you

315
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,290
reply to her?

316
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,210
Not yet.

317
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,390
I wanted to scold her in the letter.

318
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,230
But when I put pen to paper.

319
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,270
I felt...

320
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,300
I felt all of my blood rushing to my head.

321
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
I haven't written it yet.

322
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,960
Fortunately, you didn't.

323
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:45,940
Sun.

324
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,680
Don’t worry.

325
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,800
We should work together

326
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,160
to get back all the money

327
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,590
that she stole from you

328
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:54,480
and me

329
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,460
and led her to her downfall.

330
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,610
We have to make her pay for what she has done.

331
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,630
I'll do whatever it takes

332
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:04,000
to make her pay.

333
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:08,120
When you were in trouble,

334
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,310
how much of the money you transferred to her

335
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,250
did you get back?

336
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,200
Not even a penny.

337
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,410
At that time, I firmly believed in our love.

338
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,730
I thought that when I was free,

339
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,240
we could share the money.

340
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,430
So,

341
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,200
even if I were sentenced,

342
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,740
and went to jail,

343
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,580
I didn't disclose where the money went.

344
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,310
You...

345
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,870
Ever since the accident,

346
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,920
has Xiao Yuan come to visit you?

347
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,600
No.

348
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,640
After I was in jail,

349
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,560
Xiao Yuan found out about her.

350
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,050
So, she divorced me.

351
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,600
Since then, I've never seen her again.

352
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:01,820
I think

353
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,840
she must hate my guts right now.

354
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,160
If you want to punish Wen Li,

355
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,180
we need Xiao Yuan's help with this.

356
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,360
Can you write a letter to Xiao Yuan?

357
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,890
You can ask me to give it to her.

358
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,260
Let me talk to her.

359
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,420
I'll help you get Xiao Yuan's forgiveness for you

360
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,620
and ask her to help me.

361
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,400
She is also your father's student.

362
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,930
I don't think she will reject you.

363
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,080
Okay.

364
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:35,940
I'll write it.

365
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,790
About the letter to Wen Li,

366
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,230
wait for my message.

367
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,760
As long as the timing is right,

368
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,150
you can write to her.

369
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,580
You need to clearly state in the letter

370
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,230
that you will be introducing Mr. Ding to her.

371
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,160
What do you want?

372
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,300
As soon as she meets Mr. Ding,

373
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,990
we'll find out where she is.

374
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,670
As long as I know where she is,

375
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:03,720
don't worry.

376
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,950
I won't let her run away this time.

377
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,920
You may not believe me.

378
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:21,300
Later, as I carefully recalled my memories with her,

379
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,040
I realized that I actually knew very little about her.

380
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,160
I was so stupid.

381
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,020
I'm almost 50 years old,

382
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:33,850
yet I got carried away by a little girl.

383
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,130
I transferred so much money

384
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,620
to her

385
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,020
when I didn't even know her well.

386
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,980
It's too late for me to regret now.

387
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,190
Yingzi, you know.

388
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,840
I wanted to kill myself

389
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,310
because I was so ashamed.

390
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,540
It's been over a year.

391
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,700
Don't beat yourself up for that.

392
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,440
It's all in the past.

393
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,490
You shouldn't even consider ending your life

394
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:07,080
over a woman like her.

395
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,610
I can only say that you fell in love

396
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,400
with someone who doesn't deserve your love.

397
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,110
Can you remember something for me?

398
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,470
When you were together,

399
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,140
are there any details that would show her background?

400
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:27,450
I've thought about it.

401
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,200
There's only one thing.

402
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,990
What?

403
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:33,610
There was a time

404
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:37,270
when we were planning to have a date at a hotel.

405
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,250
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

406
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,580
I've booked a room.

407
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,530
Let's go.

408
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,730
Are you tired today?

409
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:50,780
No.

410
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,240
Huading.

411
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,130
Let's go somewhere else.

412
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,780
Why?

413
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,590
This hotel is very nice,

414
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,970
and its rooms are spacious.

415
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:07,690
Besides,

416
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,740
I've already opened a bottle of wine.

417
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,470
An '82 wine.

418
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,100
Let's go.

419
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,220
Hello, please take a look at our products.

420
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,900
No need.

421
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,980
Let's go somewhere else.

422
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,670
I don't really like this place.

423
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,870
And I'm not feeling well now.

424
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,710
Yes, I think they're so alike.

425
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,020
She ignored me when I said hello to her.

426
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,680
Why didn't she say hello to me?

427
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,790
I don't know.

428
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,470
She didn't tell me the reason,

429
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,880
and I didn't ask.

430
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,790
But I have a strong feeling

431
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:48,670
that she has something to do with that cosmetics company.

432
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:49,730
She probably knows

433
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,930
those people.

434
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,160
That cosmetics company.

435
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:56,650
Do you still remember the name of that brand?

436
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,800
No.

437
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,290
Men don't care about cosmetics.

438
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,940
It's okay.

439
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,680
As long as you remember the date.

440
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:10,770
As long as you remember the date,

441
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,830
there should be records at the hotel.

442
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,440
May 14, right?

443
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,170
Yes, May 14.

444
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,670
The company holding the event here was

445
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,350
Cornell Cosmetics Co., Ltd.

446
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,390
Please wait a moment.

447
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,260
Can you tell me if I spelled the name correctly?

448
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,010
Yes, that's right.

449
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:34,860
Okay, thank you.

450
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,790
You're welcome.

451
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,040
Xiao Yuan.

452
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,220
Yingzi, long time no see.

453
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,730
What would you like to drink?

454
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,070
A cup of Americano.

455
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:55,790
Americano.

456
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,610
Okay.

457
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,630
How is your dad?

458
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,230
He's fine.

459
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,070
I always said I would visit him.

460
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,700
But I'm busy. I don't have time.

461
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,540
It's okay.

462
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,470
My dad always said

463
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,070
that those who don't have time to go back to school

464
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,430
or can't attend the reunion

465
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,690
are most likely the ones who have made it.

466
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,260
Mr. Luo is still so sharp-tongued.

467
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,620
Actually,

468
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,280
when we were at school,

469
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,010
we thought he should teach Economic Law

470
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,430
instead of Criminal Law.

471
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,390
What a pity.

472
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,040
What he knows

473
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:28,060
are all the words in a textbook.

474
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,160
Aren't you afraid I'll tell him?

475
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:29,900
No.

476
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,370
By the way,

477
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,120
why did you want to see me today?

478
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,700
I met Mr. Sun.

479
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,460
Mr. Sun knew he was wrong.

480
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,650
So, he wrote you a letter

481
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,050
asking for your forgiveness.

482
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:49,130
Well,

483
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,550
you'll be disappointed.

484
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,820
I won't accept anyone's pleas on his behalf.

485
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,400
Let's talk about something else.

486
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,410
Yuan,

487
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:02,250
do you want to hear me out?

488
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,240
I don't.

489
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,410
Okay.

490
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,630
I...

491
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,270
married him for 20 years.

492
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,150
We started from scratch

493
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,910
and had two children.

494
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,160
But he betrayed me

495
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,040
for a woman

496
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,880
who he barely knew for a year.

497
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,350
But the most irritating thing is

498
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,690
that he deeply hurt my two children.

499
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,600
I now need to raise my children alone

500
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,950
and clean up the mess he left behind.

501
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,070
So, to me,

502
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,550
he is dead.

503
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:43,750
He no longer exists in this world.

504
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,120
I understand.

505
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,440
But are you going to

506
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,070
forgive the woman

507
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,310
who hurt your family?

508
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,420
No way.

509
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,300
That woman is Wen Li.

510
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,550
Not only did she seduce Mr. Sun,

511
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,440
but she also seduced my husband.

512
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,720
Not only did Mr. Sun transfer his property to her

513
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,180
but my husband also did the same thing

514
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,250
and went abroad with her.

515
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,830
We are both victims.

516
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,800
Hello, ma'am, your coffee.

517
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:24,830
Thank you.

518
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,880
Men are all the same.

519
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,030
We gave our everything to them,

520
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,890
but they betrayed us

521
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,050
for a woman like her.

522
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,860
But I can't accept it.

523
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,080
I must find her

524
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,790
and let her get what she deserves.

525
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,500
Will you help me?

526
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,130
How?

527
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,310
Mr. Sun has illegally transferred a lot of assets abroad

528
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:52,630
behind your back.

529
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,570
But during that time,

530
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,950
you were still married.

531
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,790
So, you have the right to reclaim it.

532
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,100
If you are willing to visit Mr. Sun in prison,

533
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,320
he'll tell you the whereabouts and channels of the money.

534
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,460
But

535
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,040
it depends on you whether you want to get it back.

536
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,010
What about you?

537
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,770
After you visit Mr. Sun,

538
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,180
if you trust me,

539
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,470
I hope

540
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,330
you can tell me everything

541
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,560
that Mr. Sun told you.

542
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,440
I'll find a way to deal with that woman.

543
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,150
Sure.

544
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,280
Han.

545
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:40,930
Fang.

546
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,900
Do you know that these two women

547
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,920
are crazy about becoming famous?

548
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,600
Who? Luo Yingzi?

549
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,130
Who else could it be?

550
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,650
This is their defense for the second instance.

551
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,640
Fortunately, I'm the head of the Criminal Defense Department,

552
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,620
so they have no choice but to hand it over to me.

553
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,880
That's how I found out.

554
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:00,950
They're too busy fishing for fame

555
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,750
and don't care about the client.

556
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,920
Look.

557
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,010
Let me point it out for you.

558
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,860
Here.

559
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,190
Participated in the assault, and was identified by witnesses

560
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,930
as the person responsible for causing fatal injuries.

561
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,880
They're actually going to plead not guilty.

562
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,610
If they fail,

563
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,670
the client will be sentenced to life.

564
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,430
They only care about their fame.

565
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,900
Where are the interests of the client?

566
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,180
You must deal with this kind of matter seriously.

567
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,640
You two, come to my office.

568
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,680
No, well...

569
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,120
Then you talk to them.

570
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,000
Don't let them misunderstand that I'm seeking revenge against them.

571
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,410
Mr. Han.

572
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,690
Have a seat.

573
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,790
Why are you alone? Where is Luo Yingzi?

574
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,320
She went out for something.

575
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,430
Qiu Hua.

576
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,690
I've read your defense.

577
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:03,100
I think it's too risky

578
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:06,600
to plead not guilty in this case.

579
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,110
We have to be responsible for the client.

580
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,670
I personally suggest

581
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,270
that you make two plans.

582
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:16,090
One is preparing to plead not guilty,

583
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,930
and the other is preparing to plead a misdemeanor.

584
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,330
That's what we thought in the beginning.

585
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:24,160
We also explained the risks to the client.

586
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,310
But our client is insisting.

587
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,440
He doesn't allow us to plead down to a misdemeanor.

588
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,200
Why? Why is he so insistent?

589
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:31,650
Optimistically,

590
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,250
maybe he is really innocent.

591
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,320
Even if he is innocent,

592
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,550
we need evidence

593
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,380
to prove his innocence in court.

594
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:39,950
Yes.

595
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,140
Ms. Fang.

596
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:43,910
We believe that there is a chance

597
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:45,870
to win this case if we plead not guilty.

598
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,640
After all, the evidence against him

599
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,590
is weak.

600
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,420
The prosecution's job is to prove his guilt.

601
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,820
If we can prove

602
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:55,110
their evidence won't hold up reasonably,

603
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,220
according to the benefit of the doubt,

604
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,950
there's a possibility that he will be acquitted.

605
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,160
To say the least,

606
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,760
even if we don't plead for a misdemeanor,

607
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,070
as long as the court thinks

608
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,270
that our reasonable doubt makes sense,

609
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,080
it's possible to reduce his sentence.

610
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,960
Okay.

611
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,570
Just do it.

612
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,440
But you must

613
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:19,210
explain the risks of pleading not guilty

614
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,770
to the client's family.

615
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,060
They tend to be emotional.

616
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,850
Got it.

617
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,330
You can go now.

618
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,910
Okay.

619
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,370
We have explained

620
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:36,410
the risks of pleading not guilty to you.

621
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,240
You still insist, right?

622
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:38,800
Yes.

623
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:40,350
I'm warning you.

624
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,880
If you go against my will

625
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,500
and plead for a misdemeanor,

626
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,670
I'll sue you.

627
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,160
Okay.

628
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,710
Mr. Xu,

629
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,240
we have drafted a confirmation letter to ensure

630
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,320
that you are fully informed about our defense strategies

631
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,650
and that you insist on us pleading not guilty on your behalf.

632
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:04,880
Take a look.

633
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,340
If you have no objections,

634
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,670
you can sign it.

635
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,350
Mrs. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

636
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,390
Hello, Mrs. Ma.

637
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,350
Why are you here?

638
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,310
What's the matter?

639
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,040
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

640
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:41,470
Well.

641
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,410
What's going on with Mr. Han?

642
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,500
You met Mr. Han?

643
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,890
He called me here.

644
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,640
Then he told me

645
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:50,750
that you two are young and inexperienced,

646
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,490
and you don't pay much attention to our case.

647
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,350
He said that there are some risks.

648
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,990
Doesn't he just want me

649
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,640
to hand the case to him?

650
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:57,790
And he told me

651
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,420
that the lawsuit sign amount of my Jianshe's case

652
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,550
is about 700,000 yuan to 800,000 yuan.

653
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,990
Are there any unspoken rules

654
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,960
in your firm?

655
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,690
Mrs. Luo, you have to tell me explicitly.

656
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,350
Otherwise, I'll feel uneasy.

657
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,600
Also, we've signed the contract.

658
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,960
If you suddenly raise the price,

659
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:14,300
-I... -Mrs. Ma.

660
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,880
Calm down.

661
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,400
Let me address

662
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,270
your concerns first.

663
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,790
Well, there are certain risks

664
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,920
for anyone

665
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,420
to take cases like Xu Jianshe's.

666
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,940
Mr. Han is indeed

667
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,130
a senior lawyer in our law firm.

668
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,680
But we've put a lot of effort

669
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,710
into this case.

670
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,450
Don't worry about us not paying enough attention.

671
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,620
About the legal fee,

672
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,330
I think that since we've set a number

673
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,730
from the start,

674
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,680
we won't change it.

675
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,490
It's also a matter of credibility

676
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,330
in what we do as human beings.

677
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,720
Of course,

678
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:52,340
whether you choose us

679
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,710
or other lawyers,

680
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:56,630
we understand.

681
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,680
Because it is a large sum of money

682
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,780
for you.

683
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,590
By the way,

684
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,830
we just came back from court.

685
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,680
We've submitted our defense.

686
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,780
Don't worry.

687
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:08,360
Should we go to court for the second instance?

688
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,910
Usually, we won't hold a court for the second instance.

689
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,280
Just need both parties to submit their defenses.

690
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,510
Don't worry, Mrs. Ma.

691
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,740
The judge in the second instance

692
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,670
will take our defenses seriously.

693
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:20,010
Are you still going to visit Jianshe again?

694
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,440
We may not visit him

695
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,410
until the second instance is over.

696
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,830
We're counting on

697
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,710
you, two lawyers.

698
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,030
Who else can I trust?

699
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,680
Please ask Mr. Han

700
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,950
to stop calling me.

701
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,500
I won't hire him.

702
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,080
Mrs. Ma, we're sorry.

703
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,750
We will also

704
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,210
talk to the firm about this.

705
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,690
We won't let this happen again.

706
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:45,840
Don't worry.

707
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,330
Okay, go on with your work.

708
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,550
Our case will rely on you.

709
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:51,670
I'll go back to raise money.

710
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,630
If there is any news,

711
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,270
we will call you as soon as possible.

712
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,030
Thank you.

713
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,670
Be careful.

714
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,310
Thank you.

715
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:56,860
Okay.

716
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,450
Bye.

717
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,330
Calm down.

718
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,940
It's lucky

719
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:08,370
to have a client who trusts us so much.

720
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:08,980
No.

721
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,480
Han

722
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,010
still wants to screw us.

723
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,440
He has done this many times.

724
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,030
You are...

725
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,380
I'm telling you. There's a ball of fire

726
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,500
right in my chest.

727
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,800
Don't let me see him.

728
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,489
If I see him,

729
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:21,020
I'll twist off his fat head.

730
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,219
Hello, Mr. Wang.

731
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,699
Forget it.

732
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,409
No.

733
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,389
Mr. Han.

734
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,360
You're back.

735
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,469
We have submitted our defense of Xu Jianshe's case

736
00:34:34,469 --> 00:34:36,530
to the court for the second instance.

737
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,150
Taking advantage of other's misfortune.

738
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,949
Do you enjoy it?

739
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:40,350
What do you mean, Mr. Han?

740
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:42,320
Nothing.

741
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,190
Just saying that.

742
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,429
No, you have to make it clear today.

743
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,440
We are doing our best

744
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,969
to defend our client.

745
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:51,110
What do you mean by, "taking advantage of other's misfortune"?

746
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,409
You just wanted to steal our case,

747
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:53,270
but you failed.

748
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,550
Look how old you are. Aren't you ashamed

749
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,150
of stealing opportunities from young people?

750
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,120
Luo Yingzi, what do you mean?

751
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,790
You know what I mean the most.

752
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,400
Mr. Han, don't think that just because

753
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,200
you're the head of the Criminal Defense Department, I'll do nothing.

754
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,000
If I find out

755
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:08,450
that you speak ill of us in front of my client again,

756
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,590
don't blame me for reporting you to the bar association.

757
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:11,520
Do you hear me?

758
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
Let's go, Qiu Hua.

759
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,440
Take a look.

760
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:24,520
Look.

761
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:26,630
This is how she talks to her senior.

762
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,440
Who taught you that?

763
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:30,770
Don't be angry.

764
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,880
Anger is bad for your health.

765
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
It's not worth being angry with him.

766
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:35,690
We won't live for over 100 years.

767
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,420
Why should we make ourselves suffer?

768
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,320
Whatever.

769
00:35:56,450 --> 00:35:57,010
Qiu Hua.

770
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:00,030
The second instance won't open a court session,

771
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,010
and we've only submitted written defense opinions.

772
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm a little worried.

773
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,590
If we were to lose,

774
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,170
Han would laugh at us.

775
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,690
But we have done what we should.

776
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:12,940
How about we come to see the judge?

777
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:13,870
We can explain

778
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,420
our opinions about the first instance to him.

779
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,970
It's hard to see the judges.

780
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,330
Let's meet him.

781
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,140
If we simply sit here,

782
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,470
we can only depend on

783
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,390
the judge's sense of responsibility and his attention.

784
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:33,650
Judges are humans too.

785
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,470
They doze off sometimes, right?

786
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,810
Okay, let's go.

787
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,200
I have to see the judge, no matter what.

788
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,140
Let's go.

789
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:52,220
[Jingbei Court]

790
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,170
[Meeting Room]

791
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,680
I'll go check.

792
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,100
Who is looking for Judge Wu Qili?

793
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,460
Hello, it's us.

794
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:23,330
It's you.

795
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,960
We're Xu Jianshe's lawyers.

796
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,350
Didn't you submit your defense opinions?

797
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,120
What else?

798
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,640
Please let Judge Wu know again

799
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,270
that we wish to meet with him.

800
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,750
We want to present our opinions on this case

801
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,090
to him.

802
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:37,880
Don't worry.

803
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:38,570
The judge will

804
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,490
carefully study your defense.

805
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,760
You'll see it once the verdict is announced.

806
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,670
Your opinions will

807
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:45,280
be reflected in the verdict.

808
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,110
I'm sorry.

809
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,440
Our client was sentenced to life in the first instance.

810
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,420
We believe there is a significant issue.

811
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,830
So we want to

812
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,310
express our opinions to the Judge in person.

813
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:57,160
Please tell the judge.

814
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,000
We won't take up much of his time.

815
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:00,870
I'm sorry. Judge Wu is in session.

816
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,340
He really doesn't have time.

817
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,460
Please leave.

818
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,470
I don't want to leave.

819
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,240
I think reading words

820
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,970
is different from hearing them.

821
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,060
Let's wait.

822
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:15,580
Okay.

823
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,160
Judge Liu is available.

824
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:25,850
Come with me.

Come with me.

834
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:56,840

I think so.

849
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,450
Hello.

850
00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:04,510
It's been five or six hours,

851
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,110
and you're still waiting here.

852
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:06,920
Yes, Miss.

853
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,560
This is the first time we've taken on such a big case.

854
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,760
It concerns a man's freedom and sentence.

855
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,550
We thought

856
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,790
we had to meet the judge, no matter what,

857
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,680
to present our defense in person.

858
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,240
Judge Wu has just come back from a case.

859
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,960
Hold on.

860
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
There's a chance.

861
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,460
Don't get too excited just yet.

862
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:35,090
Come in.

863
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,270
Judge Wu, why are you eating now?

864
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,800
They're here?

865
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,600
Let them in.

866
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,560
Come in.

867
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,280
Sorry.

868
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:43,950
Hello.

869
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,160
The last case took seven hours.

870
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,830
I didn't have time for lunch.

871
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:48,700
Sorry to bother you.

872
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,450
It's okay.

873
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,720
This way, your worries will be unnecessary.

874
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,290
Please trust the court.

875
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,500
Trust the law.

876
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:55,920
We will

877
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,420
take your defense seriously.

878
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,070
I'm sorry, Judge Wu.

879
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,420
It's not that we don't trust the court or the law.

880
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,840
But this case

881
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,460
is really important to us.

882
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,540
We're both new lawyers.

883
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,470
The defendant in this case

884
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,360
was sentenced to life in the first instance.

885
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,890
And now our client asks us to plead not guilty.

886
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,360
So, we would like to

887
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,790
present our defense opinions

888
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,820
to you.

889
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:20,350
Or we'll feel guilty.

890
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,550
I see.

891
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:22,470
Please sit down.

892
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:23,470
Sit down and talk.

893
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,050
Xu, you take notes.

894
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:25,520
Okay.

895
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,250
Here are your defense opinions.

896
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,210
Sit down and talk.

897
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,070
I'm listening.

898
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,210
Judge Wu.

899
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,600
We believe that in the first instance,

900
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,840
the fact that our client, Xu Jianshe, was the main offender

901
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:37,590
and that the victim

902
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,800
was beaten to death by Xu Jianshe

903
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,180
was not supported by sufficient evidence,

904
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,180
leaving room for reasonable doubt.

905
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,260
At the crime scene,

906
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,300
only Xu Jianshe

907
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,640
and another defendant, Zhang Yulin, were there.

908
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,570
The only direct evidence

909
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:52,350
that Xu Jianshe killed the victim

910
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,050
is Zhang Yulin's confession.

911
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,030
As a co-suspect,

912
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,720
the credibility of his confession is limited.

913
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,080
Besides his confession,

914
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,390
there is no other direct evidence

915
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,510
to prove that the fact of the first instance is true.

916
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:05,640
So the chain of evidence is not closed.

917
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,420
All right, I heard your opinions.

918
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,230
Go back.

919
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,680
Trust the law.

920
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,750
Trust us.

921
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,730
We'll do our job according to the law.

922
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:17,840
Judge Wu.

923
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,440
Strategically,

924
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,070
we should plead for a misdemeanor

925
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,170
for our client.

926
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,740
He insisted that he had gone there to stop the fight,

927
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,580
but on a dark night like that,

928
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,350
it's hard to say he wasn't involved in the fight.

929
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:33,750
We advised him repeatedly to allow us
to plead for a misdemeanor on his behalf.

930
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:35,640
But he insisted on pleading not guilty.

931
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,960
We've been discussing

932
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:39,680
why he is willing to take the risk

933
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,990
of insisting on his innocence.

934
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,690
I think there are only two reasons.

935
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,750
First,

936
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,230
he's really innocent.

937
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,450
Second,

938
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,180
he believes in the law.

939
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:54,390
Judge Wu, I hope

940
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,160
the law will live up to a man's expectations.
