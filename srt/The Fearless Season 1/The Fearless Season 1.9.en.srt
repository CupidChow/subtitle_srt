4
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,650
Don't even think about it.

5
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:38,750
The news about the bank

6
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,610
must be revealed by Mr. Han again.

7
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,990
What do you mean again?

8
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,140
What's wrong with him?

9
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,990
Mr. Han help the creditors

10
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,640
come to our law firm to ask for debt from me.

11
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,590
Fortunately, someone helped me suppress it.

12
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,479
Let's not think about the bank

13
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,770
without proof.

14
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,870
The bank has the advantage.

15
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,070
Well, now he's jumped the gun

16
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,000
and filed a lawsuit and a bailment.

17
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,699
We need to make a worse plan.

18
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,640
Yingzi, besides this house,

19
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:15,530
do you have another place to live?

20
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:16,950
No.

21
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:21,680
If they really kick me out,

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,950
I can only sleep on the street.

23
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,670
Alright, it's not that bad.

24
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:27,600
How can I let you live on the street?

25
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,390
Qiu Hua,

26
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,490
I have a few words with Yingzi.

27
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,490
Go get Mr. Han for me.

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:34,920
Okay.

29
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,550
In the future,

30
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,600
the life will be harder for you.

31
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,579
I thought about it.

32
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,829
I'll only charge

33
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,829
half of the attorney fees.

34
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,490
You can take back one million.

35
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,110
I was just kidding, Ms. Fang.

36
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,190
No need to do that.

37
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,000
That's what I want to teach you.

38
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,070
Women

39
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,870
can be strong,

40
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,930
but you can't show off your strength.

41
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,110
The reason I agreed to be your lawyer

42
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,300
is not about the two million.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,550
It's your ability

44
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,510
to think of such a way to protect yourself.

45
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,230
I admire it.

46
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,690
This two million doesn't mean a lot to me.

47
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,950
But to you,

48
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,510
it can save your life.

49
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,990
Do as I say.

50
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,650
Take back one million.

51
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,430
Ms. Fang, I'm not trying to be brave.

52
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,550
I used this money

53
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,910
to buy legal services from you and Qiu Hua,

54
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,230
because I think you are worth it.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,390
As for me,

56
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,310
You can rest assured.

57
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,829
I just

58
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:50,050
want to live a decent life at any time.

59
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,540
I don't accept pity from others,

60
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,870
which is also a part of my dignity.

61
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,470
Fine, it's up to you.

62
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,670
Mr. Han.

63
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,589
Ms. Fang.

64
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,029
What's up?

65
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,390
Sit down.

66
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,470
Did you tell the bank

67
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,710
that Luo Yingzi's huaband ran away?

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,790
What do you mean?

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,770
I've never dealt with that bank.

70
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,170
Didn't you provoke

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,200
one of her personal loan creditors

72
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,720
to come to the law firm to collect her debt?

73
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,710
That's my client.

74
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,550
I was just saying.

75
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,420
But I never...

76
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,990
Alright, stop explaining.

77
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,470
Han,

78
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,270
I...

79
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,710
I can put up with anything.

80
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,470
But for your own benefit,

81
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,440
you harm the firm's interests.

82
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,520
I can't stand it,

83
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,380
not to mention framing my client.

84
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,680
You are also an old comrade.

85
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,150
Don't do this again, okay?

86
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,790
Don't forget.

87
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,710
I have several complaints about you.

88
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,690
I'm holding it all down for you.

89
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:28,870
I really didn't say it.

90
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,710
I was just talking about the private loan.

91
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,850
I admit my mistake.

92
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,710
But about the bank,

93
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,240
I really didn't know it.

94
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,350
All right, stop explaining.

95
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,710
If there is, correct it, but if there isn't, guard against it.

96
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,190
I really don't want this to happen again.

97
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,100
Go back to work.

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,030
Mr. Han, take a look.

99
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,620
This is my fault determination.

100
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,940
What is it?

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,490
Qiu Hua, get some water.

102
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,610

103
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,620
and try to step on my head.

104
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,409
Is there any law at all?

105
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,830
An intern lawyer

106
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:45,030
also wants to step on the old man's head and shit on him.

107
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,510
What do you mean?

108
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,350
You can't be ordered around anymore, right?

109
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,580

110
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,240

111
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,760
It's hot.

112
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,520
Do you want to scald me to death?

113
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,670
Mr. Han,

114
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,150
when you're in trouble,

115
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,110
don't vent your anger on me. OK?

116
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,120
Don't follow her case anymore.

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
I signed the agreement.

118
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,910
The same agreement with Ms. Fang.

119
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:23,570
You also used Fang Lihong to pressure me?

120
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,450
No, no.

121
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,390

122
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,120

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,380
you couldn't leave at noon. He wanted to treat you for lunch.

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,580
They are so close.

135

I’m here for something.

136
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,210
Ms. Fang took over one of their cases

137

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,250

Sign?

150
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,830
This handwriting...

151
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,910
Ms. Fang,

152
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,430
I remember there is a saying

153
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,010
who asserts a claim, gives evidence.

154
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,920
If you say this is forged,

155
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,260
you have to find evidence to prove it.

156
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,990
We'll ask the court for a handwriting test.

157
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,600
That's good.

158
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,860
Since it's their signature,

159
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,780
then two people must come together

160
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,770
to get the loan.

161
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:53,330
There's security footage of that time, right?

162
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,140
CCTV?

163
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,730

166
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,550
What a coincidence.

167
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,980
Yes, what a coincidence.

168
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,930
There's always an agent, right?

169
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:07,870
Yes.

170
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,560
Should I call her over?

171
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,910
Of course.

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,950
Okay.

00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:13,950

You need to come here quickly.

Okay, I got it.

180
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,670
If this gets out of hand,

181
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,870
and it becomes a bad debt,

182

00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,860
that we help him get this loan.

192
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,890
Isn't that house still mortgaged

193
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,720
in our hands?

194
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,860
I'll handle it as soon as possible.

195
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,110
By the way,

196
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,660
Her name is Luo Yingzi.

197
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,200
When we get in,

198
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,520
I'll introduce her to you.

199
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,470
Don't worry about anything.

200
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,990
Just say it's her.

201
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,080
Got it?

202
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:20,630
Yes.

203
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,760
I'm counting on you.

204
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,390
Coming.

205
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,660
Let me introduce.

206
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,000
This is our agent at that time,

207
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:32,710
Wang.

208
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,470
Wang, this is Ms. Fang.

209
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:37,350
Ms. Fang.

210
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:38,720
she has redeemed over 100 million yuan

211
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,510
for our bank.

212
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,230
This is...

213
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,000
Wang.

214
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,930
Are you sure she was the one who took out the loan?

215
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,060
You were the one who came that day.

216
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,390
Really?

217
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,830
I was wrong.

218
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,990
You came that day.

219
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:06,740
Nonsense.

220
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,590
I've never been to your bank.

221
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,830
It's you.

222
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,550
You and your husband came in for a loan that day.

223
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,670
I did it for you.

224
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,350
Miss,

225
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,560
you have to take legal responsibility

226
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
for what you said to yourself, understand?

227
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:26,500
You must be responsible.

228
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,190
Ms. Fang,

229
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,570
you want to protect your client,

230
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,030
we must protect

231
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,610
our shareholders' interests.

232
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,470
Right? Everyone is responsible.

233
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,680
Mr. Wang

234
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,280
must have told the girl.

235
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,370
Don't worry about fabricating the signature.

236
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,010
We can apply for authenticity

237
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,020
in the trial.

238
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,310
But the problem is

239
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,230
the bank has frozen the property.

240
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,100
If the bank loan

241
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,420
is recognised as a couple's debt,

242
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:03,290
it'll be hard to keep this house.

243
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:06,130
What should we do?

244
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:09,310
It's not enough to knock off

245
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,990
the authenticity of the mortgage agreement alone.

246
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,110
The point is

247
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,880
whether the 10 million loan

248
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,750
is used

249
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,700
for your shared life as a couple?

250
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:21,010
But the problem is that Liu Ming has forged your signature

251
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,190
and changed the corporate and shareholder.

252
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:23,830
So?

253
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,030
if this loan is used

254
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,090
for a company run by a couple,

255
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,430
may also

256
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,780
be seen as a mutual debt.

257
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,800
And Liu Ming

258
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,760
Liu Ming has a share too.

259
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,240
So,

260
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,290
get ready to lose the lawsuit

261
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:40,310
and move out.

262
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,470
I know.

263
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,070
But I have an idea.

264
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,710
Go ahead.

265
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,310
we can keep this house.

266
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,900
At least temporarily keep it.

267
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,200
Liu Ming

268
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,890
took out this loan a month before he left, right?

269
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,820
After that,

270
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:57,470
he immediately transferred the money abroad.

271
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,950
It's very malicious.

272
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,250
If you go to the Public Security Department

273
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,680
to sue him for fraud,

274
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,780
If the police file a case,

275
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,470
the case that the bank sued you

276
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,440
has to be postponed.

277
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,280
Think about

278
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,480
what I'm proposing.

279
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,230
Ms. Fang, get in.

280
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:22,390
Let's go.

281
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:35,990
Well, can you...

282
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,630
It's you again.

283
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:40,910
If we say that we have no relationship,

284
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,140
I don't think anyone would believe it.

285
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,200
Why is it you again?

286
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,140
How did you park the car?

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,280
How can I get out?

288
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,950
How did I park the car?

289
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,470
Look at your car.

290
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,800
It's not parked in the parking space.

291
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,680
The cars are lined up one by one.

292
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,450
So I stopped.

293
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,750
Why do you do what others do?

294
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,470
Don't you have any personality?

295
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,350
Hurry up. Get out. Let me out.

296
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,310
You go out.

297
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,470
I can't.

298
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,310
Just roll out, it's so wide.

299
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,630
If I roll, I can only hit you.

300
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,350
Believe it or not?

301
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,230
Fine, come down.

302
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,350
I'll drive it out for you.

303
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,440
I'm in a hurry.

304
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,060
Come down.

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,390
Really.

306
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,020
Hello, Mr. Chen.

307
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,670
Ms. Fang, long time no see.

308
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:19,590
Long time no see.

309
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,590
Why are you here?

310
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,440
We came to deal with something.

311
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,470
She's got damp hands. Thank you.

312
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:25,250
Not at all.

313
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:26,990
Drive out.

314
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,510
Be careful. Don't rub my car.

315
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,050
The street killer.

316
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
Here comes the trouble.

317
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,100
What's wrong?

318
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,960
How could I forget?

319
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,510
He is the agent of the bank.

320
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,840
Ms. Fang,

321
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:14,070
are you still afraid of him?

322
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,380
No.

323
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,080
Chen Shuo

324
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,810
is notoriously unscrupulous in the legal profession.

325
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,950
As long as he can make money,

326
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,680
he dares to take on any lawsuit.

327
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,990
As long as he can win the lawsuit,

328
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,830
he can use any tactics.

329
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,110
He represented

330
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,110
a migrant worker in a wage claim case

331
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,010
and successfully helped the client

332
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,420
recover the owed wages.

333
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,990
But in the end,

334
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,830
the client turned against him

335
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,970
and didn't want to pay him.

336
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,470
Then?

337
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,710
He sued the client.

338
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,150
He sued his client.

339
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,230
Do you know how much he bid?

340
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,090
How much?

341
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,320
One yuan.

342
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,370
OK.

343
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,750
At that time, this case

344
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,950
was really well-known.

345
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,880
Actually, everyone knew

346
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,790
the purpose of his bid was

347
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,150
just to show his attitude.

348
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:14,760
He's not short of money.

349
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,720
What he wanted is the justice.

350
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,560
So no one

351
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,030
can guess

352
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,869
how he will play.

353
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,650
This silly lady

354
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:31,610
was cheated by a man like this.

355
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,760
But it's not a big problem. It's fine.

356
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,460
I just checked.

357
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,310
All the procedures are quite complete.

358
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,490
The court won't easily invalidate

359
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,280
the mortgage contract.

360
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,710
That's good.

361
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,660
But

362
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,550
we have to be careful of their other move.

363
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,270
Which move?

364
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,510
Based on all the evidence,

365
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,990
she can report to the police

366
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,860
that her husband Liu Ming is a fraud.

367
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,790
If he can’t be caught abroad,

368
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,390
we can't close the case.

369
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,430
If the case can't be closed,

370
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,670
the money you loaned...

371
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,430
No, that can't happen.

372
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,710
What can we do?

373
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,510
Let me think.

374
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:08,910
It's nothing serious.

375
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,370
Isn't this preserving the house?

376
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,100
If the house is in our hands,

377
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:14,480
the debt cannot be escaped.

378
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,280
That's not necessarily true.

379
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,030
Nowadays, debtors use all kinds of tricks

380
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,230
to escape debt.

381
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,100
Luo Yingzi,

382
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,860
how did you know him?

383
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,750
I've

384
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,630
dealt with him a few times by accident.

385
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,130
During the first two encounters,

386
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,870
I didn't lose.

387
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,990
Although he's not simple,

388
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,190
I don't think he's that great.

389
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,430
But you have to be more vigilant.

390
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,230
Think about what I'm proposing.

391
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,270
Think about it.

392
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,390
Otherwise, you don’t even have a chance.

393
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,790
Ms. Fang,

394
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,580
I don’t want to

395
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,270
pursue the business registration.

396
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,790
Why?

397
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,240
You plan to admit that you are the legal person of the company?

398
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,680
I'm the one

399
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,150
whether I admit it or not.

400
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,950
If we can't get rid of the corporation,

401
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,990
we can't get rid of the bank loan.

402
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,240
Have you made up your mind?

403
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,280
I won't chase.

404
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,260
♫I am♫

405
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,100

to keep this house.

410
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,370

412

♫It's getting out of reach♫

415

It's not easy for her. How could you say that?

Luo Yingzi.

439
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,230
Is Luo Yingzi at home?

440
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,750
Open the door.

441
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,790
Luo Yingzi.

442
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,320
Pay back the money quickly.

443
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,500
We represent Civil and Commercial Bank.

444
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,350
Luo Yingzi.

445
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,690
Hello, sister.

446
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,230
There's a crowd at the door.

447
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,630
They mentioned and kept banging the door.

448
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,270
They want us to move out.

449
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,620
Call the police.

450
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,380
Lock the door.

451
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,440
I'll be right back.

452
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,160
Qiu Hua,

453
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,200
tell this to Ms. Fang now.

454
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:51,660
Ms. Fang,

455
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,070
a group of people broke into Luo Yingzi's house.

456
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,870
They're forcing her to move out.

457
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,720
Not to mention,

458
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,650
It must be Chen Shuo's idea.

459
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,700
Go to Luo Yingzi's house immediately.

460
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,230
I'll contact the court now.

461
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:06,930
Okay.

462
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:14,570
Hello, Qiu Hua.

463
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,250
Hello, Yingzi. Where are you?

464
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,070
I'll go with you.

465
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,930
Okay, I'll go downstairs to find you now.

466
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,310
Why don't you take an umbrella?

467
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,390
You're all wet.

468
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,530
Here.
Thank you.

469
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,910
Ms. Fang just contacted the court.

470
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,010
It has nothing to do with the court.

471
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,010
The court just froze your property.

472
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,430
The bank must have hired someone to do it.

473
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,760
Isn’t he playing a jerk?

474
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:58,950
Ms. Fang said

475
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,680
Civil and Commercial Bank is a small private fund bank.

476
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,600
Liu Ming must have been selective

477
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,030
when he took out a loan from this bank.

478
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:05,950
To get the loan back,

479
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:07,470
they can do anything.

480
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,100
I think it should be Mr. Chen

481
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,190
who came up with this idea.

482
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,630
He's really bad.

483
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,400
We are in the same field.

484
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,200
Why should he be like this?

485
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,630
Ms. Luo,

486
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:26,420
what's going on over there?

487
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:30,030
If you're a lawyer, you should take the right path.

488
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,090
Do you have to play dirty tricks?

489
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,140
You were cheated by your husband.

490
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,480
Why are you taking it out on me?

491
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,520
We've already gone through the procedure.

492
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,910
The house has been frozen.

493
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,180
Why did you ask the banks

494
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,570
to harass my house?

495
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,140
Ms. Fang has gone to the court.

496
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,310
But she told you

497
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,880
to be prepared.

498
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,240
They must have come prepared.

499
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,530
It's just a life.

500
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,630
I don't know.

501
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,640
They just keep breaking the door.

502
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:13,640
Did they open it?

503
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,890
No.

504
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,540
Lanlan.

505
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,560
Sister.

506
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,960
They scared me just now.

507
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,950
Several men broke the door.

508
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,070
They ran away as soon as the police came.

509
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,970
Are you the landlord?

510
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:24,970
Yes, I am.

511
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,270
Comrade policeman, I have this debt dispute

512
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:29,030
with Civil and Commercial Bank.

513
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,030
But now it's the lawsuit procedure.

514
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,660
The court froze my house.

515
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,090
But before this case is closed,

516
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,160
they have no right to do that.

517
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,190
When we came here,

518
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,580
they said they were here to negotiate.

519
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,070
There's a debt dispute between you two.

520
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,530
It's better to negotiate.

521
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,190
This is our police report.

522
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,990
Sign here if there's no problem.

523
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,580
It's better to pay the bank

524
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,740
sooner than later.

525
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:53,870
They have left.

526
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,870
If they come again,

527
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,280
you can keep calling the police.

528
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:56,840
Let's go.

529
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,790
Go back.

530
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,000
Did they do anything to you?

531
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,540
Lanlan.

532
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:04,560
Yes.

533
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,470
Leave when the police come.

534
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,430
If the police leave, you go.

535
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:10,470
Keep playing with her like this.

536
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,350
Come in.

537
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:12,390
Mr. Wang.

538
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
I have to go. Someone is here.

539
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:16,670
Mr. Chen.

540
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:17,470
No, no, you...

541
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,170
Did you send someone to force Luo Yingzi to move?

542
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,950
Isn't that your idea?

543
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,790
You said

544
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,260
we had to take the house into our own hands

545
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,170
to make it secure.

546
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,650
That's not what I meant.

547
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,800
I said the house has been preserved.

548
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,360
It can't run without legs.

549
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,900
I don't care.

550
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,390
You don't realize that

551
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:36,790
people nowadays will do anything

552
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,400
to escape debts.

553
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,680
I had to defend myself.

554
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,760
My bad debt last time.

555
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,740
My superiors

556
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,170
are still holding me responsible for that.

557
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,470
Mr. Chen, this has nothing to do with you.

558
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:49,080
It’s none of your business.
Yes. Mr. Wang, look.

559
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:49,790
She's a lawyer.

560
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,470
I'm also a lawyer.

561
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,710
We're in the same field.

562
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,770
You're putting me

563
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,570
in an unfaithful situation.

564
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,910
What do you mean?

565
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,970
Does it have anything to do with this?

566
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,780
Are you afraid of crossing her

567
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,110
because you like her?

568
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,820
Of course not.

569
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,190
Mr. Wang, can we

570
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,460
change another way?

571
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,710
You'll go find the head of their bank later

572
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:12,970
and discuss with them.

573
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,420
I'll find Fang Lihong

574
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,850
and talk to her.

575
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,470
- Report this to her.
- Sister.

576
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,070
Thank you.

577
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:19,820
Lanlan,

578
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,910
this matter

579
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,990
can't be solved in a short time.

580
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,860
We're busy these two days.

581
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,910
If you're afraid, you can go home

582
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:29,680
for a few days.

583
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,280
Give yourself a few days off.

584
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,880
We have to go out later.

585
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,650
Lock the door.

586
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,790
They won't break the door, you know?

587
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,040
Okay, sister.

588
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:40,540
I'll go back to my room.

589
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,210
Sister, they are here again.

590
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,570
I'll call the police.

591
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,930
Don't call the police.

592
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
Can't you see?

593
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,440
They left after we called the police.

594
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,570
They came again after the police left.

595
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,750
I'll handle it.

596
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,780
Pay the money back.

597
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,460
There's someone at home after knocking for so long.

598
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,030
Pay us!

599
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,290
Don't block our door.

600
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,420
Let's talk outside.

601
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,600
Luo Yingzi, right?

602
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,670
Your house belongs to our bank now.

603
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,390
We're here to help you move.

604
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:20,470
The case hasn't been solved yet.

605
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,780
Why is it yours?

606
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,410
I'm Luo Yingzi's agent.

607
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,840
Who is in charge?

608
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,070
Me.

609
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,130
Are you here on behalf of Civil and Commercial Bank?

610
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,190
Manager Wang of the bank sent me here.

611
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:32,030
We got this

612
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,270
from the court.

613
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,290
The house has been sealed.

614
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,960
Hurry up and move out.

615
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,990
Leave the key to us

616
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,070
so that we can help you move out.

617
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,990
This house is just sealed.

618
00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:43,000
The court's verdict hasn't come out yet.

619
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,990
You have no right to ask us to move out, understand?

620
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,890
I don't understand legal matters.

621
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,380
I'm just carrying out an order.

622
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,390
Go back first.

623
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,660
and ask the person in charge of your bank to come, okay?

624
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:54,620
Mr. Wang's order is to help you vacate the house.

625
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:58,230
Ms. Luo Yingzi, why don't you open the door

626
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,530
and let us help you?

627
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,400
No.

628
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,800
Don't you have the verdict?

629
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,200
Break the door and get in.

630
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,390
What's wrong with you?

631
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,190
Who are you?

632
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,870
Pay the money or rent the house.

633
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:08,550
Everyone.

634
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,630
Listen to me.

635
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,190
I'm going to your bank

636
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:12,950
to find your person-in-charge.

637
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:13,870
Before I come back,

638
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,030
if any of you dare to move,

639
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,890
you will be legally responsible.

640
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,620
Yingzi.

641
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,310
Go back and lock the door and wait for me.

642
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:25,870
Go away.

643
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,590
You're leaving just like that?

644
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,710
Wait.

645
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,090
I see.

646
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:48,790
OK, Ms. Fang.

647
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,550
I’m on my way to the bank.

648
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,790
Okay, bye.

649
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:53,930
Bye.

650
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,560
Master, please drive faster.

651
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,170
Thank you.

652
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,190
Okay.

653
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,720
Wang, right?

654
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,090
We met before.

655
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,310
Where is Mr. Wang?

656
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,180
I don't know.

657
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,120
You'd better tell me.

658
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:27,150
Your people are suspected of illegal trespassing.

659
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,510
He

660
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,760
He's having dinner with a guest.

661
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,160
Call him and tell him to come back soon.

662
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,620
I'll wait for him here. Go.

663
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:37,830
Go.

664
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,860
But Manager Wang, I promise you first

665
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,070
Luo Yingzi won't run away from debts.

666
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,390
And your bank...

667
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,860
[Wang Qian]

668
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,910
I have a call.

669
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,630
Hello, Wang.

670
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,290
Just tell them I'm not here.

671
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:56,950
That's all.

672
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,000
Hold on.

673
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,270
Her lawyer is here.

674
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,630
They said we're under arrest.

675
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,450
Are you okay?

676
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,750
She's just trying to scare you.

677
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,050
But it's not appropriate for you to do this.

678
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,850
Just withdraw them.

679
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,310
Okay, I got it.

680
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,660
I'll be right there.

681
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,910
Mr. Chen,

682
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:21,090
we can't let them go.

683
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,770
You are a lawyer hired by our bank.

684
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,910
You have to take our side.

685
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,070
You have hundreds of thousands a year.

686
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,380
Now that their lawyer is here,

687
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:30,420
please go there

688
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,400
and deal with it with me.

689
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:31,890
Let's go. Let's go.

690
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,060
I want to eat, okay?

691
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,950
Please help me.

692
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:35,690
Let's go.

693
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,790
Let's deal with it first.

694
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:38,180
OK. Go.

695
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,700
Mr. Wang.

696
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,410
We're counting on you.

697
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,990
Mr. Wang.

698
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,690
Mr. Chen is still here.

699
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,750
Han Zhitong's disciple, right?

700
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,100
Yes, my name is Qiu Hua.

701
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,000
Han hasn't been doing well lately, has he?

702
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,390
He doesn’t even give you an umbrella.

703
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,230
Mr. Chen, you're not doing the right thing.

704
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:02,030
The house has been sealed by you.

705
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,270
The court's verdict

706
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,470
hasn't come down yet.

707
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:06,070
How can you just kick people out

708
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:07,790
without going through the execution process?

709
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,550
We don't.

710
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:10,170
I'm just going to have a look,

711
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,680
informing the debtor to cooperate actively in the liquidation.

712
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,550
Civil and Commercial Bank is a small bank.

713
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,470
It can’t afford a big loss.

714
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,170
Let's change our positions.

715
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,230
It's easy to understand.

716
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,030
Mr. Chen,

717
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,380
We're in the same field.

718
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,780
Do you have to be so cruel?

719
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,270
You're right.

720
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,000
You should know better if we're in the same field.

721
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm a lawyer of the Civil Commerce Bank.

722
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,490
I have to guarantee my client's greatest interests.

723
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:34,070
Ms. Fang Lihong

724
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,890
has reported this to the court.

725
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,190
It's definitely illegal.

726
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,040
Illegal?

727
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:39,870
Don't worry.

728
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,160
We only need the key to that room.

729
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,440
The lawsuit hasn't started yet.

730
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,650
As long as we don't sell the house,

731
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,920
the court won't be able to control us, right?

732
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,040
That's what I mean.

733
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,640
We're both lawyers.

734
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,320
Why are you in such a hurry?

735
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:58,040
To eat a man's food is to serve him faithfully.

736
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,270
Wang.

737
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:14,750
Where is my umbrella?

738
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,040
It's raining heavily outside. Don't be hard on yourself.

739
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,460
Open the door!

740
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:42,860
Pay us!

741
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:48,790
Open the door! Pay the money!

742
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,050
Open the door! Pay the money!

743
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:59,250
Pay the money.

744
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,270
Hello, Yingzi.

745
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,310
I'm back. Open the door.

746
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:03,140
Pay us! Pay us!

747
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,430
Lanlan, go get the towel.

748
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,270
I'm going.

749
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,150
It didn't work.

750
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,710
It was Chen Shuo's idea.

751
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,270
Did you call the police?

752
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,580
Yes, Lanlan did.

753
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:17,990
Let me get you some warm water.

754
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:18,510
Thank you.

755
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,070
Like I said,

756
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,710
they left as soon as the police came.

757
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,790
They came again.

758
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,720
I have no choice.

759
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,720
On my way back,

760
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,100
Ms. Fang called.

761
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,610
She is in the court now.

762
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,630
She also reported this to the court.

763
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:35,800
The court said

764
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,130
they don't have a proper way to intervene.

765
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,750
Thank you.

766
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,920
Then she contacted the bank.

767
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,230
The president of the bank and Manager Wang

768
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,950
are switched off.

769
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,910
They must have conspired to torture you.

770
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,160
Open the door! Pay the money!

771
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,460
Open the door! Pay the money!

772
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,170
Open the door! Pay the money!

773
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:05,750
Pay us! Pay us!

774
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:08,389
Open the door!

775
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:09,590
Pay us!

776
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,750
Open the door! Pay the money!

777
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,420
Fine.

778
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,409
I'll move then.

779
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:20,800
Pay us! Pay us!

780
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:23,870
I think

781
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,699
it's not the end of the world yet.

782
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,659
If you don't move,

783
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:29,000
they have no choice.

784
00:34:29,139 --> 00:34:30,820
But if I don't move,

785
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:33,030
my future life will be

786
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,100
in such an environment every day.

787
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,909
I don't want to deal with gangsters.

788
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,290
[Chen Shuo]

789
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,920
He's dead.

790
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,340
It's okay.

791
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,490
I'm fine.

792
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:37,680
Forget it.

793
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,420
Let me do it.

794
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,400
Let me do it.

795
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,100
OK.

796
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,960
Lanlan, get in the car first.

797
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,140
Are you done?

798
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,830
Yes.

799
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,250
Congratulations.

800
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,890
You drove me away.

801
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,520
Go and seal the seal.

802
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,630
Sorry, we're just following orders.

803
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,020
Let's go.

804
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,250
Where are you going to move these things?

805
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,110
I booked a fast hotel nearby.

806
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,170
Stay for a few days.

807
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,830
Think about renting a house later.

808
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:24,200
Yingzi, I'm sorry.

809
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,030
You trust me so much

810
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,360
and made me your lawyer.

811
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,750
I failed to protect you

812
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,250
and made you in such a mess.

813
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,790
Why are you apologizing?

814
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,670
He has been running for months.

815
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,970
I've been mentally prepared.

816
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,120
I think

817
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,800
it's not the worst time yet.

818
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,810
The car is full.

819
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:44,750
How are you going back?

820
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:45,630
Don't worry about me.

821
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,470
Just go.

822
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,350
I have a subway ahead.

823
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,460
I can take the subway.

824
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,780
Drive safely.

825
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,400
Thank you.

826
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,470
I’m leaving.

827
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,590
Let me see you off.
No, no.

828
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:53,740
Let me give you a ride.
It’s OK.

829
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,400
It's okay. I have an umbrella.

830
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,430
I'm leaving.

831
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,870
Take care.

832
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:02,790
Be careful.

833
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:03,930
OK

834
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:16,190
♫They said people only come to the world once♫

835
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
♫They say there's no boundary between good and bad♫

836
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,740
♫The only constant is change♫

837
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,160
♫They said everyone will die♫

838
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,920
♫Why ask for the truth?♫

839
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,370
♫There is not only ever in forever♫

840
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:50,420
♫Learn to say goodbye for the sake of honor♫

841
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:54,950
♫Look forward to the next tomorrow♫

842
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,830
♫Embrace the hole in your heart♫

843
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,010
Why are you here?

844
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,100
♫Be passionate♫

845
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,630
Are you here to laugh at Luo Yingzi?

846
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,490
I'm not that kind of person.

847
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,690
I was just passing by.

848
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,920
Where can I give you a ride?

849
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,230
No, you can go.

850
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,290
Why are you so stubborn?

851
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,710
Don't you know that we have our own masters?

852
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,430
It's raining heavily. You got sick. I'm sorry.

853
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:19,980
I'm talking to you.

854
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,350
Let's go.

855
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,860
If you don't come with me and get in,

856
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,480
I'll keep driving like this.

857
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,370
Sister.

858
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,470
Why does this room smell like smoke?

859
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,950
How can I live here?

860
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,830
If you can't live,

861
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,270
you can stay in your hometown for a few days.

862
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,030
I have nothing to do here anyway.

863
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,510
No, I'm not going back.

864
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:09,480
Isn't it good?

865
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,560
There's a bed.

866
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:12,830
We can take a shower.

867
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,780
There are two owls watching us.

868
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,010
Go take a shower.

869
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:31,220
Look for someone to force Luo Yingzi to vacate her house.

870
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,160
I didn't come up with the idea

871
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,890
The bank has its difficulties.

872
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,110
They are also afraid.

873
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,980
They can't get that kind of money back.

874
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,980
no one can take the responsibility.

875
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:43,820
But it's okay.

876
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:45,760
I'll go to the bank tomorrow anyway.

877
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,830
I'll do their work

878
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,750
and see if I can

879
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,710
to let Luo Yingzi

880
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,330
move back as soon as possible

881
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,360
You'd better tell her yourself.

882
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,450
You guys are so cruel.

883
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,870
She can't move back.

884
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,080
♫I'm following♫

885
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:07,170
♫Where the wind blows♫

886
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,660

♫Night is just the morning fog♫

♫I have my stars to love♫

893
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,950

896
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,300
What's up?

897
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:42,850
Nothing.

898
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,520
I miss you.

899
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,250
I have class to attend.

900
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,300
Ms. Mei,

901
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,960
can you give me the key to your dorm?

902
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,110
I'm so tired.
