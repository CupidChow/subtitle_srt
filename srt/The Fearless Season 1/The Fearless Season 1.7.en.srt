[Episode 7]

4
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,060
They want to pay us back 20 million yuan first.

5
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,120
Yes.

6
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,310
Mr. Wu,

7
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,830
take my advice.

8
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,150
Ms. Fang.

9
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,550
You can only spend the money once you get it.

10
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,090
Yes.

11
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,910
OK, since you agreed,

12
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,390
I'll come to you tomorrow.

13
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,940
Let's sign

14
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:55,830
a repayment agreement with them.

15
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,160
OK.

16
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,910
I have a guest now.

17
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:00,210
See you tomorrow.

18
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,470
Luo, have a seat.

19
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,070
Sit.

20
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:10,880
You did a good job on that pro bono case.

21
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,590
I didn't expect the result to be so good.

22
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,950
It's all because of your hard work.

23
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,370
You spread our name.

24
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,950
Did Han give you a bonus?

25
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,520
Yes.

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,700
I was considering giving you an end-of-year award.

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,790
Thank you, Ms. Fang.

28
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,400
Well... Mr. Han gave me a reward.

29
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,410
3,000 yuan.

30
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:28,100
Ms. Fang, I'm here because of a personal matter.

31
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,480
I want to ask you a favor.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,790
Personal matter?

33
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,010
What is it? Tell me.

34
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,990
Well...

35
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,320
I didn't say this before

36
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,470
because I thought it had nothing to do with the job.

37
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,410
It's about my husband.

38
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,870
He ran away

39
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,070
with another woman

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,570
behind my back.

41
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,240
They went to America

42
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,130
and transferred our shared assets.

43
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,829
I'm filing for divorce.

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,430
This was when I had just joined the firm.

45
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,870
But later, I suddenly found out

46
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,450
that he had borrowed a lot of private loans.

47
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,010
He runs away,

48
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,960
so no one pays the interest.

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:12,370
The creditors have come to me these days.

50
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,260
I'm just afraid

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,030
that those people

52
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,850
would come to the firm for money.

53
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,660
So, I thought I should

54
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,350
explain my situation to the firm in advance.

55
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,270
If something happens,

56
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,190
I hope the firm can understand me.

57
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,120
How much did he borrow?

58
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,530
I don't know the exact number yet.

59
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:34,790
Probably a lot.

60
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,579
Well, Luo,

61
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,100
I have a meeting with the partners later.

62
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,190
I've known what happened to you.

63
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:46,220
Wait until I'm done with the meeting, OK?

64
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,880
Ms. Fang, here's the thing...

65
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,030
I understand your situation.

66
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,960
I'll come to you after the meeting.

67
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,690
Ms. Fang.

68
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,690
Thank you.

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,610
Everyone will encounter difficulties.

70
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,630
I hope you can help me at this time.

71
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,310
I'll leave you to your work then.

72
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,150
Morning.

73
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,100
Morning.

74
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,940
Our agenda today is to do a sum-up

75
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,280
for the first half of the year.

76
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,150
Tao Zheng, give us an update on the cases

77
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,230
we have handled during the first half of the year.

78
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,490
Director Fan, tell us about our revenue.

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,060
OK.

80
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,290
Everyone, it's not optimistic.

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,020
There are two major cases

82
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,810
that we need to discuss today.

83
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,010
Tao Zheng, you start first.

84
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,280
Partners, let's look at

85
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,030
the case of the Minhai Group listing and reorganization submitted

86
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,760
by the Civil and Commercial Affairs Department.

87
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,840
Is he in the office?

88
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,530
No.

89
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,940
He's at the partners' meeting.

90
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,690
I just went to see Fang Lihong.

91
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,570
I'm gonna hire her as my lawyer.

92
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,880
I need someone to cover for me.

93
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,070
Is there anyone tougher than her

94
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,420
in our firm?

95
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,640
That's crazy.

96
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,680
Did she take it?

97
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,820
I just told her

98
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,710
what happened to me.

99
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,190
Then she said she had to go to the meeting.

100
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,990
I didn't have time to bring it up.

101
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,490
I don't think she'll take your case.

102
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,490
Not necessarily.

103
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,570
I'll pay her top dollar.

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,520
Do you know

105
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,159
how much she usually charges for a case?

106
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,190
Ms. Fang is no longer

107
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,080
the same as those ordinary lawyers.

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,360
I always hear Han cursing her jealously,

109
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,630
saying she took a bank case.

110
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,770
If she wins,

111
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,730
she could make over 10 million yuan.

112
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,720
But this kind of case doesn't happen

113
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,030
to Ms. Fang every day.

114
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,140
I guess there should be

115
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,910
more than one million cases.

116
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,590
I don't think she'll take it if it's less than 1 million yuan.

117
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,470
Then I'll give her this much.

118
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:26,560
She can't say no.

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,530
You still have two million?

120
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,380
You should have paid off your debt with that 2 million yuan.

121
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,070
It's not enough.

122
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,800
And this matter

123
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,460
might turn into big trouble in the future.

124
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,890
I need someone to cover for me in the firm.

125
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,430
That's true.

126
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,750
What were you thinking?

127
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,680
What?

128
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,870
Hire Fang Lihong as your lawyer?

129
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,330
I wouldn’t dare to think about it.

130
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,909
She's a lawyer. I need a lawyer.

131
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,430
I pay someone to make my trouble go away.

132
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:01,690
Isn't it natural to get paid to do things?

133
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,250
Building D, Zone A, Blue Sea International.

134
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,830
Is it your house?

135
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,690
Lastly, one small thing.

136
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,480
Han,

137
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,270
your disciple, Luo Yingzi,

138
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,730
got into trouble, you know?

139
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,750
No.

140
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:31,750
What is it?

141
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,980
She said

142
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,620
her husband had run away with someone else,

143
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,610
taking away all of the money

144
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,790
and borrowing a lot of private loans.

145
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,400
She came to me today

146
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,180
to say that the debt collectors

147
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,800
might come to the firm.

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,570
She wants us to protect her.

149
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,260
I'm her mentor,

150
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,159
but she came to you when things happened.

151
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,370
She doesn't respect me as her mentor.

152
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,930
This is a big problem.

153
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,420
Well.

154
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:06,540
Why should we protect someone like her?

155
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,800
What would they think

156
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,960
if we were blocked by debt collectors?

157
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,600
People who know will say it's her fault.

158
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,030
Those who don't know

159
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,760
might assume that our law firm is going bankrupt.

160
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,430
An intern lawyer.

161
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,030
Just fire her.

162
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,850
Han,

163
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,320
she is your disciple.

164
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,900
Isn't it thanks to Luo

165
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,780
that you won that pro bono case?

166
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,010
I don’t have such a disciple.

167
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,700
If you like her, you take her.

168
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,830
There's nothing more to discuss about it.

169
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,950
We can't keep someone like her.

170
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,500
What if the debt collectors come to block our door?

171
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,340
Who are the debt collectors?

172
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,320
They will do anything.

173
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,960
Right.

174
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,100
They'll throw a brick at you today

175
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,580
and then beat you up tomorrow.

176
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:44,900
How can we work?

177
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:45,910
We must fire her.

178
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,170
I agree.

179
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,270
We have to fire her.

180
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,370
How can we run this firm?

181
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,140
How can we get in

182
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,070
if a bunch of people are blocking our door?

183
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,940
Right. There'll be a problem for us coming in and out, right?

184
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,100
How can we work like that?

185
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,580
Right.

186
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,710
What is this?

187
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,040
Am I right?

188
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,270
Indeed.

189
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,450
It would reflect poorly on our firm.

190
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,430
It's a pity that she is actually

191
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,130
a promising lawyer.

192
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,390
[Qiu Hua, I got something about the two houses you asked me to check.
The one in Building D, Blue Sea International,]

193
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,390
[has been mortgaged to the Civil Commercial Bank for a 10 million yuan loan.
The other one is not mortgaged.]

194
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,570
He mortgaged the house?

195
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,940
When you told me that he borrowed private loans,

196
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,060
I thought about it.

197
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,070
Since he knew to take out private loans,

198
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,730
why wouldn't he go to a bank with lower interest?

199
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,790
The lawyer from the Housing Administration Bureau is my classmate.

200
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,050
So, I asked him to check.

201
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,760
As expected,

202
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,500
the house you live in

203
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,280
was mortgaged to the Civil Commerce Bank by him

204
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,520
for a loan of over 10 million yuan.

205
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,600
The other one is not mortgaged.

206
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,490
Aren't his parents living there?

207
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,380
I was wondering

208
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,310
why Lanlan couldn't find the property certificate.

209
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,370
He went this far.

210
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,170
You didn't expect it at all?

211
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,720
How could I?

212
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,470
If I could,

213
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:53,510
I would have found it myself.

214
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,390
Gosh, do I even know him?

215
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,230
Let's get emotional later.

216
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,730
Let's think about what's in front of us.

217
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:05,230
The bank doesn't know

218
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,940
that Liu Ming ran away.

219
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,310
If they knew,

220
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,130
they'd come to you immediately.

221
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,280
You can't pay it back now, right?

222
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,720
If there are clauses,

223
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,470
such as failing to pay interest within a specified period

224
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,420
or being unable to contact the borrower within the agreed time,

225
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,080
that shall be deemed to be in breach of contract,

226
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,830
the court will freeze your house

227
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,560
and definitely auction it off.

228
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,340
What are you going to do now?

229
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,360
It's not the end of the world.

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,060
Let's just see where this thing goes.

231
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:39,920
I...

232
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,850
I must hire Fang Lihong and you as my lawyers.

233
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,610
-Sir. -Luo.

234
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,430
I’ve heard about your situation

235
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,960
from Fang.

236
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,110
I'm a bad mentor.

237
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,500
When my disciple is in trouble,

238
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,620
I have to hear about it from someone else.

239
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,220
Yes.

240
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,900
I want Ms. Fang to be my lawyer.

241
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,530
So, I'm gonna go to her.

242
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,420
Goodbye.

243
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,200
No, this...

244
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,740
Did she say

245
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,560
that she's going to hire Fang Lihong as her lawyer?

246
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,900
She doesn’t respect me at all.

247
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,640
Let's see how long you can stay at this firm.

248
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Qiu Hua, come into my office with me.

249
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:54,590
Mr. Han, what’s up?

250
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,860
Why are you standing here?

251
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,940
Come on, come on in.

252
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,380
Come, sit down.

253
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,810
Mr. Han, you...

254
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,110
Don't be like this. Just say it.

255
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,580
You're so young. Why are you so conservative?

256
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,500
How can I say it seeing you standing there.

257
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,960
Come and sit down.

258
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:18,720
Sit down.

259
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,190
Go ahead. I'm all ears.

260
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:39,890
Qiu Hua.

261
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,630
Have you made up your mind

262
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,940
about what I told you?

263
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,750
Luo Yingzi will be fired immediately.

264
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,510
Do you think Fang Lihong will represent her?

265
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,670
That's what happens when you don't have anyone

266
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,260
to cover for you in our firm.

267
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,290
I've told you about my family.

268
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm long through

269
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,740
with my old...

270
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,310
For the sake of our child,

271
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,580
we stay married.

272
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,300
We've been separated for a long time.

273
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,770
But I'm also a man.

274
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,420
A man with needs and desires!

275
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,360
OK.

276
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,640
Let's not talk about desires

277
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:37,580
or needs.

278
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,120
Let's talk about love.

279
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,830
Qiu Hua.

280
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,740
I like you.

281
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,860
As long as you are with me,

282
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:51,260
I can guarantee you a promising future.

283
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,390
Mr. Han,

284
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,430
what do you mean?

285
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,190
Don't you want to become a practicing lawyer?

286
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,950
But think about it.

287
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,480
You come from the countryside,

288
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,710
without a privileged background or access to resources.

289
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,050
How can you take cases?

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
If you are with me,

291
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,750
we can work on my case together.

292
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:25,000
We can work together as a couple on cases.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,330
Mr. Han, I don't want to.

294
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,750
I still have work to do.

295
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,080
I'll get back to my work.

296
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,740
I'm really sorry

297
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,030
to hear about what happened to you.

298
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,410
Have you thought of a way to deal with this?

299
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,400
I can only solve this through lawsuits.

300
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,840
And I just found out

301
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,260
that before he left,

302
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,620
he borrowed 10 million yuan from the bank,

303
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,800
using the house I'm currently living in as collateral.

304
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,400
Why did he

305
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,240
do this to you?

306
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,350
I just can't reach him now.

307
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,270
If possible,

308
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,610
I think as long as I'm still alive,

309
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,000
I deserve an explanation from him.

310
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,300
How is your family?

311
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm from Lingnan.

312
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,300
My dad is a law professor at a university,

313
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,080
and my mom used to be a university teacher.

314
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,050
But she retired early

315
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,820
because of her poor health.

316
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,240
That's good.

317
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,840
As a lawyer,

318
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,160
here is my advice.

319
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,670
It's easy to deal with the bank.

320
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,960
No matter what, you still have a house.

321
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,620
If you have some extra money,

322
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:53,720
pay off the private loans as soon as possible.

323
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,310
After that,

324
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,870
I suggest you go back to Lingnan.

325
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,870
Go back to your parents and get some rest.

326
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,920
Ms. Fang, I want you to be my lawyer.

327
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,330
Me?

328
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes.

329
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,900
I need a lawyer.

330
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,610
And I want you to be my lawyer.

331
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,180
Because

332
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,870
I'll have to deal with a series of lawsuits

333
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,370
regarding my divorce, private loans,

334
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,460
and the bank.

335
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,620
I can't just sit here and wait to die.

336
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,560
I've got to get my act together.

337
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,880
So, I need a lawyer.

338
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,530
Your attitude is right.

339
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,320
But I'm too busy.

340
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll pay you two million yuan.

341
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
You mean you still have two million?

342
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,400
After I found out about the private loans,

343
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,300
I sold a house right away

344
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,960
just for today.

345
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,920
I offer two million legal fees

346
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
to hire you and Qiu Hua as my lawyers.

347
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,790
You'll represent me

348
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,510
until the end of the first trial in these cases.

349
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,110
By doing this,

350
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,230
I have to protect you in the firm, right?

351
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,440
Yes, that's what I want.

352
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,099
Then you should know

353
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,810
that according to Article 24 of the Judicial Interpretation II of the Marriage Law,

354
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,619
if you don't have enough evidence,

355
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,220
this will be very bad for you.

356
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:20,970
Ms. Fang.

357
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,440
I'm mentally prepared to be kicked out.

358
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,400
But even so,

359
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:26,020
I want you to be my lawyer.

360
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,040
In other words,

361
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,140
winning the lawsuits comes second.

362
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,230
The most important thing is to keep you at the law firm.

363
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:34,730
Yes.

364
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,680
That way, I'll have a job to earn money.

365
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:46,110
Then you should know about me.

366
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,670
I don't take

367
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,950
ordinary divorce cases.

368
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,360
Besides, with these three cases combined,

369
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,570
I only got 2 million yuan.

370
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,270
Isn't that a little too low for me?

371
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,370
There are three cases in name,

372
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:02,170
but in fact,

373
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,230
he may not show up.

374
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,890
If the delivery procedure is completed

375
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,190
and he doesn't appear in court,

376
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,820
the divorce is just a process.

377
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,900
I don't want to spend too much time

378
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,600
on that private loan case.

379
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,250
Ms. Fang, please trust me.

380
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,910
I will find a way to solve it.

381
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,770
And I'm already thinking of a way.

382
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,270
So, the point is

383
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,900
the bank case.

384
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,320
Of course,

385
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,230
I know that 2 million yuan in legal fees

386
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,380
may not impress you.

387
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,190
But I didn't hire you

388
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,740
because you are expensive.

389
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,310
Then, why do you want to hire me?

390
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,190
I think

391
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,600
you're the only one.

392
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,120
Only you can save me.

393
00:18:58,990 --> 00:18:59,420
Fine.

394
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:00,980
I'll take it.

395
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,770
But I have one condition.

396
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,730
Go ahead.

397
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,850
No matter what you do,

398
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:12,210
you can't let these creditors come to the firm.

399
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,470
Otherwise, I can't protect you.

400
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,620
I'll try.

401
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:17,150
I think I can do it.

402
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,060
OK.

403
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,270
Call Qiu Hua here.

404
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,850
Let's go over the case.

405
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,750
OK.

406
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,020
She said yes. She wants you.

407
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,310
Don't cover your mouth.

408
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,720
Someone might see that.

409
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,230
Thank you, Yingzi.

410
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,120
For what?

411
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,520
Thank you for bringing me to work with Fang Lihong.

412
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,480
Otherwise,

413
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,850
I wouldn't have such a chance in ten years.

414
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,350
Luo Yingzi.

415
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,510
From now on,

416
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,630
Qiu Hua and I will be your lawyers.

417
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,780
Let's analyze the case now.

418
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,920
You've filed for divorce, right?

419
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,430
Yes.

420
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,320
Good. You did it in time.

421
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,310
Have you done property preservation?

422
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:23,970
No.

423
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,840
Maybe there's nothing left to preserve.

424
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,840
Qiu Hua, apply to the court for a preservation order immediately.

425
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,800
Whether they can seal the property or not.

426
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,710
Also, go to the Industrial and Commerce Bureau

427
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:35,460
to get the business records of Liu Ming's company.

428
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,220
Print them out and bring them back.

429
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,630
Then you two go to court

430
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,640
to apply for an investigation and the collection

431
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,120
of evidence regarding the transfer of property by Liu Ming Company.

432
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,640
OK.

433
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,060
Xia Shu.

434
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,370
I'm in the office.

435
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,830
Come to my office now.

436
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,690
OK.

437
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,190
That was a great goal yesterday.

438
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,910
Yeah.

439
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,230
Great.

440
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,120
Have you seen Qiu Hua?

441
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,120
Mr. Han, she is in Ms. Fang's office.

442
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:19,730
Print out five copies of this.

443
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:20,190
OK.

444
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,550
How ungrateful.

445
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,160
How could there be such a person?

446
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,750
It's a big world. Things happen.

447
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,110
Can you do it?

448
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,700
We just need to find out

449
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,870
how this jerk is doing in America

450
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,000
and gather information about his real estate property?

451
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:00,910
I can get his real estate information,

452
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,840
but not the property information.

453
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,460
I can also check what he is doing in America.

454
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,900
I have a lot of classmates in the law in the US.

455
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,700
Thank you, Xia Shu.

456
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:13,000
Xia Shu, according to Ms. Fang,

457
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,830
I'll count on you to contact your classmates

458
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:17,100
and investigate him in America.

459
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:21,780
-I have something to say to Qiu Hua. -Luo Yingzi, Liu is horrible.

460
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,470
We're all here for you.

461
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,390
Thank you.

462
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:29,450
I feel your warmth. Thank you.

463
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,310
Don't worry.

464
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,750
I'll help you find out everything about him in America.

465
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,990
Is there anything else

466
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,750
you need help with?

467
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,410
No.

468
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,060
If I need anything,

469
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,140
I'll ask you again.

470
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,360
Are you having trouble getting by?

471
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,150
If there is, I...

472
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,280
Xia Shu, look.

473
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,800
On every desk,

474
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,460
there is someone needing your help.

475
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,610
Go ahead.

476
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,740
I'm sorry. That's not what I meant.

477
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,350
I know.

478
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,270
But thank you.

479
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,460
Come to me if you need anything.

480
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:57,820
OK.

481
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,950
Then I'm going.

482
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,620
Is she weaned?

483
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,410
Why is she so childish?

484
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,500
You think she's childish.

485
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,560
But the firm thinks she is a treasure.

486
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,680
Mr. Han almost got into a fight

487
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,120
with other lawyers for her.

488
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,280
Really? Why?

489
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,090
He just wants her.

490
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,050
I heard

491
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,630
that her father is the chairman

492
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:21,940
of the Development and Reform Commission in a development zone.

493
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,060
He oversees many large enterprises.

494
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,420
That means she can bring in a lot of cases.

495
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,370
People like her

496
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,330
just need to rely on their dad.

497
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,880
But she has to come here and compete with us.

498
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,060
Don't be so jealous.

499
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,300
Can her dad support her forever?

500
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,900
Let's talk about ourselves.

501
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,310
Help me think of a way.

502
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,670
How can I prove

503
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,560
that the money is not being used for our livelihood?

504
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:48,770
I think it's hard to prove it.

505
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,700
I don't think you should put your mind to it.

506
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,370
Your house is now

507
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,700
your most important asset.

508
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,120
We have to try our best to keep it.

509
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:02,120
Got it.

510
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,020
I've taken on Luo Yingzi's case,

511
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,030
and I've promised her that she can stay at the firm.

512
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,220
Our lawyer is in trouble

513
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,460
and has problems.

514
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:18,120
I don't think we should kick her when she is down.

515
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,090
And from the last case,

516
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,510
she's a promising lawyer.

517
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,700
So, I promised to represent her.

518
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,180
She's our client now.

519
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,690
We have an obligation to protect her.

520
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,000
She's really something.

521
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,140
Objection.

522
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,790
Fang,

523
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,330
she offered you a high legal fee, right?

524
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,490
On the contrary,

525
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,830
my fee is much lower than usual.

526
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,990
I just like this girl.

527
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,780
I admire her.

528
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,980
Don’t try to fool me, Ms. Fang.

529
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,430
I don’t care if you want to earn her life-saving money.

530
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,990
But I'm a partner here.

531
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,510
I have to think about the interests of the firm.

532
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,170
If those debt collectors come to block our door

533
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,700
and affect our reputation,

534
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,690
I'll feel ashamed.

535
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,110
We can’t keep this girl.

536
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,950
I'm with Han.

537
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,280
Ms. Fang,

538
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,650
you don’t need a case now, right?

539
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,390
Why do you have to make trouble for yourself?

540
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,430
I repeat,

541
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:17,720
I didn't keep her because of money.

542
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,790
Through this matter,

543
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,740
I saw perseverance

544
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,120
and persistence in her.

545
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,110
It's so rare.

546
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,850
I admire her.

547
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,480
What concerns everyone is the potential trouble

548
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,410
that debt collectors might cause at the firm, right?

549
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,230
All right. Let's make a deal.

550
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,910
If something like

551
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:37,190
what Han said happens,

552
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:39,280
I'll fire her right away. OK?

553
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,150
That day will come.

554
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,440
That day is not far off. Just wait and see.

555
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:57,100
How is it?

556
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,540
This girl is not simple.

557
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,060
She tied herself

558
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,020
to you through her cases.

559
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,640
If the debt collectors actually show up,

560
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,490
you will be embarrassed,

561
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:12,540
and it'll be a slap on your face.

562
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,610
Because of these,

563
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:16,140
you have to do everything you can to help her with this case.

564
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,400
What a brilliant move.

565
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,740
What are you talking about?

566
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,840
I go all the way with all of my cases.

567
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,570
Tao Zheng.

568
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,040
Don't you think

569
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,070
this girl will become a good lawyer?

570
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,350
I agree.

571
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,600
But a good lawyer

572
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:32,580
may become a good opponent against us in the future.

573
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,440
Young people grow up too quickly.

574
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,320
Bye.

575
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,100
Mr. Han,

576
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,920
I would like to request a leave of absence.

577
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,120
Get past me.

578
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,710
What will others think of me as their mentor?

579
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,710
Get her in here!

580
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,460
Who?

581
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:02,190
Who?

582
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:05,130
That Luo Yingzi who sucked up to Fang Lihong!

583
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,480
Sir, you want to see me?

584
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,420
You're all full-fledged, right?

585
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,540
Do you still see me as your mentor?

586
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,580
Step on my shoulders and try to climb up, don't you?

587
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,460
I understand that you want to get promoted.

588
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,480
Can you do it more subtly?

589
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,960
You didn't come to me about such a big thing!

590
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,820
Do you still see me as your mentor?

591
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:33,970
Why don’t you just ask Fang Lihong to be your mentor?

592
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:37,960
Sir.

593
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,670
This is the case analysis you asked me to write.

594
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,170
I finished it. Take a look.

595
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,680
Didn't you hear what I said?

596
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,980
Yes.

597
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,440
Sir, look.

598
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,760
You are indeed my mentor at the firm.

599
00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:54,210
But this is my own personal matter.

600
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,550
As Luo Yingzi herself,

601
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,620
it's my right

602
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,460
to choose whichever lawyer I want, right?

603
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,390
Since it's my right,

604
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:02,900
I won't bother you.

605
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,450
I'll get back to work, sir.

606
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,870
Calm down.

607
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,820
Mr. Han, I’m going now.

608
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:19,960
Where are you going?

609
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,900
Ms. Fang asked me to go to court.

610
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,030
You're not allowed!

611
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,190
You're with the Criminal Defense.

612
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:27,040
Waste your work time on another case.

613
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,110
It's absent!

614
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,700
How ungrateful!

615
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,230
All of you are ungrateful bastards!

616
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,690
Why did you close the door?

617
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,030
You're afraid that others might hear me?

618
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,360
All of you are ungrateful bastards!

619
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:20,430
Hello.

620
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,650
Liu Ming?

621
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,230
Liu Ming, you...

622
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,150
Why did you do this to me?

623
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,890
Why did you get me into trouble?

624
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,920
Did I do anything

625
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,650
wrong to you?

626
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:40,960
If there is,

627
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,040
you can tell me.

628
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:44,210
You can discuss it with me.

629
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,470
Even if you tell me

630
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,470
that you like someone else,

631
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,100
do you think I'm someone

632
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,200
who won't let go of you?

633
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,660
Say something.

634
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,710
I heard that you want to have children with someone else, right?

635
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:06,150
Then why did you steal

636
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:07,050
all of our money

637
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,550
and leave me with a lot of debt?

638
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,700
What did I do

639
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:18,280
to make you hate me so much?

640
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,560
Answer me!

641
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,360
Liu Ming.

642
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,060
Come back if you are still a man. OK?

643
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,430
Let's get things straight once you come back.

644
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,790
Then we will divorce

645
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,060
and go our separate ways, okay?

646
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,800
Say something.

647
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,310
Don't play possum! Say something!

648
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,550
Yingzi.

649
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:14,680
Today,

650
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,690
my mom asked me to call you.

651
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,520
Your mom?

652
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,840
Your mom, your mom!

653
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,140
Are you still breastfeeding?

654
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,870
Are you still wearing diapers?

655
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,130
What did she ask you to say to me?

656
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,150
She asked me to tell you

657
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,990
that you'd better let her go home to live.

658
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,380
Otherwise,

659
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,400
she won't go easy on you.

660
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:55,030
Your entire family pushes me into a dead end.

661
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,580
You still want me to support your parents?

662
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,920
You're all bastards!

663
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,390
Why didn't I see through you before?

664
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,110
Liu Ming.

665
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,450
Listen!

666
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:17,770
Hello?

667
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,870
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

668
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,160
Sorry.

669
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,480
I didn't mean to eavesdrop on you.

670
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,740
I was just over there, looking up information.

671
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,500
Are you alright?

672
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,550
Cry. Cry it out, and you'll feel better.

673
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:25,230
No one knows what to do

674
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,340
if they were in your shoes.

675
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,710
When you're done crying,

676
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,710
we need to pull ourselves together.

677
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,070
Hello.

678
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,659
How much did he borrow from you?

679
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,880
He ran away.

680
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,370
Yes.

681
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,139
But I really don't know about the money.

682
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:31,530
Yes, but don't worry.

683
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,060
I'll be responsible for it.

684
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:36,330
Can you give me more time?

685
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,620
Can I contact you in a few days?

686
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,040
Yingzi.

687
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:55,820
Mr. Zhou.

688
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:56,760
Sit.

689
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,050
I'm so mad about what your ex-husband did.

690
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,780
He run to America, right?

691
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,200
I have friends in America.

692
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,390
How about I ask someone to kick his ass?

693
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:07,910
Mr. Zhou, I don't even want to mention him.

694
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:08,980
Can we not talk about him?

695
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,860
I need your help

696
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,220
with an urgent matter.

697
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,600
Since yesterday,

698
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,450
the creditors have been calling me.

699
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:17,980
What?

700
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,250
I've been keeping them under control these days.

701
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:20,790
I'll call them.

702
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,720
No, no, Mr. Zhou.

703
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,860
Don't blame them.

704
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,580
It’s Liu Ming’s fault.

705
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:25,870
I came to you

706
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:28,070
because you know them.

707
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,150
Can you pass a message to them for me?

708
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,670
If they want their money back,

709
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,550
then they should go to court and sue me.

710
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,040
Don't come to my law firm to cause trouble.

711
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,910
If they come to make a scene at my law firm

712
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:37,310
and cause me to lose my job,

713
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,270
then I'll be even less able to pay them back.

714
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,790
Then I can only pay them with my life.

715
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,030
Yingzi,

716
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,820
then they have to go to court to sue you, right?

717
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,240
Yes.

718
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,640
My buddies are all not clean.

719
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,320
They don’t want to go to court.

720
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,160
Mr. Zhou,

721
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,560
don’t worry.

722
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,960
I won't give them a hard time in court.

723
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,680
I just want to

724
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,150
end this legally with them.

725
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,880
Don’t leave any consequences.

726
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,990
But, Mr. Zhou,

727
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,110
I have to tell you the truth.

728
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,970
I'm sure

729
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,530
I can't pay all of this back.

730
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,150
So, I want the judge to mediate

731
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,500
so that we can come up with

732
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,270
a number that everyone can accept,

733
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:25,530
allowing me to pay back the money fairly.

734
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,010
If you've made up your mind...

735
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,100
Fine.

736
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,490
I'll help you.

737
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:36,740
I have a say in front of them.

738
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,020
But

739
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,650
you can't bring up those illegal things they did in court.

740
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:41,910
Mr. Zhou, don't worry.

741
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,040
You helped me.

742
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,400
And I won't make things difficult for you.

743
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,900
The only good thing that Liu Ming did

744
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,470
was that he borrowed the private loans

745
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,800
so that I could meet you.

746
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,460
Mr. Zhou, thank you.

747
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,870
You are so sweet.

748
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,930
Let's go grab something to eat, Yingzi.

749
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,020
You came all the way here.

750
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:58,880
-Let’s go. -No, no, no.

751
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,030
I really can't.

752
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:00,760
I...

753
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,880
I always feel like there is a boulder in my chest.

754
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,770
Hey, Yingzi.

755
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,830
-You have to... -I gotta go.

756
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,730
You have to live well.

757
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,610
Well...

758
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,810
Luo Yingzi, someone wants to see you.

759
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:26,860
Where is he?

760
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,670
I told him to wait.

761
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,290
He's waiting for you at the cafeteria downstairs.

762
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:30,070
OK, thank you.

763
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:30,830
You're welcome.

764
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:31,670
Thank you.

765
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,620
You're welcome.

766
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,290
Ms. Luo.

767
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:58,790
Wang Dafu.

768
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,310
Have a seat.

769
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,720
You're fine now.

770
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,550
I came out as soon as the case was dropped.

771
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,310
Later, I heard that it was you

772
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:10,240
who found out about the evidence.

773
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:12,120
So, I'm very grateful to you.

774
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,030
Don't be.

775
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,960
Isn't this what a lawyer should do?

776
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,550
Wang Dafu.

777
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,930
Although you were arrested by mistake,

778
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,380
you did something, right?

779
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:25,860
Yes.

780
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,210
Look how nice your wife is.

781
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,310
You did such a thing.

782
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,840
But she still tried everything to protect you at the last moment.

783
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,720
So learn the lesson

784
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,870
and live a good life with her.

785
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,430
Stop causing trouble again.

786
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,040
I dare not.

787
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,870
I came here today.

788
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:47,000
I just...

789
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,300
I want to ask...

790
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,160
Did you get

791
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,350
the thank-you money I gave you?

792
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:52,610
What thank-you money?

793
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,120
Wang Dafu.

794
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:55,850
You can't just say that.

795
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,070
It's a pro bono case. It's free.

796
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:00,400
We can't take your money.

797
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,230
Well.

798
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,310
Who did you give it to?

799
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,140
How much?

800
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,830
Well...

801
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,100
I gave it to Mr. Han.

802
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:11,750
I know you did this case pro bono,

803
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,360
but you saved my life.

804
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,990
I...

805
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,380
I have to thank you.

806
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,590
So after I got out,

807
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,230
I talked with my wife

808
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,510
and sold a few trees.

809
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,120
I raised 30,000 yuan.

810
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,080
I gave it to Mr. Han in the office that day.

811
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,240
But he was alone.

812
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,550
But I told him clearly that

813
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:30,190
there...

814
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,850
t-t-there was a share for you.

815
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,090
So, I asked

816
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,330
if he gave it to you.

817
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,000
No.

818
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,690
I wouldn't take it, even if he gave it to me.

819
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,360
Did you leave any evidence

820
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,040
of this money?

821
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:49,000
Well...

822
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:49,860
No.

823
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,770
Don't fool me.

824
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,940
You must do it.

825
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,860
You left evidence, right?

826
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,680
Yes.

827
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,720
When I was behind the bar,

828
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,540
the big man always told me

829
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:06,790
that we need evidence for everything we do.

830
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,560
You don't know when this evidence will come in handy.

831
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,890
I got into the case

832
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,130
because there was no evidence.

833
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,310
So,

834
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,070
what evidence did you leave?

835
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:23,460
I just took a recording with my phone.

836
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,540
No, but I definitely didn't record our conversation.

837
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,960
Of course, I didn't.

838
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,770
Wang Dafu,

839
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,700
in a way,

840
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,310
without Mr. Han,

841
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,680
it would be really hard to overturn your case.

842
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,830
Of course.

843
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,020
He took your money on the sly,

844
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,470
which is definitely against the rules.

845
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,880
But you gave him 30,000 yuan

846
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,870
to thank him for saving your life.

847
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:54,310
It's worth it.

848
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,870
Don't tell anyone about this.

849
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,930
Mr. Han might be in trouble.

850
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,050
No, I won't tell anyone.

851
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:05,860
Actually, we are very happy

852
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,830
that your case can be overturned.

853
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,550
And in your case,

854
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,810
Ms. Qiu put in more effort than I did.

855
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,710
But since you've recorded

856
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,000
the whole process of giving money to him,

857
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,590
you should keep it.

858
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,320
But it's just between you and me.

859
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,980
I understand.

860
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:27,290
I will just keep it

861
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,560
and not use it.

862
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,290
Right.

863
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,200
They are...

864
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,500
from our garden...

865
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,680
They're from our garden.

866
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,610
That's too many.

867
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:37,200
It's just a token of appreciation.

868
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,400
-Take it. -Thank you.

869
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,030
Sir.

870
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,390
Sir, I just went out,

871
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,150
and I'm back.

872
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,970
Why come to me?

873
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,950
Just go to Fang Lihong.

874
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,900
Wang Dafu came to see me.

875
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,230
Thank you, sir.

876
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,930
Thank you for telling him that it was me who found the evidence.

877
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,460
What is he doing here?

878
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,880
To express his gratitude.

879
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
Didn't he

880
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,470
thank you before?

881
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,040
He is here to thank me again.

882
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,010
Apples and oranges. Which one would you like to eat?

883
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,200
Apple? OK?

884
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,860
An apple for you.

885
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,300
A good man will be safe forever, sir.

886
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,070
I'll give the rest to my colleagues on your behalf.

887
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:27,100
I'll share them with everyone.

888
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,230
I'll leave you to it.

889
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,630
Qiu Hua.

890
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,830
Mr. Han treats everyone to fruit.

891
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:33,870
What would you like to eat?

892
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,390
Thank you.

893
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,120
Wang Dafu gave him 30,000 yuan.

894
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,020
Have some fruit.

895
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,510
-Yingzi brought fruits for everyone. -Thank you, Yingzi.

896
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:49,520
Have one.

897
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,620
[Luo Yingzi]

898
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,730
Hi, beauty.
