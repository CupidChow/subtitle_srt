00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,890
Who is the man sitting across from him?

565
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:00,170
Chen Shuo from the Dazheng Law Firm.

566
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,130
Are they friends?

567
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:04,800
Sort of.

568
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,530
He's here for a case.

569
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,650
Wh-What's wrong?

570
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,700
I want to go to the toilet.

571
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,140
Hurry up and go.

572
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,430
Thank you, Miss Qiu.

573
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm going.

574
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,490
Come back soon.

575
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,380
I can't catch a break.

576
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,460
I don't understand.

577
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,520
Do his relatives want him to live or not?

578
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,330
If they do,

579
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:43,640
sell their property

580
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,050
and give the money to my client.

581
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:47,890
I promise to give your client a letter of understanding.

582
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:48,640
Hey, bro.

583
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,970
How much can you make in this case?

584
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,970
Criminal case with a civil case. How much do you think I can make?

585
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:55,890
The higher-ups.

586
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,290
The director gave the case to me.

587
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,770
You think I want to take it?

588
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,740
I'm young.

589
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,570
They exploit me.

590
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:01,770
I have to take it.

591
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,410
You're being exploited?

592
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,170
If you don't pick up anything from the street,

593
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,570
you'll feel like you're losing something.

594
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,170
But I'm doing this pro bono.

595
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,310
It used to be for justice.

596
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,000
Now, for what?

597
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,560
Justice.

598
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,280
Justice, of course.

599
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,130
The fundamental principle of justice

600
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:21,460
is to safeguard every life to the greatest extent possible.

601
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,430
Yes.

602
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:30,190
Right, I'm waiting for you in the restroom.

603
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:35,560
We won't make money from the pro bono cases. Then why are we doing this?

604
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,400
For a reputation.

605
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,160
You keep your client alive.

606
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,670
Then you earn yourself a reputation, right?

607
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:44,180
It sounds so nice.

608
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,050
Wang Dafu killed people on purpose.

609
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,760
Alright.

610
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:48,850
No need to go on.

611
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,040
I got it.

612
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,860
But it's just a suggestion.

613
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,080
I suggest

614
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,810
that Wang Dafu's family consider it.

615
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,960
500,000.

616
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,550
It's a great bargain.

617
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,750
Isn't it for justice?

618
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
Justice is priceless.

619
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,230
But the case isn't.

620
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,880
You blurted it out.

621
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,520
Thirty percent of half a million yuan.

622
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,699
At least 150,000.

623
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,340
All right, I'm old.

624
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,090
I'm going.

625
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:19,639
-I'm old. -I'll see you off.

626
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,639
Let me see you off.

627
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:26,280
See you, old comrade.

628
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:26,929
Okay.

629
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,889
This is your office.

630
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:36,770
How is it?

631
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,210
Do you like it?

632
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,820
[Apprentice Lawyer, Corporate Affairs Department, Xia Shu]

633
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,850
Not bad.

634
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:48,449
Is the internet fast?

635
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,159
Not bad.

636
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,469
Tao Zheng

637
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,100
got the girl Xia?

638
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:58,090
Seems she is assigned to Mr. Tao's Corporate Affairs.

639
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,820
I knew it.

640
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,620
When Tao tried everything

641
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:04,080
to be the head of the management committee,

642
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,130
I knew

643
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,730
that all the benefits would go to him and Fang Lihong.

644
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,040
We do all the dirty work.

645
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,300
They got the benefits.

646
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,690
The world is so unfair.

647
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:15,430
Those who are assigned to me are all bad ones.

648
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,320
Mr. Han,

649
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,290
the intern lawyer is here.

650
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,230
Come on. Come in.

651
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,390
Nice to meet you, mentor.

652
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,800
You don't have to call me "Mentor" now.

653
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,800
I might not be able to be your mentor.

654
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:36,530
What's your name?

655
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,490
Luo Yingzi.

656
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:39,960
Majored in law?

657
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,450
Yes.

658
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,880
28.

659
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,420
Why do you want to become a lawyer now?

660
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,770
Well,

661
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,410
I became a civil servant after graduation.

662
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:51,780
But I still wanted to become a lawyer.

663
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,000
I quit my job last year and passed the bar exam.

664
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,590
You think lawyers can easily earn big money, right?

665
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,990
What does your family do?

666
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,100
We're from Lingnan.

667
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,490
My parents are both teachers.

668
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,870
Are you married?

669
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:09,490
Well...

670
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,300
What does it have to do with the job?

671
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,320
My rule here is

672
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,750
that marriage leave is based on statutory holidays.

673
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:21,360
An extra day of leave will be counted as an absence.

674
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,340
And you have to be on standby during your marriage leave.

675
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,400
The Criminal Defense Department has numerous cases and is heavily burdened.

676
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,930
We don't raise idle people.

677
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,890
I'm divorced.

678
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,720
Mei Daliang wrote your recommendation letter.

679
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,120
You have a strong backer.

680
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,120
Well...

681
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,190
Mrs. Mei was my teacher

682
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,800
when I was preparing for the bar exam.

683
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,090
Then Mrs. Mei helped me when I was trying to join a firm.

684
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,490
Okay.

685
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,200
Qiu Hua.

686
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:53,370
Mr. Han.

687
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,780
Take her to the desk

688
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,370
and let her get familiar with the firm.

689
00:36:57,370 --> 00:36:59,160
Then, show her the files

690
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,090
I have prepared for her.

691
00:37:00,090 --> 00:37:00,930
Okay, Mr. Han.

692
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,450
Thank you, mentor.

693
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,980
No rush to call me "mentor."

694
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:04,860
Understand?

695
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,950
Zhang.

696
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:21,530
I'm Han.

697
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,370
Did you just give Xia

698
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,210
to Tao Zheng?

699
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:30,530
I don't have a say in front of Fang Lihong.

700
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,060
But you're different.

701
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:36,760
You don't know Xia's background?

702
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,330
Her father is the chairman of our Provincial Development and Reform Commission.

703
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:45,450
Do you know how many factories and enterprises he oversees?

704
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,480
How many cases will come to our firm because of him?

705
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,400
You can set up your office first.

706
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,410
Okay, you go.

707
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,870
Send my regards to your father from me.

[Head of Corporate Affairs/Head of Management Committee, Tao Zheng]

709
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:59,770
This is a separate meeting room for our department.

710
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:00,880
That room over there

711
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,530
is the reception room shared by several departments.

712
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:06,090
This is the office area for our interns.

713
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,850
The rule of our department is that men go outside and women remain in the office.

714
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,550
Men go to court,

715
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,970
conduct investigations, and gather evidence.

716
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:15,240
The women will be writing legal documents at the firm.

717
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,500
Then, send all of the material to Mr. Han.

718
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,640
This is your desk.

719
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,220
Mr. Han has asked you to read these files.

720
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:25,430
Are these the cases we're working on?

721
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,160
No.

722
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,270
They are closed.

723
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,410
Then why do I have to look through them?

724
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:33,940
I guess he wants you to read these files

725
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,650
and write some comments

726
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,980
to see how good you are.

727
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,580
Miss Qiu,

728
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:40,290
as you mentioned,

729
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,470
a case will be divided into several parts.

730
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,890
Each one takes care of a part.

731
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,720
Whose case is this

732
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,890
if it's done?

733
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,450
When can we take on cases alone?

734
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,500
That's exactly what he wants.

735
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,010
You'll see.

736
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,950
I'll go back to work first.

737
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,040
You got to the point.

738
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,470
Are you talking to me?

739
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,760
Han does it on purpose.

740
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,810
Each is in charge of a part,

741
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:21,470
so we can never do cases alone.

742
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,680
So he won't have to

743
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,280
share the legal fees with us.

744
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,690
Will we take on cases alone

745
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,740
when we become regular employees?

746
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,240
Let me put it this way.

747
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,880
Last year,

748
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,040

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,560
and the bar association approved eight.

750
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,010
Do you know how many places our department gets?

751
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,980
Han made the calls.

752
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,510
He didn't keep any interns.

753
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,720
You'll see.

754
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,630
Tian Ping from the Criminal Defense Department.

755
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,970
[Apprentice lawyer, Criminal Defense, Tian Ping]

756
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,040
Nice to meet you. I'm Luo Yingzi.

757
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:16,530
Could you take a look for me?

758
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,410
This one.

759
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,190
Am I right?

760
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,140
♫They said people only come into the world once♫

761
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,320
♫They said there's no boundary between good and bad♫

762
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:31,800
♫The only constant is change♫

763
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,540
♫They said everyone will die♫

764
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:44,810
♫Why ask for the truth?♫

765
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,420
♫There is not only ever in forever♫

766
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,490
Hello.

767
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:57,390
♫Learn to say goodbye for the sake of honor♫

768
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,720
♫Look forward to tomorrow♫

769
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:06,130
♫Embrace the hole in your heart♫

770
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,770
♫Be passionate♫

771
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,310
♫Look, they're still here♫

772
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,550
♫Do you dare to love♫

773
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,660
♫Let go and start over♫

774
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,330
♫Yesterday's tears have dried up♫

775
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,880
♫There's an answer♫

776
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,430
♫When I'm halfway through my life♫

777
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,750
♫Turn around, and those obstacles♫

778
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,260
♫Become laughing matters, dear me♫

779
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:45,260
♫Like pendulum, only seeing the future♫

780
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,980
Here, here.

781
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:55,370
This is my boyfriend, Wang Liang.

782
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,120
This is Luo.

783
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,240
She took good care of me at the company.

784
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:58,830
Hello.

785
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,580
Here. Three, two, one.

786
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:09,520
Who is it?

787
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:10,940
Coming.

788
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,080
[Wang Liang]

789
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,870
Luo, why are you here?

790
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,730
Luo, how about we talk outside?

791
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,370
Wang Liang.

792
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,050
We have a guest?

793
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,380
This is...

794
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,830
This is my wife, Jingjing.

795
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:27,270
What?

796
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:29,070
She is your wife?

797
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,210
When did that happen?

798
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,220
What about you and Wen Li?

799
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:31,770
Luo, Luo.

800
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,800
No, this is...

801
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,540
I’ll talk to Luo outside.

802
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,740
I’ll explain it to you later.

803
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,400
Wang Liang!

804
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,220
You are hiding something from me!

805
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,790
Actually, by that time, it had been almost two years

806
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,050
since we had broken up.

807
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,680
She said

808
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,070
you would introduce her

809
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,600
to your husband's company.

810
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,180
If you knew she didn't have a boyfriend,

811
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,810
she was afraid that you'd be worried.

812
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:55,920
So she called me over

813
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:56,960
when you were having tea together.
