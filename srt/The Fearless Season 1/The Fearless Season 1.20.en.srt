4
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:33,910
Mr. Yang.

5
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,910
Mr. Chen,

6
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,130
I have to trouble you again.

7
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:38,830
You're welcome.

8
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,390
As a lawyer, it's my duty.

9
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,360
Ms. Guo's lawyers came,

10
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,420
but I blocked them.

11
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,030
Hello, we have an appointment with Mr. Yang.

12
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,310
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,170
Mr. Yang is busy now.

14
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,450
Please wait a moment.

15
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:55,590
How long should we wait?

16
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,259
This is the time we agreed on.

17
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,670
About ten minutes.

18
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,110
Please take a seat.

19
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,730
Is it Mr. Chen who asked us to wait, right?

20
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,310
Who is it?

21
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,360
Nothing.

22
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,830
This Chen

23
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,960
is the worst person

24
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:11,330
I've ever seen.

25
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:12,990
Mr. Yang,

26
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:16,850
how do you plan to negotiate with the opposing lawyers?

27
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,760
I need your opinion.

28
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,640
That's right.

29
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:23,460
First,

30
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,270
if they have any excessive demands,

31
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:28,970
you must say that they're blackmailing you.

32
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
Second, I suggest

33
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,710
you should make appropriate concessions on financial compensation.

34
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,180
After all, this is a labor dispute.

35
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,310
Our company did violate the Labor Law.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Nothing else.

37
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,500
You can talk to them later.

38
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:43,020
I'll excuse myself.

39
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:43,950
Why?

40
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,430
I've dealt with them before.

41
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,690
I'm afraid if I'm here,

42
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,960
they'll be way more alert.

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,290
Okay.

44
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,550
Wait for me in the next room.

45
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,329
No problem.

46
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,390
Tell the receptionist to tell them

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,150
to leave their phones outside

48
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,790
in case they record.

49
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:00,170
Okay.

50
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,120
All right, you can go in now.

51
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:08,550
Thank you.

52
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,270
But our company has a rule

53
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,550
that visitors must leave their phones outside.

54
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,810
But phones are our personal belongings.

55
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,100
Sorry, this is the rule

56
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,790
our company has.

57
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,340
Please leave your phones here before entering the office area.

58
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,270
I have no choice.

59
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,370
Give it to her.

60
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:22,230
Keep them for us.

61
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,270
Okay, follow me.

62
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,610
Is he afraid we'll record?

63
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,910
Mr. Yang.

64
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:33,890
Welcome

65
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,120

Our country's legal construction is promising.

67
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,870
Welcome.

68
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,590
Have a seat, please.

69
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,710
What can I do for you, ladies?

70
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,280
Mr. Yang.

71
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,020
We're here on behalf of Ms. Guo Yu.

72
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,440
Your company terminated the employment

73
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,000
with Ms. Guo Yu for no reason.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,840
This is not only a violation of

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,550
the employment contract,

76
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,670
it's also inconsistent with the law.

77
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,510
We're here to negotiate a settlement

78
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,230
on her behalf.

79
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,280
I hope we can reach a consensus.

80
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,610
Mr. Yang?

81
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,710
Did you hear what I just said?

82
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,930
Ms. Guo Yu asked us

83
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,430
to negotiate with you to solve the problem.

84
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,940
If we can't solve the problem through negotiation,

85
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,340
we'll proceed with the Labor Arbitration.

86
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,360
What did she ask for?

87
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,480
She requires her reinstatement

88
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,940
and an apology to her.

89
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,030
Besides, her salary and bonus should be paid

90
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,090
for the days she was forced to resign.

91
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,120
So,

92
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:53,340
she came to you, right?

93
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,950
She fell and hurt her leg on purpose

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,470
because she didn't want to go on the business trip with me,

95
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,990
right?

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,930
What do you mean?

97
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,740
You know what it means.

98
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,790
Since she has talked to you,

99
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,360
she must have said a lot of

100
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,590
things that happened between us.

101
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,710
You mean

102
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:12,430
you admit that you sexually harassed Ms. Guo Yu?

103
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,560
What?

104
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,480
Sexual harassment?

105
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,710
She's so bold.

106
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,590
This girl

107
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,960
always makes a fuss.

108
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,790
It seems she really forgot who gave her everything she has today.

109
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,350
She should have known

110
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,830
how she escaped from that poor village

[Donation Ceremony for the Targeted Poverty Alleviation]

112
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,230
and how she got into college and stayed in Jingbei.

113
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,990
I admit

114
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,810
I'm not a saint.

115
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,020
When I see pretty girls,

116
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,570
I have feelings for them.

117
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,180
I also make mistakes

118
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,350
that many men would make.

119
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,730
But why would I choose her?

120
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,750
She has nothing I want.

121
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,800
Aren't I helping the poor by having an affair with her?

122
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,730
So you admit that you harassed her?

123
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,070
She said it.

124
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,360
As lawyers, you have to provide me the evidence.

125
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,530
You are here to file a labor lawsuit.

126
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,400
She can work for the company

127
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,910
and continue to be my secretary.

128
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,210
They're both fine.

129
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,280
It's fine too if she doesn't want to work in our company anymore.

130
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,940
I can give her a wage of two years.

131
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,980
That way, we won't owe each other anything.

132
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,620
As for the lawsuit for sexual harassment,

133
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,860
just go ahead.

134
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,140

135

138
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,490
Okay.

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,250
See?

140
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,130
This is what a girl should be like.

141
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,380
We'll carry on with the Labor Arbitration.

142
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,130
Okay, see you.

143
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,120
Qiu Hua, I'm sorry.

144
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,130
For what?

145
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:34,460
I asked you to uphold justice to Han.

146
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,470
Now I understand.

147
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,540
It's useless to talk about justice with people like them.

148
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,820
To deal with them,

149
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,090
we can only cut their flesh.

150
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,850
These two young girls

151
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:52,390
even wanted to fight against me?

152
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,390
Mr. Yang.

153
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,560
I don't have to know

154
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,020
what you talked with them.

155
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,030
But if you sign any agreement,

156
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,260
let me have a look, please.

157
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,550
I'll give you some advice

158
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,000
on how to avoid legal risks.

159
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,830
That's all.

160
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,030
Without your permission,

161
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,710
I wouldn't sign any literal agreements with them.

162
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,710
I promised to give Guo Yu

163
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,970
a wage for two years.

164
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,630
They went back to discuss it.

165
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,750
Also,

166
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,650
let me remind you.

167
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,870
If they are really out of their mind

168
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,120
and insist on working on this sexual harassment case,

169
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,350
as your lawyer,

170
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,950
you have to tell me the truth.

171
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,880
Do they have any evidence about it?

172
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,539
No.

173
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,200
Of course not.

174
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,429
Why would I sexually harass her?

175
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,960
Of course not.

176
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,150
Okay, Mr. Yang. You should be aware that

177
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,880
you can't hide it from your lawyer.

178
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,520
Since you said you didn't,

179
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,070
then I believe you.

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,840
Of course not.

181
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,910
Let me tell you.

182
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,790
That girl...

183
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,510
You haven't seen her.

184
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:07,090
She has nothing I want.

185
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,110
If she is like the girl

186
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,590
who came today named Luo...

187
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,860
Mr. Yang...

188
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,890
She's a lawyer, my colleague.

189
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,280
It's inappropriate to make such jokes.

190
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,060
Okay.

191
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,310
Qiu Hua.

192
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,830
What should we do?

193
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,250
What do you mean?

194
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,840
How should we tell her

195
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,020
when we meet Guo Yu later?

196
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:46,970
I'll talk to her.

197
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,960
Yang Weida is so shameless.

198
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,240
Does Unscrupulous Chen know this?

199
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,350
Of course, he does.

200
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,410
He was hiding in another room.

201
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,260
He even wants to be his lawyer?

202
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,070
Can't bad guys have lawyers?

203
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,280
It's easier to earn money from bad people.

204
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,470
Yes.

205
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:07,320
The class on professional and general ethics for lawyers

206
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,240
has to last a lifetime.

207
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,830
But I don't know why.

208
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
I still hope he doesn't know,

209
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,210
even if I call him Unscrupulous Chen.

210
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,650
You're quite heavy, soft-shelled turtle.

211
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,760
Stop playing with my pet.

212
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,710
It's not a turtle.

213
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,730
It's a tortoise.

214
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,540
Daxiang.

215
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,280
What was wrong with him when I was away?

216
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,180
Xue,

217
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,470
our job

218
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,810
is not a good job for humans.

219
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,610
Daxiang,

220
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,060
who bullied

221
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,690
our Shuo?

222
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,230
It's fine.

223
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:09,470
Sometimes,

224
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,930
I really want to strangle my client to death.

225
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,010
Is that a criminal case?

226
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,090
We can earn lots of money from criminal cases.

227
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,680
I can help you with the lawsuit.

228
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
Who did you want to  strangle?

229
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,510
That moral model Yang Weida

230
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,100
sexually harassed a girl.

231
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,030
He relies on his own power and wealth.

232
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,960
You should have seen his evil look.

233
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,370
Even though he was so shameless,

234
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,560
I had to give him some advice.

235
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,160
Tell me...

236
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,520
Shuo,

237
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,050
you've become a little stranger to me.

238
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:44,000
Who influenced you?

239
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,810
I didn't say anything.

240
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,410
You know the answer clearly.

241
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,590
Didn't you always tell me

242
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:51,120
the money of bad guys is easier to earn?

243
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,870
Besides, before the judge is sentenced,

244
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,110
they are just our clients.

245
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:55,190
I understand that.

246
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,470
But you didn't see his expression.

247
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,400
You can't help but want to slap him.

248
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,830
You have to help me

249
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,240
with his case.

250
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,580
Ms. Qiu.

251
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,430
Hi, Guo Yu.

252
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,830
Ms. Qiu, how did it go?

253
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,530
Thank you.

254
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:14,700
How was your talk?

255
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,850
It went well.

256
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,040
Have some water.

257
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,190
The result is not bad.

258
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,450
He almost agreed to all our requests.

259
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,030
He promised to compensate all your salary and bonuses

260
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,670
in the contract period.

261
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:32,240
He'll give you another compensation.

262
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,430
As for the specific amount,

263
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,230
I think we can negotiate.

264
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:34,900
Ms. Qiu,

265
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,110
did he

266
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,660
admit that he harassed me?

267
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,710
He admitted it.

268
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,510
Then he can be sent to jail.

269
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,510
Yes, but

270
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,790
there's no point in admitting that.

271
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,520
It's useless to confess

272
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,990
in front of me and Ms. Luo.

273
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,600
Maybe he won't admit it in court.

274
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,530
How can a person...

275
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:12,680
Can a person be this shameless?

276
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:19,970
The shamelessness of the bad is always beyond your imagination.

277
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,690
What should I do then?

278
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,020
I suggest

279
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,940
you should require a higher compensation.

280
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,470
Take a breather

281
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,800
with the compensation,

282
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,520
and then find a new job.

283
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,400
I

284
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,670
came to this city a few years earlier than you.

285
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,930
So I can understand your feelings.

286
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,830
But if

287
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,630
you are not economically independent in this city

288
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:06,130
and can't even feed yourself,

289
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,010
your dignity, character,

290
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,350
and all the humiliation you suffered

291
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,970
are worthless.

292
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,340
No one will truly care about you.

293
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,950
The day on which you can claim

294
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,710
and protect your rights

295
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,770
is the time when you are truly strong enough.

296
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,950
So for this day,

297
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,130
just bite the bullet and live.

298
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,870
Gnash your teeth and swallow them.

299
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,070
I'm leaving.

300
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,590
I just didn't expect that...

301
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,950

I study the law.

338
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,010

Nonsense.

342
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:08,310
Qiu Hua.

343
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,030
It's not what you think.

344
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,640
You're really great.

345
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:16,869
You're great, you know?

346
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,710
You're great.

347
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,230
I studied the evidence carefully.

348
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,750
Mr. Wei,

349
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:38,330
please allow me to say something.

350
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:40,910
If you say you suffered from domestic violence

351
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,070
and threats,

352
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,790
the judge might believe you.

353
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,760
But if you say

354
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,030
you signed this agreement

355
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,230
under duress

356
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,630
and intimidation,

357
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,630
I don't think the Judge will buy it.

358
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,050
Why?

359
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,150
Look.

360
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,620
You're so strong and tall.

361
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,020
On the other hand,

362
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,270
Ms. Qiao is only 1.6 meters tall.

363
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,640
She weighs about 50 kilograms.

364
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:09,230
How can you make the judge believe

365
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,350
she can threaten you

366
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,410
to sign such an unfair agreement?

367
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:15,820
The key to this case

368
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,870
is to make the judge believe

369
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:19,970
that your wife is

370
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,090
a violent person.

371
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,470
If you didn't agree to sign this,

372
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,910
she could do anything.

373
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,390
And you were forced to sign

374
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,820
the property transfer agreement

375
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,700
because you had no choice.

376
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,230
How can we convince the judge?

377
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,630
Mr. Wei,

378
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:40,190
the judge in charge of this case

379
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,150
is Qin Hai.

380
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:42,810
He's in his 50s.

381
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,840
He's upright and prudent,

382
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,390
and lives a very regular life.

383
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,990
As far as I know,

384
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,820
he finishes the cases

385
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,180
before lunch every day.

386
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,100
He has lunch at the  courthouse every day.

387
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,900
Mr. Wei, look.

388
00:18:56,950 --> 00:18:59,030
This is a map of the court.

389
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,680
I checked it two days ago.

390
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,790
This is the Hall of Judgement.

391
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,390
This is the door you and the defendant will use.

392
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:08,820
This is the door the judge will use.

393
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,660
Generally,

394
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:10,950
after the trial,

395
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,350
the judge will walk out of this door

396
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:21,190
[Map of Courtrooms on the First Floor]

397
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,750
and go straight to the office area behind.

398
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,030
And then, he'll walk out of this door

399
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,690
and have lunch in the canteen.

400
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:19,050
But it's been under renovation recently,

401
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,800
so this way is blocked.

402
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,430
After the trial, he can only come out from this door,

403
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,140
go to the front hall,

404
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,270
and then walk to the canteen

405
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,870
from the front hall instead.

406
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,840
Then there is one possibility.

407
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,300
After the trial, when you and the defendant walk out of this door,

408
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,400
you'll definitely meet him in the front hall.

409
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,400
If

410
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,990
you two can stay here for a while,

411
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:42,570
you might run into the judge who's taking a detour.

412
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,310
I...

413
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,720
I don't understand what you mean.

414
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,120
You want me to greet the judge?

415
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,880
In the future,

416
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:59,150
if anyone asks me to do these patent cases again,

417
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,390
I'll send my "best regards" to his family.

418
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,920
After this kind of lawsuit,

419
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:03,970
I think I can

420
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,940
run for the engineering academy.

421
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,010
Are you dead?

422
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,050
Righteous Luo.

423
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,510
What did you call me, Unscrupulous Chen?

424
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,840
Otherwise, should I call you Luo Quixote?

425
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,680
You've suffered a defeat at the hands of my client, haven't you?

426
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,920
Why are you so stingy?

427
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:28,870
Just say what you want. I'm busy.

428
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,280
Mr. Wei's case is arranged for  next Monday.

429
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,840
I booked a five-star hotel for you.

430
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,440
Send me your ID number later.

431
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,350
I'll book a high-speed train ticket

432
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,750
with a business-class seat for you.

433
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,960
Are you serious?

434
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,170
Do you really think I'm going?

435
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,650
I was just kidding.

436
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,390
I'm not interested in watching a clown's show.

437
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,600
You are not coming?

438
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:46,850
Don't you want to see me

439
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,410
beat up Han?

440
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:51,410
Do you really think you can beat him?

441
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,180
I'm so anxious to win him.

442
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,790
Send it to me now.

443
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,480
Stop bragging.

444
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,640
What if you lose?

445
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,030
I'll go to the police station immediately

446
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,030
and change my name

447
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,900
in Unscrupulous Chen there.

448
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,700
Fine.

449
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,600
Book two for me.

450
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,640
I'll go with Ms. Qiu.

451
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:10,450
By the way,

452
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,850
didn't I tell you before?

453
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,750
You need to pay the lost income to us.

454
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,430
Ten hours a day.

455
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,710
And 500 yuan per hour.

456
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,910
That is 5,000 yuan per day per person.

457
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:23,950
Sure.

458
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,880
I'll send you our ID numbers later.

459
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:26,480
Okay.

460
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,080
Bye.

461
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,610
Let's go.

462
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,470
He said he'd beat Han for sure.

463
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,450
Let's see how they battle.

464
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,070
I'm not in the mood.

465
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,450
Didn't you promise me to go with me?

466
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,000
Take it as a break.

467
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,310
Why don't you just relax?

468
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,170
Don't always live a serious life.

469
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,340
Look at me.

470
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,290
I have more than 10 million in debt.

471
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,440
So I often wonder

472
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,930
how you can even smile.

473
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:53,880
Look at this.

474
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:54,660
What?

475
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,030
Force of habit.

476
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,840
What if we meet Han there,

477
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,160
what should we say to him?

478
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,060
Say hi.

479
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,990
Say hello.

480
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,990
What else can we say?

481
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,510
So we can't go

482
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,040
where he goes in the future?

483
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,530
That will be awkward.

484
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,920
Why don't you understand?

485
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,240
We go there to see him being embarrassed.

486
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,550
He'd better not be embarrassed.

487
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,310
Right?

488
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:18,620
Let's go, OK?

489
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,820
Give me your ID number later.

490
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,240
I've transferred the money to you.

491
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,670
Buy me a first-class seat.

492
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,250
You take the second-class seat.

493
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,710
Mr. Han.

494
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,510
Yes.

495
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,270
The case file I borrowed

496
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,030
is here.

497
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,960
Are you going on a business trip?

498
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,290
Yes.

499
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,140
We are not like you guys.

500
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,710
You just need to wait at home

501
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,950
for business.

502
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:43,470
We have to run around in court

503
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,600
to earn some money.

504
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,320
Mr. Han, which case?

505
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,640
Qiao Lianfeng's case.

506
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,250
Qiao Lianfeng?

507
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,990
It's the Tongren Road and Bridge Company.

508
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,400
We've been toiling.

509
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:54,980
Look.

510
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,600
When Mr. Wei wanted to hire you,

511
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,170
the agent fee was millions.

512
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,710
But his wife hired me

513
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,470
with only a few hundred thousand's payment.

514
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,710
It's the hard-earned money.

515
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,070
You can't say that.

516
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,970
You're fighting for justice.

517
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,810
But can you win?

518
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,160
I thought

519
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,810
Mr. Wei had a good chance of winning the case.

520
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,950
Mr. Han, don't lose the lawsuit.

521
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,530
To lose?

522
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,160
That's not written in my dictionary.

523
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,150
Mr. Han, I'll go find a file first.

524
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:22,750
Okay.

525
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,470
I really want to see you

526
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,310
win the lawsuit.

527
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:28,910
Go ahead.

528
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,190
I've been telling the firm

529
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,430
when experienced lawyers defend cases in court,

530
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,070
young lawyers should  be organized to watch and learn.

531
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,460
This is also a chance to improve your professional skills.

532
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,310
Really?

533
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,070
But forget it.

534
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,760
Isn't the court out of town?

535
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:42,070
You can't afford the ticket?

536
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,130
I'll buy it for you.

537
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,220
No need, Mr. Han.

538
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,400
I just think

539
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,550
it's normal

540
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:50,310
whether to win or lose a lawsuit.

541
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,770
Especially for this case.

542
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,310
The plaintiff is more likely to win.

543
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,190
What if

544
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,360
you lose,

545
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,910
and we see it as your disciples,

546
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,240
that will be so awkward.

547
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,810
It's impossible.

548
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,070
Luo, just go and listen.

549
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,720
It's a learning chance.

550
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
I'll ask the court

551
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,200
for a seat.

552
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,820
Really?

553
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,710
Thank you, Mr. Han.

554
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,170
I'll invite Qiu Hua along.

555
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,830
Sure.

556
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,890
Don't worry about the tickets.

557
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:14,730
We'll take care of it.

558
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,780
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Han.

559
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,300
Bye.

560
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:17,080
Bye.

561
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,970
Why are you wearing your earphones?

562
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,880
Mr. Han, can you imagine

563
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,160
I am a fan of music?

564
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,580
I've got a little money, so I'm trying to keep up with the latest fashions

565
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,990
to fulfill my little dreams.

566
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,040
Tian, do your best.

567
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,800
When you become a practicing lawyer next year,

568
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,730
and take some big cases,

569
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,330
you can do whatever you want.

570
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:55,470
Tian.

571
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,640
Did Luo Yingzi and Qiu Hua

572
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,230
take the same train as us?

573
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,330
Mr. Han, I don't know if I should tell you.

574
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,830
What's so hard about it?

575
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,710
They're not only on the same train as us,

576
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,240
but also in business class.

577
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,770
What?

578
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,170
Business class?

579
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,820
[Exit]

580
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,430
Ms. Luo?

581
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:23,790
Yes.

582
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,520
Hello, please give it to me.

583
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:24,950
Thank you.

584
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:25,710
You're welcome.

585
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,750
I'll sit in the front.

586
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,410
Let me help.

587
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,950
Take care. Mind the stairs.

588
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,310
Mr. Han?

589
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:35,920
Did you call a car?

590
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,450
Why don't you get in our car?

591
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,170
No need.

592
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,890
I...

593
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,170
Our car is coming soon.

594
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:41,980
Really?

595
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,040
Luo, it's impressive.

596
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,920
Right?

597
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,670
See you in court, Mr. Han.

598
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,120
See you later.

599
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,650
Okay.

600
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,470
What are you looking at?

601
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,780
Get a taxi.

602
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,150
This is the room key to the business king room.

603
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,650
Here's your room key to the special-price room.

604
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,250
Thank you.

605
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,420
Welcome.

606
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:36,780
Mr. Han.

607
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,390
Thank you,  Mr. Han.

608
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,220
Don't be late tomorrow morning.

609
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,110
Breakfast is on your own.

610
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,110
Seriously?

611
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,480
There's a coffee machine.

612
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,010
What's in here?

613
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:54,950
The fridge.

614
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,270
There are some flowers

615
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,590
and a big bed here.

616
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,920
It's too small.

617
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,580
So comfortable.

618
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,990
There's no window.

619
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,630
Isn't this a coffin?

620
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,550
So stingy.

621
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,930
Look at the pianist.

622
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,430
So professional.

623
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,510
Back then,

624
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,060
I was at level eight in piano.

625
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,270
Now I completely don't know how to play.

626
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,790
When you were young,

627
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:02,270
your family wanted you to be a pianist in the future?

628
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,390
Not really.

629
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,510
My dad is an educator.

630
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,190
He hoped his daughter

631
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,430
to be fully developed

632
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,200
and good at everything,

633
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,970
such as music, chess, calligraphy and painting.

634
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,970
So he took me to learn

635
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:19,390
music, drawing and calligraphy.

636
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,630
He also taught me Weiqi

637
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:22,310
at home.

638
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,830
But there's one good thing about my dad.

639
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:24,910
He never forced me.

640
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,260
I could either learn if I wanted,

641
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,990
or give it up if I didn't like it.

642
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:29,100
My mom was different.

643
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,700
She always said I was a loser.

644
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,960
My dad was so funny.

645
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,440
He rejected her by saying

646
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,480
his daughter's happiness was the only thing that mattered.

647
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,340
But unluckily,

648
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,150
he didn't achieve his wish.

649
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,120
Hello.

650
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,120
Thank you.
What would you like to drink?

651
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,700
Two specialty cocktails, please.

652
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,730
Thank you.
Sure, wait a moment.

653
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,600
I think

654
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,360
your dad is indeed an educator.

655
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:51,390
Why?

656
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,530
Because I was trapped

657
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,810
and I owed a lot of debt?

658
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,120
Because even in this situation,

659
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,850
you can still live comfortably

660
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,950
and feel safe.

661
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,440
That's true.

662
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,130
About the sense of security,

663
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,570
like what happened between Liu Ming and me.

664
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,030
He ran away and I was involved in a lot of debt.

665
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,650
At least, he didn't kill me.

666
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,820
That way,

667
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,860
I feel quite safe.

668
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,680
Only you can say that.

669
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,380
Why do you lack a sense of security,?

670
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,840
Of course, I don't have it.

671
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,990
I'm curious why you feel insecure.

672
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,330
Yingzi.

673
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,200
Yingzi, look

674
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,420
It's not the one we saw last time

675
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,160
Look.

676
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,400
What are you doing?

677
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,120
Wait for me.

678
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:47,410
How is it?

679
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,380
This hotel is not bad, right?

680
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:52,470
Thank you for your hospitality.

681
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,880
Is she your friend?

682
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,850
Why don't you introduce her to us?

683
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:56,920
Tingting.

684
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,390
Excuse me, your specialty cocktails.

685
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,420
Tingting, let me introduce you to each other.

686
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,680
They're my two colleagues.

687
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Ms. Luo Zhengyi.

688
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,060
Ms. Qiu Hua.
Hello, Ms. Luo.

689
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,710
Hello.

690
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,340
She's my friend, Tingting.

691
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:13,180
Nice to meet you.
Hello, Ms. Luo.

692
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,420
Go upstairs and take a rest.

693
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll talk to them about work.

694
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,720
Goodbye.

695
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,510
Bye.

696
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,100
Excuse me.

697
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,100
I'd like to order

698
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,860
the best wine here,

699
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,810
some desserts,

700
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:30,730
and a fruit bowl.

701
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,230
That's it.

702
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,630
Okay.

703
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,520
It's on his tab.

704
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,580
Sure.

705
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,510
Order more.

706
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,320
Order whatever you want.

707
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,120
Anyway, I earned

708
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,110
one million from the bank case.

709
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,300
What do you think about the trial tomorrow?

710
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,810
Isn't it obvious?

711
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,420
You will win Mr. Wei's case for sure.

712
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,490
You don't even need to put in much effort.

713
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,620
If you can't win, that's your problem.

714
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,900
There's little work for you to do.

715
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,230
Why are you so confident?

716
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,960
Well,

717
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,900
how great our ideas' writing is?

718
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,890
Just follow the way we wrote.

719
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,930
Is it that simple?

720
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,840
To be honest,  your ideas

721
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:11,870
are not that good.

722
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,600
It contains nothing wrong anyway.

723
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,830
Every lawyer can think of it.

724
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,830
Then don't use it.

725
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,270
Why not?

726
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,980
Before I saw your ideas,

727
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,190
I had pointed out my thoughts to Mr. Wei.

728
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,250
But let me tell you,

729
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,670
with your ideas,

730
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,570
I still have a lot of work to do

731
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,260
and much evidence to support it, you know?

732
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,070
Otherwise,

733
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,920
there's no way to make people believe

734
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,990
how a slim woman

735
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,870
threatened a strong and tall man

736
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,530
to sign such an agreement?

737
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,890
You didn't think of that, did you?

738
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,090
Of course, we did.

739
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:40,960
But luckily,

740
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,300
Mr. Wei has evidence.

741
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,820
Really?

742
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,430
But you must have missed the fact that

743
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,090
the text messages and videos that prove his wife

744
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,160
coerced and threatened him

745
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,920
all happened

746
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,130
after the agreement was signed.

747
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,180
Of course, some might happen before it.

748
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:01,440
But it's not enough to convince the judge

749
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:03,580
that when Mr. Wei signed this agreement,

750
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:06,790
his personal safety was threatened.

751
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,600
What should you do?

752
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,640
Wait to lose

753
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,810
I don't believe it.

754
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:17,830
Do you really want to change your name to Chen Wuliang?

755
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:19,430
Wait for the good show tomorrow.

756
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,850
Don't waste time on blinking.

757
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,320
Don't miss every wonderful moment.

758
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:26,020
OK, wish you a success.

759
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,000
Come on, Ms. Qiu.

760
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,310
Well,

761
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:37,330
what is Unscrupulous Chen up to?

762
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,430
If the evidence

763
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:41,070
is really like what he said,

764
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,430
I don't feel optimistic about this case.

765
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,680
If we came hundreds of miles here

766
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,410
to see Han win this lawsuit,

767
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,550
then,

768
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,880
I'll be quite angry.

769
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,660
It's such a beautiful night.

770
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:57,580
Can you not mention such a disappointing thing?

771
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,160
Fine.

772
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,460
Come on, forget it.

773
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,300
Let me tell you something happy.

774
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,070
The head of the Labor Committee called me this morning,

775
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,060
saying Weida Group is willing to compensate Guo Yu

776
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,350
on the standard of N+1.

777
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,290
He will also provide Guo Yu

778
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,270
a recommendation letter.

779
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,560
Guo Yu has only been on this job for a year, hasn't she?

780
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,580
In other words,

781
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,070
she can only get compensation with 13-month wages.

782
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,200
How much could it be?

783
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,790
50,000 yuan?

784
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,580
He can buy Guo Yu's dignity

785
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,390
with 50,000 yuan.

786
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,190
No matter how much money he pays, he can't buy her dignity.

787
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,860
But at least we helped her

788
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,080
get a maximum amount of reimbursement.

789
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,330
Don't be so sad.

790
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,880
Your face is wrinkled.

791
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:52,690
Yingzi,

792
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,710
you have so many debts,

793
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:57,910
aren't you worried?

794
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,340
What's the use of worrying?

795
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:03,210
Besides, my debt isn't that much now.

796
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,200
The private loan is settled.

797
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
I just need to lose a house to them.

798
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,190
I was just exploited

799
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,469
completely by them.

800
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,510
What can I do?

801
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,030
I have to start over.

802
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,460
Besides, I've already started.

803
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:19,570
As long as I'm alive, there's hope.

804
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,199
I really envy you.

805
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,909
For what?

806
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,770
You said you learned piano when you were a kid.

807
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,429
I was envious.

808
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
When I was young,

809
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,560
I liked staring at the stars.

810
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,400
In the countryside,

811
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,380
it's dark outside at night.

812
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,969
The stars are very bright.

813
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,120
I often climbed on the roof to watch the stars.

814
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,420
Then my dad grabbed my hair and pulled me down,

815
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,020
saying that I only liked those useless things.

816
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,840
I have two siblings.

817
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,430
I'm the oldest.

818
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,800
I have a younger brother and sister.

819
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,240
So I was in charge of all the chores in my family.

820
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,580
I had to look after my siblings

821
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,400
and cook for them.

822
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,510
Think about it.

823
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,610
When we were young,

824
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:14,210
my parents took us to hide everywhere.

825
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,550
Let me tell you something funny.

826
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,230
After having me, my dad wanted to have a boy.

827
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,260
He wanted a son.

828
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,590
Then my aunt gave my dad a bad idea.

829
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,640
They took me

830
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,720
to apply for a disabled certificate.

831
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,770
For brain paralysis!

832
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:30,640
Your aunt is so mean.

833
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,600
That's why I knew since young

834
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,350
if I didn't study hard,

835
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:37,410
my fate

836
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,170
would be just like those girls'

837
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,090
who got married in their 20s

838
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,880
and had lots of children

839
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,930
in my hometown.

840
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,380
When I was young, whenever there was bad news,

841
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:47,490
I was afraid.

842
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:48,630
I was afraid that

843
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,030
they wouldn't let me go to school suddenly.

844
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,450
The daughter of the Tian family next door

845
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,890
has quit school.

846
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:59,390
She might as well not go to school.

847
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,750
Keep your voice down.

848
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,410
Don't let Hua hear you.

849
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,100
You said you wouldn't let her go to school.

850
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,350
You scared her just now.

851
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,210
What's the use of going to school?

852
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,380
She likes school so much.

853
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:13,010
How about this?

854
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,740
After I finish the farm work here,

855
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,770
I'll do some odd jobs in the town.

856
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,330
I can earn money for her tuition.

857
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,460
Let her go to school. What do you think?

858
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,270
So I worked hard at home.

859
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,100
I just hoped that they could let me go to school.

860
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:36,600
School

861
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,150
is the only hope I could hold onto.

862
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,840
Since middle school,

863
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,370
I've stopped asking for money from my family.

864
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,780
I've been raising myself

865
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,020
until now.

866
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,870
Qiu Hua, life is really hard for you.

867
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,630
But in order to pay for my schooling,

868
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,630
my family still tightened the belt.

869
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,370
Although I didn't ask for money from them,

870
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,810
I could still be hungry.

871
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,770
I had to eat.

872
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,440
Not to mention they lost one

873
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:22,330
who could do all the house chores.

874
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,560
But Yingzi, don't blame me for being ungrateful.

875
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,800
Since I raised myself,

876
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,130
and

877
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,780
my family is waiting to be fed,

878
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,120
I don't want to go back to my hometown.

879
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,030
I can save my monthly salary

880
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,120
and send it to them.

881
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:40,510
But I don't want to

882
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,580
make this family my shell again.

883
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,320
I have to live for myself first.

884
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,660
Am I right?

885
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,860
You have to live a better life

886
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,840
to help your siblings.

887
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:53,780
If you still lived there

888
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,810
like them,

889
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,870
you would have been drowned.

890
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:04,390
However, my experience

891
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:06,120
and such background

892
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,650
has made me what I am today.

893
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,870
So many people and things

894
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:14,550
are probably never gonna happen for me.

895
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,910
My handsome Mr. Han.

896
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:37,260
I finally have a chance to learn from you.

897
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,730
You're still so polite, Mr. Chen.

898
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,960
You're an awesome young lawyer.

899
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:43,550
Xue,

900
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:44,400
after so many years,

901
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,600
you've still been working for Mr.  Chen.

902
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,420
No, no.

903
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,900
I've been working hard to learn from Mr. Xue.

904
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,270
This must be Mrs. Qiao.

905
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,410
[Wife of Wei Tongren, Qiao Lianfeng]

906
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,750
One day of married life fosters enduring affection

907
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,700
You are rivals in court.

908
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,110
But in private,

909
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,590
you and Mr. Wei are still husband and wife.

910
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,080
Mr. Wei,

911
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,000
please shake hands politely.

912
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:12,480
Come on.

913
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:16,590
Believe it or not,

914
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,350
I'll break your fingers!

915
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,690
It seems there is a deep misunderstanding.

916
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:27,820
After you.

917
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,090
This way.

918
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,970
Let's wait and see.

919
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,270
You should divorce.

920
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,530
Look at Han's files.

921
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,330
They are stacked like a hill.

922
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,540
He's well prepared.

923
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:56,930
Look.

924
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:58,240
Tian is so nervous.

925
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,640
Han will scold him again.

926
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:02,440
Tian has been here for a long time.

927
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,790
Han never gave him a chance.

928
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,720
This should be the first time he assists Han.

929
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,760
It's not easy for anyone to have a mentor like Han.

930
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,160
That's right.

931
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,190
All rise.

932
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:29,470
Intermediate People's Court of Pingling City.

933
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,050
According to

934
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,490
Article 134 of the Civil Procedure Law

935
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,440
of the People's Republic of China,

936
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,590
ordinary procedures shall be applied.

937
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,390
It's a public trial today.

938
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,800
Plaintiff Wei Tongren,

939
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,380
and defendant Qiao Lianfeng Equity Transfer Dispute case

940
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:44,860
is now in court.

941
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,990
In summary,

942
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:51,350
my client signed this equity transfer agreement

943
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:54,250
after a long period of intimidation by the defendant,

944
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,790
and under extreme threat to his personal safety.

945
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,160
It's not an expression of his true will.

946
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,790
It should be revoked according to the law.

947
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:03,900
The plaintiff and defendant  are of great difference in weight and height.

948
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,660
When they signed this agreement,

949
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,260
the relationship between them was still fine.

950
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,790
The plaintiff

951
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:13,010
was not able to reverse the chronic losses of the business

952
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,700
and believed in the defendant's ability to operate,

953
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:19,130
so he voluntarily transferred the shares to the defendant's holding.

954
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:21,800
It's completely what the two parties want.

955
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,760
It should be legally protected under the law.

956
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,550
Can't we talk nicely?

957
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,310
You'll hurt me!

958
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,740
Why can't you talk nicely?

959
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,410
Someone is waiting for you when you go out.

960
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,170
You'll be beaten up every time they see you.

961
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,210
Do you hear me?

962
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,550
Do you hear me?

963
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:50,630
This is the evidence No. 21.

964
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,640
What we'd like to prove is

965
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,260
the defendant regularly inflicted domestic violence on the plaintiff,

966
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,880
thereby jeopardizing the plaintiff's personal safety,

967
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,640
and created a great sense of insecurity in him.

968
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,650
The party of the defendant,

969
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,500
you can challenge the evidence.

970
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,180
Objection.

971
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,570
The timeline on this video is

972
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,830
August 21, 2015.

973
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,470
The contract was signed

974
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,590
on August 20, 2015.

975
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,470
So this video can only prove

976
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,070
after this agreement was signed,

977
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,610
their relationship

978
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,960
worsened.

979
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,830
It can't prove

980
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,990
the plaintiff was forced to sign this agreement.

981
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:34,820
Your Honor,

982
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,000
what happened in this video

983
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,990
did happen

984
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:40,190
the day after the agreement was signed.

985
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:42,480
But I want you and everyone here

986
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,310
to pay attention to the details.

987
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,110
Where was this video recorded?

988
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,560
In a hotel room.

989
00:42:49,350 --> 00:42:51,390
Why is it recorded in the hotel room?

990
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,630
This means the relationship

991
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,420
between the plaintiff and the defendant

992
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,710
has been worsened

993
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,800
badly.
