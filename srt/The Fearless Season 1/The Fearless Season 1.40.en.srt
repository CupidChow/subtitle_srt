[Episode 40]

4
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,229
They have no reason to trick me, do they?

5
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,550
Okay.Then there's no need to rush.

6
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,479
We'll talk when the money arrives.

7
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,280
Alright.

8
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:45,720
I have something urgent to do. I have to go.

9
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,830
Who is it?

10
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,770
Mom.

11
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:54,160
You're really back!

12
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:54,670
Wait!

13
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,390
Mom!

14
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,670
You tricked Liu Ming into going to America,

15
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:58,990
while you came back.

16
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,470
You left him there alone.

17
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,670
You even transferred all the money from the company.

18
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,510
I... I can explain it!

19
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,830
Do you think you can walk all over us?

20
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,110
You...

21
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,120
Please hear me out!

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,920
I'm his mother. I'm not dead yet!

23
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,229
I'm right here to defend him!

24
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,039
I came back to prepare myself for pregnancy!

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,970
Let me explain.

26
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,590
What?

27
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,080
I came back to prepare myself for pregnancy.

28
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,080
Just hear me out.

29
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:15,550
Fine.

30
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,350
Today, if you can't give me a satisfactory explanation,

31
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,110
I'll call the police

32
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,150
and have them arrest you right away!

33
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,110
Don't do that!

34
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,530
I can explain everything.

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,880
Now say it.

36
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,110
I came back here after reaching a consensus with Liu Ming.

37
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,590
In fact,

38
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,710
I've always wanted to visit you in Lingnan,

39
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,930
but something in Jingbei keeps me occupied.

40
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,390
I'm back because I wanna prepare myself for pregnancy. It's true.

41
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,110
Mom.

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,230
Do you think I'm evil or what?

43
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:41,829
When Liu Ming and I arrived in America,

44
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:43,960
we couldn't adapt to the new environment.

45
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,230
At that time, I just got pregnant.

46
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,329
I even threw up after drinking water.

47
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,410
Because of that, I had a miscarriage.

48
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,690
Thereafter, I couldn't get pregnant again.

49
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,600
I went to the doctor.

50
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,550
The doctor said I was too weak

51
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,110
and that I needed rest and nutrition.

52
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:02,370
But I couldn't get used to the food there.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,240
As you know,

54
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,550
Liu Ming couldn't even take care of himself.

55
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,610
How was he supposed to take care of me?

56
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,150
We ran out all the options.

57
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,410
In order to have a baby,

58
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,590
I had to come back and stay a while.

59
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,690
I knew Ming would be worried, so I told him

60
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,480
I came back only to visit my family.

61
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,010
I didn't tell him the truth.

62
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,680
Mom, trust me.

63
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,290
You've misunderstood me.

64
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,190
At this point, you're still lying to me.

65
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,550
How is your preparation for pregnancy

66
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,829
relevant to the money of the company?

67
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,550
Mom.

68
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,430
As you know, Luo Yingzi is trying

69
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,829
to figure out where that money has gone.

70
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,170
However, when Liu Ming left, he made her

71
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,520
the corporate representative of Grand Property.

72
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,290
That has given her the right to investigate

73
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,690
where the money is on behalf of the company.

74
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,390
Also,

75
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,270
she called the police, didn't she?

76
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,800
She claimed that Liu Ming defrauded the bank and illegally seized property.

77
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,340
That's why I didn't dare to keep the money

78
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,200
in Ming Xin's corporate account.

79
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,530
The police easily found out that the money

80
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,930
had once been transferred from Grand Property to Ming Xin.

81
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,110
Mom,

82
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,110
it's true that I have transferred the money,

83
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,510
but I haven't used any of it,

84
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,570
as it is now safely kept in my account.

85
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:08,970
Let's say what you told me is true.

86
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,900
Luo Yingzi has traced the money from Grand Property to Ming Xin.

87
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,030
She's likely to trace it to you, right?

88
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,790
The company belongs to the three of us.

89
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,970
Liu Ming and I take the biggest share.

90
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,269
Without any notice,

91
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,150
you secretly transferred the money away.

92
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,480
What do you mean by that?

93
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,370
Listen, this is a warning.

94
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,850
Within three days,

95
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,710
you must transfer 21 million to our account.

96
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:33,310
Don't you dare to keep a penny for yourself!

97
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,030
Otherwise,

98
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,960
I'll make you suffer!

99
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,610
Mom, what's the rush for?

100
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,230
Luo Yingzi keeps a close watch on the money.

101
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,710
Can we deal with it when things cool off?

102
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,360
No.

103
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,040
I don't trust

104
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,470
anyone.

105
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,560
I won't feel secured unless the money is in my hands.

106
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,010
Just transfer it back in three days.

107
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:54,130
If you don't, I'll call the police.

108
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,330
Can you give me a few more days?

109
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,909
I can't handle such a huge sum of money in just three days.

110
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:01,110
Three days. That's all the time you have.

111
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,170
If you don't agree,

112
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,720
we'll take it to the police office.

113
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:08,150
Fine. I agree.

114
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,960
Mom, please don't be mad.

115
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,800
You came from afar. Where are you staying?

116
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:17,030
Why don't you stay at my place?

117
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,230
I have a vacant room here.

118
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,690
I won't stay at your place.

119
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,620
You might murder me at night for money.

120
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,470
I'm leaving.

121
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,470
I'll see what happens in three days.

122
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,710
Listen.

123
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,890
You'd better not pull any stunts.

124
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,470
If three days later, I can't find you here,

125
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,800
I'll immediately go to the police office!

126
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,960
You have my promise.

127
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,480
Mom, let me get that for you.

128
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,280
Don't bother.

129
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,420
Mom, take care.

130
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,100
Hello, Qiwei. Where are you?

131
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,350
I want to see you.

132
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,540
Okay.

133
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,840
I'll wait at the place we usually go to.

134
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,490
The police easily found out that the money

135
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,220
had once been transferred from Grand Property to Ming Xin.

136
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,020
No problem.

137
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:15,110
You may go back to Lingnan now.

138
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,770
I'm supposed to meet her in three days.

139
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,910
I don't think you will see her at that time.

140
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,840
Just go. I'll keep you updated.

141
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,030
I'll leave the rest to you, Yingzi.

142
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,330
I know you are good at everything.

143
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,030
Let's go.

144
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:29,930
Yingzi.

145
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,980
Look,

146
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:35,120
I've done everything you asked me to.

147
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,750
I've been very cooperative.

148
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,110
Will you withdraw your allegations

149
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,180
against Liu Ming?

150
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,860
The police have opened a case.

151
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,180
If they don't think he has committed crimes,

152
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,120
they will dismiss the case.

153
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,850
However, if they think the opposite,

154
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,590
they'll institute a public prosecution.

155
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:53,050
Then...

156
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,530
Should that happen,

157
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,590
I may write him a letter of understanding.

158
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:57,050
Well...

159
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,909
-Bye.
-But...

160
00:06:57,909 --> 00:06:58,670
Luo Yingzi,

161
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,990
don't you think you're being too cruel?

162
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,320
Not as cruel as you are.

163
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,590
Only three days to go.

164
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:13,110
She knows what Liu Ming's mom is capable of.

165
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:14,470
If this time she can't run away,

166
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,400
she will never get a second chance.

167
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,790
But before she flees away,

168
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:20,150
she'll definitely ask Ding Qiwei for money.

169
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,350
She has suffered a big loss.

170
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,750
There's no way she'd leave without a fight.

171
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,460
Liu Ming's mom has met with her.

172
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,110
So Liu Ming and his mom's account isn't useful to her anymore.

173
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:30,670
When she makes the transfer, maybe...

174
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,470
We can talk to Mr. Ding and Mr. Liang.

175
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,470
We'll say it's a business-to-business transfer

176
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,710
which doesn't accept a third-party account.

177
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,460
It's a way to force Wen Li

178
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,320
to expose her corporate account.

179
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,180
This time, we'll find the account

180
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,270
that we've been looking for, right?

181
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,450
Yes, I guess.

182
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:48,350
Have more confidence in yourselves.

183
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:52,240
Wen Li is a slippery liar.

184
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,960
I can't guarantee that we'll be able

185
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,830
to bring her corporate account to light.

186
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,790
Don't worry.

187
00:07:56,909 --> 00:07:59,040
Even if we can't find that account out,

188
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,910
we'll nail her with Ms. Xiao's case.

189
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,170
There's no way she can get away with this.

190
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,550
I admire how fierce Mr. Chen is.

191
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,350
I will hunt down

192
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,030
anyone who messes with you.

193
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:19,930
Okay. We should get going.

194
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,270
Don't. Aren't we supposed to talk about strategies?

195
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,350
You are invincible.

196
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,580
What do you need us for?

197
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,590
I'll let you take care of everything.

198
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,230
Bye.

199
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,580
To pursue a girl like Yingzi,

200
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,159
you need a proper strategy.

201
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,940
Mr. Ding,

202
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
I think Mr. Chen's proposal is good.

203
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,310
I agree to play along.

204
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:52,240
Hello, Mr. Ding.

205
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,830
I have learned

206
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,990
how much you value wealth.

207
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
I assure you

208
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,470
that the lost money

209
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,840
will be returned to you.

210
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,710
Today I came to Mr. Liang's office

211
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,430
to ask for his help with my plan

212
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,380
to find out the corporate account

213
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,180
registered to Wen Li's name.

214
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,190
Rest assured, alright?

215
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,700
That's it.

216
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:15,510
Bye.

217
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,470
All done.

218
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,430
Mr. Liang,

219
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,630
I was about to tell you to come.

220
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,090
Meet this gentleman here.

221
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,710
He is Mr. Chen, a lawyer.

222
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,180
Hello.

223
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,250
Hello, Mr. Ding.

224
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,900
Mr. Liang,

225
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,990
Wen Li and I will go on a business trip to America.

226
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,770
The two million I've received from you

227
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,900
might not be enough.

228
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,510
I was wondering if you could

229
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,380
give me that 30 million in one transfer.

230
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,600
Mr. Ding, Mr. Liang,

231
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,830
since you're having a private conversation,

232
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,490
maybe I should excuse myself.

233
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,730
What's your trip to America for?

234
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,350
What's up?

235
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,640
He agreed.

236
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:15,800
On what?

237
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,110
The 28 million.

238
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,780
Did your dad agree to give it to us?

239
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,070
I tried so hard to persuade him.

240
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,990
Why are you packing?

241
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,760
I thought you weren't coming.

242
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,220
I thought I'd leave alone.

243
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,700
I didn't do a good job and I let you down.

244
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,720
But now,

245
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,940
all the problems have been solved.

246
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,720
Come on. Let me tell you.

247
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,710
My dad entrusted Mr. Liang with 30 million.

248
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,830
We've got 2 million of it.

249
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,190
As for the remaining 28 million,

250
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,870
Mr. Liang said he could

251
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,600
transfer it to us anytime.

252
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,990
Do you have a corporate account?

253
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,850
You need to tell me one.

254
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:56,310
Mr. Liang said it should be a business-to-business transfer.

255
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,430
Qiwei,

256
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,460
I want the money to be transferred to an American account.

257
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,220
I've been working with

258
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,350
a reliable third party.

259
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:08,230
Maybe we should use their account.

260
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:10,230
But Mr. Liang particularly reminded me

261
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,300
that the money must be transferred to a corporate account registered to your name.

262
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,300
He said since it's a business-to-business transfer,

263
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,710
if the receiving end wasn't an account of yours,

264
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:22,910
the finance department in my company might not be able to send the money out.

265
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,710
Honey,

266
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,150
don't you own a company in America?

267
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,110
We'll have the money transferred to...

268
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,190
I sure do.

269
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,260
I'll tell you about it right away.

270
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,370
Ask them to transfer the money soon.

271
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:34,070
Sure.

272
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,200
Listen.

273
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,190
When we get to Hollywood,

274
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,190
we'll shoot our first movie.

275
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,350
Then it's our second movie,

276
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,470
followed by our third movie.

277
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,630
After that, I'll...

278
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,590
Alright.

279
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,350
I've booked the flight tickets.

280
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,410
Go home and pack up.

281
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,990
We'll take off at 10 p.m.

282
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:49,670
It is still early, isn't it?

283
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:52,920
Not at all!

284
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,440
We're running out of time.

285
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,400
Just go home and pack up your stuff.

286
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,810
Don't forget your ID.

287
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,590
By the way,

288
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,800
you must see to it that they make the transfer.

289
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,680
Got it?

290
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,590
Yes.

291
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,080
I'll go to the office and watch them do it.

292
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:09,070
Good.

293
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:12,930
Alright.

294
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,950
See you at the airport tonight.

295
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,480
Okay.

296
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,970
See you at the airport.

297
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,250
He's gonna give me 30 million.

298
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,620
All his family wealth will be mine.

299
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,220
Qiwei.

300
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,270
Oh, it's you, Mr. Liang. Where is Qiwei?

301
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,430
Ms. Wen, sorry.

302
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:53,280
He has a provisional meeting with Mr. Yang.

303
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,810
He'll take a plane tomorrow morning instead.

304
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,110
Mr. Liang, I just checked my account.

305
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,800
Why hasn't the money arrived?

306
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,510
Ms. Wen,

307
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,620
when Qiwei came to see me today,

308
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,190
the finance department was off work.

309
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,750
Tomorrow morning, I'll make the transfer.

310
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,080
Okay, bye.

311
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,510
Okay, bye.

312
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,960
Mr. Ding, seeing these,

313
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,730
I bet you must have figured out the truth.

314
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,680
Look.

315
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,570
Is it the account?

316
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,110
I think it is.

317
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,990
Mr. Liang, shall we test it with a transfer?

318
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,710
Let's do it.

319
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,580
Transfer a large sum of money.

320
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,750
I don't want to appear stingy.

321
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,610
Mr. Liang, you...

322
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,970
We'll do it now.

323
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,800
Okay.

324
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,380
Wen Li.

325
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,030
What now?

326
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,720
Did you see a ghost or what?

327
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:10,900
Yingzi,

328
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,680
what are you doing here?

329
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,430
I'm waiting for you.

330
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,690
Waiting for me?

331
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,220
What do you want from me?

332
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,170
Don't worry. I won't call the police.

333
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,930
I'm here to bid you farewell

334
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,660
and talk with you.

335
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:28,480
I don't understand.

336
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,650
You seduced Liu Ming

337
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,400
and took our property away.

338
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,270
You left me in a load of debts.

339
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,260
And now you tell me you don't understand.

340
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,500
Yingzi, you must have mistaken it.

341
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,170
Liu Ming and I did get together.

342
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,590
We felt too embarrassed to face you.

343
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,990
So we went to America.

344
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,170
I never intended to hurt you.

345
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,350
He was the one who transferred the property.

346
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,680
I didn't find it out until some time later.

347
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,350
When I was in America,

348
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,280
the more I thought about it, the more guilty I was.

349
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,480
So I broke up with him.

350
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,070
I lost contact with him long ago.

351
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,260
Are you done making up stories?

352
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,240
Do you think the tricks you use on men

353
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,590
can work on me?

354
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,480
I wouldn't be talking to you right now

355
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,880
if I hadn't done a thorough investigation.

356
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,000
Fine.

357
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,730
I've got some spare time.

358
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,860
There's no harm in chatting with you.

359
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:17,950
Anyway,

360
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,470
we won't see each other again after this.

361
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,260
I'm tired.

362
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,770
You have to stay alert all the time

363
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,690
and avoid being caught. That must be tiring.

364
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,450
You've been to Mashanchang, right?

365
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,290
Yes.

366
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,850
I wanted to know about your past.

367
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,310
You had a miserable childhood.

368
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,800
Today

369
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:50,860
is my 31st birthday.

370
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,830
Wasn't it ridiculous?

371
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,310
You're two years older than me,

372
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,240
but you treated me as if I was older.

373
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,710
It was quite ridiculous.

374
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,910
You accepted that without even asking.

375
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,280
For the past 31 years, I have always

376
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,710
stayed humble and put up with humiliation,

377
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,100
with the purpose of turning my life around

378
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,310
and appearing in front of people like you

379
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,640
with pride and dignity.

380
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,050
I wanted to become superior to you

381
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,740
and come off as a strong woman before you.

382
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,630
Luo Yingzi,

383
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,670
you promised not to stand in my way.

384
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,430
But if you show no kindness

385
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,630
to the world

386
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,280
and throw indiscriminate attacks at people,

387
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,650
why should I keep my promise?

388
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,190
What are you gonna do?

389
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,600
In this world,

390
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,050
everyone has been in pain,

391
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,380
be it enormous or minor.

392
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,350
Nonetheless, those who are strong

393
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:45,480
would manage to leave the pain behind.

394
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,570
But you have always

395
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,750
held a grudge against

396
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,300
your unfortunate teenage years.

397
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,470
So, in the end, you have a become a slave

398
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,430
of all your misfortunes.

399
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,640
My friend enlightened me.

400
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:57,990
Now I finally know

401
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,390
what she said is correct.

402
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,460
What on earth do you want to do?

403
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:05,910
As I said,

404
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,109
I wouldn't stand in your way.

405
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,430
But you will be punished one day.

406
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,230
We'll meet again.

407
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,150
Luo Yingzi, I'll miss you.

408
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,260
See you.

409
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,810
I will see you again

410
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,880
and I won't wait too long for it.

411
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,020
Wen Xin.

412
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:53,420
You're involved in several frauds.

413
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,550
Please come with us.

414
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,810
Show your hands.

415
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,960
I told you we'd meet again.

416
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,460
Luo Yingzi,

417
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,130
You broke your promise.

418
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,630
As I said, I wouldn't call the police.

419
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:11,010
But I can't stop other people from doing it.

420
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,680
Ms. Wen,

421
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
nice to see you again.

422
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,840
It's me who called the police.

423
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,510
I reported you to the police on behalf of Ms. Xiao.

424
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,570
We suspect you of frauds

425
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:20,370
and illegal transfers of funds.

426
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,410
It seems like we'll meet again after this.

427
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,940
Take her away.

428
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,130
Meet again, huh?

429
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,420
What?

430
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
Do you pity her?

431
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:46,150
No.

432
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,800
I just have mixed feelings.

433
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,340
Many men and women in this city

434
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
are going through ups and downs.

435
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:56,390
Some are making irretrievable errors.

436
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,400
She made her own choices.

437
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,460
You're right.

438
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,610
Congratulations, Unscrupulous Luo!

439
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:05,380
What did you say?

440
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,690
You fooled Wen Li.

441
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I think you're quite unscrupulous.

442
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,860
When I meet nice people, I can be nicer than them.

443
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,320
When there are bad people,

444
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,390
Unscrupulous Chen,

445
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,460
we can knock them down if we team up.

446
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,160
Where's your car? Let's share a ride.

447
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:18,690
This way.

448
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,540
Come in.

449
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,440
Ms. Fang.

450
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:54,970
What's up?

451
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,950
I want to discuss something with you.

452
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,380
On that case about the bank,

453
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,710
I'd like to withdraw my appeal.

454
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,010
Sit.

455
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,220
What now?

456
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,500
Are you gonna give up on that 10 million?

457
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,740
It's hard to win the second trial, isn't it?

458
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,870
Given its difficulty, I wanna quit.

459
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,840
I'd like to move on as soon as possible.

460
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,870
Did you already know

461
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,870
that you'd lose both cases?

462
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,660
On the case about the private loans,

463
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,600
as I told you before,

464
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:33,790
I knew I would lose.

465
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:36,030
As long as I made it to court,

466
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,780
I'd consider myself as a winner.

467
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,510
Fortunately, Ms. Fang, you represented me

468
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,630
and ended the whole thing with those guys.

469
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:44,670
Otherwise,

470
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,730
I'd still be troubled by the private loans

471
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,460
and stuck in a worse situation.

472
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,760
What about the case involving the bank?

473
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,530
At first, I didn't want to lose it.

474
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,150
After all, I had nothing but that house.

475
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,160
I remember

476
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,240
when I was kicked out of that house,

477
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,200
I was so sad and angry.

478
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,260
But now I choose to let it go.

479
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,140
How come?

480
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,260
So many things happened this year.

481
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I was compelled to

482
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,340
surmount every obstacle on my way.

483
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,210
I realized that these experiences

484
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,650
had helped me grow

485
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,040
and become stronger.

486
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,460
So, I believe,

487
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,390
before long,

488
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,940
I'll earn what I deserve with my own ability

489
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,880
and live an even better life

490
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:38,970
than I used to have.

491
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,380
Ms. Fang,

492
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:42,970
I'm sorry.

493
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,150
I was the reason

494
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,580
that you lost two cases in a row.

495
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,630
It doesn't matter.

496
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,310
Hearing what you just said,

497
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,800
I feel really happy for you.

498
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,720
Ms. Fang,

499
00:21:59,190 --> 00:21:59,990
thank you.

500
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:02,490
At the most vulnerable moment of my life,

501
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,720
you protected me.

502
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,880
It was you

503
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,900
who banished all my fears the whole way.

504
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,030
You are my lifesaver

505
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,640
and my mentor, who I'm indebted to.

506
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,200
Mei Daliang is the mentor you should be grateful to.

507
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,950
Sometimes,

508
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,050
students would excel their teachers.

509
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,310
I believe

510
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:25,420
Ms. Mei will have a deep understanding

511
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,490
of this sentence in the future.

512
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,590
Alright, Yingzi.

513
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,080
Keep up the good work.

514
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,630
You may go now.

515
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,040
Okay.

516
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:35,890
Ms. Fang, see you later.

517
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,410
Hello, dad.

518
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,230
Yingzi.

519
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:59,960
You've gotta come home.

520
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,470
I'm afraid your mom is in bad condition.

521
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,970
Time of death, 17:59.

522
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,290
Unscrupulous Chen,

523
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,240
you must have lots of spare time lately.

524
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,390
You've asked me out for lunch.

525
00:24:27,390 --> 00:24:29,140
Are you up to mischief again?

526
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,560
Can you stop teasing me every time we meet?

527
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,740
Can't I invite you to lunch in my free time?

528
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,400
Besides, we are both lawyers.

529
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,510
Can't we exchange experience about our work?

530
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,710
I don't do that with heartless people.

531
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:40,790
I just can't get along with them.

532
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,640
You're too narrow-minded.

533
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,750
Buyers,

534
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:47,790
from the interior design

535
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,700
to the surrounding environment,

536
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,190
this house is on the premium level.

537
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,520
Anyone would like to offer a higher price?

538
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:53,910
10.2 million.

539
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,270
10.4 million.

540
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,480
10.6 million.

541
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,630
10.8 million.

542
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:03,330
[Sun Hongliang]

543
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,350
Mr. Sun.

544
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,040
Is there good news?

545
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,440
11.8 million.

546
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,360
Chen Shuo.

547
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,630
Someone is competing with me for this house.

548
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,950
He seems quite determined about it.

549
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,010
The price has gone up to 11.8 million.

550
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,930
I need to hear your opinion.

551
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,890
It's not worthwhile to risk all you have for a house.

552
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:24,330
Maybe we should call it off.

553
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:24,770
Don't.

554
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,110
Just try your best to get it.

555
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:28,950
I believe you'll bring me good news.

556
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:29,460
Fine.

557
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,760
12 million.

558
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:36,570
12 million.

559
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,430
Mr. Sun has offered

560
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:39,450
12 million.

561
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,290
Wise people would know it's a great house.

562
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,080
Who would like to offer a higher price?

563
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,430
12.2 million.

564
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,000
12.2 million.

565
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:49,990
What's the rush?

566
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:50,570
Come on.

567
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,550
Trust me.

568
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,790
Now the price is 12.2 million.

569
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,100
You must have this house.

570
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,630
It used to belong to a friend of mine.

571
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,560
I've been there.

572
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:06,010
I can't tell you how much I like it.

573
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,300
It's not worth this much money.

574
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,220
Listen to me.

575
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,710
We'll only make a bid when it's necessary.

576
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,150
12.4 million.

577
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,690
Hold the plate up.

578
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,560
Do any of you

579
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,040
want to offer a higher bid?

580
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,070
Let me do it.

581
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,610
12.4 million.

582
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,670
12.6 million.

583
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,060
Braised sea cucumbers with millet, for two.

584
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,530
What about two bowls of cubilose?

585
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,150
Last time, I saw how much you liked it.

586
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,350
No need to order that.

587
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,070
Miss,

588
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:46,610
we only need one portion of

589
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,700
braised sea cucumbers with millet.

590
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,600
Forget about the cubilose.

591
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
Come on.

592
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,100
Isn't it your treat?

593
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,520
Can you not skimp on food?

594
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:55,090
I'm not skimping on food.

595
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,130
I'm on a diet.

596
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,010
That's unnecessary. Just eat what you want.

597
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,020
[Zhou Houze]

598
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,350
You're pretty enough.

599
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,950
I need to take this call.

600
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,510
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

601
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,390
Yingzi,

602
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,380
someone is messing with us.

603
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,440
Lanlan is dating a stupid rich guy.

604
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,820
They're competing with me.

605
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,700
Lanlan?

606
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,070
Now the price

607
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,400
has gone to as high as 13 million.

608
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,330
Have some water.

609
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,450
Are you satisfied now?

610
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,160
I don't think she really wants the house.

611
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,560
Her target seems to be me.

612
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,560
Mr. Zhou.

613
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:28,470
Well,

614
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,630
we'll stick to our original plan.

615
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,080
If the bidding exceeds the market price,

616
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,910
we'll give up.

617
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,290
I'll take care of the part above the market price.

618
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,450
Yingzi, don't worry.

619
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,900
There's no way I'll lose to her.

620
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,900
I'm gonna destroy her.

621
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,850
Mr. Zhou, calm down.

622
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,520
Hello?

623
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,100
Do any of you want...

624
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,230
13.3 million!

625
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,170
Please make another bid for it.

626
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,710
Honey, this shabby house

627
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,680
isn't worth so much money.

628
00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:00,710
I'll show you some new and beautiful houses

629
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:01,710
recently put on the market by my friends.

630
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,990
But I like this one.

631
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,280
Shall we order fish?

632
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,770
We'll have a steamed grouper.

633
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,060
No, wait.

634
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,430
Get us a more expensive grouper.

635
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,070
Yes, sir.

636
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,780
13.3 million.

637
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,600
Hurry up.

638
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,910
Hurry up.

639
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:21,510
Will any of you offer a higher price?

640
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,360
This is the last time.

641
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,420
Yes. The last time.

642
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,630
13.5 million.

643
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,950
13.7 million.

644
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,550
Come on.

645
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,860
Make one more bid.

646
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,680
Do it now!

647
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,550
No way.

648
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:37,710
You...

649
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:39,990
You're not gonna do that, are you?

650
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,120
Let me do it instead!

651
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,120
What's wrong with you?

652
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,540
You want me to spend 13 million on a stupid house?

653
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,340
Are you crazy?

654
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,150
What's wrong with you?

655
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,830
Unfortunately, there's a small incident.

656
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,270
I'm afraid the two of them

657
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,870
are temporarily disengaged from the auction.

658
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:02,670
Buyers,

659
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:04,670
Mr. Zhou has offered

660
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,470
13.7 million for the house.

661
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,110
14 million.

662
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,410
14 million.

663
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,880
14 million.

664
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,310
This is much higher than the market price.

665
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:16,910
Mr. Sun has made a bidding of

666
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,300
14 million.

667
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,650
14.5 million.

668
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,830
14.5 million.

669
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,030
15 million.

670
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,070
15 million.

671
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,200
It's beyond our expectations that...

672
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,770
Wait.

673
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,150
Hello?

674
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,270
Mr. Zhou.
Sister.

675
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,170
How's it going?

676
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:56,570
Here comes another fool competing with me.

677
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,220
The price is now 15 million.

678
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,510
Are we gonna continue bidding for the house?

679
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,790
The price has gone so much higher.

680
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,260
I can surely bid for it.

681
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,110
But how will we deal with it when we get it?

682
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,390
Mr. Zhou,

683
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,930
I don't want the house now.

684
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,290
Never mind. It's time to give up.

685
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,520
You don't want it now?

686
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,600
Okay.

687
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,020
I'll listen to you. We'll call it quits.

688
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:27,950
Now Mr. Sun has offered 15 million.

689
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,300
15 million, calling once.

690
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,680
15 million, calling twice.

691
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,260
15 million, last calling. Sold!

692
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,580
Bravo!

693
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,910
Hello.

694
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,430
Is there any good news?

695
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,800
You've got the house at 15 million.

696
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,510
How much?

697
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,750
15 million.

698
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:03,880
15 million? Are you crazy?

699
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,740
Are you crazy?

700
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,020
Didn't you ask me

701
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,960
to win the house

702
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,790
at all costs?

703
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:14,320
Do you have a problem with spending big bucks for women?

704
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,810
You're better than that, Mr. Chen.

705
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:16,290
Even so,

706
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:19,520
15 million is too high a price.

707
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,590
Listen.

708
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,450
Can you ask them if it's okay

709
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,890
to withdraw our offer?

710
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,040
Mr. Chen, don't worry.

711
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,760
I'll cover the part of the amount

712
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,490
that exceeds the market price.

713
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,960
Just take it as a token of gratitude.

714
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,970
As I said,

715
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,670
without you,

716
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,320
I would still be in prison now

717
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,180
and never have a chance to make money.

718
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,400
Just keep the house for yourself.

719
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,170
Pay me as much as you want.

720
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,750
I'll take care of the rest.

721
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,510
Okay, sir.

722
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,070
Thank you.

723
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,540
That's it. We'll talk later.

724
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,520
Bye.

725
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,440
I'd like to propose a toast.

726
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,860
How come?

727
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:59,410
I wanna congratulate you.

728
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,990
Congratulations, Mr. Chen.

729
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:04,590
You've got a 15-million-worth house in a court ordered auction.

730
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:08,240
Come on.

731
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,870
When do you plan to move?

732
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,080
Shall I bring some people

733
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,680
to your house warming party?

734
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,830
I knew you were good at making money.

735
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,990
I just didn't expect you to be so rich.

736
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,840
After this meal, I guess

737
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,150
I should go to the law association

738
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,710
and report this situation so that they will

739
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:30,710
investigate your source of income.

740
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,640
They can investigate whatever they want.

741
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,120
All my income is legal.

742
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,110
I pay all my taxes.

743
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,890
I was wondering why you had to defeat me

744
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,760
in the case about the bank.

745
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,660
As it turns out, you targeted my house.

746
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,590
Luo Yingzi,

747
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,070
from when we first met to now,

748
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,450
on this case,

749
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,540
we have had many misunderstandings.

750
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:00,880
I

751
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,510
meant to bid for the house

752
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,080
and sell it to you

753
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,140
at a lower price in the future.

754
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,160
That's my way to compensate you

755
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
for all the damage I've caused you.

756
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,370
But today, I can sense

757
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,830
that you're still clinging to the past.

758
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,990
Wipe that smile off your face.

759
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,500
I'm not selling this house to you now.

760
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,920
I won't give you a chance to cling to the past.

761
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,310
That's right. Don't sell it to me.

762
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:25,390
Look.

763
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm gonna use your 15 million in this way.

764
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,130
10 million will go to the bank.

765
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,690
Then I'll pay the interest,

766
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:33,290
taxes and processing fees.

767
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,810
At last, there will be 2 to 3 million left for me.

768
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,570
Why would I still cling to the past

769
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,660
now that I'm gonna have 2 to 3 million?

770
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,820
Miss!

771
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,360
Come on.

772
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:44,770
Here I am.

773
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:45,460
I'm gonna order more food.

774
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,450
One more portion of braised cucumbers with millet.

775
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:49,340
Two bowls of cubilose.

776
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:50,910
Eat up.

777
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,230
Today, it's my treat.

778
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,130
May I propose one more toast?

779
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,310
Liu Ming.

780
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,230
Don't you recognize me?

781
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Yingzi.

782
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,570
What are you doing here?

783
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,240
It's really you.

784
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:19,270
Did I get deported

785
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,890
from America because of you?

786
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:23,870
Why?

787
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,910
We were husband and wife, Yingzi.

788
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:26,630
I always thought

789
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,430
the problem was only between us.

790
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,470
At most, it's just a moral issue.

791
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:31,650
Maybe it had something to do with our shared property.

792
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,380
Why would you try to crucify me?

793
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,450
Are you here today

794
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,910
to see how miserable you've made me?

795
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:40,940
Are you satisfied with what I've become?

796
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,000
Are you satisfied?

797
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,950
Wait a second.

798
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:47,990
How did you know

799
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,920
I would land at this time of the day?

800
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:52,600
You didn't come alone, did you?

801
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,670
Have you made a pact with the police?

802
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,660
You wanna see me get arrested and laugh at me, right?

803
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,070
What's that look in your eyes?

804
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,030
Am I wrong?

805
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,650
Or do you plan to beg the police

806
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,050
when they arrest me? Cut it off, hypocrite!

807
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,150
I'm telling you, Luo Yingzi,

808
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,790
we were both failures in our marriage.

809
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:16,480
You failed

810
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,630
to play the role of a good wife.

811
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,140
You failed to sustain our relationship.

812
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,020
I failed

813
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,090
only because I married you.

814
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,000
♫There are many things in memory♫

815
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,890
♫Using the past to move on♫

816
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,100
♫We♫

817
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,400
♫We have great chemistry♫

818
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,370
♫Among all the people I've lost♫

819
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,910
♫I miss myself the most♫

820
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:05,880
♫No pain, no fear♫

821
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:10,830
♫Using silence as a replacement♫

822
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,480
♫After missing you, I didn't say much♫

823
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,580
♫I once tried my best♫

824
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,210
♫So it's not a regret♫

825
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:25,480
♫Missing you also became a part of the scenery♫

826
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,780
♫It's okay if I didn't do well♫

827
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,990
♫If the world seems crowded♫

828
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,850
♫Stumbling♫

829
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,250
♫I walk alone♫

830
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,760
♫Waiting with warm tears for a response from persistence♫

831
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:40,570
Goodbye, Luo Yingzi.

832
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,650
♫I'll find that complete self again♫

833
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,530
♫I will love me♫

834
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:51,080
♫Let's talk about fairness♫

835
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,970
Are you gonna admit defeat?

836
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,370
Don't forget that you're Luo Yingzi.

837
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,640
♫Missing you also became a part of the scenery♫

838
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,940
♫It's okay if I didn't do well♫

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,150

♫I'll find that complete self again♫

00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:31,240
♫I will love me and then talk about fairness♫

00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:40,740
♫I will love me and then talk about fairness♫

846
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,150
Sorry.

847
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,160
I couldn't persuade him to turn himself in.

848
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,220
You'll have to take it from here.

849
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,290
Liu Ming.

850
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,460
Who are you? A policeman?

851
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,420
No.

852
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,650
Listen.

853
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,910
I don't care what's gonna happen to you.

854
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,090
But I know Luo Yingzi

855
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:24,240
wants you to have a lighter sentence.

856
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,830
So I'll be your attorney

857
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,960
and provide you with the best service.

858
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,710
You're not going anywhere.

859
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,400
Where do you think you're going?

860
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,530
Didn't you just see the police around?

861
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,950
Just raise your arms and declare to turn yourself in.

862
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,240
This is your last chance.

863
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,270
I am Chen Shuo.

864
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,510
Have a good look at it.

865
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,250
I'll be your attorney.

866
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:52,870
I turn myself in.

867
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:53,830
I'm Liu Ming.

868
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,880
I turn myself in.

869
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:57,350
I turn myself in.

870
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,400
I'm Liu Ming.

871
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:27,890
Let's go

872
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,910
♫They said people only come into the world once♫

873
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:54,090
♫They said there's no boundary between good and bad♫

874
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:58,570
♫The only constant is change♫

875
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,310
♫They said everyone will die♫

876
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,580
♫Why ask for the truth?♫

877
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,190
♫There is not only ever in forever♫

878
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,160
♫Learn to say goodbye for the sake of honor♫

879
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,490
♫Look forward to tomorrow♫

880
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,890
♫Embrace the hole in your heart♫

881
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,540
♫Be passionate♫

882
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,090
♫Look, they're still here♫

883
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:41,310
♫Do you dare to love♫

884
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,420
♫Let go and start over♫

885
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,100
♫Yesterday's tears have dried up♫

886
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,650
♫There's an answer♫

887
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:56,190
♫When I'm halfway through my life♫

888
00:41:56,850 --> 00:42:00,520
♫Turn around, and those obstacles♫

889
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,020
♫Become laughing matters, dear me♫

890
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:13,370
♫Like a pendulum, only seeing the future♫

891
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,630
Hello, Qiu Hua.

892
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:26,770
Hello, Yingzi.

893
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,510
Where are you?

894
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,190
What's up?

895
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:29,310
Come back now.

896
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:31,040
Xia Shu's father is in trouble.

897
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,310
What happened?

898
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,270
Her father was taken to the prosecutor's office.

899
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,630
Her boyfriend disappeared with her new car

900
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:37,530
when he heard about this.

901
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,950
The firm has disqualified her

902
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,190
partnership

903
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,710
and fired her.

904
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,370
My goodness!

905
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,540
Tell Xia Shu not to worry.

906
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,560
I'm on my way back.

907
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:50,620
Do you remember how you treated Luo Yingzi?

908
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,020
How could you be so brutal to Xia Shu?

909
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,370
Everyone else will be disappointed!
