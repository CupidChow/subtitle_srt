[Episode 31]

4
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,190
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

5
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,190
It's my pleasure.

6
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,750
Bye.

7
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:35,390
Bye.

8
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,030
Shuo,

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,800
I bought you some tissues,

10
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,850
the allergy medicine, a toothbrush,

11
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:50,520
and…
Got it.

12
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,130
Take notes first.

13
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,390
Tomorrow at 12:00,

14
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,780
I'll have lunch with Mr. Wan from Belle.

15
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,720
At 3 p.m.,

16
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,110
I'll participate in the mediation

17
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,610
in the People's Court of Central District.

18
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,810
I'll have dinner with Mr. Yang of iQIYI.

19
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,410
I'll tell you the time and place later.

20
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,449
Mr. Yang, right?

21
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,330
Give me the things you bought.

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,350
I'll send them upstairs to you.

23
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,810
No need.

24
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,670
How about I move my desk upstairs

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,710
to better take care of you?

26
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,670
Didn't I tell you?

27
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,270
The office belongs to me and Mr. Xue.

28
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,270
You're fine sitting there.

29
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,000
Give it to me.

30
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,230
Go back to work.

31
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,030
Zhang Shilan,

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
please come to my office.

33
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,340
Okay.

34
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,150
How was your sister's relationship

35
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,150
with her husband?

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,690
My sister?

37
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,960
Luo Yingzi?

38
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,520
Yingzi is really stupid,

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,230
although she may seem smart.

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,710
My brother-in-law is a man of no opinion.

41
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,829
He only listens to his mother and the woman has an affair with.

42
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,790
His whole family did those evil things

43
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:59,870
behind Yingzi's back.

44
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,500
She thought she was smart.

45
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,590
The woman who has an affair with my brother-in-law

46
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,140
was introduced by Yingzi.

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:09,230
It's kind of like what that stupid woman did.

48
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,710
Yes, she is so stupid.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,920
Does she come from a wealthy family?

50
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,890
Not really.

51
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,990
I went there with Yingzi once.

52
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,930
It's just

53
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,640
an ordinary family.

54
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,270
Her father is a teacher in college.

55
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,950
He's stupid, too.

56
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,110
My brother-in-law's family had hurt Yingzi so badly.

57
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,550
Still, they taught their daughter

58
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,829
to treat his family well.

59
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,930
I see.

60
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,640
An apple never falls far from the tree.

61
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,640
Since she doesn't have much money,

62
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,329
why does she want to give up

63
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,500
such a big house?

64
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,220
Which one?

65
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,440
The one that will be auctioned soon.

66
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,770
Shuo, why do you keep asking about Yingzi?

67
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,150
Do you like her?

68
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,110
I don't like stupid women.

69
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,620
I like smart girls.

70
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,350
Yes.

71
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,390
Yingzi is so stupid.

72
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,390
If others don't help her,

73
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,670
she won't survive.

74
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,820
I used to be the one who helped her.

75
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,930
But now I've been working out.

76
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,829
Shuo,

77
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:20,589
Yingzi was really screwed over by my brother-in-law.

78
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,490
Why don't you do her a favor

79
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,910
and keep the house for her?

80
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,550
Me?

81
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,590
I don't have time for that.

82
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:29,610
Actually, I just think that house is nice.

83
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,000
I'm the plaintiff's lawyer now.

84
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,550
I know the ace in the hole.

85
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,040
If she can't keep it,

86
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,100
I'll find a way to get it.

87
00:04:38,909 --> 00:04:39,390
I see.

88
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:42,610
Okay, got it.

89
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,800
Go back to work.

90
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,040
Have some water.

91
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,950
How stupid she is.

92
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,750
[Jingbei Court]

93
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,250
Let's meet them directly.

94
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,930
Let's go. Time is running out.

95
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,750
Look at your expression.

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,710
Yours is not any better.

97
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,970
A man's life was lost because of one word.

98
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,570
We have to exonerate the assailant.

99
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:41,230
First, he may not be the one who hit him.

100
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,590
Second,

101
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,350
protecting the victim

102
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,110
is the responsibility of the prosecutor and his lawyer,

103
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,909
not ours.

104
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,270
We have to protect

105
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,170
our client's legal rights.

106
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:57,040
A plea of not guilty?

107
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,100
Yes.

108
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,700
Xu Jianshe.

109
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,110
If there is no new evidence,

110
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,470
it will be too risky to carry out the advocacy of innocence.

111
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,790
If it gets rejected,

112
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,780
you won't have any chance.

113
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,270
You'll get a life sentence in the end.

114
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,710
For your benefit,

115
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,160
we're going to do this in two steps.

116
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,110
Firstly,

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,510
Ms. Qiu will plead you not guilty.

118
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,590
Secondly,

119
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,350
I'll give you a misdemeanor defense.

120
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,280
In other words,

121
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,350
who hit him

122
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,790
with those last fatal blows?

123
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,350
According to the current evidence,

124
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,100
it can't be accurately identified.

125
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,390
The criterion for the sentence of the first instance is too heavy.

126
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,050
In this way,

127
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,030
we are left a chance

128
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,790
for a remand for retrial in the second instance.

129
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:35,990
If the advocacy of innocence is rejected again,

130
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:37,909
you'll pay too much for the result.

131
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:38,370
What do you think of it?

132
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,460
No way!

133
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,510
If you don't defend me as innocent,

134
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,050
I won't entrust you as my lawyers.

135
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,310
I didn't kill anyone.

136
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,320
I didn't fight either.

137
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,950
I was there to stop the fight.

138
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,140
I have nothing to do with Li Zhanjun's death.

139
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,780
Do you understand?

140
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,830
It's fine that they didn't appreciate it.

141
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,030
But they even wanted me to plead guilty?

142
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,910
No way!

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,000
I won't compensate them!

144
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,790
Mr Xu, please calm down.

145
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:11,030
Calm down, okay?

146
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,990
You insist on the defense of innocence.

147
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,670
If it's not accepted by the court of the second instance,

148
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,910
you'll lose completely.

149
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,370
Think about it carefully.

150
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,120
Then I plead not guilty either!

151
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,160
Never!

152
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:25,210
You must plead me not guilty.

153
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,890
Otherwise, I'll change lawyers.

154
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,270
Xu Jianshe.

155
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,100
This is the photo of Li Zhanjun

156
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,340
after his death.

157
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,590
Look at his injuries.

158
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,790
Do they have anything to do with you?

159
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,360
I won't look at it.

160
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,820
Don't play psychological warfare with me.

161
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:57,760
His death has nothing to do with me.

162
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,080
Why should I look at it?

163
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:31,560
Who is it?

164
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,470
Who?

165
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,620
Me, Yingzi.

166
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:42,090
Why are you holding scissors?

167
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,380
You scared me, Lanlan.

168
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,670
You haven't been back for days.

169
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,590
And I'm watching the photos of a murder.

170
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,830
How is your work

171
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,070
at Chen Shuo's law firm?

172
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,070
Not bad.

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,630
But he is too stingy.

174
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,680
He only pays me 5,000 yuan a month.

175
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:02,290
You can't chop off the flesh on a flea's legs.

176
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,020
Yingzi,

177
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,790
I'm here to inform you.

178
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,430
Of what?

179
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:06,990
Sit down.

180
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,070
Mr. Chen

181
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:10,510
likes your house.

182
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,710
He kept asking me about your house.

183
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,990
He's been asking around a lot.

184
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,300
I asked him why he wanted to know.

185
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,830
He said he liked that house.

186
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,170
If you can't keep it,

187
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,230
he'll buy it at the auction.

188
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,190
Just buy it.

189
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,630
Lanlan,

190
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,200
tell him when you see him at work

191
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,930
that before I moved out of that house,

192
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,630
I had cast a spell on it.

193
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,480
Besides me,

194
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,590
whoever moves in

195
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,770
will die a horrible death.

196
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:37,630
Fine.

197
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,890
[Da Zheng Law Firm]

198
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,310
That's what she said?

199
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,150
Yes.

200
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:44,990
She looked so scary when she said it.

201
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:45,990
It seemed

202
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,590
she hated you very much.

203
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:50,160
Shuo, I think you'd better forget it.

204
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,470
Just tell her

205
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,870
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

206
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,190
If this house isn't haunted,

207
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:55,190
I won't buy it.

208
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,510
Yan Qi.

209
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,880
You miss me?

210
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,470
I miss you too.

211
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,470
Let's have dinner together.

212
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,440
Okay, I'll call you later.

213
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,740
Zhang Shilan, book a table for me.

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,410
Mr. Chen!

215
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,240
You're a man of honor.

216
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,800
Ignore those bitchy women in society.

217
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,080
Which one is a bitch?

218
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:24,990
The one who came that day.

219
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,600
She doesn't look like a...

220
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,900
It's none of your business.

221
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Don't ask questions that are not related to you, okay?

222
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,790
I'm just concerned about you.

223
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:33,710
I don't need your concern.

224
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,320
It's not your job.

225
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,470
I just think...

226
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,520
Shuo,

227
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,310
if you want someone

228
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,730
to be with you after work,

229
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,650
I can be the one.

230
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:49,050
You don't need to pay me extra money.

231
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,310
Okay.

232
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:54,470
Okay.

233
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,130
Get back to work.

234
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:15,990
Hello, Unscrupulous Cheng.

235
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,830
Don't bother me, okay?

236
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,990
You just want my house.

237
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,820
Take it if you dare.

238
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,990
Let me kindly remind you again.

239
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,770
The deadline for the appeal is three days away.

240
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,510
Don't worry about me.

241
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,570
Anything else?

242
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,320
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

243
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,180
Righteous Luo.

244
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,850
You introduced Zhang Shilan

245
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,570
to me as an assistant.

246
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,190
Are you up to something?

247
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,830
What are you talking about?

248
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,760
What could I possibly have in mind?

249
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
You think I'm not picky,

250
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,440
so you found someone to seduce me, right?

251
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,930
What?

252
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,650
Unscrupulous Chen, what are you thinking about?

253
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,480
I can take you to the hospital

254
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,740
to see if you have a delusional disorder.

255
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,620
Really?

256
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,880
It's not a honey trap?

257
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,870
Do you still need a honey trap?

258
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:05,750
Buddy, aren't you hunting everywhere?

259
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,480
I warn you, Unscrupulous Chen.

260
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:08,920
Don't bully Lanlan.

261
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,410
Or I'll teach you a lesson.

262
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,960
Bye.

263
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,150
What's wrong?

264
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,510
He said he thought

265
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,260
Lanlan seduced him.

266
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,900
I told you before.

267
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,380
You're playing with fire.

268
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,110
Xue,

269
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,800
I thought Luo Yingzi

270
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,900
introduced Zhang Shilan as an assistant

271
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
to get rid of this burden.

272
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,550
But I'm a little confused now.

273
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,320
She knows my nature.

274
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,950
Isn't she sending the sheep to the tiger's den?

275
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,740
You're doomed.

276
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,780
What?

277
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,700
You're doomed.

278
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,060
I think

279
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,650
she doesn't like you at all.

280
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,950
What are you talking about?

281
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,250
I don't like her either.

282
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,050
You know yourself very well.

283
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,320
Who did you fall in love with before?

284
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,830
You dug a hole

285
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:06,340
and jumped inside.

286
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:07,990
Right?

287
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,350
Yingzi.

288
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:22,670
What's the rush? I'm still at work.

289
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,650
What would you like to drink?

290
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:25,320
No, thanks.

291
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:27,170
Can I have some of your cake?

292
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,600
Okay.

293
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,860
Excuse me, another spoon, please.

294
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,150
How are you doing with Chen Shuo?

295
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,410
Did you learn anything there?

296
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,730
Not bad. What can I learn?

297
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,440
I'm just his assistant.

298
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,050
I don't have access to

299
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,840
the legal business either.

300
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,370
You can learn some if you want to.

301
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,840
I usually

302
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,870
followed him wherever he went.

303
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,950
I carried his bags, booked hotels,

304
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,210
or ran errands and bought things for him.

305
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,750
What can I learn from these?

306
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,710
Didn't he let you get involved in work?

307
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,310
No.

308
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,470
Unscrupulous Chen

309
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,400
really thinks of you as his little follower.

310
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,160
Exactly.

311
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,630
By the way,

312
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,520
I told him about your house.

313
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,520
He said

314
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,540
he didn't believe in ghosts.

315
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,050
If this house isn't haunted,

316
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,980
he won't like it.

317
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,110
I knew he was up to no good.

318
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,050
He still keeps an eye on my case.

319
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,630
By the way, Lanlan.

320
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm just reminding you.

321
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,960
You're an administrative assistant.

322
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,630
So,

323
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,340
you just do

324
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,110
what you should do.

325
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:35,830
And try to do our best.

326
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,760
But you shouldn't

327
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,980
care about other things,

328
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,210
especially about his private life.

329
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,290
Don't worry about him

330
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,970
to avoid misunderstandings.

331
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
Misunderstandings?

332
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,860
Why?

333
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,440
No, I am just...

334
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,660
It's just a reminder.

335
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,700
Hi, Mr. Chen.

336
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,760
You want a battery?

337
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,120
Four. Okay, I'll get them now.

338
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,180
I'll be right back.

339
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:10,720
See? It's all about this.

340
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,140
Enjoy your coffee break.

341
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,870
I'm going to buy him batteries.

342
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,420
Okay.

343
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,220
Mr. Chen,

344
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,160
this is the material we prepared.

345
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,920
Excuse me, I have to take this.

346
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,460
Hello, Righteous Luo.

347
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,590
Hello, Unscrupulous Chen.

348
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,350
Why are you so shameless?

349
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,210
Why do you always feel so good?

350
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,350
Do you have to ask Lanlan to run errands for you

351
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,060
for batteries?

352
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,710
And then, you said she was seducing you.

353
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,060
Listen.

354
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,750
We had a deal

355
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,550
Lanlan would be your assistant,

356
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,120
not your housework helper.

357
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,330
Righteous Luo, what's wrong with you?

358
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,890
You know,

359
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,720
she's my assistant.

360
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,870
I can use her any way I want.

361
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,400
It's none of your business.

362
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,750
You'd better let her do the things

363
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,660
that she can learn something from, you know?

364
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,350
Also,

365
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,650
don't ask about my situation.

366
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,230
Mind your own business.

367
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,110
What kind of person is this?

368
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,300
Sorry.

369
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:22,820
Let's continue.

370
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,070
Hello.

371
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,430
Are you Mr. Wang?

372
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,740
Who are you?

373
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:38,070
We are Xu Jianshe's lawyers.

374
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,780
What do you want from me?

375
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,110
Mr. Wang.

376
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,180
You were sentenced to one year

377
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,490
because of fighting.

378
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,110
But...

379
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,260
Xu Jianshe

380
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:50,230
may be facing life in prison right now.

381
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:52,090
We just want to ask you something.

382
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:54,380
Go ahead.

383
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,200
When you

384
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,030
saw them walking

385
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,070
from the woods,

386
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,670
who was holding a stick?

387
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,930
Xu Jianshe was holding it.

388
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,710
But based on your testimony in the first instance,

389
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,260
the place you were standing

390
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,130
was at least 40 or 50 meters away from the woods.

391
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,329
It was so dark,

392
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,800
and there were no street lights.

393
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
Could you see it clearly?

394
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,050
Miss.

395
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,960
Even without street lights,

396
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,819
I could tell his weight and height.

397
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,240
Xu Jianshe is thin.

398
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,890
Zhang Yulin is fat.

399
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:25,710
Well...

400
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,670
It's said that the tool

401
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,420
was very thin.

402
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,810
He stood so far away.

403
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,670
Did you really see it clearly?

404
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,120
I saw it clearly.

405
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,930
Xu Jianshe was holding a stick.

406
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,730
He even shook the blood off.

407
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,000
Which hand did he use?

408
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,710
How did he shake it off?

409
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,480
Can you...

410
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,430
You mean

411
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,630
the right hand, right?

412
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,820
He used his right hand, right?

413
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,030
Let me show you again.

414
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,140
Like this.

415
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,030
Okay.

416
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,770
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

417
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,620
Sorry to bother you.

418
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,220
Excuse us.

419
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:02,450
Mr. Zhang is kind.

420
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,890
He did fight that day,

421
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,860
but he would never kill anyone.

422
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,250
We saw it that day.

423
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,660
Xu Jianshe ran out of the woods.

424
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,730
He was holding a stick.

425
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,590
Which hand?

426
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:14,970
Left hand.

427
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,750
Left hand?

428
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,280
Yes.

429
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,390
When he came out with that stick in his left hand,

430
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,610
did he make any moves?

431
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,610
Like shaking the blood off?

432
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,820
Yes, he used his left hand to shake it off.

433
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,820
How?

434
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,940
It's about like this.

435
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,040
How did he shake it off?

436
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,620
He just did like this.

437
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,130
Just like this.

438
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,660
Are you sure he did it with his right hand?

439
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,510
I'm sure. He did this.

440
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,720
This place is really deserted.

441
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,110
No wonder there are few people.

442
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,030
They must have made up the testimonies together,

443
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,830
but they didn't do it carefully.

444
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,610
So they gave themselves away.

445
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,670
Maybe they forgot what happened after a long time?

446
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,130
It might not be the reason.

447
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,800
The blood-shaking details

448
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,990
appeared in their testimonies.

449
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,180
It means that the police

450
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,840
made them recall it back then.

451
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,190
Maybe after Zhang Yulin

452
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,500
tricked Xu Jianshe into running away,

453
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,230
he found those people

454
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,710
to make false testimony.

455
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,630
Yes.

456
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,230
They are Zhang Yulin's friends.

457
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,270
They don't know Xu Jianshe.

458
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,390
So they must have

459
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:24,890
put the blame on a stranger

460
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,370
so that they could palliate their crime.

461
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:27,880
Right?

462
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,160
We're almost there.

463
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,040
According to the file of the first instance,

464
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,080
they were here.

465
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,070
Over there,

466
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,030
they saw Zhang Yulin and Xu Jianshe

467
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,790
come out from the woods.

468
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,480
It was the second day of the lunar calendar. Today is the third day.

469
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,230
The case happened around the same time

470
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:49,070
as now.

471
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,790
Qiu Hua,

472
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:52,710
stand here.

473
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:53,710
And I'll go in.

474
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,030
Okay.

475
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,990
I'll call you then.

476
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,490
Okay.

477
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,290
Yingzi.

478
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:23,000
Can you see me?

479
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:26,630
I can only see your figure,

480
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,080
but I can't see the details.

481
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,130
How about coming here?

482
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,950
Okay, I'll go find you now.

483
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,550
Okay.

484
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,150
Qiu Hua.

485
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:44,390
It's so dark here at this hour.

486
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,790
People outside can't see clearly

487
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:47,120
what's going on inside.

488
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,790
The evidence of the first instance is not sufficient.

489
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,430
Yes.

490
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,690
Xu Jianshe ran away.

491
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,670
Zhang Yulin turned himself in.

492
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,120
In this case,

493
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,750
it won't benefit us in court.

494
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,000
Let's go.

495
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,100
What are you doing?

496
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,750
Hurry up.

497
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,450
Who are you?

498
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,120
It's them.

499
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,470
It's them.
Who are they?

500
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:06,390
Stop!

501
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:06,870
Who are you?

502
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:07,540
It's them.

503
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,280
It's them.

504
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:14,990
Who are you?

505
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,290
Who are you?
Who are you?

506
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,430
We're just passing by.

507
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,490
What are you doing?

508
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,250
Are you Xu Jianshe's lawyers?

509
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,950
I heard

510
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,870
someone

511
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,510
asking questions today.

512
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,680
As expected,

513
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,250
you came here tonight.

514
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,440
Madam, we're Xu Jianshe's lawyers.

515
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,220
We just want to

516
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,710
see this crime scene.

517
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,040
He killed a man.

518
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,500
The trial is over.

519
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,790
Why are you still here?

520
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,630
Calm down.

521
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,880
We meant no harm.

522
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,460
You're helping a murderer in a lawsuit.

523
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,230
How dare you say you didn't mean any harm?

524
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,030
That's right.

525
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,250
Are you the family of the victim?

526
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,220
We're Zhanjun's sisters.

527
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,420
The police have been here long ago.

528
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,990
Why are you here again?

529
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,900
What? You think he's right to kill someone?

530
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:00,120
My brother

531
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,990
was a lively young man.

532
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,590
He's just gone like that!

533
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:04,360
That's right.

534
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,740
Even though he killed a man,

535
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,680
you still want to defend him

536
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:08,770
and clear his name?

537
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,650
What are you thinking about?

538
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,120
Do you have any conscience?

539
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
Exactly.

540
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,830
That's right.

541
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,300
Madam,

542
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,810
we understand your feelings.

543
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,370
But we're here today

544
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,760
to find out

545
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,670
if your brother

546
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,630
was really killed by Xu Jianshe

547
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,430
or by someone else.

548
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:27,630
No. What are you talking about?

549
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,830
What do you mean?

550
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,710
Xu Jianshe is the murderer.

551
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,090
Yes.

552
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,690
He came out with a stick.

553
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,300
Many people can prove it, right?

554
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,950
Yes, we saw it.

555
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:37,480
Chubby Zhang did hit Zhanjun.

556
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,750
But what's his attitude?

557
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,000
He admitted his mistake

558
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,330
and paid for their loss.

559
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,470
But Xu

560
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,830
didn't even say sorry.

561
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:44,910
How can he be so evil?

562
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:45,990
That's right.
There are two of them.

563
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,990
He and Zhang...

564
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,010
Can you promise to say he didn't hit Zhanjun?

565
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,480
That's right.

566
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,830
He scolded us in court

567
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:50,920
and said we were screwing him out of money.

568
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,930
How can he say that?

569
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,660
Does he have any humanity left?

570
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,240
Calm down, everyone.

571
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,090
Think about it.

572
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:58,280
Xu Jianshe doesn't know Li Zhanjun.

573
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,250
He has no grudge against him.

574
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,230
What motive does he have

575
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,870
to kill Li Zhanjun?

576
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,520
Who said he didn't know him?

577
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,590
Not only did he know him,

578
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,790
he also borrowed money from my brother.

579
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,380
He lost money in business

580
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,530
and borrowed money everywhere.

581
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,830
He also borrowed 200,000 from my brother.

582
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:16,010
He wanted to beat my brother to death

583
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,430
so he wouldn't have to pay the money back.

584
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:17,750
Yes.

585
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,280
It's not right.

586
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:20,560
There is no such plot in the first instance.

587
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,030
We just found it out.

588
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,240
During this time,

589
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,520
I've been organizing my brother's belongings.

590
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,470
I found an IOU

591
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,050
he left at my brother's.

592
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,510
I remember

593
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,600
before my brother died,

594
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,870
he had been calling for the money.

595
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,200
Yes.

596
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,180
Looks like that

597
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,170
the person on the phone must be him.

598
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,990
We've submitted the IOU to the court.

599
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,920
It will appear in the second instance.

600
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,120
Stop talking to them.

601
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,320
They just want to deny it.

602
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
They want to blame it on Zhang.

603
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:44,860
No, no.

604
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:45,950
It must be so.

605
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,070
If he didn't kill Zhanjun,

606
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,390
then why would he run away?

607
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:48,710
Yes.

608
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,770
Why did he run away?

609
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,580
What are you doing?

610
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,970
What are you doing?

611
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,530
What are you doing?

612
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,100
-Why are there so many people in the middle of the night? -Officers.

613
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,000
What are you doing here?

614
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,560
We are lawyers.

615
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,260
Here's our lawyer's license.

616
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,410
Take a look, please.

617
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,040
There was a case

618
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,490
in the woods last year.

619
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,350
We wanted to investigate on the scene.

620
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,570
We didn't expect to come across them.

621
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,870
Aren't you Li Zhanjun's family?

622
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,320
Why did you bring so many people

623
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,090
surrounding the two lawyers at night?

624
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:33,620
What are you talking about?

625
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,400
They are

626
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,190
the lawyers of that murderer.

627
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,410
It's late at night.

628
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,440
If they didn't come here,

629
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,630
how could we surround them?

630
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,670
That's right.

631
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:43,910
It's nothing serious.

632
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,870
We just wanted to get some information

633
00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:47,170
from the victim's family.

634
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:47,790
Really?

635
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,640
Yes.

636
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,130
Are you sure everything's fine?

637
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,450
It's fine here.

638
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,540
You can go home now.

639
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,360
Go home and sleep.

640
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,890
Go ahead.

641
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:55,630
Go back to your homes.

642
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,340
Let's go.

643
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,490
It's so late. How can they do this?

644
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,160
Stop talking. Let's go.

645
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,160
Did they give you a hard time?

646
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,810
Are you okay?

647
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,740
No, they didn't.

648
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,670
Please understand.

649
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,130
After all, they're the victim's family.

650
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:10,050
It's common in this village.

651
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:11,400
I understand.

652
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,970
It was scary

653
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,420
to be surrounded by so many people

654
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,420
all of a sudden.

655
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,350
We were frightened.

656
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:16,880
Thank you.

657
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,450
Are you okay?

658
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:17,930
Yes.

659
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,040
Let's go together.

660
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,510
Actually, it's not easy for their family.

661
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,650
Li Zhanjun was the only son in his family.

662
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,150
He had three older sisters.

663
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,610
Their living conditions are not that good.

664
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,590
It all depended on him to make money.

665
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,180
A young man

666
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,190
suddenly died.

667
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,500
Their family broke down suddenly.

668
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,800
After hearing about his death,

669
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,140
his mother fainted.

670
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,900
She died

671
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
before the trial.

672
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,770
His father had a stroke.

673
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,370
He's still lying in bed.

674
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,660
He can't take care of himself,

675
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
so he needs others to look after him.

676
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,280
It's quite miserable.

677
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:49,980
Well,

678
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,570
be careful

679
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,870
when you investigate the scene later.

680
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,130
Okay, thank you.

681
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:54,900
We'll leave now.
It's okay.

682
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,020
Thank you.
Okay.

683
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,620
Let's go.

684
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,810
We know his motive for murder now.

685
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,320
Hello, Mrs. Ma.

686
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,680
There's an urgent matter.

687
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:26,180
Come to the law firm now.

688
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,070
I know it's 11 p.m.

689
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,920
We haven't rested at this hour.

690
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,240
Hurry up.

691
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,120
We'll wait for you at the law firm.

692
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,960
You're thinking what I'm thinking.

693
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,560
I planned to call her just now.

694
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,650
Yeah, we're being kept in the dark about such an important plot.

695
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,920
Did she want to

696
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,510
see us lose the lawsuit?

697
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,990
Ms. Luo, you called me here in such a hurry...

698
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,570
Why didn't you tell us

699
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:09,120
Xu Jianshe knew the victim?

700
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,130
How did you know?

701
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,290
How did we know?

702
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,510
Do you think you can hide this from us, Mrs. Ma?

703
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:20,570
Do you know what we are most afraid of?

704
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,250
We're most afraid that our clients would hide the truth from us.

705
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,220
You kept it from us,

706
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:26,110
but they already knew it.

707
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,740
When we are asked in court,

708
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,570
we'll be pushed to the edge.

709
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,130
Just wait to lose the lawsuit.

710
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:33,260
No, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

711
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,150
I'm sorry about this.

712
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:37,500
I didn't know this in the first instance.

713
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,630
I didn't know it

714
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,270
until one of his sisters called me

715
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,160
a few days ago.

716
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:43,190
Why didn't you tell us the other day?

717
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,470
I...

718
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,390
I was too busy to recall it.

719
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,550
Really?

720
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,410
Is this marital fidelity?

721
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,030
Mrs. Ma,

722
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,070
since Xu Jianshe knows the victim,

723
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,030
and had a debt dispute with him,

724
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:03,760
then he had a motive to hit him.

725
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,910
This will be bad for the second instance.

726
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:08,990
Ms. Qiu,

727
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,260
I'll believe if you say

728
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,710
Jianshe went too far

729
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:13,730
during the fight.

730
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,680
But I'll never believe

731
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,720
Jianshe killed someone

732
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,090
to renege on a debt.

733
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,200
He owes a lot of money

734
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,310
for running his own company.

735
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,310
Will he kill all of them?

736
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,630
But we won't be able to argue that

737
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,800
he didn't have a motive to hit.

738
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,190
What should we do?

739
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,580
I met him through a friend.

740
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:53,350
With this friend as a guarantor,

741
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:57,210
I borrowed 200,000 from him.

742
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,070
Really, we only met once.

743
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,110
In business,

744
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,170
interbank lending is very common.

745
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:08,370
He lent me the money

746
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,650
to earn some interest.

747
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,580
But that night,

748
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,260
because of my family

749
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,510
and business matters,

750
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,950
I was very annoyed.

751
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,440
I kept drinking, without talking to others.

752
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,700
When they were fighting,

753
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,240
I didn't recognize it was him.

754
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,380
So I was trying to keep them apart.

755
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,740
To be honest,

756
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,420
you may already know that I...

757
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,030
I have five more apartments,

758
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,410
with good locations.

759
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,330
They're worth tens of millions.

760
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:37,380
How could I kill him

761
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,220
just because of 200,000 yuan?

762
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,910
After his death,

763
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,820
the debt will still be there.

764
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,000
I have to give it back to his family, too, right?

765
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,290
Mr. Xu.

766
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,080
During the first instance,

767
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,210
did they ask if you two knew each other?

768
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,240
Yes.

769
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,190
I also told the truth.

770
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,560
I said I met him before.

771
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,450
But

772
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,150
I didn't mention the debt.

773
00:29:58,410 --> 00:29:59,530
But Mr. Xu,

774
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,050
it's a fact that

775
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,550
you know him

776
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,010
and had a debt dispute with him.

777
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,850
The victim has submitted the evidence

778
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,890
to the court.

779
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,160
In the second instance,

780
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,020
they will ask questions about it.

781
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,610
They'll say you have a motive to hurt him.

782
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,210
If that's the case,

783
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,200
it'll be impossible

784
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,790
to win the advocacy of innocence.

785
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,910
So we're here

786
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,860
to persuade you to agree to our two-step defense.

787
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:26,620
I hope you...

788
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:28,160
Are you kidding me?

789
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,550
I don't understand.

790
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,680
You are my lawyers.

791
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,430
Why don't you want to defend me,

792
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,230
but persuade me to confess?

793
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,730
Are you doing it or not?

794
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:37,950
Get lost!

795
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,450
Xu Jianshe.

796
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,690
Behave properly.

797
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,520
Listen.

798
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,410
If you want to be my lawyers,

799
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,330
defend me as innocent.

800
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:00,400
Xu Jianshe has a propensity for violence.

801
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:02,270
He has poor self-control ability.

802
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,570
With his character,

803
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,480
even if he didn't know the victim,

804
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,590
he could have killed him

805
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,210
if he was upset

806
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,650
and had some drinks.

807
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,960
Drop me off after crossing the bridge.

808
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,530
Where are you going? I can give you a ride.

809
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,290
No need.

810
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,770
Why?

811
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:24,500
Quanquan?

812
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,440
Mind your own business.

813
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,600
Just pull over.

814
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,320
Where is he?

815
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
Under the bridge?

816
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,320
Okay, I'll drop you off under the bridge.

817
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,230
So, although Xu Jianshe

818
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,540
has been asking us to plead him not guilty,

819
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,500
I just have a hunch.

820
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,340
I think

821
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,320
he did it.

822
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:56,080
Is the current evidence supporting this?

823
00:31:56,810 --> 00:31:59,070
At least it looks weak to me.

824
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:07,190
As a lawyer,

825
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,730
you shouldn't have said that.

826
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,490
There are many kinds of ethics

827
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,190
in the world.

828
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:19,190
General ethics

829
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,810
and professional ones.

830
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,680
As lawyers,

831
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:24,550
our professional ethics

832
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,310
are that

833
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,640
since you accepted the entrustment,

834
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,910
you should do your best to serve your clients

835
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,850
and protect their legal rights.

836
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,280
Did Xu Jianshe

837
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,240
hit Li Zhanjun?

838
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,600
No one else knows.

839
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,670
If the current evidence

840
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,270
can't prove that it was done by Xu Jianshe,

841
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,260
then he's innocent until proven guilty.

842
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,910
As his lawyer, you should plead him not guilty.

843
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:56,980
This

844
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:00,350
is the meaning of law.

845
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,390
As a lawyer,

846
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,850
the highest morality is to uphold the dignity of the law.

847
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,820
If you suspect your client is guilty,

848
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:16,070
you don't have to accept the entrustment.

849
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,530
But if you've accepted it,

850
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,840
you have to defend him,

851
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,330
instead of conspiring with the prosecution

852
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,820
to prove his guilt.

853
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,930
Otherwise,

854
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,390
what's the point of

855
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,290
the defender system？

856
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,090
I see.

857
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,370
But in my mind...

858
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:44,440
It's the conflict between moral and professional ethics.

859
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,040
As a lawyer,

860
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:48,630
you have to

861
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,790
get through this first.

862
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:56,710
You're right.

863
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,929
Hello, Unscrupulous Chen.

864
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,420
If you like my house,

865
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,860
you can take it.

866
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,070
Don't call me all the time.

867
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:17,130
Righteous Luo, let me say it again.

868
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,210
The appeal is about to end.

869
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,560
You really don't want the house?

870
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,190
It's none of your business.

871
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,320
You know that

872
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,469
I want your house.

873
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,920
You want it to be your mourning hall?

874
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,840
That's easy.

875
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,110
Just put up some wreaths.

876
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,989
Bye.

877
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,340
Shameless!

878
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:37,639
Why can't you understand my words?

879
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,730
Gosh.

880
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,650
Hello, Dad, what's wrong?

881
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,570
Yingzi, you have to come back quickly.

882
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
What's wrong, Dad?

883
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,520
What happened?

884
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,060
Come back. Come back quickly.

885
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,090
It'll be too late...

886
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:57,940
Dad, you...

887
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,460
Tell me what happened.

888
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,050
I'm going back now.

889
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,600
Your mother...

890
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:04,690
Your mother was seriously sick.

891
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,080
Come back quickly.

892
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,880
Come back to see your mom.

893
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,290
Hello, Qiu Hua.

894
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,380
Something happened to my mom.

895
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,310
I'm on the highway back to Lingnan.

896
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,830
If anything happens here,

897
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,090
please take care of it.

898
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,420
Excuse me, where is the ICU?

899
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,270
This way. On the second floor.

900
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,900
Thank you.

901
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,830
Come here now. She's seriously ill.

902
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,550
Dad.

903
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,380
Dad.

904
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,060
Dad, how's my mom?

905
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,980
Dad, I'm Yingzi.

906
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:02,400
Dad.

907
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,160
How is mom?

908
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,350
Yingzi, you're back.

909
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:10,540
Your mom is still in danger.

910
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,890
I'll go check on her.

911
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,200
Dad.

912
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,570
What happened?

913
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,600
How could she be so bad?

914
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,370
Who?

915
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,410
Who else?

916
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:29,260
After I took my students

917
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,360
to take back our old house,

918
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,890
after a few days,

919
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,320
they bought a big house

920
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,090
near ours.

921
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,160
They have money.

922
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:44,650
They were just pretending

923
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,920
to be poor.

924
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,330
Although our houses are close to each other,

925
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,370
we

926
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:55,920
have no contact at all.

927
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,480
But

928
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,440
when your mom went to the market

929
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,690
this morning,

930
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,050
she came across

931
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:10,840
Liu Ming's mother there.

932
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,300
Ms., how much is this?

933
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,390
8 yuan per catty.

934
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,070
What about this?

935
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,850
Six yuan.

936
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,450
Pick the ones you like.

937
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:34,580
You...

938
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,850
What a coincidence.

939
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,000
Why are you avoiding me?

940
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,480
It's in public.

941
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,750
Can you stop it?

942
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:45,350
What?

943
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,870
Are you afraid of embarrassing yourself?

944
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,150
I'm not.

945
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,620
I'm afraid you'll be embarrassed.

946
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,550
I'm not afraid.

947
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,390
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

948
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,440
My son is upright,

949
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,220
unlike your daughter.

950
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,720
She was cheating!

951
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,090
What are you talking about?

952
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:01,330
What? Don't you understand my words?

953
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,960
Your daughter cheated on my son

954
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,780
by having an affair with others.

955
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,560
My son went abroad

956
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,830
because he couldn't stand it.

957
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,720
Nonsense.

958
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,950
It's…
What nonsense?

959
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:13,300
Your daughter is so shameless.

960
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,770
She occupied the house my son bought.

961
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,840
You and your husband are  professors at a university?

962
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,220
You have no shame.

963
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,840
It's an honor

964
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,950
to have such a daughter, isn't it?

965
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,270
Unreasonable.

966
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,270
What's wrong?

967
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,390
You feel embarrassed now?

968
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,400
If you do,

969
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,550
don't let your daughter do those dirty things.

970
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,410
I'm telling you, you old bastard.

971
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,590
Ask your daughter

972
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,870
to return my son's house to us.

973
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,370
Or I'll scold you every time I see you.

974
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,420
I'll make you too shameful to live here sooner or later.

975
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,980
Why are you so rude?

976
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,190
What kind of upbringing do you have?

977
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,900
That's what I'm trying to say

978
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,120
in front of everyone.

979
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,740
Your daughter cheated on my son

980
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,220
and stole our house.

981
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,970
You two only cared about your own child

982
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,070
and kicked us out.

983
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,360
Now you feel embarrassed?

984
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,280
You...

985
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:00,830
You...

986
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:01,560
What?

987
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,970
How dare you talk about me?

988
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,150
Go home and look in the mirror!

989
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,150
Look at yourself!

990
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:06,720
Say it!

991
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:07,350
What are you gonna say?

992
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:10,770
She knew your mom had high blood pressure and heart disease,

993
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,590
so she deliberately angered her.

994
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,990
Leave her alone. She's pretending to be dead.

995
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,950
Your mom couldn't stand that.

996
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,140
120?

997
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,800
There's something I need to talk to you about.

998
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,980
The patient had a massive hemorrhage in the brain

999
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:37,380
and it took a long time before getting treatment.

1000
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:40,120
Vitals indicate she's alive.

1001
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,720
But this kind of life

1002
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,220
is without thinking and consciousness.

1003
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,490
In other words,

1004
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:47,230
she has become vegetative.

1005
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:49,930
Now you need to make a decision.

1006
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,680
If we keep her breathing,

1007
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,730
she can continue to live like this.

1008
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,560
But in fact,

1009
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,130
the chance of waking up is extremely slim.

1010
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,050
From the definition of death nowadays,

1011
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:03,650
we can say she's dead.

1012
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,610
She's still breathing and has a pulse.

1013
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,390
It depends on

1014
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,480
if you want her to live in such a way.

1015
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:14,750
Sir,

1016
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,040
what are the chances

1017
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:20,130
of her waking up?

1018
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,880
There is no absolute answer in medical matters.

1019
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,230
There used to be patients who had been in a coma for many years.

1020
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,910
They miraculously woke up

1021
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,650
by the company and care of their family.

1022
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,080
But that were just extreme cases.

1023
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,690
Thank you, sir.

1024
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,410
I see.

1025
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,130
What's your decision?

1026
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,620
She just had a brain hemorrhage.

1027
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,170
How can we not try our best?

1028
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,740
How could we

1029
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,240
let her leave like this?

1030
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,510
Yingzi.

1031
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:14,690
Yingzi.

1032
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,410
Dad,

1033
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,030
go to Jingbei with me.

1034
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,020
I can take care of you two

1035
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,440
when you're around.

1036
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,590
And I'll be relieved.

1037
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:03,950
Yingzi.

1038
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:08,350
Just focus on your career.

1039
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,010
I'll continue to teach students.

1040
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:16,160
Don't worry about your mom.

1041
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:18,710
She's got two caregivers

1042
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,230
taking turns in taking care of her.

1043
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,270
I'll accompany her after class every day.

1044
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,740
But I just don't feel comfortable

1045
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,140
leaving my mom in the care of two outsiders.

1046
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:37,570
Now we're in a defamiliarization society.

1047
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:40,450
Whose coming and going

1048
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,550
is not given to strangers?

1049
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,300
Just go back to work.

1050
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,750
Come back and talk to your mom when you have time.
