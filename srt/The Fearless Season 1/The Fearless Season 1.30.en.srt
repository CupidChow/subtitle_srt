4
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:34,630
You and Xu Jianshe are divorced.

5
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,910
So even if we accept the request,

6
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:39,500
you can't request it.

7
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,140
It should be his mother.

8
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,870
His mother passed away.

9
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,640
After Jianshe's incident,

10
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,950
his mother fell sick.

11
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,759
I've taken care of his mother in the hospital for three months,

12
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,660
but I couldn't keep her alive.

13
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,610
I thought.

14
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,360
With his mother's passing,

15
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,150
Jianshe doesn't have siblings

16
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:05,670
or immediate family.

17
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,830
I'm the only one he can rely on.

18
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,990
So even if I have to spend all my money,

19
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,120
I have to save him.

20
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,930
By the way,

21
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,510
during the first trial,

22
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,990
I asked the lawyer

23
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,270
to let Jianshe sign his name

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,310

How is it?

37
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,870
How do you feel about her now?

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm not sure.

39
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,830
But overall, it's okay.

40
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:09,410
But she tried her best to dye her relationship with her ex-husband.

41
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,010
I think it's quite dramatic.

42
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,740
But it's real that she wants

43
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,780
to save her husband.

44
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,290
Yes.

45
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,360
I think so.

46
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,230
Anyway,

47
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,930
she sent Xu Jianshe 1,000 yuan

48
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,620
and persuaded him to turn himself in.

49
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,670
This is the truth.

Without the confession,

51
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,310
a death sentence with a reprieve is also possible.

52
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,390
That means this woman is sensible.

53
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:30,829
Yes.

I think this woman has a clear mind.

Think about it. The first trial isn't over yet.

Yes.

When she took out that power of attorney just now,

62
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,210
I was startled.

63
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,930
She is a clever person.

64
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,950
I'm still willing to deal with clever people.

65
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,700

only he and Zhang Yulin entered this small grove

70
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,520
in the end.

71
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,070
And Zhang Yulin testified that

72
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,280
that Xu Jianshe

73
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,860
gave the last fatal blow.

74
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,090
Many people's testimony say

75
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,690
they saw Xu Jianshe holding the stick.

76
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:18,730
I saw it.

77
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:22,230
But

78
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,130
only two of them

79
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,470
were at the scene.

80
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:27,830
If it's just the two of them,

81
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,970
in other words,

82
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,060
there's a 50-percent possibility

83
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,700
that Xu Jianshe hit him to death.

84
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,370
Sister.

85
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,070
The law cannot rely solely on probability

86
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,830
to determine guilt and sentencing.

87
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:39,409
If that's the case,

88
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,680
Xu Jianshe wasn't involved at first.

89
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,170
He was just trying to stop them.

90
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,120
What grudge did he have in the end?

91
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,950
so that he had to hit him to death?

92
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,360
On the contrary, Zhang Yulin

93
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,270
was the one who beat him first.

94
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,370
If you talk about the probability,

95
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,240
he's the most likely.

96
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,320
You just said the law can't rely solely on probability.

97
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,150
Yes.

98
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,040
So in this situation,

99
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,460
the court should do everything possible

100
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,990
to find out the truth.

101
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,400
Maybe they found out everything they could find.

102
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,730
There's no way to investigate it clearly.

103
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:09,800
What's more,

104
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,350
whether Zhang Yulin’s confession

105
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,350
can be used as evidence for the sentence.

106
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,830
This is the key question.

107
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,560
He is an accomplice in the case.

108
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,670
He has a major stake in this.

109
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,470
If what Ma Lili said was true,

110
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,350
he tricked Xu Jianshe to run away,

111
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,690
then he turned himself in

112
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,960
and testified against Xu Jianshe.

113
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,590
The credibility of his testimony

114
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,870
is worth considering.

115
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,730
At least it means that Xu Jianshe is simple-minded.

116
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,810
I found the company information of Xu Jianshe here.

117
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,540
There is a record of having been executed.

118
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:46,720
I don't think the profit is any better.

119
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,820
Ma Lili didn't mention

120
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,470
the financial condition of Xu Jianshe's company just now.

121
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,200

It’s okay.
I’m sorry.

137

I have a question.

138
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,280
Was this company closed before the accident or

139
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,630
after the accident?

140
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:56,350
The company was closed after the accident.

141
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,590
It was not easy to do business before.

00:06:58,790 --> 00:06:59,810
With this incident,

143
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,740
the boss went in.

144
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,520
so it's closed.

Miss, you have no idea.

147
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,920
This company originally belongs to him alone.

148
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,680
His ex-wife helped manage it for him.

149
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,060

After the accident,

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,590
didn't he plan to

156
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,820
sell this company to get money for compensation?

157
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,700
The company is in debt now.

158
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,920
He couldn't sell it for much money.

159
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,120
As you know,

160
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,860
Is it that your boss doesn't want to compensate

161
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,440
although he has money

162
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,900
or he just can’t afford it?

163
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,350
He has money.

164
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,790
Let me put it this way.

165
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,659
He must be rich.

166
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,390
Although the company looks like this,

167
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,120
it's closed.

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,310
But our boss

169
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:44,990
owns several properties

170
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,080
in Jingbei.

171
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,909
Within the second ring road,

172
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:48,840
two properties.

173
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,000
His company is not doing well.

174
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,360
and he just divorced.

175
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:01,590
I guess this person is emotionally unstable.

176
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,340
But  just now the security guard

177
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,150
said

178
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,680
he has two houses within the second ring road.

179
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,910
Why did he refuse compensation?

180
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,280
Maybe he didn't hit anyone.

181
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,320
That's why he didn't plead guilty or compensate.

182
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,600
That day, I don't know how it happened,

183
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,860
but suddenly two groups got into a fight.

184
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,020
They started fighting inside

185
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,650
and then continued fighting at this place.

186
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,630
Is it this person?

187
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,710
Liu, look. Is it him?

188
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,350
Yes.

189
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,309
It's him.

190
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,130
When the police brought the people over that day,

191
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:38,970
we all saw it.

192
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,990
He drank a lot on the day of the fight.

193
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,110
Did you see that?

194
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:42,830
Yes.

195
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:45,470
I even gave him several bottles of wine.

196
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,990
Did he participate in the fight

197
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,070
in the beginning?

198
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:49,410
No, he didn't.

199
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,190
He's older than them.

200
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,810
At first, he tried to stop them.

201
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:54,010
But when they fought,

202
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,590
I was afraid of blood on my body,

203
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:56,470
so I hid.

204
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,350
I didn't see what happened after that.

205
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,850
Is the grove where the incident happened nearby?

206
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,570
Over there.

207
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,390
Okay.

208
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,870
The trees are so dense here.

209
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,310
There's no street light.

210
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,280
How can they see clearly

211
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,750
what happened that night?

212
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,670
Why don't we wait another night?

213
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,650
We can come back at the same time.

214
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,350
Okay.

215
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,480
Let's go.

216
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,040
Let's go.

217
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,660
Do you still want to take on it?

218
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,240
Yes.

219
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,550
I feel itchy if I don't take on it.

220
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,680
But the first trial is over.

221
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,680
Without enough evidence,

222
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,450
the likelihood of a change of the verdict is low.

223
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,400
The more it is like this, the more reason there is to take on this case.

224
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,160
Besides,

225
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,730
we have some evidence in our hands.

226
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,330
The evidence is indeed weak.

227
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,440
What's the point of

228
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,070
always taking on safe cases?

229
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,190
Then take it.

230
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,330
This case is indeed difficult.

231
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:12,100
But young people should have the courage.

232
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,990
Challenge the impossible things.

233
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,360
In this lawsuit,

234
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,420
you must be prepared for various situations

235
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:19,830
Mr. Tao,

236
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,710
the key is if we can't win,

237
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,120
he'll be sentenced to life imprisonment.

238
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,790
Don't think too much.

239
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,890
The stage for criminal cases is limited,

240
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,290
But don't cross the line.

241
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,330
Just do your best.

242
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,810
Make the money you should earn.

243
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,650
Excuse me.

244
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:42,380
Hello?

245
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,390
Hey, Ms. Luo.

246
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,470
Mr. Han wants to see you later.

247
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay.

248
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,490
Don't tell me you haven't told him yet.

249
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:58,040
This is your fault.

250
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,010
He is the director of the Criminal Defense Department.

251
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,520
You should report to him first

252
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,600
before you come to the management committee.

253
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,240
Hurry up.

254
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:12,950
You've grown up.

255
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,800
You don't care about your master anymore, do you?

256
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,060
We're here.

257
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,580
As the old saying goes, a gentleman takes money with the right way.

258
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,100
How dare you make such immoral money?

259
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,110
Mr. Han,

260
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,010
You're not talking about yourself, are you?

261
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,810
How dare you talk to me like that?

262
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,670
We haven't signed the contract yet.

263
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,330
How do you know it's for money?

264
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Do you know how hard this case is?

265
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,190
The first trial has already issued a verdict,

266
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,880
and you want to overturn it in the second trial.

267
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,210
What if you lose?

268
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,800
How bad influence will it have on our firm?

269
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,430
I don't think

270
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,670
it will bring negative impact to the firm.

271
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:45,700
If nothing can be done after the first trial is over,

272
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,010
why would the country design the second trial system?

273
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,570
Besides,

274
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,610
as long as there is a second trial,

275
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,810
there will be a proxy.

276
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,830
If we lose the lawsuit,

277
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,030
why will it bring negative impact to the firm?

278
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,310
Easy for you to say.

279
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,300
I'm the head of the Criminal Defense Department.

280
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,680
If anything goes wrong,

281
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,620
I'll clean up the mess for you.

282
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,820
If the family of the client sues you,

283
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,280
I'll be responsible for you as your partner.

284
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,710
Don't just show off.

285
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,630
Learn to be a human.

286
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,460
Mr. Han,

287
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,870
you want to teach us how to be human, right?

288
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
If so,

289
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,010
I think there's no need.

290
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,190
It's my dad's responsibility.

291
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,180
Whether I can take on this case or not.

292
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,830
You give us an answer.

293
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,830
If we can't take it, give us a reason.

294
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,740
The case can be taken on,

295
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,380
but you may not take on it.

296
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,910
Go back and wait for the news from the partner meeting.

297
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,560
He still wants to intercept our cases.

298
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,110
We got several of his cases in hand.

299
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,540
So he's unsatisfied with us.

300
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,620
Look at him.

301
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,290
We can't give it to anyone except him.

302
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:49,310
Why don't we call Ma Lili

303
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,160
and tell her that there might be other people

304
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,290
who want to take on her case in the firm.

305
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,920
No.

306
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,050
Ma Lili is too cunning.

307
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,920
If she knows,

308
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,710
she'll think we have no background in the firm.

309
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,420
Yes, you're right.

310
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,230
Let’s wait and see.

311
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,660
Anyway, we can’t let Han take it on.

312
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,510
If we have no ideas,

313
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:09,110
we can go to find Fang Lihong.

314
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,590
Mr. Tao.

315
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,640
What?

316
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,860
Do you still see me as the head of the Criminal Defense Department?

317
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,590
What's wrong with me?

318
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,320
You need to let me handle the criminal case first.

319
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,070
without my permission,

320
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:28,200
you agreed to let them take on the case.

321
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,480
Two young girls

322
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,620
take on a case involving one life.

323
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,510
If something happens,

324
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,030
is it on you or me?

325
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:37,960
Didn't I ask them to report to you?

326
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,750
That was after you agreed.

327
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,430
What?

328
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,450
Do you want to assign my work?

329
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:44,870
Well...

330
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:45,990
Mr. Han,

331
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,480
what do you mean?

332
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,180
I didn't know they didn't tell you in advance.

333
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,640
Besides,

334
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,160
two young people

335
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,520
took on a big case.

336
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,190
You are already so successful.

337
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,950
You don't have to fight for food with two young people.

338
00:13:58,950 --> 00:13:59,880
What do you mean?

339
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,710
You mean

340
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,470
I want to compete with them for business?

341
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,710
Of course.

342
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,350
Stop arguing.

343
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,070
Now we all know

344
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:09,950
criminal cases

345
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,910
are very difficult to handle.

346
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,590
Since two young lawyers

347
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,720
are not afraid of difficulties,

348
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,090
let them experience it

349
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,750
if they want to take on it.

350
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,590
No.

351
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,230
What if they lose?

352
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,380
We have to be responsible for it.

353
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,200
We can't let them lose money and lose people.

354
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,240
If you know you can't win,

355
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,910
you can't take on it from beginning, right?

356
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,560
As long as Mr. Han can't take on the case,

357
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,940
all lawyers shouldn't take it.

358
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,460
What do you mean?

359
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:40,990
OK, Han.

360
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,620
Sit down.

361
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,380
Sit down.

362
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,110
Sit down.

363
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,590
Well,

364
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,170
I personally think

365
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,590
this case

366
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:51,560
is a big case

367
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,850
for two young lawyers.

368
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,670
I personally suggest

369
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,600
we choose an experienced lawyer

370
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,730
to cooperate with them

371
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,190
and lead them to fight, OK?

372
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,920
Who is suitable?

373
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,930
As for the criminal defense case,

374
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,140
I think

375
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,350
Mr. Han is the most professional.

376
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,000
No.

377
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,390
I'm not competing with them for business.

378
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,660
I have to make it clear first.

379
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,570
But I'm the head of the Criminal Defense Department.

380
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:23,290
I have to check this.

381
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,760
Yes.

382
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,970
We need to check.

383
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:27,710
What?

384
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,190
Ms. Fang said

385
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,460
it's for our own good.

386
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,780
Since what happened last time,

387
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,670
she has been looking for a chance

388
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,070
to help us get along with Han.

389
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,090
I don’t think it’s good.

390
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,560
I want to avoid people like him

391
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,890
as quickly as possible.

392
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,690
Why should we get along with him?

393
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,140
If you don’t want Han to take on it,

394
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,110
there is also a method.

395
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,720
As far as we know,

396
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,340
although Xu Jianshe's company is losing money,

397
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,400
he's actually an invisibly rich man.

398
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,120
He has many properties.

399
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,590
There are a few within the second ring road.

400
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,470
Within the second ring road.

401
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:03,670
It's worth millions.

402
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,570
More than that.

403
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,820
One apartment with an area of over 100 square meters.

404
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,610
It's worth several millions.

405
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,610
He is really rich.

406
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,150
Did you offer a price?

407
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:14,660
Not yet.

408
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,450
I’m waiting for you, Mr. Han.

409
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,200
It's about a life.

410
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,590
So later,

411
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,520
he may need to talk to you in detail.

412
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,660
Coming.

413
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,650
Ms Ma.

414
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,610
This is Mr. Han I told you.

415
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,630
Hello, Mr. Han.

416
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,040
Hello, Ms Ma.

417
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,130
Please have a seat.

418
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,310
Ms. Ma.

419
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,900
Mr. Han is the head of the Criminal Defense Department，

420
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,090
and an old lawyer.

421
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,040
In the past, he's handled

422
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,530
numerous criminal cases.

423
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,810
Even if he doesn't have the experience to defend to live,

424
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,700
he also has a lot of experience to defend to die.

425
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,160
Old lawyers are like old wandering doctors.

426
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,720
Very experienced.

427
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,590
Luo Yingzi.

428
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,730
You take the record.

429
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,490
OK.

430
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,960
Her words are rough but reasonable.

431
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,550
I've seen the first trial.

432
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:08,020
It's not like there's no room to defend in the second trial.

433
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,630
But the possibility is not high.

434
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,880
So you need to be fully prepared.

435
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,319
Do you still want to defend?

436
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,430
Of course.

437
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,990
Luo told me

438
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,109
that you love Xu Jianshe a lot.

439
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,230
As long as we have a chance,

440
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,510
we have to do our best

441
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,910
to save him, right?

442
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,030
It's like a person who has cancer.

443
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,670
Even if he is sentenced to death,

444
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,030
we need the best doctor to treat him.

445
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:36,740
Right?

446
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:37,510
Yes.

447
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,330
Mr. Han is like the best doctor.

448
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,310
Have you seen our case?

449
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:44,990
Yes.

450
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,120
How are you going to defend?

451
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,390
Let's not talk about how to defend.

452
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,670
The time of a lawyer is money.

453
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,660
Before signing the power of attorney,

454
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,480
I shouldn't say a word.

455
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,260
So let's sign the power of attorney first.

456
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:01,970
OK?

457
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:02,750
Qiu Hua,

458
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,760
give Ms. Ma the power of attorney.

459
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,250
The power of attorney is all standardized.

460
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,350
There's nothing to see.

461
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,360
Just sign it.

462
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,480
1.2 million.

463
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,260
Isn't it only 500,000?

464
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,240
[Don't look at me. Don't look at me.]

465
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:34,560
You get what you pay for.

466
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,580
It's like you go to the hospital to see a doctor.

467
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,230
Do you get a general appointment

468
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,610
or a specialist appointment?

469
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,610
It's not the same.

470
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,260
Yes.

471
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,270
If you pay 500,000 yuan,

472
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:46,310
he may be sentenced to life imprisonment.

473
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,770
But if you pay 1.2 million,

474
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,070
maybe he can be released soon.

475
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,560
No one dares to say that.

476
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,630
No matter who... He has to...

477
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:56,310
He just has to try his best.

478
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,300
Right?

479
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,430
The first trial is easier.

480
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:00,950
During the second trial,

481
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,470
It would require a senior court to

482
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,480
overturn the judgment.

483
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,230
It's quite difficult.

484
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
Mr. Han,

485
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,490
I'd better entrust Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu.

486
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,170
I won't bother a guru like you.

487
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,520
I'll sign with them.

488
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,470
No.

489
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,190
Our experience

490
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,010
is really not as experienced as Mr. Han.

491
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,500
But I've seen your lawsuits.

492
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,250
I've never seen Mr. Han's lawsuit.

493
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,780
I believe what I see is true.

494
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,050
Whatever.

495
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:30,850
Aren't you afraid that the second trial will uphold the original verdict?

496
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,090
Didn't you say it's very difficult?

497
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,650
You just try your best.

498
00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:34,990
If you can guarantee

499
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,330
the verdict can be overturned during the second trial,

500
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,470
I'll entrust you.

501
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,270
No one can guarantee that.

502
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,750
Do they dare?

503
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,660
No.

504
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,560
We didn't dare to say it from the beginning.

505
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,240
Right.

506
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,720
Aren't they only asking for 500,000?

507
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:02,090
After watching this case,

508
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,660
I'm really outraged.

509
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,480
OK.

510
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:10,030
I'll take on it with 500,000.

511
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,520
Mr. Han,

512
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,400
you would be at a loss for the 500,000 yuan.

513
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,680
What are you mumbling about?

514
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,280
Nothing.

515
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,030
It's mainly in front of the person.

516
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,110
I'll tell then.

517
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,250
I want to ask Ms. Qiu

518
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,760
how much the lastest case of Mr. Han is?

519
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:33,980
2 million.

520
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:35,980
Look at this. Look at this.

521
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,860
I have to tell you about this.

522
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,780
You may not know much

523
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:40,630
about our law industry.

524
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:43,620
An honorable lawyer like Mr. Han.

525
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,430
A case like yours

526
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,880
costs at least 2 million.

527
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:48,280
Yes.

528
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:51,030
I usually start with 2 million.

529
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,910
I can give you 1.2 million.

530
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,320
That's fate.

531
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,100
If you let him take on the case with 500,000 yuan,

532
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,670
it means

533
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,400
he doesn't care about other cases.

534
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,230
Luo Yingzi.

535
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,310
You and Qiu Hua

536
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,570
leave us alone.

537
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,190
I'll talk to Ms. Ma

538
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,250
in private.

539
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,960
Wait, wait.

540
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,990
I'll leave it to Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu.

541
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,150
Don't bother.

542
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,390
No, Ms Ma.

543
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:17,240
I can analyze this case for you.

544
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,310
You haven't seen several points.

545
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,440
You didn't analyse that.

546
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,910
You two leave first.

547
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,960
At the beginning,

548
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,430
I also thought

549
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:24,910
Ms. Qiu and I should leave.

550
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,390
Didn't you say you won't talk about the case

551
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:27,590
before signing the power of attorney?

552
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,860
Ms. Luo. Ms. Qiu.

553
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,230
You guys continue.

554
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,570
Let me...

555
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,120
You don't have to change it.

556
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:35,410
It's okay.

557
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,680
It won't take long.

558
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,010
Do you dare to bet?

559
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,140
Bet for what?

560
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:45,990
Ma Lili.

561
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,030
How long will it take her to get Han back?

562
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,800
One hour.

563
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,360
Will it take such a long time?

564
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,010
Twenty minutes?

565
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,230
You underestimate Han.

566
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:00,450
Just wait.

567
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,360
It's 4:20 now.

568
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,790
Let's make a bet. Okay.

569
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,270
OK.

570
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,650
You two sign with her.

571
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,230
She is so ignorant.

572
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,790
Listen to my advice.

573
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,870
Don't sign with her either.

574
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,390
She's not a good person.

575
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:35,520
She's divorced and she's still working so hard.

576
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,490
It's uncertain what is in her mind.

577
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,990
Why does she need young lawyers

578
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:40,670
instead of an experienced lawyer?

579
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,790
Because she thinks young lawyers are easy to fool,

580
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:43,550
right?

581
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,640
Mr. Han, thank you for your concern.

582
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,220
I personally think

583
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:52,190
if a lawyer is afraid of being cheated,

584
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,520
I won't do this anymore.

585
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,790
We are young.

586
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,810
We have to experience everything.

587
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,930
Don't blame me for not reminding you.

588
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,670
I'm sending it.

589
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:07,420
100 yuan.

590
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,030
- I sent it.
-Thank you.

591
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,130
Let's go.

592
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,990
Let's sign the power of attorney.

593
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,000
Dinner.

594
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,060
It's on you.

595
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,580
In your dreams.

596
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:19,720
Ms. Ma.
Ms. Na!

597
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,390
Ms. Ma!

598
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,710
Ms. Qiu.

599
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,740
I just rejected Mr. Han.

600
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,000
I sincerely

601
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,370
want to entrust you two.

602
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,510
Of course.

603
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,770
Thank you for your trust in us.

604
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,640
We will also put in 100% effort

605
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:33,890
and do everything we can.

606
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,820
Of course, no one dares to promise the result.

607
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,580
But we can assure you

608
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,270
you will never find another lawyer

609
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,670
who works harder than us.

610
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,990
I believe you.

611
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,990
But Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

612
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,430
there's a situation

613
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,230
I want to tell you.

614
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,230
I left from you last time.

615
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,550
I went back to raise money.

616
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,470
Now Jianshe is in prison.

617
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,200
And the company is closed.

618
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,190
We do have some savings,

619
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,670
but some of the savings

620
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,840
were used during the first trial.

621
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,410
There's still some left.

622
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:12,330
I used it to pay for his mom's medical treatment.

623
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,740
So now,

624
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,990
I really can't raise

625
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:17,950
500,000 yuan.

626
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,620
No problem.

627
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:22,710
This

628
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,410
is not paid at once.

629
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,180
Just pay 200,000 yuan first.

630
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,460
I know.

631
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,900
But I didn't raise

632
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:31,390
the 200,000.

633
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,860
Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu,

634
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,950
as you can see,

635
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,990
I sincerely want to entrust you two.

636
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,950
You two

637
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:38,810
sincerely want to take this case.

638
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,660
How about 300,000 yuan?

639
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,590
I can pay 150,000 yuan first.

640
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,510
After the second trial,

641
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
I pay the rest.

642
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
What do you think?

643
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:50,870
Ms. Ma.

644
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,380
Doesn't Xu Jianshe still have many properties?

645
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,190
But that house belongs to him.

646
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,880
He's in prison now.

647
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,640
I can't help him deal with that.

648
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,560
Besides,

649
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:03,550
it's too late to sell the house now.

650
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,230
How about 300,000 yuan?

651
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,050
I've tried my best.

652
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,630
You also see that I'm

653
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:11,270
not for his money.

654
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,330
Every penny I spend now

655
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,650
is my own money.

656
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,240
Jianshe has

657
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,550
no siblings and relatives outside.

658
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,080
If I don't save him,

659
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:21,990
no one would help him anymore.

660
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,880
Ms. Ma, here's the thing.

661
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,430
Okay, 300,000 then.

662
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,200
We have to make money,

663
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,090
but we can't just work for money.

664
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,820
Let's sign it by 300,000.

665
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,620
You pay 150,000 yuan first.

666
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,360
After the second trial,

667
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,230
you pay the remaining 150,000.

668
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,110
Thank you so much, Ms. Luo.

669
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,310
I'll get going.

670
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,030
Goodbye.

671
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:41,910
Goodbye, Ms Ma.

672
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:43,990
Goodbye.

673
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,790
It's done.

674
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,560
You are getting carried away with yourself.

675
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,490
What do you mean?

676
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,150
I was very restrained just now.

677
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,420
[Civil and Commercial Bank]

678
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,620
Why is it only valued at 10 million?

679
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,350
A 200-square-meter house.

680
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,560
Next to the city center.

681
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,960
10 million is not enough.

682
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:12,390
Foreclosed properties usually have a lower valuation.

683
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:14,190
We can sell as much as we can.

684
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:16,260
It's enough to pay our loan anyway.

685
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,710
How about

686
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,520
choosing another one

687
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,410
to value it again.

688
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,230
I guess 1,2 million should be available.

689
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,510
Mr. Chen, what's wrong with you?

690
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,870
It's too high to sell.

691
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,720
We can't get our money back.

692
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,960
Right. When is the auction?

693
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,920
Soon.

694
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,250
If they don't appeal

695
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,220
and the verdict works, we'll sell it out soon.

696
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,420
Otherwise, there will be more trouble.

697
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:45,700
Mr. Chen,

698
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,470
I bought the food.

699
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,070
Thank you.

700
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:47,660
Your bag.

701
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,830
Put it on the passenger seat.

702
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,690
You haven't eaten either, have you?

703
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,460
No, I just want to buy it for you.

704
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,570
I'll transfer you 100 yuan later.

705
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:04,410
Take it for dinner.

706
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,660
And go back after dinner.

707
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,120
Do you want something else?

708
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,520
No.

709
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:08,770
Close the door.

710
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,840
Ten million.

711
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,890
That's too little.

712
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,120
Ten million.

713
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:56,830
Let's go.

714
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,250
I'll take you home.

715
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,970
No, I'll take the bus.

716
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,040
Be polite when you need to be.

717
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,150
Let's go back together and

718
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:05,450
we can discuss the case.

719
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,060
I can tell it's you by the sound.

720
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,770
Why are you here?

721
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,340
This is not your place.

722
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,080
Of course.

723
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:21,070
If this is my territory,

724
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,600
I would have broken your leg

725
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,550
before you had finished this sentence.

726
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:25,590
Tell me, why are you here?

727
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,070
What bad ideas are you thinking of?

728
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,230
Don't flatter yourself.

729
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,190
You're not the only lawyer in the firm.

730
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,160
I have a lot of friends.

731
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,460
A bunch of friends?

732
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,030
What friends?

733
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,590
Unscrupulous and shameless.

734
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,030
This is good.

735
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,800
You can change the name. We can match.

736
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,490
Chen Shuo, do you want to die?

737
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,030
Luo Yingzi.

738
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,120
It's been for a week. Won't you appeal?

739
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,030
What does it have to do with you?

740
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,730
Stop pretending to be kind.

741
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,340
How can it have nothing to do with me?

742
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,390
If you don't appeal,

743
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,030
how can I earn the agent fee for the second trial?

744
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,640
I have no grudge with you.

745
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,200
Why do you keep pestering me?

746
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,840
I like you.

747
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,500
It's lonely to have no opponent.

748
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,670
You even treat me as your opponent.

749
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:14,870
I don't respect you at all, you know?

750
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,510
Alright, stop talking nonsense.

751
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:17,430
Seriously,

752
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,190
if you don't appeal

753
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,190
and the verdict works,

754
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:22,080
the house is about to enter the foreclosure process.

755
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,780
Don't worry about it.

756
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,280
What?

757
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,160
The money you earned in the first trial is not enough for you to buy medicine.

758
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,900
Yingzi, why don't I go first?

759
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:29,720
Let's go together.

760
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,920
He is so troublesome.

761
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,590
Bye, Ms. Qiu.

762
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,080
I'm really confused.

763
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,240
What kind of parents

764
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,270
can cultivate such a strange girl?

765
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,150
He was right.

766
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,470
Who?

767
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,680
Unscrupulous Chen.

768
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
You keep calling him Unscrupulous.

769
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,150
He meant well.

770
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,250
He's a suspicious person bearing gifts.

771
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,950
What good intensions would he have?

772
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:11,990
I seriously suspect

773
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,630
he is interested in my house.

774
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,470
He comes to spy on information.

775
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,390
Believe it or not,

776
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,790
as long as I don't appeal,

777
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:21,420
He will definitely try to get my house at once.

778
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,790
Ma Lili.

779
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,740
Ms Ma, what's the matter?

780
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,630
Sure. Go ahead.

781
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,270
What?

782
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:42,680
Hey, hey. Hey, hey.

783
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:51,180
Ms. Luo, here.

784
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,310
Ms. Ma.

785
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,320
what can I do for you?

786
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,120
Please have a seat.

787
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:58,430
Here.

788
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,000
This is for you.

789
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,230
Thank you.

790
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,230
Have some tea.

791
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,840
Ms. Ma, thank you for trusting us.

792
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:08,630
We'll meet Xu Jianshe right away.

793
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,700
But before that,

794
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,890
you need to pay 150,000

795
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:12,890
to the account of our law firm

796
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:15,040
as soon as possible.

797
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:17,190
Yes, I'm working on it.

798
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,750
As you know,

799
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,750
I lost everything

800
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,280
to save our Jianshe.

801
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,190
I borrowed money

802
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:29,190
for this first trial.

803
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,990
But what should I do?

804
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,910
I just love Jianshe.

805
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,200
Ms. Ma,

806
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,870
we know your situation very well.

807
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,720
We understand

808
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,950
your situation.

809
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,950
But

810
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,870
if you don't pay the agent fee on time,

811
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,220
we can't take on this case.

812
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,470
Of course.

813
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,550
I'm trying to find a way.

814
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:53,920
So you mean...

815
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,190
You've learned about

816
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,270
about our Jianshe.

817
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,060
You know his companies

818
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,430
are already in debt.

819
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,050
But he has several houses under his name.

820
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,470
Just deal with one.

821
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,570
Then I can do anything, not to mention the agent fee.

822
00:32:10,230 --> 00:32:12,550
But I'm divorced now.

823
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,100
Without his request,

824
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,210
I can't help him with this.

825
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,530
You are going to see him.

826
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,830
Can you ask him to sign this?

827
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,860
A request?

828
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,800
Who gave you this draft?

829
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,960
The lawyer of the first trial .

830
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,740
It was supposed to be done by him.

831
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,240
I just think he was not good at the first trial.

832
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,370
So I won't ask him for the second trial.

833
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,990
He can't meet Jianshe.

834
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,420
I was wondering

835
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:42,800
could you ask him to sign it when you meet him.

836
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,500
No.

837
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,220
Unless you get the permission

838
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,450
of the court and public security.

839
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,200
No.

840
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,620
We can't let the court know about this.

841
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,070
As you know,

842
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,490
Jianshe hasn't confessed yet.

843
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,710
And he didn't pay for the compensation.

844
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,870
If the court knows

845
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:02,530
we're selling our house here,

846
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,240
and will think we're transferring the property.

847
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:05,750
Then...

848
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,190
Let's go. Let's go.

849
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,710
I have no choice.

850
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,080
If I do this,

851
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:11,990
it would be illegal.

852
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,390
Ms. Luo.

853
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:30,990
Ms. Ma, don't do this.

854
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,320
You're making things difficult for me.

855
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,240
No, no, no.

856
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,900
I'm not crying for that.

857
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,160
I'm crying for myself.

858
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,750
I can't figure it out myself.

859
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,310
We're already divorced.

860
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,950
What am I doing?

861
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,420
His life has nothing to do with me.

862
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,790
To be frank.

863
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:52,450
When he's in prison,

864
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,000
it only brings benefits and no harm to me.

865
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,920
Because he has no relatives outside.

866
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,370
If something happens to him,

867
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:58,850
he has to come to me.

868
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,580
I can fool him.

869
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,750
But do you think I fooled him?

870
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,110
Am I lying to him?

871
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,790
I borrowed private loans.

872
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:08,150
I just want to save him.

873
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,429
We're divorced.

874
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:11,670
But I still treat him like this.

875
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,530
Do you think...

876
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,989
Do you think I am cheap?

877
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,110
I am!
Ms. Ma, don’t.

878
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,550
You...

879
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,949
Don't say that.

880
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,130
We've been married after all.

881
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,469
Ms. Luo, you don't know

882
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:29,550
Jianshe has domestic violence.

883
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,909
Of course.

884
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,630
I'm also hot-tempered.

885
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,469
When we were together,

886
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,420
he really hit me.

887
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,900
and beat me to death.

888
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,639
If he didn't hit me too hard last time,

889
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:44,880
no matter how bad his mother was to me,

890
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,230
I could't divorce him.

891
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,429
Why am I...

892
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:54,940
Why can't I forget him?

893
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,830
Ms. Luo.

894
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,590
I know I put you in a difficult position.

895
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,110
Don't worry.

896
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,000
For the sake of our Jianshe,

897
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,260
even if I borrow private loans again,

898
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,550
I'll pay the 150,000 yuan as soon as possible.

899
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,830
I have to rely on you

900
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:17,990
to take on our case.

901
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,000
I'll keep it

902
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:27,990
and take it back to study.

903
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,070
Well,

904
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,390
thank you so much.

905
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,880
Don't thank me yet.

906
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,500
Well, send me a message

907
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,950
and write down

908
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,150
what you just told me.

909
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,390
What are you doing?

910
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:46,190
Nothing.

911
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,680
It's a professional habit for lawyers.

912
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,680
You type and I'll give my statement.

913
00:35:58,830 --> 00:35:59,750
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

914
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,510
Ms. Luo.

915
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:05,150
There was a power of attorney

916
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,470
in the case materials left with you that day.

917
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,390
I hope you can give it to Xu Jianshe and ask him to sign

918
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:15,070
when you meet him.

919
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,800
It's a request to ask me

920
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,240
to take care of his property

921
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,020
so that I can help him with the second trial.

922
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,250
Okay, I've sent it to you.

923
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,670
Don't worry, Ms. Na.

924
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,910
Once Jianshe signs on it,

925
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,260
I'll take care of a house for him.

926
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,630
A house is enough.

927
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,270
I'll pay you the 150,000 yuan first.

928
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,300
Then I can

929
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,100
I can pay back the private loan.

930
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,840
I sent it.

931
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:42,590
Okay.

932
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,540
No.

933
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,740
This is illegal.

934
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,620
You are...

935
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,810
Self-protection.

936
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,090
I'll keep this for now.

937
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:57,210
Okay.

938
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,790
Are you crazy?

939
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,900
How can you take this?

940
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,550
It's clearly against the discipline.

941
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,910
If it's found by the court,

942
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,040
or leaked out later,

943
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,170
your lawyer ID will be gone, you know?

944
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,310
I know.

945
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,710
What were you thinking?

946
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,280
I don't know.

947
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,540
I just couldn't refuse it.

948
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:28,720
I'll keep this.

949
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,200
Let's go.

950
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,180
Detention center. Meet at 3 p.m.

951
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,630
Qiu Hua.

952
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,460
Do you believe in intuition?

953
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,070
Why do you ask?

954
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,400
Xu Jianshe kept saying he was wronged.

955
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,390
Whether I believe my client

956
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,150
is innocent.

957
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,860
This is very important to me.

958
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,430
When he comes out,

959
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,840
let's feel it.

960
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:56,110
I remember a lawyer abroad

961
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,340
once said a sentence.

962
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,840
Lawyers don't like innocent clients.

963
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,360
I heard that too.

964
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,220
Why do you want a innocent client?

965
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,320
If you lose the lawsuit,

966
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,820
you still feel guilty.

967
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:11,360
It's best if they're not innocent.

968
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,410
But if

969
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,270
you know he's not innocent,

970
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,470
but you still defend for him.

971
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,870
That's another thing.

972
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,030
Since he asked us

973
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,540
to defend for him,

974
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,840
I still hope he is innocent.

975
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,770
Xu Jianshe.

976
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,470
We're the lawyers

977
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:54,090
hired by your ex-wife Ma Lili

978
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,750
with your power of attorney.

979
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,990
I'm Luo Yingzi.

980
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,390
This lawyer is Qiu Hua

981
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,440
Do you agree to let us

982
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,450
be your defense counsels for the second trial?

983
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:02,970
I agree.

984
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,330
Mr. Xu, if you have no objections,

985
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,250
please sign these two powers of attorney.

986
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,440
We'll officially become your attorney.

987
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:09,880
Okay.

988
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,480
Okay.

989
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,990
Xu Jianshe.

990
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,720
The verdict of the first trial has found you guilty of intentional injuries.

991
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,080
The truth was on last August 23

992
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,300
you hit Li Zhanjun to death with a stick.

993
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,470
According to that, the court sentenced you to life imprisonment.

994
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,750
We would like to ask you

995
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,600
what happened.

996
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,200
I didn't kill anyone.

997
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,130
I didn't even fight.

998
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,320
I went to stop them.

999
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,550
I was wronged.

1000
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,870
Mr Xu, calm down.

1001
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,350
Please tell us

1002
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,240
what happened that day in detail.

1003
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,120
Chubby and I...

1004
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:57,500
No.

1005
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,800
Zhang Yulin and I

1006
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,760
are business partners.

1007
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,630
I'm afraid if something happens to him,

1008
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:07,310
it might affect our business.

1009
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,950
So I went to stop fighting.

1010
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,030
Chubby! Chubby!

1011
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,150
Don't hold the stick.

1012
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:14,830
Why are you stopping me?

1013
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,230
I've been stopping them.

1014
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,890
How could I kill someone suddenly?

1015
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,990
But at the scene,

1016
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,250
Your blood prints were

1017
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,690
on the wooden stick.

1018
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,340
I told you I went to stop them.

1019
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,510
When I went after him,

1020
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,620
I saw Zhang Yulin beating someone with a stick.

1021
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,680
He was very fierce.

1022
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,450
I was afraid something would happen to him.

1023
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:35,680
So I pounced on him and snatched the stick.

1024
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,740
Of course my fingerprints were on it.

1025
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:38,890
Besides,

1026
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,680
I'm not the only one

1027
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,570
whose fingerprints are on this stick.

1028
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:44,930
How can you be sure that I killed him?

1029
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,260
But all your comrades said

1030
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,360
that you were the one

1031
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,620
holding a stick out of the grove.

1032
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,550
What friend?

1033
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,890
They are his friends.

1034
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,660
To be honest,

1035
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,930
You can investigate

1036
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,280
and see if I'm telling the truth.

1037
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:01,930
It was dark that night. There was no moon.

1038
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:04,150
There was no street light on the street.

1039
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,810
They were so far away.

1040
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,590
They couldn't even see who was who.

1041
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:11,910
How could they accuse me of murder?

1042
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,770
Mr Xu.

1043
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:14,050
Later, Fatty Zhang...

1044
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,370
told me

1045
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,670
the man was dead.

1046
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,310
The police were catching the murderer.

1047
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,480
He lied to me to let me run away.

1048
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,540
He didn't run away.

1049
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,270
It must be at that time

1050
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,590
Zhang Yulin bribed them.

1051
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,150
I just told you

1052
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,350
those are his friends.

1053
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,630
I'm not close with them.

1054
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:30,470
They must be on his side.

1055
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,480
Mr Xu,

1056
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,670
you said you went to stop fighting.

1057
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,510
But the grove was so dark.

1058
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,990
It's hard to determine what happened exactly.

1059
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,550
If you can actively compensate

1060
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,670
or apologize,

1061
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,970
the trial won't be that serious.

1062
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:43,990
I didn't kill anyone.

1063
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,280
I didn't even fight.

1064
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,630
I went to stop fighting.

1065
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,600
Why should I compensate you?

1066
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,250
Why should I apologize?

1067
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:51,900
Ladies,

1068
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,590
I don't

1069
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,140
know the law.

1070
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,860
But I'm not stupid.

1071
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,510
If I apologize and compensate,

1072
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,780
it means I admit

1073
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,330
that I'm guilty?

1074
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,790
Ms. Luo! Ms. Qiu!

1075
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:13,330
Ms. Ma.

1076
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:15,420
Did you meet him?

1077
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,110
Yes.

1078
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:18,210
Jianshe has signed?

1079
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,990
Ms Ma,

1080
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,330
we really can't sign this for you.

1081
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,960
This is against our professional discipline.

1082
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,720
I know.

1083
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,900
But you know my difficulties.

1084
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,900
If Jianshe doesn't sell one of his houses,

1085
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,530
I can't afford the lawsuit.

1086
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,990
Aren't you going to see him later?

1087
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,730
Please sign this for me.

1088
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,960
Ms Ma, we understand your situation.

1089
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,570
But

1090
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,410
I've sent you the message.

1091
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,290
We can't help you with this.

1092
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,280
Besides, Ms. Ma,

1093
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,970
the first payment is 150,000 yuan.

1094
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,270
You have to transfer it to our firm as soon as possible.

1095
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:47,590
Otherwise, our follow-up work

1096
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,700
can't move on.

1097
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,980
Okay, I'll do it as soon as possible.
