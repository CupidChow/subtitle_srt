[Episode 2]

4
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,740
So you called me over

5
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,140
when you were having tea.

6
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,700
I thought

7
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,620
we had a romantic relationship before.

8
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,979
So...

9
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,630
Wang Liang,

10
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,150
you helped her deceive the lady.

11
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:47,800
No.

12
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,350
I just wanted to

13
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,490
find her a job.

14
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,950
I thought it's hard for a girl

15
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,500
to make a living and rent a house in Jingbei.

16
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,260
Miss,

17
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,980
I'm so sorry.

18
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,730
But I can promise you

19
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,930
Wang Liang

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,180
has nothing to do with her.

21
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,470
He told me about it before.

22
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,660
Wang Liang rejoiced

23
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,970
that they had separated early.

24
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,530
Do you have her contact information?

25
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,220
I have her WeChat number.

26
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,890
But we didn't contact each other again.

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,180
Turn on her WeChat chat window

28
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,400
and call her on video phone.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,550
I have something to tell her.

30
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:37,329
But...

31
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,440
You can't say it has nothing to do with you.

32
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,990
Listen to the lady.

33
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,680
She blocked me.

34
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:05,850
-Sister. -Lanlan.

35
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,500
Mom. Dad.

36
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,900
My son broke up with you.

37
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,370
Don't call me mom anymore.

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,400
Mom,

39
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,480
legally, we are still a couple.

40
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,560
Even if Liu Ming doesn't want to live with me,

41
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,630
he wouldn’t make me die.

42
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,880
Our company

43
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,030
has been the agency of Huading.

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,430
There should be tens of millions of yuan as bank slips per year.

45
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,700
But didn't he leave me a penny?

46
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,610
I have no idea about it.

47
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,520
Tens of millions yuan?

48
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,600
Nonsense.

49
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:52,829
Dad,

50
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,570
he cut off all contact information with me.

51
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,900
I can't reach him.

52
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,730
Can you ask him to come back?

53
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,600
We go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to deal with the divorce procedures.

54
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,800
After that,

55
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:04,830
he can marry that girl justifiably.

56
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,990
We don't have his contact information either.

57
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,190
Mom,

58
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,079
we've been living together for a long time.

59
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,279
You know that

60
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,110
I'm not an unreasonable person.

61
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,350
As long as you let him back,

62
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,880
everything is negotiable.

63
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,790
I told you.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
You have nothing to do with Liu Ming.

65
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,920
From now on,

66
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,420
you don't have to come again.

67
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,790
Mom, can’t you pass on my words to him?

68
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:35,909
Lanlan,

69
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,580
see her off.

70
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:51,970
Dad,

71
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:54,790
Mom,

72
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,080
I’m leaving.

73
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,940
Lanlan,

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,460
go downstairs and find me. I have something to tell you.

75
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:14,900
Lanlan.

76
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,830
Sister.

77
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,310
Lanlan, thank you for coming out.

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,790
It's nothing.

79
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,710
Wait a minute.

80
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,910
I'll throw the trash.

81
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,900
Sister,

82
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,560
they've ruined you.

83
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,580
You've been working here for some days.

84
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,240
Have you seen or heard anything useful?

85
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,350
Actually, I don't know much,

86
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,590
but I saw that shameless woman.

87
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,590
She came back with Liu Ming a few times.

88
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,930
When they talked,

89
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,190
the old witch kept me away from listening.

90
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,200
I reminded you

91
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,490
when you came back last month, remember?

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,560
That's why you told me to keep an eye on the door,

93
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,760
right?

94
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,670
Yes.

95
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,920
I didn't realize it.

96
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,970
I am so stupid.

97
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,570
The old witch treats me badly.

98
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,980
You always speak for me.

99
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,050
Sister, your affairs...

100
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:08,510
I...

101
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,350
Lanlan,

102
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,330
I need

103
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,070
your help.

104
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,710
Say it.

105
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,260
The house you live in

106
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,430
is actually mine.

107
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,230
The house ownership certificate and the purchase procedures

108
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,590
were in the house I live in.

109
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,990
But later, I found

110
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,790
the certificates and procedures of the two houses

111
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,870
were all gone.

112
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,940
I guess Liu Ming took them away,

113
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,350
but I don’t think he took them abroad,

114
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,800
because such a behavior is useless to him.

115
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,170
So,

116
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:41,020
I think those should be in the house you live in.

117
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,360
When you do the cleaning,

118
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,830
could you try to search for them?

119
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,320
If you can find them,

120
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,640
can you take them out for me?

121
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,210
Now that you mention it, I seem to remember

122
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,590
Liu Ming came back a few days ago

123
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,080
with a small bag.

124
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,560
I'll go back and look for it.

125
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,330
Thank you, Lanlan.

126
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:06,290
But...

127
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,390
Tell me.

128
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,050
Do you have any difficulties?

129
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,670
If I do so,

130
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,840
I may lose my current job.

131
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,320
But it's okay.

132
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,140
I'll play it by ear.

133
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,150
No.

134
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,410
If you take it out,

135
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,810
don't work for them.

136
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,660
Work for me

137
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,130
if you don't mind.

138
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,990
OK.

139
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,180
-I'll pay you the same as before. -Sister, forget about the salary.

140
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,140
Let me do it for you first.

141
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,350
I'll go back first.

142
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,700
Wait for my message.

143
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:36,080
Thank you, Lanlan.

144
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,670
Hello, mom.

145
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,530
I'm working.

146
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,660
What's the matter?

147
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,160
I know. Stop rushing me.

148
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,860
I haven't been paid this month.

149
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,080
I'll transfer it to you

150
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,680
right away as long as I get it.

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,600
Stop rushing me.

152
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,290
I have to go to work.

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,040
Don't call me.

154
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,990
Xiu,

155
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,880
do you have a case?

156
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,910
Yes, I've been quite busy recently.

157
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,419
As for Wang Dafu's case,

158
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,490
I want to try it myself.

159
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,340
But Mr. Han asked me

160
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,630
[Xiu Beibei, Intern Lawyer of the Criminal Defense Department]

161
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,169
to find another person to do with me.

162
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,280
Qiu Hua, Mr. Han's package is here.

163
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Just give it to me.

164
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,120
Okay, thank you.

165
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,610
You're welcome.

166
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,250
Thank you.

167
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,280
Mr. Han.

168
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:06,840
Mr. Han.

169
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,200
I've finished all the files you gave me.

170
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,660
Now I'm here to report you.

171
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,950
What did you do this morning?

172
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,790
Are you absent from duty as soon as you join the law firm?

173
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,610
These cases are pretty interesting,

174
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,840
so I borrowed some information.

175
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:23,130
Of course, something happened to my family,

176
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,190
so I was delayed.

177
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,230
Sorry, sir.

178
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,800
I'll never do it again.

179
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,650
Give it to me.

180
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,430
I made some notes.

181
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,040
According to my understanding,

182
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,810
and combining your handling thinking,

183
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,020
I summarized the way of defense.

184
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,840
Mr. Han, please correct me.

185
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:46,200
Have you finished these cases?

186
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,910
Yes.

187
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,480
I learned a lot

188
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,910
from you.

189
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,710
The most important point is that

190
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,480
law is not only the clauses,

191
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,310
but also practical experience.

192
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,050
Good.

193
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,220
Not bad.

194
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,790
Other young lawyers

195
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,950
haven't figured it out for years.

196
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,410
You got it in a few days.

197
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:19,900
Work hard with me.

198
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,570
I'll teach you by hand.

199
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:22,920
Sir,

200
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,960
can I

201
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,800
handle the specific case with you?

202
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,320
You're a newcomer,

203
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,610
and you want to solve the case by yourself. Huh?

204
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,210
Well,

205
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,710
I want to learn more from you.

206
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,870
And I...

207
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,390
I can't support myself

208
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:39,260
by the current basic salary.

209
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,390
Sir.

210
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:41,950
Mr. Han,

211
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,330
why don't you give me a case

212
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:45,450
and let me have a try?

213
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,410
You guide me.

214
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,220
If we can earn the agent fee,

215
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,480
you can take most of it.

216
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,880
Just give me a little.

217
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,450
You're really impatient.

218
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,170
OK.

219
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,030
Take it.

220
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:17,230
[Wang Dafu‘s intentional homicide]

221
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,000
Wang Dafu's intentional homicide.

222
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,870
Thank you, sir.

223
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Thank you, sir.

224
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,950
Thank you so much.

225
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,190
I'll go check it out.

226
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,980
Thank you.

227
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:25,590
OK.

228
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,270
I'll

229
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,470
close the door for you.

230
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,110
Okay.

231
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,070
Please go ahead.

232
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,630
Ms. Qiu,

233
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,470
can you help me check

234
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,830
the time of the court session of this case?

235
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,020
Did he give you the case?

236
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,970
Yes.

237
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,470
Can you help me find all the information

238
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,270
of this case?

239
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,470
Who will be with you

240
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:57,990
on the preparation work?

241
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,150
Did Mr. Han tell you?

242
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,110
No.

243
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,100
He said he would give this case to me.

244
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,630
Did he ask you to do it alone?

245
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,350
By the way,

246
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,550
how much did Mr. Han

247
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,640
charge the agency fee for such a case?

248
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,080
This is a legal aid case assigned by the Legal Aid Center.

249
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,110
There's no subsidy fee,

250
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,110
but some subsidies are no more than one thousand yuan.

251
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,280
It's not even enough for gas fee.

252
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,410
So,

253
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,440
he gives only these cases

254
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,220
to young lawyers.

255
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,560
But some young lawyers

256
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,270
had the capacity to deal with cases independently by such cases.

257
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,150
Never mind.

258
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,470
It's okay for me as long as there's a case.

259
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,710
May 14 is the time of the court session.

260
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,030
There are ten days left.

261
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,430
You're pressed for time.

262
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,620
Ms. Qiu, may I borrow a pen?

263
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,620
May 14, ten days left.

264
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,080
Luo Yingzi.

265
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,910
If you need,

266
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,890
I can help you with this case.

267
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,090
I won't bother you.

268
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:55,070
Go ahead.

269
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,320
Mr. Han asked me

270
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,950
to write a defense opinion.

271
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,870
I can handle it.

272
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:00,920
OK.

273
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,590
I don't have all the information.

274
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,900
I'll ask Mr. Han for it

275
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,940
and send the document to you.

276
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,660
Okay, thank you, Ms. Qiu.

277
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,320
It's okay.

278
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,080
I’m leaving.

279
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,470
Mr. Han.

280
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:31,920
Yes?

281
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,260
Did you hand Wang Dafu's case

282
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,010
to the new one, Luo Yingzi?

283
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,470
She came to ask me for information.

284
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,430
She is eager to express herself in the law firm.

285
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,010
She is a newcomer

286
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,540
and not familiar with many business matters.

287
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,260
Why don't I do it with her?

288
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,330
It's a waste of time.

289
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,630
Leave it to her alone.

290
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,290
It's okay.

291
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,990
No.

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,430
Are you at ease to

293
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,540
give a case to a newcomer alone?

294
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:01,710
Well.

295
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,140
There is a closed loop of evidence.

296
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,260
Her work is nothing but a formality,

297
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,720
writing defense opinion.

298
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,820
Mr. Han.

299
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,800
Why?

300
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,400
Didn't you promise me

301
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,050
to let me handle this case?

302
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,990
Why are you so anxious?

303
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:27,060
For the lawyer assessment?

304
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,450
Just one case.

305
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,330
She's not qualified to be a licensed professional.

306
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,760
It won't affect you.

307
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
Don't worry.

308
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,860
Besides, you know

309
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,900
she was introduced by Mei Daliang.

310
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,240
I have to do something to show my kindness.

311
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,850
Everyone has a background.

312
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,920
What can I do?

313
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,680
What can you do?

314
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,760
Qiu Hua,

315
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,970
don't worry.

316
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,540
Just follow me,

317
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,560
I won't let you suffer any loss.

318
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:56,800
I see.

319
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,070
Thank you, Mr. Han.

320
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,340
She runs fast.

321
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
These days,

322
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,410
I have been wondering about it.

323
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:20,750
Are we uncool to

324
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,570
Liu Ming's case?

325
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,230
What's wrong?

326
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,230
Luo Yingzi is a bit tough, indeed.

327
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,110
Except it, she's a good girl.

328
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,710
And she treats Liu Ming well.

329
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,490
Can you guarantee that Win Li, the new lover of Liu Ming,

330
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,360
will be better than Luo Yingzi?

331
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,040
Think about what Liu Ming is doing now.

332
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,210
With Liu Ming's IQ,

333
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,750
he could not do these things.

334
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:44,440
Anyway,

335
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,450
Wen Li treats me as her mother.

336
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,090
In Luo Yingzi's eyes,

337
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm nothing.

338
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,010
Let's go.

339
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
But don't forget

340
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,240
Luo Yingzi is not a soft target.

341
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,070
If she gets serious,

342
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,790
I'm afraid you...

343
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,280
Not a soft target?

344
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:04,150
Then why doesn't she go to America to find Liu Ming?

345
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:05,490
Let’s go.

346
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,890
Lanlan.

347
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,480
Take care of the house.

348
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,410
If Luo comes again,

349
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,320
don't open the door for her.

350
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:12,850
Alright.

351
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,650
Do you hear me?

352
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,710
Yes.

353
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,130
Chariot.

354
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:01,980
Knight.

355
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,980
What do you think?

356
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,470
I can't listen to Xu.

357
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,110
What about the other one?

358
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,250
The files are all here.

359
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,600
Also, the electronic version is sent

360
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,530
through internal email. Check it.

361
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,800
Thank you.

362
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,870
You're welcome.

363
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:49,920
Thank you.

364
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:04,070
I've read all the files of this case.

365
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,200
If you need anything,

366
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,370
come to me anytime.

367
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,520
Thank you.

368
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,670
Don't you realize?

369
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,510
Qiu Hua wants to join your case.

370
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,420
What?

371
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,580
I heard that

372
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,310
Qiu Hua asked Han for this case.

373
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,760
He refused her,

374
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,480
but now he gave it to you.

375
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,150
I don't know.

376
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,620
Mr. Han asked me to write

377
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,380
the defense ideas of this case.

378
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,440
Does it need two people

379
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,970
to write a defense opinion?

380
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:47,990
Never mind.

381
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,310
Qiu Hua is Han's follower. She wouldn't lack cases.

382
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,270
Go on with your work.

383
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,190
Ignore her.

384
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:57,940
What the hell?

385
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:19,180
Lanlan.

386
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,770
Sister.

387
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:21,430
Why are you here so early?

388
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,450
I'm in a hurry.

389
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,070
This is what you want.

390
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,180
Good job, Lanlan.

391
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,920
Why is there only one set?

392
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,130
I searched all the house

393
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,660
and only found this one.

394
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,670
That's strange.

395
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,150
Where did he hide the other one?

396
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,180
Anyway,

397
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,730
Lanlan, you helped me a lot.

398
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,310
Go back now.

399
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,530
Don't get caught.

400
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,990
You can resign tomorrow,

401
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,750
but don't let them know you will work for me.

402
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,400
I've resigned.

403
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,940
I've brought the stuff.

404
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,140
I'm afraid if I'm late,

405
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,600
the ownership certificate won't be delivered to you.

406
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,560
Okay, got it.

407
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,280
Let's go home.

408
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,360
I told them

409
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:00,850
my family in my hometown asked me to go back

410
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,400
for a blind date.

411
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,030
Then the older witch said,

412
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:06,230
"you asked to leave by yourself

413
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,830
and didn't tell us in advance,

414
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,640
so we won't pay for this month."

415
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,560
I was so angry that I took the ashtray on the table,

416
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,410
and stood next to the TV.

417
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,170
I said,

418
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,170
"if you don't pay me this month's salary,

419
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,700
I'll smash your TV."

420
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:19,970
When the old man heard it,

421
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,050
he panicked

422
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:22,540
and urged her,

423
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,820
"don't argue with a nanny.

424
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,650
Give her the money.

425
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,820
Let her go."

426
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,840
So,

427
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,580
you have to be worse than the villains

428
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,340
when arguing with them.

429
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,750
You eat first.

430
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,680
I have to make a salad.

431
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,520
No, Lanlan.

432
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:39,930
There are only the two of us here.

433
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,040
We can't eat that much.

434
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,190
Come and eat with me.

435
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:42,960
No need.

436
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,810
Sister, you eat first.

437
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,580
I'll be ready soon.

438
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,600
I'll eat after you finish.

439
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,070
No.

440
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:47,990
I don't have so many rules.

441
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:48,970
Fill your bowl.

442
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,960
It's improper.

443
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,770
I never ate with them

444
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,480
in their house.

445
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:57,470
Have they ever done any good deeds?

446
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,530
Fill the bowl. Eat.

447
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,510
Lanlan,

448
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,140
I know you took care of them

449
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,750
at the price of 6,000 yuan a month.

450
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,030
But

451
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,190
I can't give you so much money

452
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,670
in a short time.

453
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,910
Sister, I work here

454
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,340
not for money,

455
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,120
but for you.

456
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:18,020
Give me more if you earn more.

457
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,340
If not, give me less,

458
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,380
or

459
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,150
at least provide me with a meal.

460
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,800
Thank you, Lanlan.

461
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,290
Sister.

462
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,230
What about being a lawyer?

463
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,470
I heard lawyers make a lot of money.

464
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:38,900
Who said that?

465
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,230
I saw the remark online.

466
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,950
They only see the enjoyment, not the price.

467
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,420
I haven't realized

468
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,910
whether it could make money,

469
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,510
but I know how hard it is.

470
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,120
Sister,

471
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,770
do you think

472
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,520
it's possible for me to learn the law with you?

473
00:22:58,090 --> 00:22:58,640
Lanlan,

474
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,310
what about your academic background?

475
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,630
I graduated from a technical secondary school.

476
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,330
What's your major?

477
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,160
Beauty treatment and hair care.

478
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:04,760
Is it okay?

479
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,520
Actually, the law

480
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:13,620
is not easy to learn.

481
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,730
If you really want to learn something,

482
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,450
why don't you keep studying hair care and beauty treatment concurrently?

483
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,150
I can help you to find a proper school.

484
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:23,200
Sister, I like law.

485
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,390
Cosmetics and hair care are hard to make a living now.

486
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,450
I won't be a nanny if it's a good major.

487
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,360
You don't have to help me.

488
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,800
Lend me the books in the room

489
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,810
when you're not here, okay?

490
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Sure, why not?

491
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,330
I'll open the door.

492
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,160
You eat first.

493
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,190
Coming.

494
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,820
Coming.

495
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,180
Who is it?

496
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:48,950
Lanlan.

497
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:51,200
Why are you here?

498
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:52,620
Sister.

499
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,320
Sister.

500
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,270
Here comes the old witch.

501
00:23:59,270 --> 00:23:59,790
Who?

502
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,700
Old witch.

503
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,880
Why is Lanlan here?

504
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,430
Can't I visit her

505
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,450
before I go home?

506
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:09,050
Lanlan, go back to your room.

507
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,510
What's the matter?

508
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,140
Liu Ming asked me to send you this.

509
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,960
Take a look.

510
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,300
[Divorce Agreement]

511
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,720
He doesn't even want to see me.

512
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,690
Does he want to divorce in this way?

513
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,930
He won't come back

514
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,870
unless you sign the divorce agreement,

515
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:59,260
and then he would go back to get a divorce certificate.

516
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,760
Besides,

517
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,820
is it significant for you

518
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,150
to keep delaying?

519
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,340
I've discussed with his dad.

520
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,760
If you agree,

521
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,180
we'll try our best

522
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,960
to give you 20,000 yuan

523
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,240
from our pension

524
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,080
as a humanism compensation

525
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,110
for you.

526
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,950
Humanism compensation?

527
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,280
Where did you learn the boastful words?

528
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,720
Do you think

529
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,750
you are generous?

530
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,280
What about the communal estate he transformed?

531
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,920
Are we just letting it go?

532
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,920
In all fairness,

533
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,210
do you have any communal estate?

534
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,890
These years,

535
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,950
your life

536
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:45,060
has been supported by Liu Ming.

537
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,790
You ate but did not work

538
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,470
like a parasite.

539
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,040
How dare you mention communal estate?

540
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,470
That's all his earnings.

541
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,750
When he started his company,

542
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,400
who connected him with the big customers?

543
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,690
It was my dad.

544
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:04,570
Even if he made the money

545
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,790
during the period when we were a couple,

546
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,940
it is called the communal estate.

547
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,030
I don't want to waste time with you.

548
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,430
If he wants a divorce,

549
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,630
then come back.

550
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,650
I'll talk to him face-to-face about the whole thing clearly

551
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,480
before we divorce.

552
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:20,910
Luo Yingzi,

553
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,810
is it meaningful for you to be so stubborn?

554
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,940
It's so meaningful.

555
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,040
I didn't expect it before.

556
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,710
Now I know how meaningful it is.

557
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:33,850
Since you are here,

558
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,160
please tell Liu Ming

559
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,790
I’ve sued the court to divorce him.

560
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,670
Tell him to come back and respond to a charge,

561
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,750
in case the court can't find him.

562
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,080
The notice will be delivered.

563
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,940
If he isn't here during the trial,

564
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,380
the result will be unfavorable to him.

565
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,830
Don't blame me.

566
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,890
You are so cruel.

567
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,130
Luo Yingzi,

568
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,410
I advise you to sign here.

569
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,130
I've brought 20,000 yuan with me.

570
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,180
As long as you sign it,

571
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,260
I'll give it to you.

572
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,620
Otherwise,

573
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,840
you'll lose the chance to get the money.

574
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,030
Will you sign it?

575
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,960
What a disrespectful old guy!

576
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,570
Get out now.

577
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,800
Luo Yingzi,

578
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,150
as I said,

579
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,360
you are ill-bred.

580
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,690
You're not divorced yet,

581
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:31,790
and I'm still your mother-in-law. How could you be so…

582
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,590
Don't push me.

583
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,270
What are you doing?

584
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:38,520
Are you crazy?

585
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:39,630
You...

586
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:41,890
I'll leave now.

587
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,150
The agreement is here.

588
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,370
Think about it.

589
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,960
You have three days.

590
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:48,470
Or the 20,000 yuan will never be yours.

591
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,430
Just three days.

592
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,480
A passionate murder.

593
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,020
There is no alibi.

594
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,090
[Defense]

595
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:50,590
Qiu Hua.

596
00:29:58,430 --> 00:29:59,350
Mr. Han.

597
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,310
I think

598
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,900
we should meet the defendant

599
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,480
and then write the defense.

600
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,680
Otherwise,

601
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,100
I'm uneasy.

602
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,460
Is there any problem with the prosecution's evidence?

603
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,520
According to the evidence provided by the prosecution,

604
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,400
there is a complete chain of evidence.

605
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,000
I can't see anything wrong.

606
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,290
But

607
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,230
should we

608
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,380
meet the defendant?

609
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,810
Just finish the case according to the process.

610
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,160
The judicial resources are limited.

611
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,760
They need to be used on the one who needs it most.

612
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,060
Write down the defense and give it to me.

613
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,880
Then meet him before the trial.

614
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,230
Okay.

615
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,360
Sister,

616
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,980
I read your books at home today.

617
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Why can't I understand many of them?

618
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,680
Can't you understand?

619
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,950
Yes.

620
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:03,150
Well,

621
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,470
books of law

622
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,960
are hard to understand.

623
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,010
Are you thinking about the case?

624
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,930
Tell me.

625
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,960
Do you want to hear it?

626
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,450
Well,

627
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,960
the defendant and his wife

628
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,430
worked in Jingbei.

629
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,080
They have three children.

630
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,470
But the defendant

631
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:32,450
had affairs with another woman.

632
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,830
Then he was entangled by her,

633
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,450
and was forced to divorce.

634
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,610
Think about it.

635
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:41,230
He had a large family.

636
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,450
How could he divorce for another woman?

637
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:44,690
So,

638
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,660
the defendant killed the mistress.

639
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,520
That's what the indictment says.

640
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,520
I think there's no problem with the evidence.

641
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,880
The mistress

642
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:59,380
died in his rental house.

643
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:00,630
At that time,

644
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,250
someone saw the woman coming to his house.

645
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,810
The defendant was alone at home.

646
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,640
The witness heard them arguing.

647
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,330
The autopsy report

648
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:13,790
showed that the woman had sex

649
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,680
with the defendant

650
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:19,560
before she died.

651
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,750
Most importantly,

652
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,850
the lethal weapon is a kitchen knife,

653
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,120
on which we find the defendant's fingerprint.

654
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,280
We should shot such a jerk

655
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,560
to death.

656
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,110
Sister,

657
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:35,030
why are you defending him?

658
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,550
He's just a suspect

659
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:40,000
before the court pronounces judgment.

660
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,320
As a lawyer,

661
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:44,300
I must protect his legal rights

662
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:46,960
and give him a valid defense.

663
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,470
If I become a lawyer,

664
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,700
I'll only defend good people.

665
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,480
Hey,

666
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,410
we should meet the defendant first.

667
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:02,930
What?

668
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:05,030
Then, study the defense strategy.

669
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,990
[Han Zhitong]

670
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,150
You've grown up.

671
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,780
Mr. Han,

672
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,220
it's a life, after all.

673
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,350
The prosecution has enough evidence.

674
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,130
But we should meet the defendant first

675
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,590
and listen to what he says.

676
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,640
Do I need you to teach me how to be a lawyer?

677
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,460
Mr. Han,

678
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,180
the defendant's wife is here.

679
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,960
She wants to see the attorney.

680
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,680
Is it Wang Dafu's case?

681
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:29,720
Yes.

682
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,080
We can't count on him.

683
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,730
He probably hasn't even read the files yet.

684
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,620
I see. Thank you.

685
00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:46,470
Mrs. Sun, right?

686
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,150
Please have a seat.

687
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:54,790
I'm the lawyer in charge of this case.

688
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,720
My surname is Han.

689
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,480
Mr. Han,

690
00:33:56,510 --> 00:33:57,790
this is Luo Yingzi.

691
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,050
Hello, Mrs. Sun.

692
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:03,060
[Sun Xiaoe, Defendant's family]

693
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,910
Mr. Han,

694
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,920
well,

695
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,440
Daifu is innocent.

696
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,910
You have to defend him.

697
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:08,810
Madam, don't worry.

698
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,120
Take it easy.

699
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:11,469
Let me make a statement.

700
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:12,199
Okay.

701
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,469
Have some water.

702
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,600
This is my assistant, Qiu Hua.

703
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,370
Okay.

704
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,310
Have some water. Take your time.

705
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,760
Okay.

706
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:19,860
Qiu Hua,

707
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,800
stay here and make a record.

708
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,239
Well.

709
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,320
Take it easy.

710
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,170
Have some water. Take your time.

711
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:28,670
Well,

712
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,120
that bitch

713
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,120
died in our house,

714
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,429
but she was not killed by my husband.

715
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,980
Mrs. Sun,

716
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,340
please do not say so in court.

717
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,900
Go straight to the point,

718
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,210
and don't use abusive language.

719
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,940
It's not good for your husband.

720
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,560
Okay, I got it.

721
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,139
But

722
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,010
Dafu was wronged.

723
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:52,730
Mrs Sun,

724
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,820
although your husband cheated on you,

725
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,160
you still defend him.

726
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,980
That's a good attitude.

727
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,570
If you can

728
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,150
compensate the victim

729
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,210
and get her family's forgiveness,

730
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,350
it will be more beneficial

731
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
for your husband.

732
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,910
But

733
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,120
he didn't kill that woman.

734
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,040
Mrs. Sun,

735
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,590
do you have any proof?

736
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,160
The Public Security Bureau said

737
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,310
the woman died at 3 o'clock.

738
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,840
But at that time,

739
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:21,470
my husband and I were in my hometown.

740
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,520
It is dozens of kilometers

741
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,990
away from this city.

742
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,350
How could he be the murderer?

743
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,370
You mean

744
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,040
when the woman was killed,

745
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:34,280
your husband and you were at your mother's house.

746
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,670
Yes.

747
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,800
That bitch,

748
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,990
no, no,

749
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:39,290
that woman

750
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,130
had an affair with my husband.

751
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,860
I was very angry about that.

752
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,000
The night before the murder,

753
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,760
I quarreled with him.

754
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,250
I went back to my parents' house out of anger.

755
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,060
The hotel I worked in

756
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,430
called me at that time.

757
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,880
Dafu was afraid that

758
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,260
I would be fired.

759
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,800
So he came to my parents' house to find me.

760
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:02,750
And...

761
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:04,260
when he arrived,

762
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,130
it was 3 o'clock.

763
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:10,600
[July 12, 3 p.m.]

764
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:06,910
Then,

765
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:08,430
we

766
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:10,470
talked for a while on the mountain.

767
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,590
I was angry.

768
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:13,310
My husband asked me to come back with him,

769
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,020
but I refused.

770
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,050
Then he left on his own.

771
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:18,950
He left

772
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,610
at 4 o'clock.

773
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,390
Yes, 4 o'clock.

774
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,910
When he got home,

775
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,090
he saw that woman

776
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,970
lying on the floor of our house and died.

777
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,500
He could not be the one

778
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,070
who killed her at 3 o'clock.

779
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,790
Please see if I'm right or not.

780
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:37,030
That is to say, you were angry at that time.

781
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:39,720
Then your husband went to your parents' house to find you.

782
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,550
Luo Yingzi. Then...

783
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:41,140
Yes.

784
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,210
Mrs. Sun,

785
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,630
did you tell the police about that

786
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,760
during the investigation?

787
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,090
I did.

788
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,450
But they didn't believe me.

789
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,230
Why not?

790
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,420
They said I was covering for my husband,

791
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:55,100
and the evidence I provided

792
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:56,240
can't overturn…

793
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,530
what they said.

794
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,220
Tell me,

795
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:02,410
do you have any evidence

796
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,680
to prove that your husband was together with you?

797
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,490
Mr. Han,

798
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,280
it would be great if I could provide evidence.

799
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,600
When he arrived,

800
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,290
I was working on the mountain.

801
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,260
Then we...

802
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,000
Mrs. Sun,

803
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,440
did anyone see you

804
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,100
when you were on the mountain?

805
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:21,510
It seems...

806
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,550
nobody saw us.

807
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:23,800
When you went home,

808
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,910
did you tell your family about his arrival?

809
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,060
I dared not tell them.

810
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,510
Only my parents and I knew he was outside.

811
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,060
Alright.

812
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,280
Mrs. Sun,

813
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,230
we got what you said.

814
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,720
Please believe that

815
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,560
the law won't wrong a good person

816
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,930
or let go of a bad guy.

817
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,670
We need to study

818
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:40,250
how to defend your husband.

819
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,400
I won't keep you.

820
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,000
Bye.

821
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,850
Luo Yingzi,

822
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,930
see Mrs. Sun off.

823
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,880
Well...

824
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,800
Mr. Han,

825
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,090
I'm not done yet.

826
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,430
Ms. Luo,

827
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:55,600
Dafu will be fine, right?

828
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,470
Mrs. Sun,

829
00:37:56,570 --> 00:37:58,970
go back and think about

830
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,100
who can prove your words.

831
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,440
If you can prove that your husband

832
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:06,270
were with you at that time,

833
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,070
it would be clear that your husband was not the murderer.

834
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,760
There's hope for this case.

835
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,850
OK, Ms. Luo.

836
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,910
Thank you.

837
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,360
I'll go back and think over it.

838
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:16,960
Okay.

839
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,590
-Bye. -I’m leaving now.

840
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,640
Mr. Han, I think

841
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,030
something is wrong with this case.

842
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,780
The agent cheated on his wife

843
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:26,840
and had an affair with the dead.

844
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,910
His wife should be heartbroken.

845
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,630
But she insists that the defendant is innocent.

846
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:31,430
Shouldn't we

847
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,110
pay attention to this point?

848
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,320
You know nothing.

849
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,880
A family is a community of shared interests.

850
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,640
Sun Xiao' e's husband indeed cheated on her.

851
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,450
But he is still her son's father.

852
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,160
Now that the mistress passes away,

853
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,420
the threat to the family has been lifted.

854
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,550
So, Sun Xiao' e will definitely protect her husband

855
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:50,090
in this case.

856
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,010
It's a criminal case.

857
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:56,270
We shall not do unnecessary things.

858
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,290
Just look for something

859
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,110
that is favorable to the defendant

860
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,910
in the prosecution's evidence.

861
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,710
As for this case,

862
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,860
we can defend him from several aspects,

863
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,800
like the victim also had mistakes, the defendant killed her in the heat of passion,

864
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,150
he's a first-time offender, and he's pleaded guilty.

865
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,010
That's enough.

866
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,390
With these,

867
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:17,980
it would be more possible that he won't get the death penalty.

868
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:20,060
We've done our best

869
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,640
to save his life.

870
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,370
Go and write it.

871
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,660
Let's meet the defendant tomorrow.

872
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,000
Tomorrow?

873
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,280
Okay.

874
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,740
Mrs. Mei,

875
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,320
I'm here to see you.

876
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,810
I bring you some delicious food.

877
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:48,820
Do you come back to life?

878
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,390
I have to live.

879
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,010
I've sued for divorce.

880
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,260
But it's meaningless.

881
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,550
He has transferred all the assets.

882
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,160
But there are two more houses.

883
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
I want to get them.

884
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,720
By the way, Mrs. Mei,

885
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,400
I took a legal aid case

886
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,400
and wrote the defense statement.

887
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,260
This is the first defense I've ever written.

888
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:13,550
I'm afraid I can't do it well.

889
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,840
Please check it for me.

890
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,380
As soon as you were hired by the law office,

891
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,150
you received this legal aid case.

892
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,280
Mr. Han gave it to me.

893
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,020
Actually, I asked him for one.

894
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,170
He gave me this.

895
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,540
An intentional homicide.

896
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,440
Did you meet the defendant?

897
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,310
No.

898
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,040
Mr. Han let me write the defense statement first,

899
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,080
and meet the defendant

900
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,030
before the trial.

901
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,470
You write the statement

902
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,820
before meeting the defendant.

903
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,180
I think the prosecution has enough evidence.

904
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,480
And Mr. Han said that...

905
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,570
Is this how you treat the law?

906
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,690
Because Mr. Han said...

907
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,540
That's how you treat your job.

908
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,750
You might as well quit.

909
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,680
You're disregarding human lives.

910
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,190
I'm sorry.

911
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,420
Mrs. Mei, I was wrong.

912
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,180
What did you do wrong?

913
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,680
I just criticized you,

914
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,630
but you blame someone else.

915
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:27,750
A man

916
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,230
who lost his freedom

917
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,370
and lost contact with others,

918
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,760
and the only one that he can rely on

919
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,000
is his lawyer.

920
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:39,780
But you

921
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,310
have already written the defense statement

922
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,990
without even seeing him.

923
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,510
People like you

924
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,640
don't deserve to be lawyers.

925
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:02,820
I deserve it.

926
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,480
Sir.

927
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:10,740
You've never seen the defendant, right?

928
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,300
Yes.

929
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,400
The condition is much better now.

930
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,510
The police won't be there or record.

931
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,320
But there will be surveillance cameras.

932
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,970
Please obey the rules here.

933
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:21,510
Okay.

934
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,790
Why is she here again?

935
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,520
Damn it.

936
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,700
Let's meet up first.

937
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,090
Mr. Han,

938
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,470
I found witnesses.

939
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,220
Really?

940
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:39,700
Yes.

941
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,430
I found two.

942
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,000
My neighbors.

943
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,620
They contracted the orchard on the mountain.

944
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,760
They saw my man that day.

945
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,780
Mr. Han.

946
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,180
That's all?

947
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,370
That's all.
