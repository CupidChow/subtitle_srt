[Episode 17]

4
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,390
Are you looking for me?

5
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,280
Do you want me to handle a lawsuit for you?

6
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,940
That's definitely a no-go.

7
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,670
We have a conflict of interest.

8
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,160
No, it's not about that.

9
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,550
There's something

10
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,050
that's just perfect for a unscrupulous lawyer to handle.

11
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,330
Please wait a moment.

12
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,030
Bro, how about this?

13
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,560
This is my sister.

14
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,500
Do me a favor.

15
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,600
Wait in the meeting room for a while.

16
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,470
Say please.

17
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,180
Please.

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,820
I'm doing this for the sake of my brother.

19
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,260
Wimpy guy.

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,870
You two seem to have a funny relationship.

21
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,300
Well, why's he here?

22
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,100
One of my people got into some trouble,

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,360
so I asked him for help.

24
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,160
Yingzi.

25
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,350
It's not that I didn't want to ask you.

26
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,010
Well, my man is a bit flirtatious.

27
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,270
When he sees a girl, he…

28
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,490
I know.

29
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,470
I appreciate that, Mr. Zhou.

30
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,440
So, let's talk about Lanlan.

31
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:34,790
Mr. Zhou.

32
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,829
I hope you don't mind my straightforwardness.

33
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,050
You have a family,

34
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,270
and what you did in this matter was just not right.

35
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,160
Whether indirectly or directly,

36
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,960
Lanlan

37
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:48,540
got to know you through me,

38
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,990
and it caused a lot of trouble.

39
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm in a difficult spot too.

40
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,510
I‘m here today

41
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,480
to ask you about

42
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,460
her saying she wants to marry you.

43
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,800
What's your plan?

44
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,230
Marry me?

45
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,480
Yingzi, to be honest with you,

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,430
I've never had any interest in her.

47
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,830
She threw herself at me.

48
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,270
What could I do?

49
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,790
Since she insisted, I had to do something.

50
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,520
She's serious about this,

51
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,590
even wants to have your child.

52
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,520
You believe that?

53
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,270
Can she have a child?

54
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,680
Your wife took people to the school to beat her up,

55
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,350
causing a huge scandal.

56
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,440
It was a disgrace to all the teachers.

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,310
I know.

58
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,990
You don't know about my wife.

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,790
She usually acts like a sick cat,

60
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,829
but when she gets angry,

61
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,579
she's a tiger.

62
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:38,290
At the end of the day, this is your fault.

63
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,800
If you don't like Lanlan,

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,640
can you end your relationship with her soon, okay?

65
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:43,579
My bad.

66
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,690
I'll end it right away.

67
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,200
I have your word.

68
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,870
Alright, with your words, I feel reassured.

69
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,310
Well,

70
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:53,060
but your wife

71
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,430
did beat her.

72
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,270
How are you gonna solve this?

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,270
It's already happened, what can I do?

74
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,270
Does she want money?

75
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,450
I will pay for it.

76
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,070
Since you mentioned that,

77
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,210
and I admitted it.

78
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,280
I can pay her 300,000 or 500,000 yuan.

79
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,080
It's up to you.

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,240
Lanlan isn't after the money.

81
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,790
She wants you.

82
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:26,300
Don't you know that?

83
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,370
Mr. Zhou.

84
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,830
Regardless of her motives of approaching you,

85
00:04:32,909 --> 00:04:35,110
you shouldn't talk about her like that.

86
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,590
Money

87
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,450
can't buy a girl's dignity.

88
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,350
I hope you can

89
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,400
handle this matter properly.

90
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,090
Don't make things difficult for everyone.

91
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,390
I don't have any other business.

92
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,710
I'll go meet Mr. Chen.

93
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,350
Let me take you there.

94
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,470
Okay.

95
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,850
Yingzi, it's here.

96
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:58,320
Do you want me to accompany you?

97
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,980
No, thanks.

98
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,420
I'll talk to him alone.

99
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:02,350
Bro.

100
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,960
We are family.

101
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,090
Try to settle things without resorting to violence.

102
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:06,820
Don't worry.

103
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,360
Hold on.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,760
Let me finish this round.

105
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,350
It's reward time.

106
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,600
Got it.

107
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,060
What's up, Ms. Luo?

108
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,640
What do you wanna talk to me about?

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,790
Even if we have something to discuss,

110
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,120
it should be in the courtroom.

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
Unscrupulous Chen, you're really...

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,910
What did you call me?

113
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,040
Unscrupulous Chen.

114
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,090
Didn't you call yourself an unscrupulous lawyer?

115
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,230
So I give you the nickname,

116
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,590
Unscrupulous Chen.

117
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,720
Unscrupulous Chen.

118
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,050
That's a good name.

119
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,960
Do I need to go to the police station

120
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,020
to officially change my name to this?

121
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,150
As soon as possible.

122
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,470
Unscrupulous Chen, you're really something.

123
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,470
How dare you make money off Mr. Zhou?

124
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,710
Isn't Mr. Zhou’s money money?

125
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:57,030
I’m unscrupulous.

126
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,390
Why can't I?

127
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,910
I want to introduce a case to you.

128
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,560
You want to introduce a case to me?

129
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,030
Why?

130
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,910
Is it because I treated you to a meal

131
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,150
a few days ago

132
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,720
and you felt guilty?

133
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,650
I don't have time for that.

134
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,730
I just want a bad guy

135
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,680
to deal with another bad guy.

136
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,630
After thinking about it,

137
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,000
I found no one more suitable than you.

138
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,390
You're absolutely a perfect match.

139
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,750
No need for the preamble. Get to the point.

140
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:28,540
It's a case

141
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:31,190
worth thousands of millions in a way.

142
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,840
Luo Yingzi.

143
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,500
I'm definitely  more unscrupulous than you,

144
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,030
but I'm not as stupid as you.

145
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,560
If it's a case worth thousands of millions,

146
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,970
why are you handing me this big piece of cake?

147
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,790
Don't fool me.

148
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,240
Believe it or not,

149
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,790
I have a conflict of interest in this case,

150
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,030
so I can't take it.

151
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,330
But the client

152
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,000
wants us to introduce a lawyer

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,590
who is extremely unscrupulous,

154
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,520
that's why you are the perfect fit.

155
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,640
In your eyes,

156
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,580
I'm the most unscrupulous, huh?

157
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:01,580
Not necessarily.

158
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,030
It's still up for debate who's more unscrupulous.

159
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,510
It will be decided in the courtroom.

160
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,510
Fine.

161
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,710
Since you've put so much effort into it,

162
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,500
I'll consider taking the case.

163
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,750
What's the referral fee?

164
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,480
None at all.

165
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,580
It's against the rules.

166
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,710
Are you a hypocrite?

167
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,990
Who are you scolding?

168
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,450
I have just one condition.

169
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,080
One condition?

170
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,830
Anyway, there's no way to let me

171
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,990
cut you some slack in the banking case.

172
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:31,630
Listen.

173
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,090
I'm not that pathetic.

174
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,470
My condition is

175
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,700
you must win the case.

176
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:38,030
You also have to crush him completely,

177
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,490
leaving him no face at all.

178
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,850
Who do you hate so much?

179
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,480
The opposing lawyer

180
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,790
is my mentor,

181
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,560
Han Zhitong from our firm.

182
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:51,720
What?

183
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,020
From now on, I changed my name

184
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,280
to Unscrupulous Chen.

185
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,409
Unscrupulous Chen.

186
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,850
It's your turn.

187
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,240
Nice change on the name.

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,840
I'm not talking about that.

189
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,770
I mean she introduced a case to you.

190
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,560
You two are quite interesting.

191
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:12,490
What do you mean?

192
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,290
She named me Unscrupulous Chen.

193
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,710
Not about that.

194
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,610
No matter she praises or criticizes you, she's still the buyer.

195
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,670
I've also noticed

196
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,520
she's actually been interested in me for a long time.

197
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,640
But she might want to buy, and I may not want to sell.

198
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,840
I, Unscrupulous Chen, have some taste.

199
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,110
Come on.

200
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,470
Don't act in front of me.

201
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,789
Who knows who is the buyer or seller?

202
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,110
Do you think we should take this case?

203
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,750
Of course.

204
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,110
Why not?

205
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,100
I'm Unscrupulous Chen.

206
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,280
What wouldn't I dare to take?

207
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,950
It's worth millions.

208
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,549
Why would I refuse the money?

209
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,559
Wait, bro.

210
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm considering it for your sake.

211
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,080
Sure it's a case worth millions,

212
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,770
but ruining your lifelong reputation

213
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,220
for such a case

214
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,130
is not worth it.

215
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,130
How about this?

216
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:54,030
Let me take on some of that burden for you.

217
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,930
I'm unscrupulous too.

218
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,760
We can split it 50-50.

219
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,990
Bro, you're really something.

220
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,490
80-20, no more than that.

221
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,800
No, 70-30.

222
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:00,580
Or...

223
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,760
80-20.

224
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:06,930
Bullseye.

225
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,300
Dinner is on you.

226
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,080
Qiu Hua.

227
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,310
What's wrong?

228
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,110
It's time to fight fire with fire.

229
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,900
I found someone even more shameless,

230
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,830
more despicable,

231
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,490
and more unscrupulous than Han.

232
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,060
Who?

233
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,250
Unscrupulous Chen.

234
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,020
Who is Unscrupulous Chen?

235
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,540
Chen Shuo, from Dazheng Law Firm.

236
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,550
I gave him this nickname.

237
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,470
Isn't he handling my bank case

238
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,970
and trying to take away my house?

239
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,420
Is there anyone more unscrupulous than him?

240
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,350
So, what do you think about letting him deal with Han?

241
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm even proud of myself

242
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,470
for coming up with this plan.

243
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,450
I love this kind of lively drama,

244
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:02,190
full of chaos.

245
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,220
You don't agree?

246
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,430
Yes.

247
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,770
What made you think of him?

248
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:13,200
I just went to Mr. Zhou

249
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,990
to talk about my housekeeper.

250
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,360
I met him there.

251
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,190
After I told him this matter,

252
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,610
he was quite interested.

253
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,550
Then it was settled.

254
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,810
Did Mr. Wei agree?

255
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:26,070
I just called

256
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,470
both of them,

257
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,070
and we made an appointment.

258
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,830
I don't want to

259
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,880
miss a minute of this big show.

260
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,250
You have to go too.

261
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,070
Since both of them are interested,

262
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,660
just let them meet.

263
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:39,440
I won't go then.

264
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,850
No.

265
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,110
You have to be there

266
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,900
to witness this great moment.

267
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,710
It'll be a brilliant drama directed by me,

268
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,460
and the curtain is about to rise.

269
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,410
You must go.

270
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,470
I have something else to do.

271
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:52,430
What is it?

272
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,590
You are always busy.

273
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,160
You must go.

274
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,060
Listen.

275
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,110
Even if we are not Mr. Wei's lawyer,

276
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,220
we have to settle

277
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,440
the rest of the things properly, right?

278
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,000
You're back.

279
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,300
I'm exhausted.

280
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
How did your play the role of daughter-in-law?

281
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,510
Don't mention it.

282
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:15,250
It was a nightmare.

283
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:16,720
I've decided.

284
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,050
I'll never get married.

285
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,790
Tell me about it.

286
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,510
I've never seen so many rules.

287
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,680
When we ate,

288
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,510
my boyfriend kicked me under the table four times.

289
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,500
For a bun,

290
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,990
I had to break it into half,

291
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,490
then I had to wait to eat

292
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,140
before his parents started eating.

293
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,040
After they finished, I had to say,

294
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,180
"Dad, Mom,

295
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,200
I'm done.

296
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,390
Take your time."

297
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,380
Gosh, it's so scary.

298
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,800
And the bathroom.

299
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,160
Well.

300
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,430
No.

301
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,680
I can't say anymore.

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,150
I can't eat if I keep talking.

303
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,990
Well, you could be more flexible.

304
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,190
Say, don't stay at their house

305
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,610
and find a hotel nearby. Problem solved.

306
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,890
That's exactly what I did.

307
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,960
I knew that I couldn't stay there after the first day.

308
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,710
That bathroom...

309
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,590
I wouldn't use it even if you paid me.

310
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,590
So the next day,

311
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,450
I found a hotel in the town to stay.

312
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:04,830
But his parents are pitiful.

313
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:05,990
He told me that ,

314
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,990
to send him to college,

315
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:09,750
his older sister and younger sister

316
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,990
had to drop out.

317
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,890
The whole family supported him to go to college.

318
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,930
His dad's back has been already bad

319
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,680
from working hard,

320
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,170
while his mom's eyes shed tears against wind.

321
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,510
Let me guess.

322
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,510
You must have given money to them.

323
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,680
What else could I do?

324
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,470
I had to help them improve their lives.

325
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,350
No, Xia Shu.

326
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,180
There are many people in this world who shed tears against wind,

327
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,190
and countless others with back problems.

328
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,390
Can you help them all?

329
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,830
If you don't plan to marry your boyfriend,

330
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,520
it's better to avoid getting too involved

331
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,850
with his family sooner rather than later.

332
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,200
But I saw it.

333
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,660
How pitiful they are.

334
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,590
Forget it.

335
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,910
It's up to you.

336
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,070
Qiu Hua, it's a deal.

337
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:52,590
What deal?

338
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,750
We got a case?

339
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,800
Let me join you.

340
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,140
I'm afraid you can't.

341
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,850
It's the case you mentioned before

342
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,160
but couldn't handle,

343
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,720
so it's taken by someone else.

344
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,710
That divorce case?

345
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,370
I thought it was a murder case.

346
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,870
Well,

347
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,510
those two snacks on the windowsill have expired.

348
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,310
Don't eat them. Throw them away.

349
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,110
Alright.

350
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,370
Dear lawyers.

351
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,190
I can't blame others for this matter.

352
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,750
It was all my fault.

353
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:22,610
I hesitated back then,

354
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,430
and missed the chance to collaborate with you.

355
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,930
I wasn't like this before.

356
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:30,980
When I was at the company,

357
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,380
projects worth billions

358
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,990
would be resolved

359
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,650
in one or two hours of meeting.

360
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,510
Look at me now.

361
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,310
Whether in personal matters or business,

362
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:41,590
I'm always overtaken by fear

363
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,990
and hesitant.

364
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,080
I don't even know how I become this.

365
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,230
It's all because of that women.

366
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,470
Mr. Wei.

367
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,110
After listening to your words,

368
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,410
I can totally understand you.

369
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,130
I really do.

370
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:53,930
But Mr. Wei,

371
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,200
I think

372
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,070
we should leave the past behind.

373
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,830
Why?

374
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,590
Because the person we're introducing to you

375
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,850
will definitely complete the mission

376
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,230
to defeat Han.

377
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,510
Defeat him?

378
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,230
You see,

379
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,190
this is a professional term

380
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,590
among lawyers.

381
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,830
In simpler terms,

382
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,640
it means winning this lawsuit.

383
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,910
I got it.

384
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,530
If I do hire this lawyer,

385
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,840
can I show him the litigation strategy

386
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,330
you two figured out for me?

387
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,590
Why not?

388
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:30,110
If he thinks it's viable

389
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,990
after reviewing it,

390
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,310
feel free to use it.

391
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,530
Because, to be honest,

392
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,830
we won't be handling this case anymore.

393
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,520
Keeping it in our hands won't do any good.

394
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,780
Giving a rose to others

395
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,110
will leave fragrance on our hands, right?

396
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,320
- So why don't we do it?
-Right.

397
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,350
Thank you.

398
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,270
Thank you so much.

399
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,730
How much consultation fee

400
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,130
do you charge, then?

401
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
What are you talking about, Mr. Wei?

402
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:51,670
Bringing up money is too formal.

403
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,260
No.

404
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,940
I must pay no matter how much it is.

405
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,460
This is our fate.

406
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,310
We just want to defeat…

407
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,050
Well...

408
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,470
Winning the lawsuit is the top priority.

409
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,340
Thank you both.

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,030
Here, let me pour the tea for both of you.

411
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,830
-Thank you so much.
-Here you are.

412
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,740
Have some more tea.

413
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,300
By the way, there's something I'd like to discuss with you two.

414
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,560
I wonder if you're interested.

415
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,490
Please go ahead.

416
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,430
I happen to have a business partner.

417
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
He has a case and

418
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,410
is looking for a lawyer now.

419
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,840
Are you interested?

420
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:22,890
What kind of case is it?

421
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,880
He told me it's a patent case.

422
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,110
Have you dealt with such cases before?

423
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,240
What a coincidence.

424
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,330
We are currently

425
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:30,510
working on a patent case.

426
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,430
Really?

427
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:34,270
Then I've found the right people.

428
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,540
But

429
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:38,110
this case is not a big case.

430
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,880
It's just worth a few million.

431
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:40,640
Of course.

432
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,230
I was going to tell you earlier,

433
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,990
but I was afraid you might

434
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,830
think this is too small.

435
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:44,940
No. Mr. Wei.

436
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,830
Actually, we have to thank you, Mr. Wei.

437
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,230
After all, you introduced the case to us.

438
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:51,120
When do you think

439
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,800
is convenient for us to meet with the other party

440
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,290
to see if it's suitable for us to take on?

441
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,370
If it's suitable,

442
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
we'll take it.

443
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,020
Ms. Luo, what's suitable or not?

444
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,880
Just take it.

445
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,470
He specifically asked me

446
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,680
to help him

447
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,350
find a reliable lawyer.

448
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:08,950
-Since you two have helped me so much.
-Mr. Wei.

449
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,990
The more it's like this,

450
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,320
the more we should live up to

451
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,850
the trust others have in us.

452
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,130
As lawyers,

453
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,950
we have to take a look at this case first,

454
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:20,350
and see if we are confident to take it.

455
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,250
First,

456
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,470
we need to live up to the trust of the client.

457
00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:25,230
Most importantly, we must live up to

458
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,350
your faith in us, right?

459
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,270
Great.

460
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,350
If all the lawyers in the world were like you two,

461
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,940
it would be great.

462
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,100
Well...

463
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:40,370
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

464
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,650
How about I go pick him up at the door?

465
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,330
It's okay. Maybe there's a traffic jam.

466
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:45,810
Right.

467
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,310
By the way, Ms. Qiu.

468
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:48,370
I have something you need to know.

469
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,100
Can I have a word with you outside?

470
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,060
Mr. Wei, please enjoy the tea.

471
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,660
Okay.

472
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,540
Enjoy your tea.

473
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,720
Come on.

474
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,290
Regarding financial matters in the future,

475
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,650
it's better for you not to talk about it.

476
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:09,849
Just let me handle it.

477
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,720
Have you got this rich?

478
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,550
Why didn't you accept his money?

479
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:14,470
I forgot.

480
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,240
I was only thinking about dealing with Han.

481
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:17,920
Well,

482
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,550
didn't you see

483
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:21,760
the immediate returns from this?

484
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:23,890
The patent case, Qiu Hua.

485
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:26,089
I need you to pinch me to see if it's true.

486
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,430
You really did that?

487
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,230
It hurts.

488
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,510
The patent case is true,

489
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,870
but can we win it?

490
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,400
You're really good at boasting.

491
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,270
Well, what cases can't be handled?

492
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,070
We can learn if we don't know how.

493
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,600
He just said it's worth a few million.

494
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,590
Two million is also a few million.

495
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,510
Nine million is also a few million.

496
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,910
Alright, don't bother calculating now.

497
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,840
It'll go south if you calculate it.

498
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,990
You called me out here just for this?

499
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,710
No, I was afraid that if I continued to sit in there,

500
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,990
my sneaky expressions thinking of getting rich

501
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,270
might show up.

502
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,390
So I had to come out

503
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,290
to calm myself down.

504
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,030
You're quite the sneak when it comes to getting rich,

505
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,070
but you have to get rich first.

506
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,790
Well, I just want to enjoy the thrill for a bit.

507
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,120
Unscrupulous Chen is coming.

508
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,070
Give me your bag.

509
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,230
Wait for while.

510
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:19,710
Half an hour.

511
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:20,440
Disgusting.

512
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,110
Ms. Luo.

513
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,830
What took you so long?

514
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,310
I'm not late.

515
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,310
I've thought about it.

516
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,390
Although I love money,

517
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,590
a gentleman loves money in a proper way.

518
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:35,630
Unscrupulous Chen.

519
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,030
Don't tarnish the word "gentleman", okay?

520
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,350
Then let's say a sneak loves money.

521
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,550
Even a sneak has a proper way of acquiring it.

522
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,670
If I take on this case,

523
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,670
you'll be the middleman,

524
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:44,890
and I'll give you a commission.

525
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,710
Regardless of how much I earn,

526
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,710
I'll give you 15%.

527
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,030
After all,

528
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,660
some people still have car loans to repay.

529
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,190
I really admire you

530
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,670
for turning the lawyer's profession

531
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,950
into a business.

532
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,790
But do I look like a broker to you?

533
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,640
Ms. Luo.

534
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,000
Why are you acting so self-righteous?

535
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,150
If I were you,

536
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:06,560
15% is not enough, I'll make it 20%.

537
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,860
20% doesn't work, 30%.

538
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,640
30% doesn't work, or I'll leave.

539
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,640
20% is fine.

540
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,110
Well,

541
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,520
you're so easy to talk to.

542
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,120
Well,

543
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,990
let me tell you.

544
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,070
I'd rather not make this money,

545
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,610
I'd like to see you two fighting.

546
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:24,870
Qiu Hua.

547
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,140
Ms. Qiu.

548
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,910
20%.

549
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,750
20%, okay?

550
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,240
Long time no see.

551
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,860
After you.

552
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:35,030
Look at him.

553
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,960
Mr. Wei.

554
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,010
Come here.

555
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,140
Let me introduce Mr. Chen to you.

556
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,180
Hello.

557
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,270
-Hello, Mr. Chen.
-Mr. Wei.

558
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,910
Come here.

559
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:46,990
Take a sit.

560
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,900
You can go.

561
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,350
We'll take care of ourselves.

562
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,950
Thank you.

563
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:56,850
Mr. Wei.

564
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
You can rest assured

565
00:19:58,670 --> 00:19:59,950
about Mr. Chen.

566
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:04,160
In terms of professionalism,

567
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,860
he's absolutely on par with Mr. Han.

568
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,950
Your recommendation is surely correct.

569
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,680
Didn't I tell you before?

570
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,910
The reason Ms. Qiu and I

571
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,770
failed to take charge of your case

572
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,620
was we were set up by someone.

573
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,900
So now,

574
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,290
you don't need a good person.

575
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,760
You need someone who is more

576
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,290
manipulative than Mr. Han.

577
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,750
Mr. Chen is definitely qualified.

578
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,980
Mr. Wei.

579
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,790
My name is Chen Shuo.

580
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,280
Just think about it. You're up against Mr. Han.

581
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,260
You need a lawyer

582
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,040
more unscrupulous than Mr. Han.

583
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,230
It is up to you to decide

584
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,930
whether to hire him or not,

585
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,200
but my suggestion is

586
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,400
you'd better do so.

587
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:47,630
Ms. Qiu, let's leave it to them.

588
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:48,660
Okay.

589
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,480
Chen Shuo,

590
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,280
I have to remind you.

591
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,000
Use your intelligence

592
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,400
where it's needed,

593
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,140
not elsewhere.

594
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,830
Don't worry. You said I'm professional.

595
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,910
-Bye.
-Have a seat.

596
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,420
Bye, Ms. Luo, Ms. Qiu.

597
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,740
Come here.

598
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,970
Take a sit, Mr. Chen.

599
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,540
Let's get straight to the point.

600
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:08,940
Okay.

601
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,890
Here are all the files.

602
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,060
She's just waiting there?

603
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:22,360
I'm really impressed by Chen's taste.

604
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,470
Not bad. This girl looks good.

605
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,390
I forgot something.

606
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,400
What's wrong?

607
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,000
I forgot to ask Mr. Wei for his friend's number.

608
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,280
Wait a minute.

609
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,600
Forget it.

610
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,500
I should play it cool.

611
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,120
I'll ask for it tomorrow.

612
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,650
Let's go.

613
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,580
That's basically the situation.

614
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,400
Mr. Chen.

615
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,780
Do you have any ideas for this case?

616
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,660
Annulment.

617
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,320
Haven't you been under constant threats?

618
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,630
So, that agreement

619
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,810
must not be your true intention.

620
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,240
Mr. Chen.

621
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,890
You do have an extraordinary insight.

622
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,120
It's like heroes see eye to eye.

623
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,530
What do you mean?

624
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,470
I mean, your thinking just now

625
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,560
is the same as Ms. Luo and Ms. Qiu's.

626
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,230
The same as theirs?

627
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:19,820
Yes.

628
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,650
If it's the same as theirs,

629
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,850
then I need to change my approach.

630
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,310
I can't have the same approach

631
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,430
as two young lawyers.

632
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,730
It would lower me to their level.

633
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,230
Well,

634
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:29,990
Mr. Chen, I didn't mean that.

635
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,010
I didn't mean to degrade you to their level.

636
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,330
I mean what great minds think alike.

637
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,020
Besides,

638
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,710
the approach you suggested just now is yours.

639
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,700
And I also think

640
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,240
it's the only possible approach to win.

641
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,930
Let's proceed with this approach.

642
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:45,980
Let me think.

643
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
Here's the thing.

644
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,700
This case is actually quite difficult.

645
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,080
Well...

646
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,700
It doesn't mean

647
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,440
there is no possibility to win.

648
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,070
If you're entrusting me with this case,

649
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,910
we have to sign the agreement now.

650
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:07,650
Sure.

651
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,550
We can sign it.

652
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,000
Okay.

653
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,580
How do you want us to sign the agreement?

654
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,300
Now, considering the current situation,

655
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,430
I think it's best

656
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,470
if we do it in two steps.

657
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:19,990
If we only file for your divorce

658
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,750
right now,

659
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,550
it will definitely be unfavorable for you.

660
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:25,710
First,

661
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,180
let's nullify that equity transfer agreement.

662
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,340
Then we can proceed with the divorce and asset division.

663
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,120
This way, it's most advantageous for you.

664
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,180
Considering this,

665
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,470
we're dealing with two cases.

666
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:37,330
We need to sign two agreements simultaneously.

667
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,670
For the first one, I'll charge you 200,000.

668
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:44,070
For the second one, it's dependent on the value of the target.

669
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,700
Mr. Chen,

670
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:49,150
how about this?

671
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,120
Can we sign these two agreements separately?

672
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,920
I mean,

673
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,910
if you win the first one,

674
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,470
I'll definitely

675
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,550
entrust you with the second one.

676
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:58,040
No.

677
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,630
No way.

678
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,970
If so, Mr. Wei,

679
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:03,110
I'm sorry. Please ask for someone else.

680
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,910
To be honest,

681
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,110
the first one is only 200,000 yuan.

682
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,830
It's practically a free gift.

683
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,910
What I'm interested in is the second case.

684
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:12,120
So for the second one,

685
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,420
I will definitely ask for a higher price.

686
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,660
Please understand.

687
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,150
Okay, let's sign then.

688
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,070
No problem.

689
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,790
By the way,

690
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,820
I have a proposal

691
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,280
of the litigation strategy

692
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,790
from Ms. Qiu and Ms. Luo,

693
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:28,390
and I've got their consent

694
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,490
that you can take a look at it as a reference.

695
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,180
No need.

696
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,950
I have all my ideas in mind.

697
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,770
-Thanks, but no thanks.
-It’s okay.

698
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,490
If you have time, take a look.

699
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,590
You can keep it or discard it.

700
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,570
Just take it.

701
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:41,070
Okay, I'll take it.

702
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,430
Good.

703
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,550
Okay, here are the agreements.

704
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,100
Okay.

705
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,580
Tingting,

706
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,770
let me know what gift you want.

707
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,250
I've just made a big deal.

708
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,760
How big is it? Show me.

709
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,910
It's confidential.

710
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,010
[Litigation Strategy]

711
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,120
I'm hungry.

712
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Let's grab some late-night snacks.

713
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,940
Chen Shuo, I'm hungry.

714
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Just drive wherever you want to eat.

715
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,170
What about you?

716
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:31,680
Don't worry about me.

717
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,590
That girl, Lanlan,

718
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,340
is giving me a headache.

719
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,630
You know,

720
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,530
with her and this Mr. Zhou thing...

721
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:52,410
You don't have to worry too much about it.

722
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,610
They are adults.

723
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,280
They should be responsible for their behaviors.

724
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,360
I think if Mr. Zhou

725
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,020
is willing to solve this problem with money,

726
00:25:59,020 --> 00:25:59,830
it may lead to a good result

727
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,360
for Lanlan.

728
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,920
But

729
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,720
what if Lanlan

730
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,700
does have feelings for Mr. Zhou?

731
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,540
If he resolves it with money,

732
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,860
wouldn't that be an insult to her?

733
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,000
If Mr. Zhou had no money,

734
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,960
would Lanlan still want him that much?

735
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,930
Believe me.

736
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,180
There's nothing new in this world.

737
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,050
Maybe that's what she's looking for.

738

750
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,120
of an unscrupulous lawyer?

751
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,280
I want to thank you.

752
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,710
You introduced a big deal to me.

753
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,660
♫Among all the people I've lost♫

754
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,270
You're welcome.

755
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,290
I just want to sit on the sidelines

756
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,070
♫I miss myself the most♫

757
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,190
and watch how a bad guy

758
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,130
defeat another bad guy.

759
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:57,170
♫No pain, no fear♫

760
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,810
Fine.

761
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:58,450
Well,

762
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,680
I've read the litigation strategy

763
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,070
♫Using silence as a replacement♫

764
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,900
you wrote for Mr. Wei.

765
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,700
It's not bad.

766
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,860
♫After missing you, I didn't say much♫

767
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:06,190
How about we find some time to meet face-to-face

768
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,310
and discuss it further?

769
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,870
♫I once tried my best♫

770
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,990
It might not be necessary.

771
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,360
♫So it's not a regret♫

772
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,550
Your cunning mind

773
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:12,600
seems to be enough.

774
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,920
You don't need off-the-field guidance.

775
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,790
♫People born to be optimistic♫

776
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,950
Also,

777
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,970
please don't keep calling and bothering me in the future.

♫Always heal themselves in the deep night♫

779
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:17,820
Bye.

780
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,310
Wait.

781
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,030
I just want to tell you that

782
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,310
♫I always believe the resolution of tomorrow♫

783
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,040
I've signed the agreement with Wei Tongren.

784
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,230
Fine.

785
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,470
What does it have to do with me?

786
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,900
♫Is my superpower♫

787
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,140
How can it not concern you?

788
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,370
Won't you get a commission?

789
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,120
♫I crossed mountains and ridges to find a solution♫

790
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,850
Well, let me tell you how much it is.

791
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,990
It's 200,000 yuan.

792
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,560
♫After walking a long way, I realized it was already in the past♫

793
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,870
What?

794
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,060
No way.

795
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,470
You're a money chaser.

796
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,860
♫The clear sky appears after the rain♫

797
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:38,910
How can you be satisfied

798
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,750
♫What is fairness?♫

799
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,420
with only 200,000 yuan?

800
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,230
I did sign the agreement for 200,000 yuan.

801
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:43,910
But…

802
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,910
we signed two cases altogether.

803
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:46,920
For the first,

804
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,200
since you want 20% commission,

805
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,400
I signed at a low price on purpose.

806
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,790
As for the second one,

807
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,580
the amount is confidential.

808
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,190
Oh my god.

809
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:00,240
♫What happened hysterically♫

810
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,710
I can't believe

811
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,880
♫There's no need for proof to leave♫

812
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,260
you split the case

813
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,930
only to cut down the commission fees for us.

814
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,990
♫I once tried my best♫

815
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,010
Unscrupulous Chen.

816
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,610
♫So it's not a regret♫

817
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,640
Han is definitely no match for you.

818
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,510
Since you admitted

819
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,880
♫Missing you also became a part of the scenery♫

820
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,430
you had split the case,

821
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,310
I have to tell you,

822
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:18,180
♫It's okay if I didn't do well♫

823
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:18,010
both cases are considered as referrals from us.

824
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:18,510
So, when it comes to the second case,

825
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,390
♫If the world seems crowded♫

826
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,280
no matter how much you charge,

827
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,540
you still have to share it with us.

828
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,250
♫Stumbling♫

829
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,110
We'll have to talk about it then.

830
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,660
♫I walk alone♫

831
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,340
I can't promise you now.

♫Waiting with warm tears for a response from persistence♫

833
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:27,900
Thank you. Bye.

834

♫Let's talk about fairness♫

837
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,400
This case is interesting.

838
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,630
The people involved are more interesting.

839
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,630
Do you think I'm having bad luck lately?

840
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,390
Why do I keep running into shameless people

841
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:48,070
like this?

842
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:49,710
You have no idea that

843
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,770
he asked Mr. Wei for only 200,000 yuan

844
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,200
only to cut down the commission for us.

845
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,670
But you just said that

846
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,230
it has nothing to do with you whether they signed or not.

847
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,510
I was just trying to be cool.

848
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,580
Besides,

849
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,780
I really didn't want his money.

850
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,630
Why not?

851
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,130
Are you afraid of breaking the rules?

852
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,750
I just feel

853
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,670
when you start to be a lawyer,

854
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,000
you shouldn't be solely focused on money.

855
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,050
I'm sorry, Qiu Hua.

856
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,140
I should have discussed with you beforehand.

857
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,560
After all, you are in urgent need

858
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,880
for money.

859
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,000
I am desperate for money,

860
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,470
but as someone with debts,

861
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,510
you might probably be in much more urgent need than I am.

862
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,660
Since you can give up the immediate benefits

863
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,820
despite the urgency,

864
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,620
I can try to be less desperate.

865
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:41,610
Thank you, Qiu Hua.

866
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,630
Actually, I was forced

867
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,810
into this line of work.

868
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
But after entering this profession

869
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,190
and seeing lawyers

870
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,860
as undignified as Han,

871
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,380
I thought

872
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,480
I might not become

873
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,650
a very successful lawyer in the future,

874
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,980
but I must work hard

875
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,690
to be a decent lawyer.

876
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,100
To dignity.

877
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,830
Cheers.

878
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,230
Lanlan.

879
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,130
Ms. Luo.

880
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,040
Have a seat.

881
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,470
What would you like to drink?

882
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,800
Why do you want to see me?

883
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,110
Well,

884
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,390
I just

885
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,790
picked two good books

886
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,250
for you.

887
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:02,530
They're helpful for your study.

888
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,840
Did you call me just for books?

889
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:08,220
Lanlan.

890
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,640
Well,

891
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,070
about Mr. Zhou,

892
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:12,910
I feel

893
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,800
he's unlikely

894
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,980
to divorce his wife because of you.

895
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,280
He feels sorry to you

896
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,870
on this matter,

897
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,240
so he wants

898
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,510
to compensate you financially.

899
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,870
Can you

900
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,990
accept it?

901
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,500
If he doesn't want to divorce for me,

902
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,200
why did he seduce me in the first place?

903
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,560
Is he trying to get away without any consequences?

904
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,670
Ms. Luo, please tell him

905
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,340
I don't want money.

906
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,320
I just want him.

907
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,930
I also think what he did was wrong,

908
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,550
and he admitted it himself.

909
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
When I met him, I criticized him too.

910
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,560
That's why he said he wanted to make a financial compensation.

911
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,290
What financial compensation?

912
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,730
He thinks I'm a prostitute?

913
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,430
Of course not.

914
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:58,070
But obviously, he's not worthy of your love.

915
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,740
First, he has a family.

916
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,460
Besides,

917
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,170
I don't think he's really into you.

918
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,150
Actually,

919
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,140
I didn't ask him for the money.

920
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
It was his offer to

921
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,720
end the relationship with the money.

922
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,680
So I don't think

923
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,620
you should waste your

924
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,800
youth and love on Mr. Zhou.

925
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,200
Fine.

926
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,620
How much is he going to give me?

927
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,390
He...

928
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,460
Anyway,

929
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,130
he said

930
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,050
he can give you 500,000 yuan.

931
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,410
I want 10 million.

932
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,480
Lanlan, are you serious?

933
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,230
Well…

934
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,710
It's such a big gap.

935
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,060
I mean it.

936
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,710
Do you think my youth

937
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:59,920
is so worthless?

938
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:00,720
No.

939
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,070
I don't think youth should

940
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,330
be equated with value.

941
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:05,150
Well,

942
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,030
you see,

943
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,220
it doesn't matter what I think.

944
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,660
It's about whether he can give you that money

945
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,750
or whether he agrees or not.

946
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,900
If he doesn't agree, he shall marry me.

947
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:27,920
I'm an adult now.

948
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,470
You don't need to worry about

949
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,600
my affairs with him.

950
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:35,910
Lanlan, you said

951
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:37,230
you are an adult.

952
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,730
You should take care of yourself.

953
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:44,040
You have helped me before.

954
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,060
Now that you're in trouble,

955
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,490
I want to offer my help.

956
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:50,130
But if you say so,

957
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,210
I won't intervene.

958
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,740
Actually, I can't.

959
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,010
Deal with it yourself, okay?

960
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,930
Okay, don't worry.

961
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,100
Well,

962
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,250
I've transferred your salary this month

963
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,570
to your account.

964
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:05,910
You don't need to.

965
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,730
I have been busy taking classes

966
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:07,950
and done little work recently.

967
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:09,560
Besides, you've already paid for the tuition.

968
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,980
You don't have to pay me anymore.

969
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,739
No, we had a deal earlier.

970
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,300
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

971
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,020
She doesn't want me to get involved in this anymore.

972
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,610
Just take care of yourself.

973
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,239
What does she want?

974
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,469
She doesn't want to break up with you so easily.

975
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,219
You'd better be prepared.

976
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,389
She doesn't want to end it?

977
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,909
So do I.

978
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,330
Let the game continue.

979
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:47,090
I have a lot of time,

980
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,150
and I have nothing else to do.

981
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,389
Yingzi,

982
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,739
don't worry about this anymore.

983
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:55,320
Don't let it bother you.

984
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:46,320
Yingzi.

985
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,400
Are you busy?

986
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,260
I just bought some books on patent cases,

987
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:52,890
and we have a bit of work to do.

988
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,260
Can you do me a favor?

989
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:55,900
Go ahead.

990
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,690
Today is my turn to handle legal consultations,

991
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:00,670
but I'm feeling a bit unwell.

992
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,880
The client is still in the meeting room.

993
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,750
Could you talk to her on my behalf?

994
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:05,890
Are you all right?

995
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,150
Do you need a break?

996
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,980
I'm fine.

997
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,460
I just need some water.

998
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,550
Okay.

999
00:36:11,590 --> 00:36:12,100
I'll go.

1000
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,950
Go have some rest.

1001
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,040
I'll go then.

1002
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:33,110
Hello.

1003
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,870
Hello.

1004
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,240
Are you the one who consulted with Lawyer Qiu earlier?

1005
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,460
Please have a seat.

1006
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:40,830
Ms. Qiu isn't feeling well,

1007
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,320
so I'm here to replace her.

1008
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,310
My surname is Luo.

1009
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,590
You can call me Ms. Luo.

1010
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,870
What's your name?

1011
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,400
My name is Guo Yu.

1012
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:51,050
[Guo Yu]

1013
00:36:48,110 --> 00:36:49,710
So, why are you here today?

1014
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,860
Do you need advice on any legal issues?

1015
00:36:54,270 --> 00:36:55,450
I want to ask...

1016
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,010
I want…

1017
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,580
It's quite normal here.

1018
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,770
Actually, if you haven't made up your mind,

1019
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,450
you can always come back later.

1020
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,750
I work in Weida Group.

1021
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,360
You know Weida Group, don't you?

1022
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,700
My boss is Yang Weida.

1023
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,990
I don't know much about Weida Group,

1024
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:32,880
but…

1025
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,800
Is Yang Weida

1026
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,780
an online celebrity,

1027
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,340
the former youth leader

1028
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,520
who started his own business at a young age

1029
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,180
and frequently sponsored students

1030
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,070
in impoverished areas and children who dropped out of school?

1031
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,950
He made presentations everywhere. Is that him?

1032
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:47,590
It's him.

1033
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,950
I'm his assistant.

1034
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,740
You're very lucky.

1035
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:53,240
Really?

1036
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,410
I thought so at first.

1037
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,090
After he succeeded,

1038
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:02,280
he continued to contribute to society,

1039
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,920
establishing several funds,

1040
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,830
including one specifically for supporting female college students.

1041
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,260
for supporting female college students.

1042
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:10,540
[Opening Ceremony of Weida Foundation's Dream Project of Supporting Village Girls]

1043
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,830
Actually,

1044
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,940
I also received help from this fund

1045
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,000
to attend college.

1046
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,890
It's challenging for rural kids to find jobs.

1047
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,040
After graduation,

1048
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,490
I couldn't find a job, so I wrote a letter to Mr. Yang.

1049
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,750
Then,

1050
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,400
I was hired by the company

1051
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,590
to work for him.

1052
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:32,570
Really?

1053
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,720
He sounds like a good person.

1054
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:36,790
A good person?

1055
00:38:38,770 --> 00:38:39,900
You really think so?

1056
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,250
I thought so at first.

1057
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,590
What's wrong?

1058
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:53,260
Well,

1059
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,300
let me get you some more water.

1060
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,210
Guo Yu.

1061
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,900
Are you okay?

1062
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,910
If there's something, take your time and tell me.

1063
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,120
He harassed me.

1064
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,790
I shouldn't have said it.

1065
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,830
After all, he helped me a lot.

1066
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,550
But I can't stand it anymore.

1067
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,260
Calm down.

1068
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,140
You…

1069
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,520
Tell me how he harassed you.

1070
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,310
I don't know how to put it.

1071
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,330
I work around him,

1072
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:43,750
and initially, he seemed really nice to me.

1073
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:45,480
But later on,

1074
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,510
things started feeling off.

1075
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,640
He often sent me

1076
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,820
these suggestive messages.

1077
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,050
What kind of suggestive messages?

1078
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,010
Can you be more specific?

1079
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,920
Like,

1080
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,910
he advised me to be more open,

1081
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,280
asked if I have a boyfriend,

1082
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,920
and if I'm a virgin.

1083
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,210
Well,

1084
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,640
it's really inappropriate.

1085
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:20,130
He even asked about my bra size

1086
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:21,630
and the color.

1087
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,550
Hold on.

1088
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,160
Guo Yu, look.

1089
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,400
Are you talking about this man?

1090
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,020
Yes.

1091
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,160
It's said this woman is his wife.

1092
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,820
Have you seen her?

1093
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,410
Yes, it's his wife.

1094
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:56,230
She's the vice president of our company.

1095
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,380
She's very capable.

1096
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:58,820
Actually,

1097
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,270
she's been running the company

1098
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,530
for the most part.

1099
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:06,280
Guo Yu,

1100
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,310
I may have started working a few years earlier than you.

1101
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,270
Based on my years of experience,

1102
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,650
in society,

1103
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:20,030
there's a type of successful guy

1104
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:23,290
who loves to throw around some verbal advantages

1105
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,730
in front of younger girls.

1106
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,590
It's all about showing off

1107
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:31,620
their so-called social superiority.

1108
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,710
But when you feel offended,

1109
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:35,870
they quickly claim

1110
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:37,640
it's just a joke

1111
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,160
or without malicious intent.

1112
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,620
Is sticking a hand inside someone's clothes

1113
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,200
considered a joke?

1114
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,960
Moreover, he enjoys watching porn in the office

1115
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,590
when he's alone.

1116
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Sometimes when I go to deliver files

1117
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:04,860
while he's watching,

1118
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:07,490
he pulls me to watch together.

1119
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,720
At times like this,

1120
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,350
he would get his hands all over me.

1121
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,950
slapping my butt

1122
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,320
and grabbing my thighs.

1123
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,060
At first, I thought I was overthinking,

1124
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,320
but he's crossing the line more and more.

1125
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,820
When there's no one around,

1126
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,170
he gets touchy-feely,

1127
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,110
hugs me,

1128
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:29,660
and kisses me.

1129
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,200
Mr. Han, what are you doing?

1130
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,820
How about we booking a hotel room tonight?

1131
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,090
How long has this been going on?

1132
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,740
I've been at the company for almost a year,

1133
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,460
and it's been going on for about half a year.

1134
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,970
Half a year?

1135
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,130
Then what took you so long to see us?

1136
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,930
I didn't know who to turn to before,

1137
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,840
and now I'm desperate.
