1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,372
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

2
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,586
The main character, Kang Chul...

3
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,920
It looks good on you.

4
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,426
...meets a girl from reality, Oh Yeon-joo,

5
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,928
and dreams of a new, happy life.

6
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,933
The killer who killed Chul's
entire family ten years ago appears.

7
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,643
I'll put a bullet in her head.

8
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,813
He threatens Chul
by saying that he would kill Yeon-joo.

9
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,484
As the purposes of the characters
in W disappear,

10
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,570
the characters themselves
start to disappear too.

11
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,239
Chul thus works
with the author, Seong-moo,

12
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,742
and tries to protect Yeon-joo
and the world of W.

13
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:19,204
They plan to catch the killer who killed
Chul's family ten years ago,

14
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,122
but just before they could do it,

15
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,794
the killer appears with Seong-moo's face

16
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,462
and sends Chul's plans down the drain.

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:31,925
He kills Son Hyeon-seok
who was like a father to Chul

18
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,344
and frames Chul for the murder.

19
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,221
Stop the car. I'll drive.

20
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:39,224
Chul is shot while making his escape,
and fights for his life.

21
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,815
He is saved by Yeon-joo, who goes
back to the real world to save him.

22
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,441
Grocery shopping.

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,695
Cake.

24
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,198
Give me a bite.

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,035
Going shopping.

26
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,204
How is this? It's 5,000 won.

27
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,539
It's cheap.

28
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,799
Did we do four things now?

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,385
Two more and I'm done
with today's homework.

30
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,058
Do you like it with a lot of bacon?

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,145
-What did you just say?
-What?

32
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,440
You said something about homework.

33
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,736
The homework to do ten sweet things a day.

34
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,489
You said your husband disappeared
after doing only four.

35
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,869
I wanted to do them
on behalf of your husband

36
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,037
since you saved my life.

37
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,500
You said your husband looked like me.

38
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,586
Isn't that why

39
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,754
you're following me?

40
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:54,883
How did you know?

41
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,887
I never mentioned anything about homework.

42
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,723
I read it.

43
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:03,808
From where?

44
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,406
Here.

45
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,328
You know this webtoon, right?

46
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,040
Your face says you know it well.

47
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,792
I read it in here.

48
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,338
Your husband disappeared
after doing four sweet things.

49
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,550
He's so mean.

50
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,762
How could he do that to a woman
after marrying her?

51
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,934
You wouldn't show up,
and I had nothing to do here,

52
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:47,435
so I read this over and over.

53
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,022
The story was fun and interesting.

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,859
I felt bad for Kang Chul,
but he also seemed foolish

55
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,903
just like me.

56
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,199
That's why I didn't turn myself in.

57
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,243
So I could meet you.

58
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:06,663
I was going to ask you what happens next.

59
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:10,667
I couldn't go to prison
without finding that out.

60
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,965
Have you read the book after this one?

61
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,009
What happens

62
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,470
to Chul and Yeon-joo next?

63
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:27,850
So?

64
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,145
Does Chul forget Yeon-joo forever?

65
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:33,982
Answer me.

66
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,860
Is your husband
who suddenly disappeared...

67
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:44,909
me?

68
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,650
Is it hard for you to answer?

69
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,161
Then let's go out and confirm together.

70
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,294
This is your father's workroom, right?

71
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,101
I...

72
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,896
didn't know I took the book with me.

73
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,734
I wasn't planning on telling you.

74
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,654
I was going to keep it a secret.

75
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,197
I just

76
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,034
really wanted it
to be a happy ending for you.

77
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,875
Seok-beom, wait.

78
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,294
Seok-beom, please don't go.

79
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,380
Let me go.

80
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:04,257
I'm so scared.

81
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:07,510
I'm more scared of you.
You laugh by yourself.

82
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,053
I'm going back to the hospital.

83
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,598
Please stay with me just until
Yeon-joo gets back.

84
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,101
When is she coming back?

85
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,562
You don't even know where she went.

86
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,417
Where's your father?

87
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,390
Why?

88
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,893
I want to meet him.

89
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,646
Don't worry, I won't shoot him.

90
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,357
I would be an idiot
to make the same mistake twice.

91
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,445
Where is he?

92
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,197
He didn't draw it.

93
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,991
He didn't frame you.

94
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,036
Don't get the wrong idea.

95
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,801
Why is the door locked?

96
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,803
You'll see.

97
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,063
Mr. Oh?

98
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,191
This is Oh Seong-moo?

99
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:48,069
Yes.

100
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,238
What happened to him?

101
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,657
I don't know either.

102
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:56,827
It's only been a few hours, although
it's been over a month in your time.

103
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,708
I'm dizzy.

104
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:04,835
I'm...

105
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,468
Come on, Dr. Kang. Dr. Kang!

106
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,762
It'll only be a little while.

107
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,265
It won't be long. No.

108
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,935
Have some instant ramen.
I'll make it for you.

109
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:24,564
Stop offering me ramen.
And why do you keep touching me?

110
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,692
Wasn't that door closed before?

111
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,945
What is it?

112
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,701
Who are... Who is he?

113
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,578
Kang...

114
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,454
Kang what?

115
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,540
Can you help me? She fainted.

116
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,208
Yeon-joo.

117
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,294
Yeon-joo.

118
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,604
What's wrong? Are you sick?

119
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,314
It's just exhaustion.

120
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,149
Exhaustion?

121
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,318
I skipped time by a month.

122
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,778
It was like this last time too.

123
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,031
Does this mean that all you have
to do is rest?

124
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,074
That should be enough.

125
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,243
I'm glad.

126
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,957
Are you going to Myungsei?

127
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,292
Of course.

128
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:30,921
Ms. Kim, we're heading there now.
Can you book a hospital room?

129
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,549
We'll do the basic tests
and a chest x-ray.

130
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,219
Where are you going?

131
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,143
Don't go.

132
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,565
I have something to take care of.
I'll head there soon.

133
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,776
Do you remember?

134
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,903
Do you

135
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:56,572
remember me?

136
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,576
Do you remember everything now?

137
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:04,038
No.

138
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,084
I'm just assuming

139
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,127
how the Kang Chul in the comic
would have felt.

140
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,008
Since you didn't change,
I'm sure I'll find out soon

141
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,219
what your strange charm is.

142
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,352
I'll come by in a bit.
Please take care of her.

143
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,420
That's Kang Chul.

144
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,548
It's Kang Chul for sure.
It's definitely him. Why is he here?

145
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,092
Kang Chul. Why is Chul...

146
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,262
I...

147
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,931
May I come in?

148
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:07,226
Yes. Please come in.

149
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,229
What's your name?

150
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,647
It's Park Su-bong.

151
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,192
I'm sorry, but may I borrow your shoes?

152
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,735
I came here without any.

153
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,738
Yes, sure.

154
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,365
Thank you.

155
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,491
Excuse me.

156
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,536
We've met once before.

157
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,413
We have?

158
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,665
In the front yard.

159
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:46,932
-I'm sorry.
-I don't think sorry will cut it.

160
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,436
I'm sorry. I don't know any scenes
that weren't in the book.

161
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:53,898
I see.

162
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,774
Do you have a screwdriver?

163
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,943
A screwdriver? Flat-head or Phillips?

164
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,696
Do you want both?

165
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
DASH

166
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:10,581
Pardon me.

167
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,042
Here you go.

168
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,336
I brought both a flat-head
and a Phillips head

169
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,962
just in case.

170
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,510
What are you going to do?

171
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:26,013
Because it's dangerous.
We can't have a repeat of what happened.

172
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,432
He won't come out if I disassemble it.

173
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,142
I see.

174
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,436
If you disassemble it,
you won't be able to reassemble.

175
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,230
What if you need it again?

176
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,361
Oh, right. You majored
in computer science.

177
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,449
-What happened to Oh Seong-moo?
-Well,

178
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,535
when I came back after buying some snacks,

179
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,912
his face had disappeared like that.

180
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,331
He was drawing furiously
as the killer instructed him

181
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,083
to draw the gun and the voice recording.

182
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,335
It wasn't just a mess over there.

183
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,337
It was a total mess here too.

184
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,172
Yeon-joo suddenly disappeared

185
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,966
after Mr. Oh's face disappeared.

186
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:04,677
I was so scared that I was shuddering.

187
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,013
And then you suddenly appeared.

188
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,435
By the way, Chul,

189
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,729
may I shake your hand?

190
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,024
I've been your fan for a long time.

191
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,236
I couldn't talk to you back then
because of the situation,

192
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,737
so I...

193
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,952
Goodness.

194
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,874
I was the one who drew the penthouse
and the broadcasting station.

195
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,750
I'm the one who draws those.

196
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,003
I've been drawing the background
for three years.

197
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,629
Is that so?

198
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,339
This is amazing.

199
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,010
Do you want some beer? You like beer.
I have beers of all types.

200
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,386
Water will do.

201
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,389
I'll bring you some water.
Of course, I will.

202
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:03,152
Goodness, this is incredible.

203
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,280
Chul. Oh, my goodness.

204
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,492
He even smells good.

205
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,868
2015 REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FOR W
2014 REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FOR W

206
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,042
OH, NO.

207
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,977
Here's your water.

208
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,105
Thank you. Where can I find
what happens after volume 34?

209
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,400
-Volume 34?
-I need to see the next one

210
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,610
to find out what's been happening.

211
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,445
Here you go.

212
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,492
This is the letter I sent?

213
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,160
Yes, you sent it to Mr. Oh.

214
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,793
WHERE IS KANG CHUL?

215
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,462
GIVE THIS TO YOUR FATHER

216
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,590
Mr. Oh and I were creating a story

217
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,426
to catch the killer

218
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,469
when that happened to him.

219
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,346
What's the story you came up with?

220
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:59,768
This is the storyboard.

221
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:16,261
YOU COULDN'T SHOOT ME TO BEGIN WITH

222
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,972
You're just an illusion.

223
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,185
You're nothing.
You're just a character I created.

224
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,979
So why did you show up here

225
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,357
and act like you're human?

226
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,735
You're just a character, understand?

227
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,654
Just something I created!

228
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,743
How can you be a god?

229
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,581
Why did I think you were a god?

230
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,835
Why was I so angry,

231
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,045
that I shot you?

232
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,717
You're nothing either.

233
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,151
Who is it?

234
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,654
Take a guess.

235
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,743
Guess who I am.

236
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,543
How does it feel,
being alone in an empty world?

237
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,215
You love shooting and killing people,

238
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,758
but you have no one to kill now.

239
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,551
You probably can't shoot either.

240
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,386
How are you surviving?

241
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,228
You can't follow me out like last time

242
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,480
because I got rid of the exit.

243
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,193
Isn't it better to just die?

244
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,321
Are you telling me

245
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,116
-to die?
-What's the point of living there alone?

246
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,994
The time there will be stopped forever.

247
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,622
Why would I die?

248
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,999
Just a little bit more
and you'll disappear first.

249
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,588
You're no longer the main character.
You're a murderer and a fugitive.

250
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,757
You'll disappear soon.

251
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,051
Once the main character disappears,

252
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,470
the world will start going again.

253
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:06,348
All I have to do is wait for you
to disappear,

254
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,267
so why would I die?

255
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,604
Mom?

256
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,243
Was that a dream?

257
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,926
Was that all a dream?

258
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,861
-Hello?
-Are you awake?

259
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,823
How do you feel?

260
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,996
Hello? Can you hear me?

261
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,123
I hear you.

262
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,709
I asked how you were. Are you all right?

263
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,588
I think I am, but...

264
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,465
Where are you?

265
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,133
I'm near your father's workroom.

266
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,968
You're here right now?

267
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,679
Are you really calling me from here?

268
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,390
How can I call you
from inside the cartoon?

269
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,439
I just got a cell phone in Su-bong's name.

270
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,733
Save this number. It's mine.

271
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,111
Will you continue to sleep?

272
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,822
If you're feeling okay,
let's go on a date.

273
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:28,740
A date?

274
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,618
While you were down for two days,
I adjusted to this world.

275
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,662
I also figured out what's happening.
I did everything.

276
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,122
Except for my marriage problem.

277
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,624
What?

278
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,168
It says that I'm your husband,

279
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,881
and I think it's certainly true.
But I've only read it in the book.

280
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,342
So it doesn't feel real to me.

281
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:50,345
That's why I've been waiting
for you to wake up.

282
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,223
Let's go on a date.

283
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,102
You know me too well
but I don't know much about you.

284
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,063
So you need to give me a chance
to catch up.

285
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,776
You don't want to?

286
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:08,488
I have to go see my dad.
Plus, I just woke up.

287
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:12,117
Let's talk about your dad when we meet.
I have things to tell you.

288
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,996
You'll go on a date with me, right?

289
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,417
Start getting ready.
I'll call you when I'm near.

290
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,017
-Hello?
-I was...

291
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:39,728
I was just checking
if it's really your number.

292
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:41,980
It is.

293
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,649
But where did you get the money
to buy the phone?

294
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,110
Oh, I took it from Su-bong.

295
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,697
Can you pay him back for me?
I borrowed quite a lot.

296
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,783
Am I your bank or something?

297
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,870
Shouldn't a married couple share assets?

298
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,247
You're mean.

299
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:02,500
Even when I was broke,
I bought you clothes and ice cream.

300
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,003
I didn't say anything. I was just asking.

301
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,264
-What?
-When are you coming again?

302
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,391
Will 30 minutes be enough?

303
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,809
No. Give me an hour.

304
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,394
Okay.

305
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,410
Yes. He borrowed money.

306
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,205
-A million won.
-A million won?

307
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,333
-That's a lot.
-Well,

308
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,795
he had to buy shoes, clothes,
and a cell phone.

309
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,880
He needs money
to go on dates with you too.

310
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,298
I'll pay you back later.

311
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,218
Don't worry about it.
He'll pay me back eventually.

312
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,887
You can't handle the spending habits
of an uber rich.

313
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,639
I know. I'm going to go bankrupt.

314
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,977
Anyway, what's going to happen now?

315
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,186
Will he continue to live here?

316
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,273
Is that possible? Can I get my money back?

317
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,068
I mean, it's been all right so far.

318
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,612
I wonder if it's possible
for it to keep going.

319
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:15,532
I'm normal when I'm there,

320
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,200
so isn't it the same?

321
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,744
Actually, did you know?

322
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,123
There's something strange about his hand.

323
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,670
Don't you have more?

324
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,463
How much more?

325
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:33,425
The more the better.
I need a lot of things.

326
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,143
Is that all?

327
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:47,022
I have more in my bank account.

328
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,069
What? Your hand...

329
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,156
What? Your...

330
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,909
It's because the main character
isn't acting like a main character.

331
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,786
Don't tell Yeon-joo.

332
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:06,124
Do you remember how
when So-hee was about to disappear,

333
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,376
her hand became translucent?

334
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,172
Oh, no. He told me not to tell you,

335
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,049
but I did.

336
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,302
Don't tell him that I told you.
He told me not to.

337
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,598
Let's talk later. Someone's at the door.

338
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,936
Dang it. I might not get my money back.

339
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,940
Mom?

340
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:35,779
Yeon-joo.

341
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,616
-May I come in?
-But...

342
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,244
How... How did you come here?

343
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,205
You said you would call when you're near.

344
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:47,040
I wanted to see how you live.

345
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,500
What?

346
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,419
I heard from Su-bong
that your mom went to work.

347
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,004
I'm coming in.

348
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,389
The book lacks a lot of information.

349
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,933
I have the right to know
about you too, don't I?

350
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:09,687
I guess.

351
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,315
So this is where you live.

352
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,691
Yes.

353
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,695
This is where I live.
It doesn't compare to a penthouse.

354
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,823
It's nice and cozy.

355
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,158
It's similar to my old house.

356
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,955
You came so suddenly. I'm not ready yet.

357
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,457
Get ready. I'll wait.

358
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,794
There are drinks in the fridge.
Help yourself.

359
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,962
Okay.

360
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,800
Wait.

361
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,930
Can you take off your robe?

362
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,016
What did you just say?

363
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:48,643
Nothing.

364
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:51,563
You're sad that I don't remember,

365
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:52,981
and I'm frustrated too.

366
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:56,067
So shouldn't we do everything
we did in this book?

367
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,363
We should see each other in the nude
and kiss five times today.

368
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,326
There is a big gap in our relationship.

369
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,537
I'm curious.

370
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,082
I want to feel how Chul in this book felt.

371
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,544
You're joking, right?

372
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,963
I am very serious right now.

373
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,048
Seriously...

374
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,728
Take your time. I'll wait.

375
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,353
DID I DO FOUR SWEET THINGS NOW?
THIS ISN'T THE TIME FOR HOMEWORK

376
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,575
What are you doing?

377
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,376
Thank you.

378
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:39,963
For what?

379
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,715
For not forgetting me, and missing me.

380
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,268
We didn't take any pictures, so...

381
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,523
Let's take a picture together.
I regretted it a lot.

382
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:01,985
Okay.

383
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:07,031
Is she your mother? She's beautiful.

384
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,202
Yes.

385
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,715
Your husband has never been
in your room, right?

386
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,174
What?

387
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,723
If he knew you were so messy,

388
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,058
he would've reconsidered the marriage.

389
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,645
He's a neat-freak.

390
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,689
He would've been shocked.

391
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,608
It's all your fault!

392
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,903
I was going mad
because I thought you might be dead.

393
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,322
When would I have the time
to clean my room?

394
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:51,326
And I'm usually very neat.

395
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,496
I've seen everything,
so I'll go down and wait.

396
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,873
Come down when you're ready.

397
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,093
Where shall we go?

398
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,929
What do you feel like eating?

399
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,473
Are you treating?

400
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,224
You don't know any restaurants.

401
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,101
You have neither money nor friends.

402
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:18,895
So I have to buy.

403
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,232
I'll tell you what I think
about what I've read.

404
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,611
Chul and Yeon-joo got married too soon.

405
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,279
Although they did have their reasons...

406
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,117
So let's go on dates

407
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:36,329
like other couples.

408
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,043
It's funny that we're on a date
when we're married,

409
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:45,838
but let's not rush the sweet things
you like as homework.

410
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,050
Let's go naturally with the flow.

411
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,135
What do you think?

412
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,096
I like that.

413
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,265
Where should we go? You choose.

414
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,823
Maybe we came too late. It's just us here.

415
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:15,743
Right.

416
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,538
When do I get to have those five kisses?

417
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,581
What?

418
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,042
How about now? No one is around.

419
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,796
Enough already.

420
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,341
I'm serious.

421
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,595
I was joking about seeing you
in the nude earlier, but I'm serious now.

422
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,558
You don't want to? Is it too awkward?

423
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,271
-Then we'll take it slow.
-No.

424
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,941
Why would it be awkward for me?

425
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,237
Then may I do it?

426
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,452
Yes.

427
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:00,830
You may...

428
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,647
So this is what it feels like.

429
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:28,983
I see.

430
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,822
-I get it.
-What did you get?

431
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,533
How does it feel?

432
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,152
It's delicious.
No wonder you chose this place.

433
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,992
Are you mad? Why aren't you talking?

434
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:22,328
Your hand...

435
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,206
What do we do?

436
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,170
I know you've been hiding it
from me since earlier.

437
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,716
I was going to tell you after we finished.

438
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,471
I can't...

439
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,182
eat.

440
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,443
It's been like this for a month.

441
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,321
Ever since Mr. Son died.

442
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,867
-What are we going to do?
-We'll have to fix it.

443
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,494
How will we fix it?

444
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,125
I've talked to your father
a lot since then.

445
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,545
You talked with my dad?

446
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,299
I didn't know which was the real
Oh Seong-moo, so I met both.

447
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,803
That's how I knew why our plan failed.

448
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,776
No!

449
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,646
Please don't kill me.

450
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,606
Don't kill me.

451
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,066
Who are you?

452
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,443
I'm supposed to kill Kang Chul.

453
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:18,653
Why are you trying to kill him?

454
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,781
How are you alive
when you've been stabbed?

455
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,241
What are you?

456
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,910
Who are you?

457
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,133
Don't be so conceited.

458
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,637
You didn't find out first.
I found out long before you did.

459
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,100
Oh Seong-moo promised me then

460
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,102
that he'll give me a face.

461
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,937
One more thing.

462
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,856
Please...

463
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:08,661
You'll be the main character.
I'll make you the main character.

464
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,289
No, it's not hard to do.

465
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,834
I can make it happen. Please...

466
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:19,422
He told me I would become
the main character if I got rid of you.

467
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,299
He promised me,

468
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,551
but he betrayed me as soon as he returned.

469
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,386
That asshole.

470
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,513
That's why I ate him...

471
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,017
for breaking his promise.

472
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,228
What does...

473
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,939
There's something that your father failed
to tell me.

474
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:40,860
He had already met the killer that day,

475
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,070
and they had made a promise.

476
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,032
That's why it didn't work
when we turned it into a dream.

477
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,076
He was aware of his identity,
and only my memories were erased.

478
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:51,495
It was my mistake.

479
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,165
I chose the wrong point in time
to turn into a dream.

480
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,916
That's why things got messy.

481
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,793
Then...

482
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,212
I thought about it.

483
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,673
Promise me something.

484
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,760
What?

485
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,013
When you go to the workroom,

486
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:11,140
draw something for me.

487
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,810
What do you mean? What now?

488
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,940
Do you want me to make it a dream again?

489
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,736
Then you'll disappear from here.

490
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,115
It's easy for you
since you'll forget me and live on,

491
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,078
but I have to stay here by myself
and repeat the memories again.

492
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,833
If you were going to ask me this,

493
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,086
why did you ask me to go on dates?

494
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,213
Why did you kiss me just now?

495
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,843
-I never mentioned dreams.
-That's what you're trying to say.

496
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,971
You want to turn back time
to before the killer knew his identity

497
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,640
so that everyone is safe.

498
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,976
That's what the cartoon Kang Chul said.

499
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,478
That's not my plan.

500
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,733
We were in a bind
and didn't have a choice then.

501
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,860
Now we have time to think.

502
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,197
I don't want to live the same life
all over again either.

503
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,283
Nor do I want to leave you
with nothing but memories.

504
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,119
Then?

505
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,746
What do you want me to draw?

506
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,918
Draw this for me.

507
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,924
What is this?

508
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,886
I think the killer has to die
for your dad to return.

509
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:33,848
Since I'm no longer the main character,

510
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,599
I might disappear at any point.

511
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,812
There is only one solution.

512
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,566
Proceed with the story your father
and I had planned from the beginning.

513
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,568
Hello?

514
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:47,862
It's me.

515
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,448
How are the kids?

516
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,455
We have to catch the killer
and make Han Cheol-ho kill him.

517
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:02,543
That's the best way.
So we must make it happen.

518
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,879
It's the only way for your father
and I to live.

519
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,716
Although,

520
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,844
I want to change
the ending your father wrote.

521
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,180
In the end,

522
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,766
Kang Chul and Oh Yeon-joo should
get married and live happily ever after.

523
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,438
That would be the most logical
happy ending for W.

524
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,108
Don't you agree?

525
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,487
I don't care if we piss off the readers.

526
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:58,849
I realized this after I saw your father.

527
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,809
Oh Seong-moo is not a god.

528
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:03,437
This happened because he thought he was.

529
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,900
It's impossible for him to have
created everything in that world.

530
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,070
How can a writer make up billions
of characters?

531
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,488
It doesn't make sense.

532
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,867
What he could control was the few
he designed himself.

533
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,078
That's the conclusion I came to.

534
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,872
The cartoon is only a pathway
connecting the two worlds.

535
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,416
This world and that world
are exclusively independent.

536
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,377
Two different worlds.

537
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:55,197
-Where does the killer live?
-Pardon?

538
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,950
There must be a location.
Is there anything you used for reference?

539
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,494
There are photos of the apartment I used.

540
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:01,954
Where is it?

541
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,166
Was the killer's address
mentioned in the cartoon?

542
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:09,837
No, because things happened
before I drew anything.

543
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,549
That's why the police couldn't find him.

544
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,844
These are the photos
of the apartment I used.

545
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,101
SUNGHA APARTMENT IN MUNGYE,
DOBONG, SEOUL

546
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,314
The only things the two worlds share
in common are things in the cartoon

547
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,524
including me, a few other characters,

548
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,193
and certain locations
and things from the set-up.

549
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:57,217
The two worlds came together
initially via Oh Seong-moo's tablet.

550
00:44:00,846 --> 00:44:02,640
I also got out via the tablet,

551
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,226
but there were variables thereafter.

552
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,479
-What's going on?
-The characters became aware.

553
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,939
Yeon-joo?

554
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,650
Depending on which characters
became aware,

555
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:15,194
people in real life were called upon.

556
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,781
They were ejected when one chapter ended.

557
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:23,744
Variables continued to appear,

558
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,746
and because of that,
you've been used thus far.

559
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,706
You've been used enough.

560
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,585
It's time that we use the variables
to our advantage.

561
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,886
What do you want to eat?

562
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,680
-A hamburger.
-A hamburger?

563
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,473
Let's go get some hamburgers.

564
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,358
I chose apartment number 815.
There's no particular reason.

565
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,874
Ten minutes will be enough.

566
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,418
After ten minutes, turn it on.

567
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,220
I'm in reality right now.

568
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,974
At the same time,
I'm one of the characters.

569
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,937
If a character
can call someone from reality,

570
00:46:15,022 --> 00:46:16,190
my first hypothesis is...

571
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:20,319
that I can pull myself back
into the cartoon.

572
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:24,907
From now on, I'll summon myself.

573
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:26,658
Here,

574
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,952
the world inside the cartoon.

575
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,502
Hello, what's your emergency?

576
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,170
I have a tip about a murder suspect.

577
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:05,048
I'm listening.
Which murder case are you referring to?

578
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,510
I caught the killer of the shooting
at Channel W.

579
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:09,886
Please come arrest him.

580
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,888
Okay, please wait one moment.

581
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:16,518
The address is No. 815 Block 2,
Sungha Apartment, 216-13 Mungye,

582
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,728
Dobong, Seoul.

583
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:18,895
His name is Han Sang-hun.

584
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,981
We'll leave now and check.

585
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,568
Could you identify yourself?

586
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,902
I'm just a citizen.

587
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,489
Hello?

588
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,576
Sir, we received an important tip.

589
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,498
Which one of us will die first?

590
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,709
I think it'll be you.

591
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:46,089
Since I caught the killer,
it'll take some time for me to disappear.

592
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:48,592
I completed one
of the main character's tasks.

593
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:51,261
Asshole.

594
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,182
Rot in the detention center for a while.

595
00:48:55,932 --> 00:48:57,726
I'll think about how to kill you.

596
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,237
Is this...

597
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,573
Once you leave here,
go to the workroom and draw this.

598
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,368
I've re-assembled the tablet.

599
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,828
No. You already know.

600
00:49:58,245 --> 00:49:59,496
If I turn it on, the killer--

601
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,416
That's why we must catch
the killer so he won't roam free.

602
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,167
I'll stop him from getting his hands

603
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:06,211
on the tablet.

604
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,756
First, draw my getaway car.

605
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,709
Check his identity.

606
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,336
He looks like him.

607
00:50:49,171 --> 00:50:51,047
We caught the shooter.

608
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,424
Please send backup.

609
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,764
All right, that's enough.
Let's stop the interview now.

610
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,015
I'm a little tired.

611
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,393
Sir, the shooter has been caught.

612
00:51:03,477 --> 00:51:04,603
Wait a moment.

613
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,773
What do you mean? Where?

614
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:10,650
He was arrested in his apartment
in Dobong.

615
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,403
-How?
-Someone tipped the police.

616
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,822
What are you talking about? Who?

617
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,700
-What?
-Maybe it's Chul.

618
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,035
The man who called in the tip.

619
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,038
The police said his voice
was similar to his.

620
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,539
Maybe he's alive?

621
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,875
I think he's alive.

622
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,420
It's definitely Chul.

623
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:34,925
Perhaps. Let's not jump to conclusions.
We should find out.

624
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,218
Okay.

625
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,680
No way.

626
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,077
It can't be. He was there for sure.

627
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,894
At around 10:30 p.m. today,

628
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,731
the suspect who shot ten people to death
at Channel W's studio

629
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,692
was arrested in his home.

630
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,653
The suspect hasn't been identified yet.

631
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,739
A courageous citizen tipped the police.

632
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,576
The anonymous citizen went
into the suspect's house,

633
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:44,619
and after a fight, he called...

634
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,747
The second thing you must draw is...

635
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,749
my dead, decaying body.

636
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:27,245
Chul, where are you?

637
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,915
-What do you mean?
-Did you see the news?

638
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:32,375
So-hee thinks you're the one
who caught the killer.

639
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,919
Yes, I caught him.

640
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,671
What? You did?

641
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,132
-But how?
-Do-yoon, listen carefully.

642
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:42,302
Go to my house where I was 15 days ago.

643
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,304
You'll find my body there.

644
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:47,891
What? What are you talking about?

645
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:50,435
Report it to the police
and let everyone know.

646
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,228
The body's DNA will match mine.

647
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,483
Do-yoon, I'm dead.

648
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,985
I was framed and shot, and died unjustly.

649
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,240
However, I'm still alive, so don't worry.

650
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:06,743
I thought you should know.

651
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:10,580
-Hey.
-It's better

652
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:12,457
that So-hee thinks I'm dead.

653
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,417
It's for her own good.

654
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,796
I'll call you later.

655
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,102
Then,

656
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,479
what about So-hee?

657
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,148
If it's a happy ending for us,

658
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:39,484
she'll disappear again.

659
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:42,529
-I'll create a variable for her.
-A variable?

660
00:54:42,862 --> 00:54:46,658
I can't accept the fact that
there's only one reason for our existence.

661
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,453
When there's a variable,
the direction of one's life changes,

662
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,165
like how I met you.

663
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,761
If her fate is determined only
because she's one of the characters,

664
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:07,929
we'll free her.

665
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,558
Do-yoon, I'm going
to the police station now.

666
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,812
I heard the voice, and I think it's him,

667
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,105
so I'm...

668
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:20,984
What?

669
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:23,611
He's dead?

670
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,280
I'm going to get rid

671
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:27,323
of So-hee's character set up.

672
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:45,759
Today on the 23rd,

673
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,345
a dead body found in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi,

674
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:52,599
was identified by the police
as being that of Kang Chul.

675
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,893
On the 22nd of last month,

676
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:58,605
Kang was on the run under the charge
of killing the director of WBN.

677
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:02,108
After 33 days on the run,
he was found dead.

678
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,737
Kang was shot
by the police while fleeing...

679
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,869
How will you come back?

680
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,955
Once you leave now, it's over.

681
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,585
You can't come back here.

682
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,338
I think I can.

683
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,549
It was only possible
when you became aware.

684
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:29,469
That means you have to come back
after losing all of your memories.

685
00:56:30,011 --> 00:56:32,222
-Then, a dream--
-I don't want dreams anymore.

686
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,057
What do you plan to do then?

687
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:36,726
I think I can do it. Wait for me here.

688
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:40,688
You said that last time too.

689
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,024
You said to wait
until the operation was over,

690
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,609
but you disappeared.

691
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,736
That's Kang Chul in the cartoon.

692
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,241
There's one more thing
I would like you to draw.

693
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:54,994
It's too expensive here
and I couldn't afford it.

694
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,139
Draw me the ring I lost.

695
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,128
My second hypothesis is,

696
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,964
I was called in from reality.

697
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,259
Therefore, when the mission
in one chapter is accomplished,

698
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,844
I shall

699
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,304
go back.

700
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,310
TO BE CONTINUED

701
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,846
KANG CHUL

702
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,017
Hello?

703
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:45,897
I came back.

704
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,233
Where are you?

705
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,527
I'm coming to you now.

706
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,950
Get ready to finish our date.

707
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,744
Let's finish our five kisses today.

708
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,455
What?

709
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:04,499
I can't stand losing.

710
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,418
I can't let your ex-husband defeat me.

711
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,964
That's a strange competition.

712
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,966
Are you competing with someone?

713
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,180
You'll find out soon that I'm much better.

714
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,719
Oh Yeon-joo again!
The character I'm tired of

715
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:58,803
appeared again.

716
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,639
W is no longer a masterpiece.
I've dumped it.

717
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,017
Hope makes me imagine again.

718
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,685
As Chul came back to me,

719
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,520
W ended with a happy ending.

720
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,188
I heard Han Sang-hun escaped from prison.

721
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,691
You're Chul's family. My purpose
of existence is to get rid of you.

722
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,401
Who told you to be
the main female character?

723
01:00:13,484 --> 01:00:14,819
Did you expect a happy ending?

724
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,781
What happened to the woman who was here?

725
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:22,869
The real last chapter of W begins.

726
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,042
