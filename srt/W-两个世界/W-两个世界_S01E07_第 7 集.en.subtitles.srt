1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,164
With sales totaling ten million copies...

2
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:40,373
-Thank you.
-Sure.

3
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,751
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

4
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,718
The main character, Kang Chul,
learns from Oh Yeon-joo

5
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,387
that he's a main character of a cartoon.

6
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,514
Chul comes out into Yeon-joo's real world.

7
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,974
You must have created me here.

8
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,477
With your pen in hand.

9
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,146
He tries to get his life back.

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,484
Through Oh Seong-moo, he realizes

11
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:10,361
that his life is a fiction
created by the author.

12
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,201
Finally,

13
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:19,120
in order to create
a logical ending to his life,

14
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,622
he chooses death.

15
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,794
And that very moment, the cartoon W ends.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:26,795
THE END

17
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,129
After two months,

18
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,507
Yeon-joo, who couldn't forget Chul,

19
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,968
accidentally finds out
that Chul is not dead.

20
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,723
Please save him. He can still be saved.

21
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,184
What do you mean? Isn't it over?

22
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:44,187
Time didn't pass. It had stopped.

23
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:47,565
"The end" meant that time stopped
in the last scene.

24
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,776
He's still in the river right now,
suspended in time.

25
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,277
THE END

26
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,738
TO BE CONTINUED

27
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,704
I don't want ramen.

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,414
Forget the ramen.

29
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:05,792
Do you remember?

30
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,335
I think

31
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,797
I heard it from Mr. Oh
a really long time ago.

32
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,216
Something about W.

33
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,009
That you...

34
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,221
That you created it.

35
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,640
He said Kang Chul's character

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,684
was created by you.

37
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,479
-What do you mean?
-He said

38
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:31,651
that he based W on a story
you wrote as a kid. Don't you remember?

39
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:38,241
That's 9.7. She lost it.

40
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,202
Firing point 1, 9.7.

41
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,538
Oh, there she goes.

42
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,791
No way! I can't believe it!

43
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,459
We should've won!

44
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,794
You brats.

45
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,130
Keep it down!

46
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:58,136
I told you. Lower the volume.

47
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,763
Mom, this is an important moment.
Come here.

48
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,307
Did we win the gold medal?

49
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:06,311
We were winning the whole time,
but it just became a tie.

50
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,855
By the way, isn't she absolutely gorgeous?

51
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,607
She's only in high school,
but she's awesome.

52
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,650
She's shooting.

53
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,904
What do we do, Yeon-joo?
I think my heart will burst.

54
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:21,117
Let's see how it goes.

55
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,703
Nancy Johnson, the American shooter...

56
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,288
We lost it!

57
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,206
-No way!
-I don't believe it.

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,583
What a shame.

59
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,460
She must've been nervous
because she's young.

60
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,338
-Let's go together.
-Let's eat.

61
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,216
We're doomed. It's such a shame.

62
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,637
-Isn't she pretty?
-She's seriously pretty.

63
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,056
I thought we would win the gold!

64
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,474
Seriously.

65
00:03:55,526 --> 00:03:57,946
He's an 18-year-old high school junior.

66
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,656
High school junior.

67
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,952
He's on the National Shooting Team.

68
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,416
Height, 180cm tall.

69
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,337
No, make it 185cm.

70
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,340
His name...

71
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,467
What should I name him?

72
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,052
Yeon-joo.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,019
-Your friend Seul-a called.
-Oh, thanks.

74
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,944
-Hello?
-Hey, are you done?

75
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,698
I should call and tell the teacher
that I can't finish by tomorrow.

76
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,909
-I didn't do it either. I'm busy.
-What are you doing?

77
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,954
I finally found the man of my dreams.

78
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,331
Gosh, did that change again?

79
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,792
No, it's for real this time.

80
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,377
Listen.

81
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,299
He's a high school student,
but he's on the National Shooting Team.

82
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,593
He comes from behind to win
a competition with his final shot.

83
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,555
And he's a genius too.
He's a good student and a good athlete.

84
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,726
He's over 185cm tall.
He's thin but a bit muscular.

85
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,811
He's very sweet.

86
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,688
He's kind and funny too.

87
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,732
He sounds amazing.

88
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,734
Who is it? Does he go to our school?

89
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,071
-No.
-Then which school is he from?

90
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,740
Let me see his face.

91
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,826
You can't see his face.

92
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,953
You can't meet him.

93
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,666
Okay.

94
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,377
See you tomorrow. Bye.

95
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,764
HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR,
NATIONAL SHOOTING TEAM

96
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,959
-How is it going--
-Don't look! Don't!

97
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,213
I didn't look. What's wrong with you?

98
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,465
But Yeon-joo, I need to see it.

99
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,468
I have to see it
to tell you anything. Fine.

100
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,804
I need to see it. Let me see.

101
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,311
That's a new character!

102
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,687
He's nothing like Chul.

103
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,815
It's too difficult.

104
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,025
I can't draw this.

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,653
Mr. Oh said you drew well.

106
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,780
I heard you wanted
to be a cartoonist once.

107
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:47,448
I haven't drawn in ages.

108
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,368
And I'm not used to this pen.

109
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,245
We didn't have this before.

110
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,789
If you can't do it, just give up.

111
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,499
-When Mr. Oh comes back--
-Hey.

112
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,794
Don't say anything to my dad.

113
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,797
I'll save him.

114
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,967
I'm going to save Chul.

115
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,053
Gosh.

116
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,849
Not everyone can draw a cartoon.
Good luck.

117
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,837
LIFE IS SOMETIMES...

118
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,966
-Someone jumped off.
-He fell in the water.

119
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,885
-Hurry and rescue him.
-Okay.

120
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,170
She's here!

121
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,048
The one who broke out is here!

122
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,133
Over here!

123
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,719
Freeze! Don't move.

124
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,248
Yes. They say he isn't hurt.

125
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,585
I don't know either.
I'll let you know when he wakes up.

126
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,591
There's no need for you
to come over right now.

127
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,220
He's awake. I'll call you back.

128
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,222
What happened?

129
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,435
Explain why you went to the Han River
and why you fell off that bridge.

130
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,020
Someone pushed you, right?

131
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,356
Why on earth did you go there
in the middle of the night?

132
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,442
What happened?

133
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,778
That's what I'm asking you.

134
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,199
What's the date today?

135
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,828
What did I do today?

136
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,830
-I don't know when it started--
-What's with you?

137
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,082
You don't remember?

138
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,669
You suddenly disappeared
after you visited Yeon-joo.

139
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,130
Everyone was busy looking for Yeon-joo
after she broke out,

140
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,840
and you were missing all day.

141
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,926
I tried to find you,
but you didn't answer your phone.

142
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,639
Then I got a call from the police
that you fell off a bridge.

143
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,976
Why did you go to the Han River
at that hour and fall off a bridge?

144
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,186
What's going on?

145
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,939
Yeon-joo was...

146
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,484
-You're awake.
-What about Yeon-joo?

147
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,486
What happened to you at the river?

148
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,945
What were you going to say?

149
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,989
They found Yeon-joo.

150
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,619
-Did they catch her?
-They just called. They caught her.

151
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,371
That's a relief.

152
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,290
They would've blamed us
if she wasn't found.

153
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,335
-Where was she?
-She was in the detention center.

154
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,836
What do you mean?

155
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,464
They couldn't find her but she was inside?

156
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,343
Where are you going?

157
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,637
Where are you going this late?

158
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,682
Tell them I need to see her right now.

159
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,701
Oh, the suspect who escaped
from Seoul Detention Center yesterday

160
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:46,664
and caused a disturbance
was caught a while ago.

161
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:50,459
The police expected the suspect
to flee into the city, but it appears

162
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,170
that she was hiding inside
the detention center when she was caught.

163
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:56,841
She was arrested and is being taken
to Seoul Jungbu Police Station,

164
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,343
where the interrogation is expected
to continue through the night.

165
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,744
Mr. Kang?

166
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,917
-Good evening.
-You must've heard the news.

167
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:34,670
We're taking the suspect
to Jungbu Police Station.

168
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,673
-You may--
-I'm sorry, but I need to talk to her now.

169
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:39,216
Wait. I can't let you do that.

170
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,428
-Please make an official request--
-It won't take long.

171
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,270
Please give me five minutes.

172
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:23,594
Are you okay?

173
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,475
I wondered what happens after a person
jumps off a bridge. You seem fine.

174
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:36,190
-How--
-How are you still alive?

175
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,360
When you threw yourself from the bridge,

176
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,988
a police boat happened to be
passing under that very bridge.

177
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,407
An even bigger coincidence was that...

178
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,494
there were two divers on that boat.

179
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,122
The moment you fell, the divers
went in the water and saved you

180
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,541
right before you stopped breathing.

181
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,709
You were so lucky.

182
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,587
I can't believe that someone
can be that lucky.

183
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,592
What about your father?

184
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:07,888
He's alive.

185
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,684
Two months have passed over there.

186
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,894
He has healed and is on a trip.

187
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,439
Don't tell me

188
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,359
that your father saved me.

189
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:22,695
It wasn't my dad.

190
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
I brought you back to life.

191
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,785
I'm the one who saved you.

192
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,287
Which means

193
00:14:32,162 --> 00:14:33,372
this would be

194
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,334
the third time you owe me your life.

195
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,629
How did you do it?

196
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,172
Do you want to know?

197
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,717
Answer my question first,

198
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,135
then I'll tell you.

199
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,513
You keep copying what I've said before.

200
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,223
If you lost your goal in life,

201
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,100
you can set a new goal.

202
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,436
Don't think about jumping off a bridge
and dying.

203
00:14:56,478 --> 00:15:00,357
How can taking revenge
be your only goal in life?

204
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,236
If you're not sure what to do
with your life,

205
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,906
I can tell you what you should do
right now.

206
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952
Get me out of here.

207
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,122
Not the way I escaped before, but legally.

208
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,624
Get me out legally.

209
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,336
I don't want to be chased by the police
every time I come to see you.

210
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:28,594
You said you owe me your life,
but you've done nothing for me.

211
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,889
You know what an ungrateful person
you are, right?

212
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:36,518
I want you to pay me back from now on.

213
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,855
Do everything in your power
to save me from this.

214
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,651
You're a competent man, right?

215
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,365
If you want to know how I saved you,

216
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,367
get me out of here first.

217
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,203
I'll tell you after I'm out
of the detention center.

218
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,791
Get out someone who broke out of jail?

219
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,793
Do you think that's easy?

220
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,671
It's not easy,
so you should hit the ground running.

221
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,005
Don't think about anything else.

222
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,095
Mr. Kang, we can't delay any longer.

223
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,388
I'm going.

224
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,765
Also,

225
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,519
your life going forward
isn't my dad's work anymore.

226
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,105
That part's already completely over.

227
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,606
From now on,

228
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,486
let's think of this
as a sequel we're making together.

229
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,907
My dad and I don't have the same taste.

230
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,536
I hate things like murder, revenge,
gunfights, or thrillers.

231
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,538
What I like is...

232
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,125
sweet romance.

233
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,130
We need to go now.

234
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:17,244
EMERGENCY TRANSPORT

235
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,707
-I'm sorry.
-If you want to visit her,

236
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,751
come to the police station
tomorrow morning.

237
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,627
Okay, I'll do that.

238
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,222
Mr. Kang.

239
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:19,848
Where have you been?

240
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,615
YOON SO-HEE,
CHUL'S FRIEND AND PERSONAL ASSISTANT

241
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,623
Chul.

242
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,919
Where have you been?

243
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,256
What's wrong?

244
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,216
SEO DO-YOON

245
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,385
SEO DO-YOON, CHUL'S BODYGUARD

246
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,975
Call the legal team for me.

247
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,354
It's regarding Yeon-joo.

248
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,361
Can't you hear me?
I asked where you were hiding!

249
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:57,863
Why won't you answer me?

250
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:03,660
Say something, would you?
Just say anything!

251
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,497
Shit! She's at it again.

252
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,374
What the hell is her problem?

253
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,045
-Sir.
-She looks normal enough.

254
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,963
Why is she doing this to me?

255
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,507
Forget it. She needs a psychiatric test.

256
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:20,052
If I talk to her any longer,
I'll lose my mind.

257
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,261
He's here.

258
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,013
Really?

259
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,603
Hello.

260
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,357
I heard you were coming yourself,
so I chose this spot for the visit.

261
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,317
It's more comfortable here.

262
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,070
I'm sorry for continuing
to break the rules.

263
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,655
Not at all.

264
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,033
You're practically an adviser
for the police.

265
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,660
Would you like some coffee?

266
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,370
I'm good, thank you.

267
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,290
We've turned off the cameras.
Please speak comfortably.

268
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,934
You came early.

269
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,272
Did you find a way for me
to get out already?

270
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,984
You said it won't be easy to get me out
since I broke out of jail.

271
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,904
I guess you really are capable
of anything.

272
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,406
Who do you think you are?

273
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,955
Who are you to decide
what to do with my life?

274
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,581
Who gave you the right?

275
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,797
I don't think I need you to tell me
how you saved me.

276
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,676
You must have drawn me yourself.

277
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,971
I don't know why, but you must have.

278
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,307
Maybe it's possible
since you're his daughter.

279
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,017
I honestly don't care.

280
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,893
However,

281
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,273
do you think it's your right
to draw and save me?

282
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,818
Why did you save me when I chose to die?

283
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,486
Who do you think you are?

284
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,363
Are you the Creator?

285
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,492
You tried to kill me
when I desperately wanted to live,

286
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,329
but you saved me when I wanted to die.

287
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,706
Are you playing games?

288
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,585
Is it thrilling and fun for you people?

289
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,507
How...

290
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,968
How could you say that?

291
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,595
Why would I--

292
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,389
You probably thought
that I would thank you for saving me.

293
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,893
A sequel?

294
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:35,103
Did you say a sequel?

295
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,689
You like sweet romance,

296
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,775
so you want to play with me?

297
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,945
What can I say?

298
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,408
You can just come here and have fun
when you're bored,

299
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,660
then return to your real world after.

300
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,081
Did you save me for your romance?

301
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,541
Am I some kind of toy?

302
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,086
How...

303
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:04,216
How could you take it that way?

304
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,095
How do you expect me to live?

305
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,307
Do you know where I just came from?

306
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,823
KANG YUN

307
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,414
You have both your mother and your father,

308
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,959
but I don't.

309
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,629
I used to think they passed away,

310
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,757
but they never existed.

311
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,013
I was born alone as an orphan

312
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,392
at the tip of an alcoholic man's pen.

313
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,063
Why

314
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,732
have I been sad?

315
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,943
What did I long for?

316
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,656
Don't get ahead of yourself.

317
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,951
You must feel proud of yourself,
but don't.

318
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,913
What you did was useless.
I'm not grateful.

319
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,000
Why did you create a sequel?
Like I would want to continue this life?

320
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,764
I did a useless thing.

321
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,934
Do you realize now

322
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,103
that you've made a mistake?

323
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,773
Yes.

324
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,942
I realize that now.

325
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,487
Why did I even bother,
just to get chewed out?

326
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:53,617
I shouldn't have cared
even if you stayed in the water forever.

327
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:59,873
Why did I work so hard all by myself
these past two months?

328
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,710
Exactly.

329
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,337
Why did you?

330
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,007
You should have kept working
at the hospital, dated,

331
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,050
and lived your life.

332
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,259
Why did you do this?

333
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,887
Why did you hold onto this lousy cartoon

334
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,306
-and come here handcuffed--
-Because I love you!

335
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,686
I know it doesn't make sense,

336
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,857
but I really fell in love with you.

337
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,989
I love you.

338
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,287
Do you realize you're ridiculous?

339
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,706
I love you.

340
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,333
You know that doesn't work on me.

341
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,836
Because I love you!

342
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:30,208
You were being so cocky,
as if you would never get swayed,

343
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,669
but those words were all it took?

344
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,424
Don't be so hard on me.

345
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,843
I don't come here because I want to.

346
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,679
I get dragged in here
because you keep thinking about me.

347
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,098
You thought about me in the water
and even now.

348
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,937
Am I wrong?

349
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,442
You're right.

350
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,113
I was afraid.

351
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,741
Of what?

352
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,745
I was afraid I would never see you again.

353
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,475
Oh, my.

354
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:38,568
Are you sure this is okay?
I think the detective saw us.

355
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,445
I don't care.

356
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:07,180
We're making arrangements. Don't worry.

357
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,557
Is he still talking to her?

358
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,353
Did Mr. Kang know the suspect?

359
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:14,896
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

360
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,148
That's not possible.

361
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,817
They seemed close.

362
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:24,155
And not just close.
They seemed very close.

363
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,633
If I were to pick the happiest moment
during the 30 years I've been alive,

364
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:50,181
shockingly enough, I'd pick that night
that I was lying alone in the cell.

365
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,602
I feel sorry to my mom, but that was...

366
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,442
I wonder if she's home.

367
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,986
Yeon-joo.

368
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,450
She's not home yet? What time is it?

369
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,287
Oh, my gosh. Why isn't she home yet?

370
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,498
I completely forgot about my mom
who would be waiting for me.

371
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,587
-My gosh.
-Who was it?

372
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,922
Was it you?

373
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,259
How can you be eating snacks
when someone is dying?

374
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,929
I didn't care if I couldn't work
at the hospital anymore.

375
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,561
My life suddenly felt unrealistic,

376
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,565
and I started getting delusional
and thought

377
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,903
that this moment
and my life here was real.

378
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,074
Prisoner 4205, you have a visitor.

379
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,577
Okay.

380
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,045
-Where's Mr. Kang?
-He's busy. Please sit.

381
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,595
-He wanted me to deliver his message.
-His message?

382
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,348
He'll walk you through
the legal issues later.

383
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:16,142
Mr. Kang wanted me
to tell you this exactly.

384
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,065
I found out that there are many types
of sweet romance that girls like.

385
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,109
-What?
-Tell her to narrow it down

386
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,402
so I can pay her back.

387
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:32,450
Number one, a Cinderella story
with fancy parties.

388
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,702
-What?
-Number two,

389
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:36,955
a romantic trip to the country.

390
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,000
Number three, a simple romance
within everyday life.

391
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:47,423
What on earth is this?

392
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,426
Right. I'll add one more.

393
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,306
Number four, a bold and sexy

394
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,226
erotica. Oh, yeah.

395
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,439
-What?
-Mr. Kang wanted me to tell you

396
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,316
he personally prefers number four.

397
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,445
Please pick one. Which one would you like?

398
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,781
Pick what? What is this?

399
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,575
You told him to pay you back
for saving his life with sweet romance.

400
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,577
No. That's not what I meant.

401
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,455
This feels like business, asking me
to choose one of those options.

402
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,750
I didn't ask him to come up
with a business plan.

403
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,711
This is how he deals with things.

404
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,588
You should pick one
so we can make preparations.

405
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:30,008
Are you seriously

406
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,927
-telling me to choose one?
-Yes.

407
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,851
-What was number four?
-A bold and sexy--

408
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,769
No, not that one.

409
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:43,396
-Maybe number one?
-Sure.

410
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,982
-A Cinderella story with fancy parties.
-No.

411
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,068
-How about number three?
-A simple romance within everyday life.

412
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,278
Wait, hold on.

413
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,866
Fancy parties sound interesting too.

414
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,409
-Is it number one, then?
-Hang on.

415
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,411
Gosh, you're so impatient.

416
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,832
Number three?

417
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,251
That's four fingers.

418
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,881
Number three?

419
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,383
Number three? All right.

420
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,010
I'll let Mr. Kang know.

421
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,888
Wait.

422
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,057
I'm still stuck in here.

423
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,893
-Why are you telling me that--
-You'll be out soon.

424
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,354
-How?
-Our attorney will explain that.

425
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,616
PRESIDENT KANG CHUL

426
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,085
Sir, Mr. Son is here.

427
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,296
Mr. Son.

428
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,925
Please come in.
Why are you standing like that?

429
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,723
You're getting married?

430
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,559
Married?

431
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,894
Just on paper.

432
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:08,648
We're arranging papers so it would appear
that you married him last year in the US.

433
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,234
Married? Not going to get married,

434
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:13,778
but we're already married? Me?

435
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,863
Yes. You have two problems.

436
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,740
One is that you can't identify yourself.

437
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,951
The other is that you ran away
without giving your statement.

438
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,954
You were with Mr. Kang on the roof
when he was attacked.

439
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:25,706
You should state that you ran away
because you were afraid

440
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,251
your secret marriage with Mr. Kang
would be revealed.

441
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,962
It's the most convincing alibi
and it guarantees your identity.

442
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,886
Are you really going to register
your marriage with Yeon-joo?

443
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,763
I think I'll have to.

444
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,516
That's the only way to get her out.

445
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,184
I know you have to prove her identity,

446
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,853
but registering her as your wife
is too much.

447
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,729
If you legally become a married couple,

448
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,274
there is no escaping it.

449
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,819
If I can't escape,
then I'll just live with her.

450
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,612
You know nothing about her.

451
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,948
How are you going to deal
with your assets later?

452
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,616
I know her identity

453
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,244
and assets don't mean anything.

454
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,704
What?

455
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,375
Assets don't mean anything to me now.

456
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,211
That's why I wanted to see you.

457
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,755
I want to stop looking
for the real killer now.

458
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,551
I'm giving up on finding the real killer.

459
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,553
I want you to quit as well.

460
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,471
What are you talking about?

461
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,849
That is also meaningless now.

462
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,893
I have no right to.

463
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:34,275
You said something to me last time

464
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,194
after you visited Yeon-joo.

465
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:40,406
I know you said something to me back then.

466
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,951
I heard it, but I don't remember
what it was.

467
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:46,370
You told me

468
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,623
that there are moments
you don't quite remember.

469
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,877
I understand what you meant.
I experienced it myself.

470
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,296
I was definitely on the phone with you,

471
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,051
but when I came to my senses,

472
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,178
I couldn't remember what came next.

473
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,931
Then you went missing all day.

474
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,766
Yes.

475
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,685
Did you go to another dimension?

476
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,812
Yes.

477
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,731
Where is it?

478
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,317
I can't tell you.

479
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,653
-Why not?
-If I tell you,

480
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,821
it would be too hard for you.

481
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,615
You wouldn't be able to bear it.

482
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,034
That's why I can't tell you.

483
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,329
You're so frustrating.
I came all the way here,

484
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,831
-yet you can't tell me anything?
-Yes.

485
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,416
I can never tell you.

486
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,752
I can tell you two things though.

487
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,296
I know who Yeon-joo is.

488
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,215
Thankfully, she's not a strange lunatic.

489
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,467
There would be no problem
if she becomes my wife.

490
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,262
I'm just worried she won't always
stay beside me.

491
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:49,308
And I no longer need to find the killer.

492
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,270
Please don't ask me why.

493
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,857
The W Project ends here.

494
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,531
Then just tell me this.

495
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,950
Why did you go to the Han River?

496
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,744
Why did you fall in?

497
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,669
I wanted to die.

498
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,382
I didn't know how to continue living.

499
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,554
I still don't know that,

500
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:30,891
but I kind of feel like living.

501
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:37,356
So I have to think more
about what to do from now on.

502
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,364
You're a third generation Korean-American.

503
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,952
You first met Mr. Kang, who was
on a business trip, in May 2015

504
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:54,040
and got married in Chicago
in September, correct?

505
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,377
-Yes.
-At the time of arrest,

506
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:03,382
you were living with Mr. Kang
in the penthouse of Seoul Prime Hotel.

507
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,676
-Yes.
-After he was attacked,

508
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,720
you ran away because

509
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:12,683
you two were in the middle of a fight
and were considering divorce.

510
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,936
Mr. Kang testified you didn't
want the press to find out

511
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,064
that you two were married.
Is that correct?

512
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,524
Yes.

513
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,822
Put the ring on first.

514
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,951
-Is this a wedding ring?
-Yes.

515
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,205
A lot of people are watching you,
so wear it from now on.

516
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,631
Let's go.

517
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,968
Put this on.

518
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,303
Why?

519
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,971
You'll know once we're outside.

520
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,042
She's here.

521
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,877
-Welcome, Madam.
-Welcome, Madam.

522
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,216
Madam?

523
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,302
They've been waiting for you.

524
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,720
Say hello.

525
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,475
They are the security team.
Mr. Park, Mr. Yoon, and Mr. Oh.

526
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,477
-You recognize them, right?
-Yes.

527
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:41,063
And they are the hotel staff.

528
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,816
-It's nice to meet you.
-It's nice to meet you.

529
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,526
It's nice to meet you too.

530
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:53,492
Hey, I know the situation,
but do you seriously want me

531
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,662
to stay here in the same room with Chul?

532
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:59,415
Yes, you're married.
Of course, you should share a room.

533
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:01,834
The workers are watching.

534
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,919
But even so, it's a little--

535
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,173
I prepared you a bath, Madam.

536
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:11,510
You should wash up and rest.
Mr. Kang will come home at night.

537
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,944
I'm married?

538
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,244
WHO IS OH, KANG'S SECRET WIFE?

539
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,082
MYSTERY OF THE SECRET MARRIAGE,
A KOREAN-AMERICAN?

540
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,251
Oh, my gosh.

541
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,588
WHO IS KANG'S WOMAN?

542
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:55,054
KANG CHUL SECRETLY MARRIED
TO A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

543
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,599
Am I...

544
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,726
really married?

545
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,740
I feel much better after the shower.

546
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,332
Thank you.

547
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:08,919
Everything is in pairs.

548
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,947
So it was number four.

549
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,908
Number four is your style.

550
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,078
A bold and sexy erotica.

551
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:44,538
Right?

552
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:48,542
-When did you come?
-You said it was number three.

553
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,254
Are you sure you like simple romance?

554
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,881
I don't think so.

555
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:59,136
I... I was just checking what that was.
I didn't know what it was.

556
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:00,179
Really?

557
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,890
I'm sure men's underwear exists
in the other world as well.

558
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,059
Just let it slide.

559
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:08,228
-Should I?
-Let it slide!

560
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:11,690
We haven't seen each other for days.
Stop teasing me.

561
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,570
-Why are you smiling?
-I'm happy to see you.

562
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,993
Whatever. You didn't even come
to visit once.

563
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,662
I was too busy.

564
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:28,123
It turns out getting married
unexpectedly is tough.

565
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,585
I had to create a scandal
and match it with my schedule,

566
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,671
and I had to memorize it to testify.

567
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,465
I know. You went too far.

568
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:40,844
I said I like sweet romance.
I never said I wanted to get married.

569
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,430
We can start doing sweet things now.

570
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:44,848
I studied hard.

571
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:48,519
-You studied?
-That's right.

572
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:50,521
I had something to do here.

573
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,980
Stay right there.

574
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,157
What's wrong with my heart?

575
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,210
What's going on?

576
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,005
-Oh, dear!
-Don't come out.

577
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:19,466
Have a seat.

578
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,143
I've never done this,
so I'm not sure if it'll work.

579
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,228
What is it?

580
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,148
It said to tie your hair.

581
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,401
-What?
-I asked the female staff

582
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,819
and they got me this book.

583
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:42,281
The book lists the sweet and simple
romantic things women love.

584
00:45:43,532 --> 00:45:44,575
What?

585
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,368
-Stay still.
-Oh, dear.

586
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:47,953
What are you doing?

587
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,874
-You're really doing this?
-Yes.

588
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,173
LOVE IS...

589
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,428
You studied with this book?

590
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:07,347
I had to study. I knew nothing.

591
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,725
You told me to pay back my debt,
but I knew nothing.

592
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,268
Studying is my forte.

593
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,150
-By the way, do you really like this?
-What?

594
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,735
Is this sweet?

595
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,613
I love it.

596
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,491
You do? I'm glad.

597
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,203
This is interesting. How is this sweet?

598
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,833
I can tell you majored in engineering.

599
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,543
What's wrong?

600
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:38,629
It's your first time doing this, right?

601
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,256
Yes.

602
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,594
I never thought you were like this.
I have never seen this side of you.

603
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,222
Pick other things that you want to do.

604
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,350
If we try hard, we can finish
ten things a day.

605
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,227
This isn't homework.

606
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,979
Shouldn't we do a lot while we can?

607
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,232
We don't know when we will part again.

608
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,331
Don't look at me like that.
You might disappear.

609
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,544
Something must be wrong with my heart.
I get swayed easily.

610
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,172
So don't cry or suddenly say you love me

611
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,799
if you want to stay with me
for a long time.

612
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,891
I give up.

613
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:34,226
It's too difficult.

614
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,313
Let's say I did one though,
since I did tie it.

615
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:39,606
Okay.

616
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:43,110
Good job.

617
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,657
What else shall we do?
There's still time until dinner.

618
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:55,289
You shouldn't read books like that.

619
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:57,207
Come with me.

620
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,634
What are we going to do?

621
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,138
Goodness.

622
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:14,224
What are you doing?

623
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,745
Lie down.

624
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:35,996
What?

625
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:38,999
Oh, my gosh.

626
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,668
It says to read like this.

627
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,547
Page 172.

628
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,466
Here it is.

629
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:51,470
Did you memorize the pages?

630
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,097
I told you I studied a lot.

631
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,350
See what else is here.

632
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,312
There's also grocery shopping together.

633
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:03,273
Do women really find
grocery shopping sweet?

634
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,275
It's totally sweet

635
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:09,613
when the man carries the basket
and talk about what to make.

636
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,865
Then let's go grocery shopping later.

637
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:13,867
For real?

638
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,622
How about tying your shoes?

639
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:19,790
How nice.

640
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,712
How about this?

641
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,179
I would love that.

642
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,936
How about this?

643
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,696
This one is easy.

644
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,707
You're not doing homework
to pay me back, are you?

645
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:03,250
And if I'm not?

646
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:06,545
I think you're enjoying it more.

647
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,257
No way.

648
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,346
Mr. Kang.

649
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:21,977
Don't you know how to knock?

650
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:24,855
I'm sorry. I'm not used
to the fact that you're married.

651
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:26,690
What is it?

652
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,443
Mr. Seo would like to see you
in the rooftop garden.

653
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,739
-Why didn't he come in?
-I don't know, sir.

654
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:35,782
All right.

655
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:49,087
Mark the ones that you want to do today.

656
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,550
I keep telling you,
but I like adult romance.

657
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,234
My heart hurts.

658
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,508
RESTRICTED NUMBER

659
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,718
Hello?

660
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,678
Hello--

661
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:40,597
Where are you?

662
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,726
How did you come back to life?

663
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,782
Mr. Kang, is there something wrong?

664
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,200
No, it's fine.

665
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,703
Why did you press the emergency button?

666
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,705
I pressed it by mistake.

667
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,290
Okay, sir.

668
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,640
-Do-yoon.
-Chul.

669
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,392
I need you to trace a call.

670
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,520
-Which number?
-A call I received five minutes ago.

671
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:31,189
Find the number that called. It's strange.

672
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,607
Okay.

673
00:52:34,317 --> 00:52:36,111
Why didn't you come into the room?

674
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,738
I couldn't say it in front of Yeon-joo.

675
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,198
What's going on?

676
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,328
RESIGNATION LETTER

677
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:46,955
So-hee turned in her resignation.

678
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:51,585
I saw her earlier today.
She told me to give it to you.

679
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,803
I understand how you feel,

680
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,306
but you should talk to Chul in person.

681
00:53:04,389 --> 00:53:05,599
I don't want to.

682
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,225
I can't do it.

683
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,189
I don't want to see him.

684
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,611
Can you give it to him instead?

685
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,780
It's a fake marriage. You know that.

686
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,576
Do you really think so?

687
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,413
I don't think it is.

688
00:53:29,623 --> 00:53:31,041
Even if it isn't,

689
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,919
keep your personal feelings out of work.

690
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,174
I guess I'm not very professional.

691
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:42,385
I can't continue
being his personal assistant

692
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,971
and see that woman.

693
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:49,726
Tell her to take a few days off.

694
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,395
I'll go see her.

695
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:53,897
Okay.

696
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,108
By the way...

697
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,153
Shit.

698
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,656
Just listen, okay?

699
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,616
It's very strange.

700
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,789
I'm sorry.

701
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,458
Thank you for everything.

702
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,585
You'll be back anyway.

703
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,880
I don't think so.

704
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,801
Let's shake hands.

705
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,608
What...

706
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,485
What's wrong?

707
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,326
-Her hand disappeared?
-Like a ghost.

708
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,413
It suddenly went translucent like a ghost.

709
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,123
It's absurd,

710
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,375
but I know what I saw.

711
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:56,960
Shit.

712
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,295
Have I lost my mind?

713
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,517
Mr. Kang, what about dinner?

714
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,102
Please prepare it. We'll eat.

715
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,604
Your wife has fallen asleep.

716
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,898
-She's asleep?
-Yes.

717
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,078
She must have been tired.

718
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,789
I'll eat with her once she wakes up.

719
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,332
You'll be hungry.

720
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,168
-It's all right.
-Yes, sir.

721
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,395
LOVE IS...

722
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,149
She marked a lot.

723
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,948
RESTRICTED NUMBER

724
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:25,799
Hello?

725
00:56:25,882 --> 00:56:27,008
Where are you?

726
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,136
How did you go back?

727
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,643
Who said you could die?

728
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,938
Do you know how long I've waited?

729
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,065
Who are you?

730
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,483
Who am I?

731
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,026
Don't you know me?

732
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:49,781
I killed your family

733
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,034
in your house ten years ago.

734
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,208
I don't have it.

735
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,835
There is no real killer.

736
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,630
It was just an initial set-up.

737
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:09,092
It was a set-up to make
the main character stronger.

738
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:11,928
Who...

739
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,514
are you?

740
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:17,767
I said I killed your parents and siblings

741
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,396
with just four shots.

742
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:23,940
I shot them right in the forehead.

743
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:27,694
I'm a sharpshooter just like you.

744
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,156
That's why you should find me.

745
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,409
Why would you die before finding me?
You can't die now.

746
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,870
This won't end

747
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,664
until you and I finish our business.

748
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,877
I see you have a new family now.

749
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,839
It's her turn now.

750
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:54,721
I'll put a bullet in her head.

751
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,348
Wait for it.

752
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:00,185
Hello?

753
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,030
THE REAL KILLER,
KILLED CHUL'S FAMILY

754
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,619
I don't die here.
I'm immortal in this world.

755
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:01,829
There is no principle without variables.

756
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,414
It's not normal for you to bleed.

757
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,583
It means you'll die if you get shot.

758
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,502
Does the real killer know me?

759
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,088
Is the killer in the outside world?

760
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,006
Promise me one thing.

761
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:15,843
When you leave this world again,
can you draw me something?

762
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,721
Draw a scene where I wake up
from the dream, okay?

763
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:20,890
Yeon-joo, forget me.

764
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,184
Character set-up, reason for existence.

765
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,187
It'll all be resolved if we return
to the time when we never met.

766
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:30,567
