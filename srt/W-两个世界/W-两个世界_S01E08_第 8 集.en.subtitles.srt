1
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,414
Chul is an uber-rich man
with a net worth of 800 billion won.

2
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,709
I'll create a crime-solving program
and search for the killer.

3
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,169
He founds broadcasting channel W

4
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:46,838
to look for the killer who murdered
his family ten years ago.

5
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,591
He is attacked

6
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,636
-and is critically injured.
-The police spotted Kang Chul...

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,306
Then Chul meets cartoonist Oh Seong-moo,

8
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,433
who created and destroyed his life.

9
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,519
-Draw the real killer's face.
-There is no real killer.

10
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:03,646
There he finds out that his life

11
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,691
is just fiction fabricated by the author.

12
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,694
He tries to end his own life.

13
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,865
You tried to kill me
when I desperately wanted to live,

14
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:16,242
but you saved me when I wanted to die.

15
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,912
Like I would want to continue this life?

16
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,455
Because I love you!

17
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,169
He is saved once again by Yeon-joo,

18
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,965
and realizes his true feelings for her.

19
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,425
You should just remain my friend.

20
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,677
You're fired.

21
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,054
Thank you for everything.

22
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,766
-Her hand disappeared?
-It's absurd, but I know what I saw.

23
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,436
Is this a wedding ring?

24
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,855
Goodness.

25
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,191
Oh, my gosh.

26
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,322
Chul is about to live
a happy second life with Yeon-joo.

27
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,366
I'll put a bullet in her head.

28
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,118
It's her turn now.

29
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,787
The killer he thought
didn't exist appears.

30
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,751
RESTRICTED NUMBER

31
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,391
Hello?

32
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,600
Where are you?

33
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,186
How did you go back?

34
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,525
Who said you could die?

35
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,653
Do you know how long I've waited?

36
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:37,365
-Who are you?
-Who am I?

37
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:38,867
Don't you know me?

38
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,620
I killed your family

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,291
in your house 10 years ago.

40
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,298
I don't have it. There is no real killer.

41
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,634
It was just an initial set-up.

42
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,804
It was a set-up to make
the main character stronger.

43
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:02,891
Who...

44
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,435
are you?

45
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,688
I said I killed your parents and siblings

46
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,942
with just four shots.

47
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,861
I shot them right in the forehead.

48
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:18,823
I'm a sharpshooter just like you.

49
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,160
That's why you should find me.

50
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,455
Why would you die before finding me?
You can't die now.

51
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:27,832
This won't end

52
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,668
until you and I finish our business.

53
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,714
I see you have a new family now.

54
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,760
It's her turn now.

55
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,308
I'll put a bullet in her head.

56
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:47,852
Wait for it.

57
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:49,896
Hello?

58
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,656
When did you get back?

59
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:09,666
What's wrong?

60
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,545
Why did

61
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,548
"The end" change to "To be continued"?

62
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
-What?
-You said it suddenly changed.

63
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,223
THE END

64
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,519
TO BE CONTINUED

65
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,774
You said you could save me

66
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,068
because the words changed.

67
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,196
I don't know. It just changed.

68
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,864
It just changed?

69
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:45,451
I thought there must be a reason
why it can't end yet.

70
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,161
I don't know what though.

71
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,499
What is it? Why are you asking me that?

72
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,629
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

73
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,048
I brought Madam's dress.

74
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,511
Okay.

75
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:08,975
A dress?

76
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,857
RESTRICTED NUMBER

77
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,294
This way, please.

78
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,424
-Hello, Madam.
-Hello, Madam.

79
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,633
Hello.

80
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,178
It's a pleasure to meet you.

81
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,513
Since we don't know your style yet,

82
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,600
we prepared dresses of different styles
for your choosing.

83
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,061
I see.

84
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,605
Over here, we have a bright pink dress.

85
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,066
If you prefer something simpler,
there's this striped dress.

86
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:58,983
Okay.

87
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,152
What is this?

88
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,112
You said parties sounded interesting too.

89
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,783
Number one, a Cinderella story
with fancy parties.

90
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,326
I heard you wanted that too.

91
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,954
I looked for a party
you can attend wearing a dress.

92
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,790
Luckily, I got invited to a state dinner.

93
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,333
A state dinner?

94
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,835
It's at the Blue House,
so pick a nice one.

95
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,795
The Blue House?

96
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,297
DO-YOON

97
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:24,092
Are you saying I'm going
to the Blue House?

98
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,096
For your information,
I like low-cut dresses.

99
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,853
I think this has the lowest neckline.

100
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:39,440
No, don't listen to him.
He's just kidding.

101
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,154
Did you look into it?

102
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:47,448
They can't trace the call.

103
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,993
They can't trace the call,
and the number doesn't exist.

104
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:52,870
It's strange.

105
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,456
Who was the call from?

106
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,254
I said I killed your parents and siblings

107
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,463
with just four shots.

108
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,091
I shot them right in the forehead.

109
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,636
I'm a sharpshooter just like you.

110
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,931
That's why you should find me.

111
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:15,101
Why would you die before finding me?
You can't die now.

112
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,147
Look into it more.

113
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:45,923
W Project, report number 353.

114
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,300
W PROJECT REPORTS

115
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,759
August 2016.

116
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,095
Written by Kang Chul.

117
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,433
I'm discarding all the reports
written so far.

118
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,686
From now on,
I will work on a new hypothesis.

119
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:00,897
The killer...

120
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,817
exists.

121
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,319
THE KILLER EXISTS.

122
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,077
The killer definitely exists.

123
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,787
However,

124
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,542
he lacks a physical body

125
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,794
since he wasn't given one.

126
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,551
Thus, he has neither
a face nor an identity.

127
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,763
-No.
-Shoot!

128
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,558
He was created only to kill my family.

129
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,562
Thus, he feels no guilt toward killing.

130
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,898
He doesn't feel sadness

131
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,691
or pleasure.

132
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,904
It's because he doesn't have
a personality.

133
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:53,658
Mom.

134
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,703
Dad...

135
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,207
His only role was to traumatize me...

136
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:07,380
and make me devote myself
to solving violent crimes.

137
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,092
RESTRICTED NUMBER

138
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,010
Hello?

139
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:14,971
Hello...

140
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:16,764
Where are you?

141
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,185
How did you come back to life?

142
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,109
He appears only
when he is needed for the story

143
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,028
and disappears when he is not.

144
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,788
He can appear anywhere...

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,001
and in any form.

146
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:48,462
If the creator wants to,
he can appear any time...

147
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,215
without any context...

148
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,092
HE CAN APPEAR ANY TIME

149
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,218
...and commit murder.

150
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,899
What is a state dinner anyway?

151
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,986
Don't people like
the Prince of England go to that?

152
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,447
Will there be dancing? Dancing?

153
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:17,450
I can't dance. Oh, no.

154
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,535
Will we be dancing the waltz?

155
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,341
Gosh, I can't do this. This is crazy.

156
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,061
May I come in?

157
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,649
How do I look?

158
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,360
They said this suits me the best.

159
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,404
It's her turn now.

160
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,740
I'll put a bullet in her head.

161
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,909
Wait for it.

162
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,204
I guess I look bad.
I guess it's really bad.

163
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,956
Don't say anything. I got it.

164
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,333
Go back.

165
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,502
I'm going. I am.

166
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,629
Do I look that bad?

167
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,298
Go home. It's dangerous here.

168
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:15,633
What?

169
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,428
Is there any way you can go back?

170
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:26,435
I can't just go back.
I can't go back whenever I want to.

171
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,271
What's the matter?

172
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,053
What's wrong?

173
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,593
Smile as you get out.
They'll be taking pictures.

174
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,680
I don't think I can do this.
I'm not good at things like this.

175
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,062
Just hold my hand and follow me, okay?

176
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,449
-Over here!
-Please look here!

177
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,242
-Please look here!
-Over here!

178
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,204
You two look beautiful together.

179
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,041
How do you feel to be invited
to the state dinner?

180
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,584
Please tell us.

181
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,254
-Please look here!
-Let us take your picture!

182
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:19,173
-Here!
-Please look here!

183
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,980
Are you all right?

184
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,400
-I'm all right.
-Let me help you.

185
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,609
No, I'm all right.

186
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,453
It's okay. I'll do it.

187
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:33,080
What was that?

188
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,541
She was sleeping and fell off the bed.

189
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:36,959
Are you all right?

190
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,419
Yes, I'm fine.

191
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,338
Okay, you may go.

192
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:55,811
Why did you fall off the bed?

193
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,399
I was just dreaming.

194
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,110
What was it about?

195
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:07,531
It was a very sweet dream.

196
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:11,076
A very sweet dream?

197
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:13,829
You haven't slept yet?

198
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,998
I think it's almost 3 a.m. now.

199
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,208
Everyone is protecting you,

200
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,085
so relax and go back to sleep.

201
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,590
By the way,

202
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,802
are the guards really necessary?

203
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,389
The door's open,
and I feel like people are looking at me,

204
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,516
so I can't sleep well.

205
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,978
We don't know when he'll appear,
so we have no choice.

206
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,815
I don't die here.

207
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,945
I don't die here.
I'm immortal in this world.

208
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,906
Regardless of what the killer said,
what's there to worry about?

209
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,662
Variables.

210
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,957
There is no principle without variables.

211
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,460
Who knew the killer who lacks
a physical form would suddenly appear?

212
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,464
There's nothing we can do
until we know where he is.

213
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:08,801
Go back to sleep.

214
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,263
So I have to keep on living like this?

215
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,018
I can't go to the party, can I?

216
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,520
I already canceled.

217
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,150
I just got out of prison,
but I'm trapped in here again.

218
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,820
I can't even go outside.

219
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,239
You told me to mark the sweet things
you would do for me.

220
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,200
You said we would go grocery shopping.

221
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:36,161
You said we would do ten things a day,
but we haven't done anything.

222
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,168
We can't go outside, but isn't there
something we can do in here?

223
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,755
Aren't you hungry? I am.

224
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,514
-Shall I call someone?
-It's okay. It's my homework.

225
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,184
Wait outside.

226
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,022
Just a minute.

227
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,992
To be perfectly honest,

228
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,703
there's only one thing I know how to cook.

229
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,079
What is it?

230
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:20,581
Instant ramen.

231
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,960
-You call that cooking?
-That's my favorite food.

232
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:29,798
Okay, let's just eat ramen
and call it even.

233
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,758
Okay.

234
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,885
Where's the ramen?

235
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:37,556
Where's the ramen?

236
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,644
That's the oven. Why are you opening that?

237
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,313
Oh, that's right.

238
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,774
It's usually kept in places like this.

239
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,485
Here they are.

240
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,404
You're right.

241
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,907
Move out of the way. I'll make it.

242
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,452
I need to cook in order for it to count
as my homework.

243
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,330
I don't think we can call it even.

244
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,749
Make me a proper dish later
after you study.

245
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:05,501
Okay.

246
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,422
Do we have eggs and scallions?

247
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,884
-Do you want eggs in it?
-Yes.

248
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,719
Here they are.

249
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,431
There's something I don't understand.

250
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,100
How could your father do that?

251
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:25,437
How could he order the killer
to kill his own daughter?

252
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,857
That character always follows
your father's orders.

253
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:30,400
I don't know.

254
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,029
But I'm sure my dad wouldn't do that.

255
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,531
Then who?

256
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,869
I don't know,
but there's no way my dad drew it.

257
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,995
Why would he?

258
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,541
Plus, Dad said he'd never draw again--

259
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:47,835
Are you all right?

260
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,797
Call the nurse.

261
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,884
Just bring me some ointment! I can do it!

262
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,054
Why would you call a nurse for this?

263
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,684
What's wrong?

264
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,111
-Why are you bleeding?
-What?

265
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,405
It's not normal for you to bleed.

266
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,073
Why are you bleeding?

267
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:21,702
This means

268
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,581
you'll also die if you get shot.

269
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,550
TO BE CONTINUED

270
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,548
Mr. Kang, I brought the first aid kit.

271
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,050
It's okay, the bleeding stopped.

272
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,802
Go back downstairs,
and come back when I call you.

273
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,869
What's going on? Why am I bleeding?

274
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,121
Variables.

275
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,876
There is no principle without variables.

276
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,474
I SEE YOU HAVE A NEW FAMILY NOW

277
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,850
IT'S HER TURN NOW

278
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:12,312
I'LL PUT A BULLET IN HER HEAD

279
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:14,731
Does the real killer

280
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,650
know me?

281
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,235
How?

282
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,211
What is it? What changed?

283
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,506
Why are there variables now?

284
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,676
What's the reason?

285
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,441
Please leave a message after the beep.

286
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,736
Dad hasn't arrived yet?

287
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,615
SO-HEE

288
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,701
Hello?

289
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:33,912
Are you sleeping?

290
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,498
No. Why are you calling at this hour?

291
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,708
Can't I call at this hour?

292
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,378
Right.

293
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,257
Because your wife is there?

294
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,802
Are you drunk?

295
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:50,804
Is Yeon-joo...

296
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,224
sleeping beside you right now?

297
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,479
I really can't imagine it.

298
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,566
Are you...

299
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,403
Are you really married?

300
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,992
I know. That's right.

301
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,744
You've done nothing wrong.

302
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,541
You never promised me anything.

303
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:25,172
But I guess I'm slow-witted.

304
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,968
I thought things would turn out well
if I waited.

305
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,554
I was so stupid.

306
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,640
But I'm not the only one who thought that.

307
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,309
Everyone

308
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,270
thought so too.

309
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,398
So-hee.

310
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,989
What am I to you?

311
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,116
What am I?

312
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,164
What was I to you?

313
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,887
What?

314
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,598
What?

315
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,226
My hand...

316
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,603
What's wrong with it?

317
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,647
Hello?

318
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,858
Hello, So-hee?

319
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,443
Her hand disappeared?

320
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,945
Like a ghost.

321
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,031
It suddenly went translucent like a ghost.

322
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,243
It's absurd, but I know what I saw.

323
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:27,794
Characters.

324
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:31,840
That's why you should find me.

325
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,843
Why would you die before finding me?
You can't die now.

326
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,221
The purpose of the characters.

327
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,353
KANG CHUL, THE MAIN CHARACTER

328
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,272
YOON SO-HEE, CHUL'S FRIEND
AND PERSONAL ASSISTANT

329
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,942
The characters are created
because they're needed for the story.

330
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,570
THE REAL KILLER,
KILLED CHUL'S FAMILY

331
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,490
The W Project ends here.

332
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,750
When their purposes are gone,

333
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,091
they disappear.

334
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,344
They disappear forever?

335
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,684
On the flip side, when a character's
purpose becomes clearer...

336
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:26,811
Put the ring on first.

337
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,938
Is this a wedding ring?

338
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,151
Are you all right?

339
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,156
Then the character
becomes a major character

340
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,866
by force?

341
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,745
No way.

342
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,916
Have I become a real cartoon character?

343
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,709
Because I married the main character?

344
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,546
Is that why I bleed?
Does this mean I can actually die?

345
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,217
Then how about the killer?

346
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,096
Why doesn't he cease to exist
when his purpose is gone?

347
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,265
Where are you?

348
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,353
How did you come back to life?

349
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,940
Did he revive himself?

350
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,359
Did he wake up?

351
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:16,611
Like me?

352
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,469
Is the killer...

353
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,973
in the outside world?

354
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,418
Let's drink.

355
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:18,006
River flows

356
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,132
My gosh!

357
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,010
What's your problem?

358
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,928
Move! Get out of my way!

359
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,727
-Where is this?
-My goodness!

360
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,228
Where am I?

361
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,064
Where is Kang Chul?

362
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:39,152
Who are you? I don't know!

363
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:40,612
Help!

364
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,071
Help!

365
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,419
W ENDS WITH CHUL'S SUICIDE

366
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,505
THE IDENTITY OF THE KILLER
REMAINS UNKNOWN

367
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,007
THE MOST MEANINGLESS ENDING

368
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,427
The killer followed me into reality
and found out the truth.

369
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,265
When he realized that he doesn't exist,

370
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,309
he became furious.

371
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,443
The one who wanted
the killer's identity revealed

372
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,237
even more than I did...

373
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:25,532
was the killer himself.

374
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:29,911
He's dead?

375
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,288
Chul is really dead?

376
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,833
Who said that he could die?

377
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,417
I've waited so long for him.

378
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,045
I've waited ten years

379
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,047
for him to find me.

380
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,882
So how can it end?

381
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,926
How can this be the end?

382
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,472
He found out about my death
and became furious.

383
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,308
Did the pipe explode in the bathroom?

384
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,478
THE END

385
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,732
TO BE CONTINUED

386
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,484
He stopped W from ending.

387
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:05,822
He wanted to end it with me.

388
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,242
Wait a minute. There's someone over there.

389
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,667
Why are you standing there?
It's dangerous.

390
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:25,008
And now,

391
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,845
he is still wandering there...

392
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,183
because he doesn't know how to come back.

393
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,234
He must be worried. What should I do?

394
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,333
Who would call at this hour?

395
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,797
Hello?

396
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,219
Hello?

397
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,848
You're back?

398
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,188
You're Oh Seong-moo's daughter, right?

399
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,442
You're Oh Yeon-joo, right?

400
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,320
The girl who married Chul.

401
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,540
MR. OH SEONG-MOO'S HOUSE

402
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,587
SHOW PERSONNEL
EMERGENCY CONTACT LIST

403
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,884
-Really?
-Good morning, Su-yeon.

404
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,302
She's sleeping.

405
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,513
She must've gotten
a lot of complaint calls yesterday.

406
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,063
Hey, Su-bong!

407
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,358
Wake up, Su-bong! Wake up now!

408
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:08,027
-What's wrong?
-Wake up! We have to run!

409
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:12,281
-What? What's wrong with you?
-Hurry! Where's the car key?

410
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,033
-Find the car key!
-What's going on?

411
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,285
You should first tell me what's going on!

412
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,912
-What's going on?
-Hurry up!

413
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,039
-Did you find the key?
-What is it?

414
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,958
-Hurry!
-What's wrong?

415
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,419
Tell me what's going on!

416
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,672
-Hurry up!
-What's going on?

417
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,798
Hurry!

418
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,341
Gosh!

419
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,975
Go. Hurry up!

420
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:42,145
Gosh, I got it.
Let me start the car first.

421
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,598
Yeon-joo, do I just keep going?
Where are we going?

422
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,184
Just go as far away
from the house as possible.

423
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,353
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.
What is it now?

424
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,731
I'm so sick of things happening.

425
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,275
Nothing can surprise me now.

426
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,027
Don't answer your phone.

427
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,112
Don't answer calls
from unknown numbers, okay?

428
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,406
Who would call me?

429
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:36,866
The real killer

430
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,661
-is looking for me.
-What are you talking about?

431
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:49,337
Go... Go back.

432
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:50,755
Go back.

433
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,177
Who is that?

434
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,973
Isn't that a gun? It's a gun.

435
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,809
That's a gun, Yeon-joo!

436
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,519
-Back up!
-It's a gun!

437
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:07,021
-Let go of my hand!
-Hurry up!

438
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,773
Let go of my hand.

439
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,069
What's going on?

440
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,137
Did you check the bathroom?

441
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,055
She's not there.

442
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,850
I'm here.

443
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,481
Mr. Kang?

444
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,944
Wasn't that her voice?

445
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,113
Yes, I found her. We're good now.

446
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,284
Are you okay?

447
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,413
-Are you hurt?
-I...

448
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,665
I almost died.

449
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,418
The killer shot his gun at me.

450
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,503
Where?

451
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,673
He called my dad's house
and I answered it.

452
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,551
He showed up right away
after just a few minutes.

453
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:22,054
I was running away and he shot me,

454
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,266
but I came here right before I died.

455
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,333
What about Su-bong?

456
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,711
-Who is Su-bong?
-He's my dad's pupil.

457
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,963
He was in the car with me.

458
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,051
Please don't kill me!
I'm so sorry. Please!

459
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,136
I'll be a better person. I'm sorry.

460
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:06,015
Please spare my life!
Please don't kill me.

461
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:10,561
I'm sorry.

462
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,195
Yeon-joo?

463
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,411
What if he shot Su-bong?

464
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,624
You're the target.
He won't hurt him without a reason.

465
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,585
I'm worried about my mom.

466
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,631
What if he goes to my mom's place
to look for me?

467
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,099
Shit!

468
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,352
Su-bong! Are you okay?

469
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:58,025
Are you okay?

470
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:01,862
I was on my way to Seong-moo's house.
Is Yeon-joo there?

471
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,030
-Ms. Gil.
-Yes?

472
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,199
You can't go there. Go somewhere else.

473
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,077
-That way. You have to go that way.
-What's wrong with you?

474
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,662
You'll get shot if you go this way.

475
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:12,081
-You'll get shot. Go left.
-Oh, my.

476
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:14,667
-I'm sorry. Just trust me, please.
-What are you doing?

477
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,253
Go left. Just hurry up and go.

478
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,297
-What's wrong with you?
-Please go now.

479
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,152
ARRIVAL IN SEOUL AUGUST 16TH

480
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,376
Excuse me.

481
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:02,590
-You're Mr. Oh Seong-moo, right?
-Yes.

482
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,717
I'm a big fan. May I have your autograph?

483
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,013
I wasn't sure if it was you.

484
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,100
I heard you were badly injured.
I guess you've recovered.

485
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,727
I'm fine now.

486
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,896
Is W really over?

487
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,647
Are you planning a sequel?

488
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,569
I just like your work so much.

489
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,574
It was a pleasure.

490
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:35,414
Ladies and gentleman,

491
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:41,045
we will be arriving at Auckland
International Airport in 30 minutes.

492
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:44,256
Are we there? Gosh, this is so tiring.

493
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,310
Who am I?

494
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:58,896
Who am I?

495
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:00,898
Where is Chul?

496
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:03,484
Who am I?

497
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,027
Why won't you say who I am?

498
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,530
Who am I?

499
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:08,906
Tell me who I am!

500
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,129
Sir, is everything okay?

501
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,550
Sir? Are you okay?

502
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,093
Sir.

503
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,518
Didn't your father tell you anything?

504
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,270
No.

505
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,398
I can't call him. He's still on the plane.

506
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,153
Where were you going?

507
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,671
Isn't this So-hee's place?
I saw it often in the book.

508
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,215
So-hee, it's me. Let me in.

509
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,137
-So-hee.
-What's going on?

510
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:16,140
-Do you know the code?
-Pardon?

511
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,058
Is there anything you remember
from the book?

512
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,440
Please eat. Why won't you eat?

513
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,608
Aren't you hungry?

514
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,819
My gosh, what is that?

515
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,447
-Don't we look good together?
-Yeon-joo.

516
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,742
He's totally obsessed with So-hee.

517
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,496
-He's making such crazy connections.
-How?

518
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,665
Do you know why So-hee lives in Room 702?

519
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,167
It's because my birthday is July 2nd.

520
00:41:43,709 --> 00:41:46,378
And every one of So-hee's passwords
is 2405.

521
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,796
My cell phone number.

522
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:51,800
So-hee can't escape from me.

523
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,761
So-hee, you're mine!

524
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,181
Gosh, what is that? That's pathetic.

525
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,183
She's right. You're really pathetic.

526
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:01,393
Look who's talking.

527
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:06,106
It's 2405. Her code is 2405.

528
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,250
Stay here. Don't come in.

529
00:42:58,617 --> 00:42:59,451
So-hee.

530
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:04,873
Chul.

531
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,502
I think I'm dying.

532
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,881
What's wrong with me?

533
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:18,220
My hands are disappearing. Look at this.

534
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,767
HER HAND DISAPPEARED?

535
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,231
My legs are gone too.

536
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,650
What's happening to me?

537
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,864
It's because you're drunk.
There's nothing wrong with you.

538
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,575
It's because I'm drunk?

539
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,369
Yes, you're drunk.

540
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,704
Let's get you up.

541
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,169
It's a wedding ring.

542
00:43:52,212 --> 00:43:53,547
You're really wearing it.

543
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,716
You really got married.

544
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,678
-So-hee.
-I thought I'd marry you one day.

545
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,056
So what am I?

546
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,016
What am I?

547
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,271
What am I?

548
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,316
It's a misunderstanding, So-hee.

549
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,109
You know it's a fake marriage.

550
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,279
It's all fake.
There's nothing going on between us.

551
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,407
It's a misunderstanding?

552
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,077
Yes, it is.

553
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:25,871
What are you worried about?

554
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,374
You're very precious to me.

555
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,584
You're the closest person to me.

556
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,711
I need you for the rest of my life.

557
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,923
You need me?

558
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,009
Of course.

559
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,221
You can't leave.

560
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,060
I'm not dying?

561
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,442
Why would you die? That won't happen.

562
00:44:57,986 --> 00:44:59,196
You're drunk now.

563
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,741
Everything will be fine
once you get some rest.

564
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:05,202
Really?

565
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,579
Yes, really.

566
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,242
I'm going to study computer engineering.

567
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:47,828
Aren't you going to shoot?

568
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:49,705
That was just a hobby.

569
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:53,000
I was hoping for your second
Olympic gold medal.

570
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,502
Your dad will be disappointed.

571
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,588
I can become the world champion
in computers.

572
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,465
Gosh, hey.

573
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,009
You're not a genius who can do anything.

574
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,178
Yes, I'm a genius.

575
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,972
-I'm a genius. Didn't you know?
-What?

576
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,016
You annoying...

577
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:10,893
Hey.

578
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,146
Come here. You're such a rascal.

579
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,861
I had forgotten

580
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,865
that So-hee was the main female character.

581
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:30,245
This happened because of me.

582
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,541
It's a horrible fate
that your father created.

583
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,002
The character set-up.

584
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,921
Our reason for existence.

585
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,218
Isn't it cruel

586
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,846
that there is only one reason

587
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,015
for our existence?

588
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,937
We're also human.

589
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:11,787
It's such a mess.

590
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,708
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

591
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,951
To Mr. Oh Seong-moo.

592
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:25,986
What are you doing?

593
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,947
I'm tying your shoes.

594
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,033
Here is my chance.

595
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,797
Did I do four sweet things now?

596
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,967
This isn't the time for homework.

597
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,036
We're going to get some fresh air.

598
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:24,294
Isn't this place...

599
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,296
Do you remember?

600
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,134
This is it. You were on the ground
around here, right?

601
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:34,888
I was so startled because
I thought you were going to die.

602
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:37,307
You're lucky

603
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,268
that you met such
a skilled doctor like me right then.

604
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,146
I was lucky, indeed.

605
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,241
Promise me one thing.

606
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,620
When you leave this world again,

607
00:49:59,037 --> 00:50:00,288
can you draw me something?

608
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,374
Draw you what?

609
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:04,918
A dream.

610
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,420
A dream?

611
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,715
A scene where I wake up from a dream.

612
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:15,929
Make everything that happened
from two months ago when we first met

613
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:19,474
to this moment a dream.

614
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,060
Make it a long dream.

615
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,066
It isn't hard, is it?

616
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,861
You even brought me back from the dead.

617
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:38,410
No matter how much I think about it,
that's the only way I can think of.

618
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,623
Going back to the time before I thought
that you were the key to my life.

619
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,630
I met you here for the first time.

620
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,176
Anyway, we have to find her.

621
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,472
I think that woman holds
the key to my life.

622
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,975
I started to wonder about you
and looked for you.

623
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,188
Then you kept getting
pulled into this world.

624
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,565
The world inside a cartoon.

625
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,068
This world is inside a cartoon.

626
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:16,406
And you are
the main character of that cartoon.

627
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,536
Through you, I learned the truth
I was better off not knowing.

628
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,750
I met your father

629
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,590
and did things I shouldn't have.

630
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:38,053
The killer followed me then...

631
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,516
And is making a mess
in your world right now.

632
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:46,937
My friend is close to disappearing.

633
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:51,525
And most importantly,

634
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,404
you must not die.

635
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,450
I can't watch you die again.

636
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:07,082
Everything will be resolved if we go back
to the time when we haven't met.

637
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,169
If I don't know you, I won't look for you

638
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,338
or think about you.

639
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:16,341
Then you won't be pulled into this world.

640
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,969
I won't learn the truth from you.

641
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,055
I won't shoot your father.

642
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,932
The killer won't get out.

643
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,309
No one will be in danger.

644
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,021
Thank you for saving me.

645
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:34,025
I didn't know how I should live,
but I know now.

646
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,320
I should live according to my fate.

647
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,907
If looking for a killer I can't catch
for the rest of my life

648
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,785
is the reason for my existence,
then so be it.

649
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:48,790
What do you think?

650
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,962
Do you understand me?

651
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:04,890
I do.

652
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,188
Can you draw that for me?

653
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,983
This is all a dream

654
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,569
that I had while I was in the hospital.

655
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,613
A dream I can't even remember.

656
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,375
Promise me.

657
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,420
You have to do that immediately
when you go back.

658
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,172
Don't hesitate at all.

659
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:40,550
He doesn't need to
follow the rules of reason,

660
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,927
so he can appear at any time.

661
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,307
Answer me. We don't have time.

662
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,226
He might be up to something as we speak,

663
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,937
since he doesn't have a personality.

664
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,069
I...

665
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,072
promise.

666
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:05,867
Okay, then.

667
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:15,001
It's too bad that we only got to do
four sweet romantic things.

668
00:54:18,254 --> 00:54:20,298
I had over 100 more to do for you.

669
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,304
I want to hug you,

670
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,515
but I can't do that.

671
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,187
It may make me change my mind.

672
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,565
Are you going somewhere?

673
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:51,746
We're running out of time,
and this is the only sure way.

674
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,875
Yeon-joo,

675
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,338
forget me.

676
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,758
I'm just a cartoon character.

677
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,637
When you want to see me,

678
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,265
go to a bookstore
and see me in the comic book.

679
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:13,768
Okay?

680
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,569
Take care.

681
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,728
According to the hospital, Kang Chul,

682
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:00,648
who was attacked by an unknown man,
is now recovering and in stable state.

683
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:04,736
The front of the hospital
is currently swarming with people

684
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,696
who are worried about him.

685
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,909
The police are searching for
the assailant who attacked him.

686
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:14,037
However, they do not have any clear leads.

687
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:16,039
This is M News.

688
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:19,876
You're up.

689
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:22,003
How are you feeling?

690
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:25,048
-Did they find anything?
-Not yet.

691
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,259
They're checking the surveillance videos,
but it'll take time.

692
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:29,511
You know how slow they are.

693
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,097
Were you crying?

694
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,142
-What?
-Those look like tears.

695
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,904
I don't know. I think I had a dream.

696
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,533
It must've been a pretty sad dream.

697
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:55,120
I don't remember.
Would you get me some water?

698
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,204
Okay.

699
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:59,874
Anyway, your problem is
that you are too reckless.

700
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:03,128
Why would you go up there alone?
You were just asking for it.

701
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,256
You're lucky the waiter happened
to go up there.

702
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,258
Why would you meet someone
you don't know alone?

703
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,591
I'll accept the shitty fate
you've given me.

704
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,010
Just as I drew it...

705
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:36,387
-What a pretty ring.
-...Chul forgot everything.

706
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,806
This is a fresh start.

707
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,893
Chul will catch the killer
and then marry So-hee.

708
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:47,232
No one remembers me there,

709
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,984
and no one in this world
knows what I went through.

710
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,362
I called you because I want
to end it right.

711
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:53,571
I already picked the face.

712
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,991
He is the only person
Chul will accept as the real killer.

713
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,535
Dr. "Oh Yeon-joo"?

714
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,872
