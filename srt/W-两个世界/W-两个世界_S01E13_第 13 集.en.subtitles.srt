1
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,146
The Assemblyman is running late.
He'll be here in 20 minutes.

2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,445
Kang Chul is trying to harass you
even in his death.

3
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,406
He wrote something strange
in his suicide note.

4
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,450
What did he write?

5
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,952
Don't worry about it too much.

6
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:20,705
Someone at death's door
could write anything.

7
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,710
I'LL MAKE YOU THE NEXT PRESIDENT.

8
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:28,254
-They had a phone call?
-Pardon?

9
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,216
Han Cheol-ho and the killer
talked over the phone.

10
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,176
Yes.

11
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,888
I think we can make something out of this.

12
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,100
-Who?
-Han Sang-hun.

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,146
He wrote that we should investigate
a phone call

14
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,065
between that killer and you.

15
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,859
He's making it seem like
you colluded with him.

16
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,529
He's a cunning one.

17
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,489
He didn't want to die alone.

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,491
Hey.

19
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,493
Can you send me

20
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,412
a copy of Kang Chul's suicide note?

21
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,376
Murder without context.

22
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,587
A mass shooting without a purpose.

23
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,465
A fake recording.

24
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,473
That's how I'll die.

25
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:25,520
Without a reason. In vain.

26
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,692
Investigate the phone call
between the killer and Han Cheol-ho.

27
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,159
Those two are connected. I'm sure of it,

28
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,869
although I don't exactly know how.

29
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,622
THOSE TWO ARE CONNECTED. I'M SURE OF IT.

30
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,708
Please expose their relationship.

31
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,503
I'm innocent.

32
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,262
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

33
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,890
Even so, we need to confirm what he wrote,

34
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,558
so they'll investigate the call.

35
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,852
I just wanted to give you a heads up.

36
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,234
RECORDING

37
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,904
That's right. It's me.

38
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,699
Do you know what will happen to you
if I get caught?

39
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,911
I do. You will...

40
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,288
kill me.

41
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,666
I'll make you the next President.

42
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:31,920
-What?
-I'll help you.

43
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,339
I know a lot of things about Chul.

44
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,717
He'll become a murderer.

45
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,303
And the killer behind
his father's death will be him too.

46
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,222
You're insane.

47
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,349
What nonsense are you...

48
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,809
I'll make it happen for you right now.

49
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:52,065
Hey, you. Why did you call me?

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,608
Don't you know?

51
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,945
If you become President,
it will all be thanks to me.

52
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:58,363
You can pay me back later.

53
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,200
We're in this together now.

54
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,705
MORE

55
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,957
DELETE

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,458
DO YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS FILE?
YES

57
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,376
NO FILES

58
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,970
Do you think Han Cheol-ho
will try to kill him for that?

59
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,098
His character is
a simple-minded antagonist.

60
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,766
That's how your father made him.

61
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,852
I'm sure he'll do it as long as
there are no variables.

62
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,330
I heard Kang Chul is dead.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,961
-Did he really die?
-What is it to you?

64
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,047
You should worry about your own life.

65
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,678
-I'm asking you if he's dead.
-Don't look at me like that.

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,767
Yes. He's dead. So what?

67
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,353
-Moron.
-What?

68
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,939
How are the cops so stupid?

69
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,901
-What did you say?
-Go get Han Cheol-ho.

70
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,612
-What?
-Congressman Han Cheol-ho.

71
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:24,824
-Call him. Tell him I want to see him.
-What?

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,827
Tell him not to do anything stupid.

73
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,372
If he's trying to get rid of me,
I'll kill him first.

74
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:34,042
I'll put a bullet through his brain,
so he better watch out!

75
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,922
Tell him to go find Kang Chul.
That bastard's not dead.

76
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,215
Understand?

77
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,347
He's a lunatic. Fine.

78
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,726
Sorry. There was traffic.

79
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,227
I already started.

80
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,694
Do you know Han Sang-hun?

81
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,200
He's the suspect that was arrested
for the mass shooting.

82
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,538
-What about him?
-He's looking for you.

83
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,999
-He's asking to see you.
-Pardon?

84
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,168
You've never met him, have you?

85
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,381
-How would I know him?
-That's what I mean.

86
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,510
Maybe someone's setting you up.

87
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,387
Now that the troublemaker
Kang Chul is dead,

88
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:31,015
this punk is stirring up trouble.

89
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:32,934
Gosh.

90
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,852
I'm sorry I'm late.

91
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,188
Hi, come on in.

92
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,775
-The traffic was bad, wasn't it?
-It was.

93
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,576
He got me good.

94
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,373
I thought he was just a lunatic,
but I was wrong.

95
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,670
A trap?

96
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,339
Why?

97
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,343
How did Kang Chul get the idea
to write that in his suicide note?

98
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,724
I'll get rid of it.

99
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,602
I'll get rid of it at the source.

100
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,113
Hello?

101
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,365
How have you been?

102
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:31,784
What are your boys doing these days?

103
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,580
I have a job for you.

104
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,046
I HAVE A JOB FOR YOU.

105
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,399
She always calls when I'm about to eat.

106
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,028
Hello? Hi, Yeon-joo.

107
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,864
You just read the webtoon?
It was posted a while ago.

108
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,824
I had a surgery so I just saw it.

109
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,244
I see. The story's moving forward well.

110
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,500
-How's my dad?
-He's still the same.

111
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,376
I just checked a minute ago.

112
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,961
Check again.

113
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,923
I checked ten minutes ago.

114
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,176
Fine.

115
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,314
He's still the same.

116
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:49,612
Is the killer still alive?

117
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,572
It looks like Han Cheol-ho
is hiring men for the job.

118
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,201
The time there and here are different,
so I have no idea what's going on.

119
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,745
But I think

120
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,790
it's almost time.

121
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,876
-What about him?
-Who?

122
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,128
Oh, Chul? He went out.

123
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,756
-Where?
-I don't know.

124
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,008
He doesn't sit still for a minute.

125
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:16,013
Keep checking on my dad for me.
I'm done here, so I'll be right over.

126
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,856
-Hello?
-What are you doing?

127
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,024
I just got off work.

128
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,777
Where are you? I heard you went out.

129
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,696
Come out. I'll buy you coffee.

130
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,657
Are you nearby?

131
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,493
Okay. I'm leaving now.

132
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,287
What do you want to drink?

133
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,582
Iced Americano.

134
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,126
Americano? Okay.

135
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,982
Do I look okay?

136
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,986
You look absolutely gorgeous.

137
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:13,654
Have a nice day.

138
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,325
See you tomorrow.

139
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:20,369
Is she seeing someone?

140
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,672
Hope makes me imagine again.

141
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,610
Dad.

142
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,161
Dad.

143
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,880
When Dad safely returns,

144
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,139
the real last chapter of W begins.

145
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,310
WHAT ARE YOUR BOYS DOING THESE DAYS?

146
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:30,481
Who are Han Cheol-ho's underlings?

147
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,234
The gang is called Baekcheong.

148
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:36,695
Han Cheol-ho used to look out for them
when he was a prosecutor.

149
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,198
This is great!

150
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,117
Where should we go after the job?

151
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,243
Let's go somewhere nice.

152
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,786
Jang Won-hwi is their leader.

153
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,830
He appeared in several other chapters.

154
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,416
This music is great! Step on it!

155
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,051
You have their
personal information, right?

156
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,428
Yes. I'll get it.

157
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,600
These are Han Cheol-ho's gang members.

158
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,228
Seo Do-yoon will pass
the information he got from Chul

159
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,021
to a broadcasting station.

160
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,691
GANGDONG POLICE WILL ELIMINATE
ALL SOCIAL EVILS!

161
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,862
Cheol-ho goes to prison
like he was supposed to,

162
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,073
for his role in Chul's
and Han Sang-hun's death.

163
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:30,624
KANG CHUL

164
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,258
The people who once loathed Chul

165
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,177
starts missing him again.

166
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,684
He dies but regains his fame
as the main character

167
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,853
and escapes the crisis
of ceasing to exist.

168
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,037
THE END

169
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,923
As Chul came back to me,

170
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,844
W ended with a happy ending.

171
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,703
When the webtoon ends,

172
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,873
he is freed from his character profile.

173
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,960
He is no longer
the main character of a cartoon

174
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,878
and does not have
the main character's fate.

175
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,171
He's inside.

176
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:05,177
He is simply a special person
who can travel between two worlds.

177
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,647
Dad.

178
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,358
We're here.

179
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,613
How are you feeling?

180
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,662
He will live here now. There's no problem.

181
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,671
May I join you? I haven't eaten yet.

182
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,174
Have a seat.

183
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,093
I'll get the rice.

184
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,853
Stop eating so loudly!

185
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,522
You're chewing so loud.

186
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:13,829
There is no way Dad
will accept the situation,

187
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:18,042
but he will accept our relationship
one day.

188
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:22,254
Fine, let's forget it. Forget it.

189
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,300
What can I do now? It already happened.

190
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,345
He's a human being. I didn't draw him.

191
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,986
What are you doing?

192
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,616
Do you want to play Go?
I heard you like it.

193
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,348
Who's winning?

194
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,359
Dad, did you lose again?

195
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,363
Let's play one more time
so that you can beat your friends.

196
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,951
It will be hard to find
another player like me.

197
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,496
Unless you learn from a professional.

198
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,676
I have to wait patiently

199
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,553
and take it slow.

200
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,773
Tell him to sit.

201
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,609
Have a seat.

202
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,989
Have a seat. Come, have a seat.

203
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,035
Do you want coffee?

204
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,578
Yes, thank you.

205
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,040
Oh, my. Aren't you handsome?

206
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,833
You're cute.

207
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,961
How old are you?

208
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,421
I'm 30.

209
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,256
That's perfect.

210
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,427
You look like you came out
of a comic book.

211
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,429
What's so great about him?

212
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,974
Mom will be difficult,

213
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,726
but Auntie will help me...

214
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,144
You're tall, too.

215
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,439
-...since she only cares about looks.
-You are so handsome.

216
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,513
Have you already paid for this?

217
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,390
I was going to pay.

218
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,016
I should at least buy the coffee.

219
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,852
I'm making my wife work alone.

220
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,271
I guess you have a conscience.

221
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,314
I have a conscience.
I just don't have money.

222
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,901
Anyway, why are you here?
I was going to go home.

223
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,028
I have to go somewhere after this.

224
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:16,572
Where?

225
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,365
I'm curious about what's happening.

226
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,951
In the webtoon?

227
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,289
I want to know how things are going,
and I have to meet Do-yoon too.

228
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,874
I need to settle the inheritance issue.

229
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,709
What will you do about it?

230
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,544
I'm going to establish a foundation

231
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:32,254
that supports crime investigations.

232
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:33,797
Do-yoon will run it.

233
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:36,091
I can't bring the money here anyway.

234
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,385
I see.

235
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,221
Are you disappointed?

236
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,765
What? No.

237
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,851
You seem very disappointed.

238
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,146
No, not at all. Why are you saying that?

239
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,815
Maybe you liked me for my money.

240
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,483
Should I bring some gold bars?

241
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,824
Draw me a few things,
and your part will be done.

242
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,288
-What's this?
-It's a voice recording.

243
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,832
I'll put it in Han Cheol-ho's office
to be found as evidence

244
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,250
so that we can put him in jail.

245
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,340
We should get your father back
some time tonight.

246
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,593
Are you sure?

247
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,595
If there are no variables.

248
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,430
What variables?

249
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,727
I just hope there won't be any.
Don't worry too much.

250
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,771
Hey, Yeon-joo!

251
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,441
I'm glad I found you here.

252
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:35,859
I told you about him. Mad Dog.

253
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,613
-I have something to tell you.
-Pardon?

254
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,865
I'm going to survive.

255
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:44,910
I was a fan of W before,
but as of today, I'm a hater.

256
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,037
-What?
-You probably know

257
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,540
how much I hoped
for Mr. Oh's beautiful ending.

258
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,960
But you saw it, right?
Where the story's heading?

259
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,838
Oh Yeon-joo again! The character
I'm tired of appeared again.

260
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:02,427
So I've come to a conclusion.

261
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,638
Kang Chul is a bigger moron than Yeon-joo.

262
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,014
And the bigger moron than Chul

263
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,433
is me, who's reading that moronic webtoon!

264
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,685
Therefore,

265
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,561
I've dumped it.

266
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,730
W is no longer a masterpiece.
It's garbage!

267
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,776
What?

268
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:20,904
Are you offended
that I insulted your father? I don't care.

269
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:23,949
Tell your father about my rage.

270
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,867
On behalf of the readers,

271
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,453
I can't hide my anger and disappointment.

272
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,581
Tell him I'll write 100 nasty comments.

273
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,417
Tell him to brace himself for bad ratings.

274
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,046
You'll probably never see
such a fair hater.

275
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,548
My user ID is Professor Park.

276
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,759
Tell him that the hater
"Professor Park" is me.

277
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,388
Is it that ridiculous?
Enough to become a hater?

278
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,472
Pardon?

279
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,558
Is Kang Chul that moronic?

280
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,935
Isn't Yeon-joo a decent woman?

281
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,564
Which Yeon-joo do you mean?

282
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,607
Do you mean Yeon-joo here or in the comic?

283
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,402
I don't know any Yeon-joo who is decent.

284
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,112
You don't like this one either?

285
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,699
I can't decide which one is a bigger mess.

286
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,242
Is she that bad?

287
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,286
Especially this Yeon-joo here.

288
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,663
She's both horrible and disgusting.

289
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,540
She's horribly disgusting.

290
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,126
-Professor?
-Yes?

291
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,962
Aren't you going to order?
Shall I buy you some coffee?

292
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,130
-Let's go.
-Wait.

293
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,924
Who are you to talk to me about...

294
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,302
Hello, I'm Yeon-joo's friend.

295
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,722
Oh, I see.

296
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,849
Well, pardon me.

297
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,852
-I was upset, so please understand.
-What would you like?

298
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:36,021
You like iced latte, right?

299
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,152
What's wrong now?

300
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:50,160
Haven't we met before?

301
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,454
-We have?
-Haven't we?

302
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,539
I've never met you before.

303
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:58,543
Why do you look so familiar?

304
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,128
Do you look like someone?

305
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:05,926
Kang Chul?

306
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,636
Kang Chul?

307
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:12,641
That's right. You look like him.

308
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,102
Kang... That's right.

309
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,355
-You look exactly like him.
-What are you doing?

310
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,899
-A lot of people say that.
-Right?

311
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,693
Goodness, how is this possible?

312
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,946
You look exactly like him!

313
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,907
-Professor, let's go order--
-Seriously,

314
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,951
you would be perfect for the movie
based on the webtoon.

315
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:33,954
Talk about a perfect match! Gosh!

316
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,705
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

317
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:39,292
Why don't you audition? What do you do?

318
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,961
-I'll give you my business card.
-Okay.

319
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,841
Let's see. CEO. Kang Chul...

320
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,095
Kang Chul?

321
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,684
A lot of people say that I look like him,
so I made it for fun.

322
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,812
Goodness, wait a minute.

323
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,773
You're such a funny man.

324
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,942
You're so funny.

325
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,862
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Kang.

326
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,240
-Professor, I really have to get going.
-Okay.

327
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,410
Where did you meet someone so funny?

328
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,538
It's so great to meet you.
We should really talk.

329
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,166
-Wait. We should--
-Professor!

330
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,250
-Okay.
-Iced latte.

331
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,669
-Let's go for a drink sometime.
-Come on.

332
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,179
We wasted our 20 minutes with him.

333
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,349
I don't have to take you home, right?
Draw as soon as you get home.

334
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:37,851
Okay.

335
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,979
You won't be in danger, right?

336
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,566
You know I am free to do whatever I want.

337
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,817
Don't worry about me.

338
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,278
Please be careful.

339
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,198
I'll call you.

340
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:21,561
Is there a reference for the hotel
I lived in as well?

341
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:23,480
Yes, here it is.

342
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,316
It's the Miracle Hotel.
I only changed the name.

343
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:30,862
What's the address?

344
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,572
I'm not sure.

345
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:44,936
Where are you?

346
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:48,315
-I'm on my way home.
-We aren't inside the webtoon, right?

347
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,150
What do you mean?

348
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,569
How could we talk on the phone then?

349
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,904
We're talking on the phone now.

350
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,699
Then why did I see So-hee just now?

351
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,786
So-hee? Do you mean Yoon So-hee?

352
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,664
No.

353
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:06,541
What are you talking about?

354
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,379
Never mind, I'll call you later.
I'm not sure what's going on.

355
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,030
Su-bong.

356
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:46,956
Su-bong.

357
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:49,751
Su-bong.

358
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,922
Where did he go?

359
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,114
MYUNGSEI UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

360
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,201
-Hello?
-What happened to my dad?

361
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,287
-What?
-The door's open and he's gone.

362
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,415
What happened to him?

363
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,126
I definitely locked the door.

364
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,837
I'll call you after I find him.

365
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,216
Yeon-joo.

366
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,390
-Dad?
-Yeon-joo.

367
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,434
Dad.

368
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,981
Dad.

369
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,791
-When did you get here?
-A minute ago.

370
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,170
I didn't vacate the penthouse
like you said but what will you do?

371
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,839
I need a place to stay
when I come back here.

372
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,466
Where are you coming from?

373
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,053
-From the moon?
-Of all the...

374
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,973
Stop joking around. I'm serious.

375
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,393
I was at your funeral yesterday.
I don't feel like joking around.

376
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,230
I'm sorry.
It's too complicated to explain.

377
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,566
I'll tell you in time. Where is the will?

378
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,319
Here.

379
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,821
LAW OFFICES OF CHA YOUNG-HO

380
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,199
ASSIGNOR

381
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,957
Don't give it to me.
I don't want to deal with it.

382
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,043
Who else can I trust?

383
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,211
I told you I'm retiring.

384
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,172
I'm going to start martial arts again.

385
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,674
I hate dealing with paperwork.

386
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,053
I'll leave it under your name for now.
You can find a successor if you want.

387
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,429
You're such a...

388
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,183
Right. Have you seen So-hee?

389
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,270
-What?
-So-hee said she saw you.

390
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,357
-Where?
-In front of the lobby.

391
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,526
She said she saw you driving by.

392
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,362
Did she really see me?

393
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,910
So-hee, I have to get going.
I have to meet someone.

394
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,495
I'll get you a cab.

395
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,996
I just saw Chul.

396
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,083
-What?
-He was here just now.

397
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,587
He drove up in his car
but it suddenly disappeared.

398
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,091
What are you talking about?
That makes no sense.

399
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,176
He's dead.

400
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,429
No. He saw me too.

401
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,558
How can this be?

402
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,853
It was suddenly daytime.

403
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,355
I saw sunlight as I was walking out.

404
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,899
That's when Chul appeared.

405
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:04,988
But now it's suddenly nighttime again,

406
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,198
and his car disappeared.

407
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,993
What is happening?

408
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,958
It was so hard to cover up.
You need to be more careful.

409
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,840
Hello? Yes.

410
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,967
I'm out right now.

411
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,514
There is...

412
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,309
another variable?

413
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,898
Yes, I was definitely
thinking about So-hee.

414
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,567
I suddenly thought of her
as I drove up to the hotel.

415
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,613
I'm the main character,
and I'm living in the real world.

416
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,865
Then is it my third hypothesis?

417
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,244
If I think of a character
from the webtoon,

418
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:38,706
they can be summoned into the real world?

419
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:44,879
Did I...

420
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,467
accidentally summon someone?

421
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,937
Does it hurt anywhere? Are you all right?

422
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,897
I think I'm okay.

423
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,858
Do you want water?

424
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,571
Rest for a bit,
and then let's go to the hospital.

425
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:14,409
You need to get some tests.
Who knows what was damaged?

426
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,870
What happened?

427
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,040
How did I come back?

428
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,168
It's just like the story
you had originally planned.

429
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,045
Kang Chul came back and wrote it himself.

430
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,797
He's making Han Cheol-ho kill the killer.

431
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,675
He said that was the only way
to bring you back.

432
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:32,552
Kang Chul?

433
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,805
Yes, Chul.

434
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,808
He came here, Dad.

435
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,396
Don't you remember?
We spent a few days together.

436
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,149
I don't know.

437
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:47,984
I don't know.

438
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,407
Don't think about it for now.
You need to rest.

439
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:56,617
Where is Chul?

440
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,411
Where is he?

441
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,371
He went back there.

442
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,998
Into the webtoon?

443
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,376
Yes. He didn't know you were back.

444
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,421
He'll come back once he confirms
the killer is dead.

445
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,010
I'd better call Su-bong.
He's going to be so happy.

446
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,637
He's been having heart palpitations
because of you.

447
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,515
That means Kang Chul isn't here, right?

448
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,778
Shit. I waited for nothing.

449
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,531
Pardon?

450
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,700
What I mean is,

451
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:42,538
I thought I could get rid
of you both at once.

452
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,752
Dad.

453
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,089
Dad?

454
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,343
How am I your dad?

455
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,691
Do-yoon! Where is Han Cheol-ho right now?

456
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,904
How can that happen?
How is that possible in a police station?

457
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,741
I'm speechless.

458
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,494
All right. Call me back.

459
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,414
-What happened?
-It's Ms. Yoon. I heard Han Sang-hun...

460
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,792
-Is he dead?
-...escaped from prison.

461
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,418
-What?
-Can you believe that?

462
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,755
How can they lose a killer
from the police station?

463
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,396
Hey. Can't you hear me?

464
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,481
Don't send me to the prosecutor!

465
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,277
Han Cheol-ho will kill me
while I'm on my way! Don't you get it?

466
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:59,031
He's going to send thugs to kill me!

467
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,201
You need to protect me right now,
you bastards!

468
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,749
Bring Han Cheol-ho here.

469
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,711
I said, bring Han Cheol-ho!

470
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,254
Seriously.

471
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,268
Hey, where did he go?

472
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,445
What?

473
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:40,865
What happened?

474
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,294
Come by 10:00 a.m. Okay.

475
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,195
Yes. My name is Park Su-bong.

476
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,615
I've been having chest pain.

477
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,492
I'll be right there.

478
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,035
Yes, thank you.

479
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,963
Goodness.

480
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,882
Were you locked in here?

481
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,842
Come out now.

482
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,035
Dad?

483
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,040
How am I your dad?

484
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:41,545
It's been a while, Yeon-joo.

485
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,842
You were the problem. You.

486
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,803
The story got messed up because of you.

487
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,721
You kept on drawing.

488
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,350
Kang Chul should've been long dead,

489
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,812
but you hid him and saved him.

490
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,190
You took the book to the other world
and made Chul realize everything.

491
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,778
If it weren't for you,
this would have ended a long time ago.

492
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,781
Do you know how much of a hassle this is?

493
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,828
I read all the chapters here.

494
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,623
I know how Chul goes back and forth
between the two worlds.

495
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,626
Once you get how it works, it's easy.

496
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,086
I can do it too.

497
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,091
Want to go with me

498
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,468
to find your husband?

499
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,226
He just disappeared
while being interrogated.

500
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,395
-Does that make sense?
-When was that?

501
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,188
It must've been about an hour.

502
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,484
I'm sorry. I'll call you again.

503
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,361
Where are you going?

504
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,371
Where are you going?

505
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,382
OH YEON-JOO

506
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:19,435
KANG CHUL

507
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,188
All right.

508
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,190
Draw a car.

509
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,117
Draw a cell phone too.

510
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,631
I'm telling you, we were all ready.

511
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,258
But all of a sudden, a siren went off.

512
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:55,137
That bastard escaped
from the interrogation room.

513
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,931
Are you kidding me right now?

514
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,141
How can he get out of there?

515
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,772
How could he get out of there?

516
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,776
It's getting worse.

517
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,490
RESTRICTED NUMBER

518
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,368
Hello?

519
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,620
I told you not to mess with me, didn't I?

520
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:25,042
This bastard never listens.
After I helped you so much...

521
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,170
How did you get out?

522
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:30,256
Don't mess with me!

523
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,175
I can kill you right away, do you hear me?

524
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:38,013
You don't even know how things work.
What makes you think you can kill me?

525
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:41,141
And do you think I don't know
about that gangster Jang Won-hwi?

526
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,813
Prepare a safe house.

527
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,856
Right now.

528
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,734
Find a place within five minutes
and send me the address.

529
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,653
I told you.

530
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,572
We're in the same boat now.

531
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:56,991
Look.

532
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:58,784
Why would I?

533
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,703
Chul is alive.

534
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,790
That bastard isn't dead yet.

535
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:08,460
Don't think about anything else
if you want to catch him. Okay?

536
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:22,725
Let's go to Gwangmyeong. Drive.

537
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,478
Good job.

538
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,814
You can rest after drawing one more.

539
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,692
I don't need that tablet anymore,

540
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:32,985
so destroy it completely.

541
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:36,739
Go.

542
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:06,852
Gosh.

543
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,901
Oh, gosh.

544
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,570
Oh, Chul.

545
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,283
-Wait out here.
-What?

546
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,534
Come in later. It's dangerous.

547
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,329
Chul! What's wrong?

548
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,246
What's going on?

549
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:09,289
It's dangerous here. Go somewhere else.

550
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,042
What's happening?
I thought everything was going well.

551
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,128
-The killer took Yeon-joo.
-What?

552
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,131
The killer took Yeon-joo? Why--

553
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,425
Chul!

554
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,053
That asshole.

555
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:26,223
How do I get rid of him?

556
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,435
Who is he exactly?

557
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,324
Hello? Are you on your way?

558
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,493
Listen to me carefully.

559
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:49,913
You can't kill him.
Just watch what he does.

560
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:54,626
I have to check something,
so make sure he doesn't run.

561
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,044
Got it?

562
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,506
Good. I'll head there later.

563
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,142
Where did you send Han Sang-hun?

564
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,147
-You...
-What's the address you mentioned?

565
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,408
Where is Sang-hun?

566
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,536
How are you still alive?

567
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,416
Tell me now. I don't have time.

568
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:40,797
Sir! What's going on?

569
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,965
HAN CHEOL-HO

570
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,260
Who are you?

571
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,598
-Kang Chul...
-Kang Chul?

572
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,769
Sir!

573
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,605
Are you all right?

574
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,820
What happened?
He looked a lot like Kang Chul.

575
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:19,878
GWANGMYEONG

576
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,590
Why don't I take you to the hospital?

577
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:26,260
Leave me alone for a while.

578
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,181
I am so sorry.

579
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,976
I didn't see anyone go in.
How could this happen?

580
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:37,396
-Kang Chul...
-Yes?

581
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,023
Kang Chul is alive.

582
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,610
But he died, didn't he?
He looked quite similar, but...

583
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,575
That asshole was right.

584
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,413
It will be even better if he leaves
a repenting suicide note.

585
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,499
Who are you?

586
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:01,837
There's something.

587
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,840
There's something that I don't know.

588
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:10,304
How dare you two threaten me?

589
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,600
-Get the car.
-Where are you going?

590
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:18,437
If there's something I don't know,
I should find out.

591
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:22,816
Turn left.

592
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,156
Turn right over here.

593
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,707
Okay. Stop here.

594
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:43,253
UNDER CONSTRUCTION

595
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,088
Turn off the engine.

596
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,094
Get out.

597
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,044
I wanted to shoot you
in front of your husband,

598
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:27,923
but I think this is the only way
to get him to come here.

599
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,512
I've waited for a long time

600
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,139
because Chul didn't remember you.

601
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,603
It was meaningless to shoot you
when he didn't know you were his wife.

602
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,650
Now that he knows who you are,

603
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,445
it'll be worthwhile to shoot you.

604
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,782
Please...

605
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:56,785
Please...

606
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,789
don't kill me.

607
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:05,419
I can't do that. You're Chul's family.

608
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:08,130
My purpose of existence
is to get rid of you.

609
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,388
Please, I beg you.

610
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,726
Who told you to put on that wedding ring?

611
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,353
Who told you to be
the main female character?

612
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,480
Did you expect a happy ending?

613
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,251
TO BE CONTINUED

614
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:04,978
What is that?

615
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,815
Have you lost your mind?

616
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,567
Move, you idiot!

617
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,787
W BY OH SEONG-MOO

618
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:25,832
DID YOU EXPECT A HAPPY ENDING?

619
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,850
Shit.

620
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,810
What's that? What's going on?

621
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:29,771
Shit. What should we do?

622
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,914
Those morons.

623
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,457
What's going on?

624
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:17,152
TO BE CONTINUED

625
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:26,369
I'm going back in.

626
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,704
I mean, how could this happen?

627
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,372
You've really never seen her before?

628
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,582
No, never!

629
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,294
I don't think she even lives here.
Whom should I call?

630
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,629
It's disturbing.

631
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,297
It's quite absurd.

632
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:26,382
She doesn't have a bag or a cell phone.

633
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,722
Who are you? Where did you come from?

634
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:36,976
What happened to the woman who was here?

635
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,274
Oh, my gosh!

636
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,277
What happened here?

637
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,328
I found a woman passed out
and covered in blood,

638
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,872
so I just put her in an ambulance.

639
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,958
-Is she alive?
-She was alive then,

640
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,335
but I'm not sure because she was dying.

641
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,213
Which hospital?

642
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:10,093
They say she's in critical condition

643
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,719
from losing so much blood.

644
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:20,019
You seem injured as well. Are you okay?

645
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,565
What's your relationship with the woman?

646
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:28,987
I'm her husband.

647
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:05,124
Where is Yeon-joo?

648
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,918
Where is Yeon-joo?

649
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,503
Yeon-joo?

650
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,631
Even if I kill you here,

651
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,633
it won't be considered a crime.

652
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,262
Nobody will say anything
even if you die again here.

653
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,476
I need to save someone.

654
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:24,686
Where's Yeon-joo?

655
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,979
She's dead.

656
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,942
