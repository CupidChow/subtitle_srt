1
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,706
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

2
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,915
WILL CHUL FIND THE KILLER?

3
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:46,921
The main character, Kang Chul,
learns from Oh Yeon-joo

4
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,257
that he's a main character of a webtoon.

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,760
You want to shoot me? Go ahead.

6
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,678
Shoot me!

7
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:58,058
This is the most logical ending
for the main character

8
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,143
who became a murderer
while searching for a murderer.

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,854
Chul and Yeon-joo realize
their true feelings for each other

10
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,607
and dream of a new, happy life together.

11
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,193
Why are you bleeding?

12
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:11,237
This means you'll also die
if you get shot.

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,531
You are Oh Yeon-joo, right?

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,492
The girl who married Chul.

15
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:19,370
The real killer appears and threatens Chul
by saying he'd kill Yeon-joo.

16
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,915
Have I become a real webtoon character?

17
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,583
Because I married the main character?

18
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,502
Because of the killer and Yeon-joo,

19
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,546
other characters in W lose their purposes

20
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,507
and start to disappear.

21
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,468
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

22
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,809
Isn't this place...

23
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,852
Do you remember?

24
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,398
This is it. You were on the ground
around here, right?

25
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,111
I was so shocked because
I thought you were going to die.

26
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,071
I was lucky indeed.

27
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:03,790
Promise me something.

28
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,128
When you leave this world again,

29
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,754
can you draw me something?

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,798
Draw you what?

31
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:14,300
A dream.

32
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:15,760
A dream?

33
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:17,428
Make everything...

34
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:23,434
that happened from two months ago
when we first met to this moment a dream.

35
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,440
Everything will be solved if we go back
to the time when we never met.

36
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,693
If I don't know you,

37
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:33,695
I won't look for you

38
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,780
or think about you.

39
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,783
Then you won't be pulled into this world.

40
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,327
I won't learn the truth from you.

41
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,414
I won't shoot your father.

42
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,291
The killer won't get out.

43
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,543
No one will be in danger.

44
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,838
And most importantly,

45
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,759
you shouldn't die.

46
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,847
I can't watch you die again.

47
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,522
Give this to your father.

48
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,614
It's too bad that we only got to do
four romantic things.

49
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,660
I had over 100 more to do for you.

50
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,208
I want to hug you,

51
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,169
but I can't do that.

52
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:37,008
It may make me change my mind.

53
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,094
Are you going somewhere?

54
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,317
We're running out of time,
and this is the only sure way.

55
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,446
Yeon-joo,

56
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,867
forget me.

57
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,329
I am just a webtoon character.

58
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,169
Take care.

59
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,377
Who am I?

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,046
Who am I?

61
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,132
Where is Chul?

62
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,551
Who am I?

63
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:02,927
Why won't you say who I am?

64
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,971
Who am I?

65
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,889
Tell me who I am!

66
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,064
You betrayed me.

67
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,364
Sir?

68
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:25,199
Sir, is everything okay?

69
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,787
Sir.

70
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,831
Why didn't you keep your word?

71
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,334
You said you'd find me.

72
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,294
Sir? Are you okay?

73
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:37,962
Who am I?

74
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,881
Tell me who I am.

75
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,799
Give me my face!

76
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:47,638
Sir?

77
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,642
Sir! Are you okay?

78
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:53,102
Sir!

79
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,069
Sir, are you okay?

80
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,987
I heard some noise.

81
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,373
After we parted,

82
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,545
the real killer disappeared from my world.

83
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,137
We found two drowning victims
at the south end of the Hangang Bridge.

84
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,181
We found two drowning victims
at the south end of the Hangang Bridge.

85
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,850
They're both male in their 20s.

86
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,356
Three people lost their lives,

87
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,942
but there were no more victims.

88
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,569
I can't believe this.

89
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,029
Ms. Gil, you should go back!

90
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:31,409
-You can't--
-I don't know what you're saying!

91
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,078
How can Yeon-joo disappear
while in the car with you?

92
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,913
Ms. Gil, it's dangerous here!
You can't go in!

93
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,540
-Seriously!
-Ms. Gil!

94
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:40,084
-Ms. Gil!
-Where is your car?

95
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,044
Ms. Gil, no! Ms. Gil!

96
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,338
Ms. Gil! It's dangerous! Don't go!

97
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,339
Ms. Gil!

98
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:48,718
Shoot! Why won't she listen to me?

99
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:49,635
Ms. Gil.

100
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,347
It's that car, right?

101
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,226
Ms. Gil, please don't go. It's dangerous!

102
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,401
Yeon-joo! Oh, my gosh!

103
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,279
Oh, no. Yeon-joo, wake up!

104
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:11,365
Yeon-joo! Wake up!

105
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,702
-Yeon-joo!
-Mom and Su-bong were safe.

106
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,224
And the characters in the webtoon

107
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,267
didn't disappear.

108
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,603
Not a single one.

109
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,776
Four new chapters went up overnight.

110
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,611
Yeon-joo almost got shot.

111
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,905
He appeared out of nowhere and shot her.

112
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:43,583
Who is it?

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,834
It's me.

114
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,502
Who...

115
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,223
Why are you here?

116
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:02,727
I thought you went
to New Zealand yesterday.

117
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,687
I just came back right away.

118
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,522
May I come in?

119
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,652
Come in.

120
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,576
What happened?

121
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:19,869
Where's Yeon-joo?

122
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,122
She's in her room. She's sick in bed.

123
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,249
Did Su-bong tell you?

124
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:40,473
She had passed out
after drawing something inside the car.

125
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,183
She's unbelievable.

126
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:45,269
I took her to the ER,
and we just got back.

127
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,439
I don't know what is going on.

128
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,192
She won't tell me
what she was drawing inside that car.

129
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,194
And Su-bong keeps talking gibberish.

130
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,697
I don't understand
what he was so scared of.

131
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,660
By the way, why did you come back?

132
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,287
I thought you would stay there
for at least a month.

133
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:07,833
Excuse me.

134
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,943
What foolishness is this?

135
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:47,123
GIVE THIS TO YOUR FATHER.

136
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,227
USB DRIVE CONNECTED

137
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,478
TO MR. OH SEONG-MOO

138
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,366
It's such a mess.

139
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,036
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

140
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,276
To Mr. Oh Seong-moo.

141
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,334
I heard you're alive.

142
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,753
I'm also alive.

143
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,174
I'm glad that you're alive,

144
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,343
but I won't apologize.

145
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,969
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE ALIVE

146
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,055
I don't deserve to be forgiven,

147
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,682
but you don't have the right
to forgive me either.

148
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,018
That rude punk.

149
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:36,315
I'm writing not to apologize,
but to make an offer.

150
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,611
We have something
that we must end together.

151
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,286
We're going to get some fresh air.

152
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,716
I'll accept the shitty fate
you've given me,

153
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:06,053
so you should do what you need to do

154
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,389
instead of running away.

155
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:12,142
If it's for your daughter and not me,

156
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,852
you can do it this time.

157
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,479
GIVE W A HAPPY ENDING.

158
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,939
Give W a happy ending.

159
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,321
Mom, go sleep in your room.

160
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,240
Are you awake?

161
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,035
Are you all right?

162
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,996
Why are you sleeping there?
It's uncomfortable.

163
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,958
It's all right. I don't want to move.

164
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,758
Your dad stopped by.

165
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,596
-When?
-Around 11 p.m.

166
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:35,517
Gosh, he said he would stay
in New Zealand for a month,

167
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,686
but he suddenly came back.

168
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,397
I wonder what's going on.

169
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,358
We're checking every surveillance camera
and dash cams within a 5km radius.

170
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:49,818
We're checking everything.

171
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:51,528
Why can't we find it, then?

172
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,405
I'm frustrated, too.

173
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,074
-Hello.
-Hey.

174
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,035
So, Chul, how do you feel?

175
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,914
I just can't stay awake.
I must be all drugged up.

176
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,378
I think

177
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:11,632
the dream stayed
in his subconscious for a while.

178
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,054
Therefore, I was able to see Chul
a few more times after that.

179
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,598
Although...

180
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,476
it was always very brief.

181
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,002
KANG CHUL

182
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,439
I'm going to take your blood pressure.

183
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,764
Where's your surgical cap?

184
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,183
Oh, that's right.

185
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,561
Hey. What is that? Are you wearing a ring?

186
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,440
Do you want a beating?
You're always in the OR.

187
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,902
Wow, that looks really nice.

188
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,362
Did you steal it from someone?

189
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,823
Did you get married secretly
without telling the professor?

190
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,202
How could she get married
when she doesn't have a boyfriend?

191
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,330
I knew it right away when I saw
how she was on the blind date.

192
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:09,917
She's one of those people
who will stay single forever.

193
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,878
I hear there are many
single old women who live with cats.

194
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,339
She's following their exact path.

195
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,217
-Strangely enough, I agree.
-Right?

196
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,887
-Get it together, or you're dead.
-I'm sorry.

197
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,190
The third time I saw him was a week later.

198
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:35,901
In Chul's world,

199
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,320
it was after two months.

200
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,876
Oh, I'm sorry.

201
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:58,966
Are you okay?

202
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,107
I'm sorry I didn't see you.

203
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,278
What a pretty ring.

204
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,461
Hello? I'm by the entrance.

205
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:38,463
I see you.

206
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,677
-Why were you so late?
-I was stuck in traffic.

207
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:44,886
Are you all better now?

208
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,930
-No.
-Why not?

209
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,931
It still hurts.

210
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,975
What did you do
these past two months, then?

211
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,238
Who is she?

212
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,159
I don't know. I've never seen her before,
but she keeps staring at me.

213
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,661
She looks sad.

214
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,164
Maybe she's one of your past lovers.

215
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,708
Perhaps you hurt her and dumped her.

216
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,752
Punk.

217
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:19,880
Let's go.

218
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,073
Just as I drew it,

219
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,743
Chul forgot everything.

220
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,931
Why aren't you inside yet?

221
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,184
Hey, what's wrong?

222
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,610
As he got better and busier,

223
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,863
Chul didn't even have dreams anymore.

224
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:29,533
He completely

225
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,203
forgot about me.

226
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,805
He was infinitely devastated.

227
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,814
LIFE IS SOMETIMES...

228
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,482
He had lost his direction in life.

229
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,698
Chul depended on the power of love
in order to live.

230
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,117
But that man is gone now.

231
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,200
He went back

232
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,786
to being the man
the readers know and love.

233
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,125
It's Chul again. Shit.

234
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,129
Why are they always together?

235
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,923
Our main character

236
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,634
who is always strong

237
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,345
and never discouraged.

238
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,792
W PROJECT REPORT NO. 1

239
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,229
It was too sudden,

240
00:26:04,312 --> 00:26:07,148
so Seon-mi and Yun-hui
can't come before Wednesday.

241
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,525
The two of us can do it.

242
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,030
But Mr. Oh...

243
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,743
Actually, I was on the way
back to my hometown.

244
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:23,123
I am going to give up drawing cartoons.

245
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,083
I am seriously scared.

246
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,211
I have not slept well

247
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,505
ever since you were shot.

248
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:35,051
I don't understand why
my life has to be in danger

249
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,636
just for drawing cartoons.

250
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,348
I went to churches
as well as Buddhist temples.

251
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,226
I even got myself talismans.

252
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,149
But I still don't feel at peace.

253
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,444
I'm seriously scared to even come here--

254
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,529
I called you because
I want to end it right.

255
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,952
I will go shave now.

256
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,290
I plan to end W with a happy ending.

257
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,876
A happy ending?

258
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,754
Chul will find the real killer
and punish him.

259
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,256
We will get rid of the killer forever.

260
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,842
Otherwise, we don't know
what will happen again.

261
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,970
Are we killing the killer?

262
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:22,349
He killed three real people
and even tried to kill my daughter.

263
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,600
We can't just leave him be.

264
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,478
Even though he's a killer, I created him.

265
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,230
It's only right that I end him.

266
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:33,860
In order to get rid of the killer,

267
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,696
you have to create his identity first.

268
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,282
He can't be like a ghost as he is now.

269
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,909
He has to be a human I can catch.

270
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:47,791
I am attaching a copy
of all the W Project reports.

271
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:48,875
W PROJECT REPORTS

272
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:52,837
The reports include investigation records
of 353 suspects.

273
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,842
You have to create someone
that is not in the reports.

274
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,595
Only then will I accept it,

275
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:03,765
and only when I accept it,
can this webtoon end.

276
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,398
W PROJECT REPORTS

277
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,236
You have to read every single one.

278
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,530
And we have to eliminate
all overlapping setups,

279
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,782
or Chul will get suspicious.

280
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,242
If Chul becomes suspicious,

281
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,995
the curse will begin again.

282
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,122
Mr. Oh,

283
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,125
we made it a perfect crime.
So how do we create the killer?

284
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,711
Whatever evidence we come up with,
there will always be a flaw.

285
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:36,089
There will be flaws. We can't help that.

286
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,886
So we must come up with a face
that Chul can believe despite the flaws.

287
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,222
A face that Chul can believe?

288
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,557
I already picked the face.

289
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:56,359
He is the only person
Chul will accept as the real killer.

290
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,968
Mr. Kang, shall I prepare breakfast?

291
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,888
-In ten minutes, after I wash up.
-Okay.

292
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,986
-Hello?
-Where are you?

293
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:40,987
I'm still at the hotel.

294
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:43,406
-I finally got something.
-What?

295
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,035
There was a man who came
from the hotel rooftop that night.

296
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,995
He was caught on
a delivery truck's dash cam.

297
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,349
Chul.

298
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,856
You said they checked everything
but found nothing for two months.

299
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,442
I know, but they missed one.

300
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,904
The bakery truck delivering ingredients
to the hotel kitchen.

301
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,385
I called you because I wanted
to add it to the show today

302
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,970
if it is a lead.

303
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,389
It has to be right.

304
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,432
Look at the face.

305
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:55,520
That guy.

306
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:00,733
Zoom in a little.

307
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,780
More. A little more.

308
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,168
This is...

309
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,172
He kind of looks similar to you.

310
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,967
That's right. It is me.

311
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,845
You're using yourself

312
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,639
as the real killer?

313
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,600
He won't believe it if it's not me.

314
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,146
Let's stop this now!

315
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,653
I'm the only suspect he saw.

316
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,989
He'll believe it if he sees my face.

317
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,659
Yes. I know him.

318
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,413
He stabbed me on the roof.

319
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,125
I thought I had imagined it
since they didn't find anything.

320
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,335
How was he caught on this?

321
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,795
You said other surveillance cameras
didn't catch anything.

322
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,256
That doesn't matter now.
At least one camera caught him.

323
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,216
This is unbelievable.

324
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,262
Let's air it on the show today.
Getting tips from the public is faster.

325
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,723
-Call Mr. Park.
-Yes, sir.

326
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,873
-Hey, Yeon-joo. Have you seen it?
-Pardon?

327
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,958
Have you seen W?

328
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,126
No, not yet.

329
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,544
The king has returned.

330
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:47,090
The Great Oh Seong-moo has returned.

331
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,427
After that idiot Yeon-joo disappeared,
the story is going great.

332
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,804
Haven't you seen it yet?

333
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:58,518
I was really disappointed
as I watched W get ruined.

334
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,105
I couldn't say anything
because the author was injured.

335
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:05,984
And frankly, the recent storyline
was absolute rubbish.

336
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,319
It was a third-rate childish
cheap romance.

337
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,113
It didn't make any sense.

338
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:13,908
But now, Mr. Oh
has finally come to his senses.

339
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,869
Everything was just a dream.

340
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,749
This is a fresh start.

341
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,168
Chul will catch the killer
and then marry So-hee.

342
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,670
That's how it should be.

343
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,422
Gosh. It's only right.

344
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,966
Doesn't that sound nice?

345
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:34,679
That's right.
Your father is in good health, right?

346
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,640
Tell him not to strain himself.

347
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:42,061
And tell him that I'm looking
forward to his work very much. Okay?

348
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,439
-All right.
-Okay!

349
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,359
Chul's action! Chul loves So-hee,
Chul hates Yeon-joo!

350
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,944
Oh, wait.

351
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:54,282
Why does the killer
look exactly like Mr. Oh?

352
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,535
-Pardon?
-He looks like Mr. Oh.

353
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,038
Could it be...

354
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:06,794
It's like Hitchcock's movie, right?
He's leaving his face in his work.

355
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,757
Gosh. W is driving me crazy.

356
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,884
The killer has the author's face.

357
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,802
Gosh, W.

358
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,183
It's the best!

359
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,477
W! Yes!

360
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,319
He's giving it a happy ending?

361
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,447
No. He said he will finish it
in four chapters.

362
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,032
What you saw is the first.

363
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,618
What kind of happy ending?

364
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:42,163
Well, now that Mr. Oh has left a clue,

365
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,583
they'll catch him using the broadcast.

366
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,669
Please take a careful look
at this picture.

367
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,300
This is the prime suspect
of the assault on Mr. Kang Chul

368
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,928
at the Seoul Prime Hotel on May 22nd.

369
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,348
He seems to be
in his late 50s to early 60s.

370
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,267
On the day of the assault,

371
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:07,522
he was wearing a gray hooded jacket,
an olive green T-shirt, and navy trousers.

372
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:11,567
He wears glasses and has a gray beard.

373
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:15,279
He seems to be around 175cm tall.

374
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:19,158
If you have seen him
or know his whereabouts,

375
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,660
please call us.

376
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,374
-Goodness.
-Does he live in our neighborhood?

377
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:29,502
They finally found him.
His name is Han Sang-hun, 61 years old.

378
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,879
He was Chul's father's teammate
on the shooting team.

379
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,298
He felt that he was being
overshadowed by Chul's father.

380
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,468
He has been seeing a psychiatrist
for a while for paranoia.

381
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:38,594
He's basically crazy.

382
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,680
POLICE LINE

383
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,034
They also found all kinds of evidence
in his residence.

384
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:05,163
Chul's blood, a knife with
his fingerprints, Chul's family photo,

385
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,747
and even records of his crime.

386
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:08,791
I found them!

387
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,131
Please keep it short.

388
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:16,883
Thank you.

389
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,193
I killed your family.

390
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,907
Your father was a rude
and arrogant douchebag.

391
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,828
The day before it happened,

392
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:50,625
I ran into him at a bar after five years.

393
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,461
That asshole was still
just as condescending.

394
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,630
That's why I killed him.

395
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,636
I went in to kill just your father,

396
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,597
but I ended up killing everyone.

397
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,225
I would've killed you as well
if you were there.

398
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,105
I thought I'd get caught soon after,

399
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:17,443
but the prosecutor insisted
you were the killer.

400
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,528
I don't know if he was stupid

401
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,240
or if he was up to something.

402
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,700
Either way, it was good for me.

403
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,537
I never thought

404
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,166
you'd keep hunting me for over ten years.

405
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,335
I got sick of it.

406
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,505
That's why I called you to the roof
and stabbed you.

407
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,508
But you didn't die.

408
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:42,927
Why didn't you die?

409
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,014
Maybe I should've shot you
like I shot your parents.

410
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,099
You asshole!

411
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,776
That's not the end.

412
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,906
We should kill and eliminate the killer
within the webtoon

413
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,199
to prevent future trouble.

414
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,661
Is Chul going to kill him in vengeance?

415
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,664
That's not a happy ending.

416
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,749
A villain must be killed

417
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,002
by another villain.

418
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,255
The murder case of Mr. Kang's family
has been aired

419
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,007
several times over the past five years.

420
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,591
I'm sure everyone remembers.

421
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,137
After a long and tiring chase,
the truth finally came to light.

422
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,974
Ten years and two months
after the incident,

423
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:33,144
the suspect, Han, finally confessed
to his crime on August 20th.

424
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,649
He already confessed. It's over now.

425
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,567
No!

426
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,821
No. That's not right, sir.

427
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,907
Chul must have bribed him.
That's not true.

428
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,535
Look here, it's game over now.

429
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:52,163
You lost to Chul.

430
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,998
You need to resign.

431
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:58,919
Are you telling me to step down
after getting this far?

432
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:02,548
Don't drag everyone down with you.

433
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,009
You are on your own now.

434
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,848
Han Cheol-ho misses his chance
to be the next president

435
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,308
and loses his mind.

436
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,811
He wants me...

437
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:17,980
to step down?

438
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,492
Hello.

439
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,702
It's me.

440
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,372
How are your boys doing these days?

441
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,804
He kills the killer
under the guise of suicide.

442
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,936
Wait.

443
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,687
Stop!

444
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,739
He even makes a fake suicide note
that says

445
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,409
Chul bribed him
to make a false confession.

446
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,537
He told me to do it.

447
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,288
He told me to make a fake suicide note.

448
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,374
He makes me do things like that at times.

449
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,834
He didn't tell me to kill him,

450
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,044
but that's what he meant.

451
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,547
Who are you talking about?

452
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,633
Han Cheol-ho, the one
running for president.

453
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,094
Chul turns the tables on him.

454
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:35,975
Sir, is that true?

455
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,577
THE POLICE WILL ERADICATE CRIME

456
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,578
He's here.

457
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:01,000
-What was your motive?
-Why did you kill him?

458
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:02,668
Is what the man said true?

459
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,879
-Wait.
-Please say something!

460
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,755
HAN CHEOL-HO ARRESTED FOR MURDER

461
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,674
The killer dies,
and Cheol-ho goes to prison.

462
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,176
It's a clean triumph of good over evil.

463
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,095
What do you think? Would people like it?

464
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:14,722
They'll love it.

465
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,764
I know, right?

466
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,269
If this goes well,
I may finally be able to sleep well.

467
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,396
This is how it was supposed to be
in the first place.

468
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,231
Nothing would've happened, then.

469
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,277
-Is that the end?
-What?

470
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,738
What's the last scene?

471
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,740
Chul's love story...

472
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,286
We thought Chul's love story
needed an ending, too.

473
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:39,788
How?

474
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,791
Will he...

475
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:44,752
marry So-hee?

476
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,379
No. Nothing that extreme.

477
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,475
TO CHUL

478
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,106
Chul, congratulations on fulfilling
your heartfelt wish.

479
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,067
You've worked hard.

480
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:11,320
I'm glad my wish for you
came true as well.

481
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,863
Your longtime friend, So-hee.

482
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,249
What was with that mature letter?

483
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,711
Where are you?

484
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:30,923
Okay.

485
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,138
So-hee!

486
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,217
We'll hint that they'll get together,
and end it there.

487
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,221
Hello?

488
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,599
Yeon-joo, are you still there?

489
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:24,268
I see.

490
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:28,105
Please answer immediately.
I almost had a heart attack.

491
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,858
It feels so futile, Su-bong.

492
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,778
No one remembers me there,

493
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:38,616
and no one in this world
knows what I went through.

494
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,994
I don't even have a single picture.

495
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:45,748
I was an idiot and didn't even take
a single picture.

496
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,628
Do you know

497
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,589
what I did yesterday?

498
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:01,972
THE FINAL CHAPTER
IS COMING OUT IN AUGUST?

499
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,089
YEON-JOO?

500
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:58,570
STAB

501
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,369
STAB

502
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,998
I'm asking for a truce.

503
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,000
Sorry for what I did a while ago.

504
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,217
Answer me.

505
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,095
Where do you live?

506
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,471
ANSWER ME.
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

507
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,806
You will regret it.

508
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,379
Is this sweet?

509
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,382
I love it.

510
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,185
Oh, my gosh.

511
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:14,771
It says to read like this.

512
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,446
I'm tying your shoes.

513
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:26,408
Did I do four sweet things now?

514
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,618
DID I DO FOUR SWEET THINGS NOW?

515
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,411
This isn't the time for homework.

516
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,395
Have some watermelon.

517
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:57,689
What are you doing?

518
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:03,695
What is all that? It looks messy.

519
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,155
Act your age.

520
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,408
Take them down. It's ugly.

521
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,162
Put up photos of your real boyfriend
instead, will you?

522
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:33,934
Isn't it ridiculous?

523
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,230
Let's talk later, Su-bong.

524
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,023
Chul.

525
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,151
How are you?

526
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,739
Are you happy these days?

527
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,910
I'm not.

528
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,917
Every day that goes by...

529
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,879
Yeon-joo.

530
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,009
-Are you going to sleep?
-Yes, for ten minutes.

531
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,135
What about dinner?

532
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,095
I'm sleepy.

533
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,930
Okay, see you.

534
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,239
Code Black, Code Black emergency.

535
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,408
Shooting victims will arrive soon.

536
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,327
There are too many victims
for the ER to handle.

537
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,913
Doctors of all departments
who are not on duty,

538
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:20,666
please come to the emergency room now.

539
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,958
Code Black emergency.

540
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,336
-What's going on?
-Shooting victims will arrive soon.

541
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,421
There are too many victims
for the ER to handle.

542
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,549
Doctors of all departments
who are not on duty...

543
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,884
HANKUK SUNGJIN MEDICAL CENTER

544
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,265
There was a shooting?

545
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,103
Didn't you see the news? There was
a shooting at a broadcasting station.

546
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,270
At a broadcasting station?

547
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,275
We have emergency patients!

548
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,860
-Move out of the way.
-Please move.

549
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,862
-Go straight.
-Hello?

550
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:52,948
So-hee!

551
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,702
He got shot in the stomach.

552
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:01,707
What's this?

553
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:04,042
Why am I here again?

554
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,336
It hasn't been confirmed yet,

555
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,088
but eight people died

556
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,966
and more than 15 people were injured.

557
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,467
I repeat.

558
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,177
A shooter opened fire

559
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:19,391
inside W's recording studio
around 6 p.m. today.

560
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,352
The shooter hasn't been identified.

561
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,938
And despite containing the area,

562
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,023
the shooter managed to flee the scene.

563
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:32,028
All the victims were staff members of W.

564
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,698
There were about 23 people
at the crime scene,

565
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:39,119
yet the culprit shot everyone
in the studio in less than five minutes.

566
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,747
Currently, eight people
were confirmed dead.

567
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,582
The 15 people who were injured

568
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,168
are being treated
Hankuk Sungjin Medical Center.

569
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,044
-What's going on?
-Seven are in critical condition.

570
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:51,381
-This isn't what's supposed to happen.
-We predict the death count to rise.

571
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,593
Here's the list of people
who were confirmed to be deceased.

572
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,387
The host of the program...

573
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,347
What's the current situation?

574
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,016
Who died?

575
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,894
I'm a doctor!

576
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,485
It's an emergency.

577
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,445
Please hurry up!

578
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,280
It's an emergency.

579
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,367
Out of the way!

580
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:50,690
Please take a look at her.

581
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,860
She got shot in the leg and is in
great pain. Please do something.

582
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,197
It hurts.

583
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,324
Dr. "Oh Yeon-joo"?

584
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,868
Dr. Oh.

585
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,788
Can't you hear me?

586
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,916
Please do something! Are you deaf?

587
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,798
Just a minute.

588
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,240
How is she?

589
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,205
She needs surgery,
but she's not bleeding much,

590
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:49,291
so she'll survive.

591
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,379
I'm sorry I yelled a while ago.

592
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:58,675
What about you? Are you hurt?

593
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,094
I'm not.

594
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,722
I saw in the news...

595
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:05,932
Oh, that's a false report.

596
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,150
I remember you.

597
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:19,279
You dropped that ring before, didn't you?

598
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,536
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

599
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:34,544
Because I don't know why I am here.

600
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,634
Mr. Kang!

601
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:45,972
How is Mr. Son?

602
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,142
He's in surgery. May we talk?

603
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:50,727
Let's go.

604
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,767
I'm back, Mr. Oh!

605
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,478
Mr. Oh?

606
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,064
Have some pork trotters.

607
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,782
Mr. Oh, I bought some pork trotters.

608
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,868
Is he sleeping?

609
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:50,870
Sir?

610
00:54:51,663 --> 00:54:52,747
Is that you, Su-bong?

611
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,169
It's me, Su-bong.

612
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:02,882
Su-bong.

613
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:08,346
SU-BONG

614
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,597
My face disappeared.

615
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,559
Su-bong.

616
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:14,352
What the...

617
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,734
Help me, Su-bong.

618
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,820
He took my face.

619
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,573
Where did my face go?

620
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,744
Su-bong.

621
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,496
Su-bong?

622
00:55:34,539 --> 00:55:35,415
Sit down.

623
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,591
Please take a close look at this picture.

624
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:50,305
This is the prime suspect
of the assault on Mr. Kang Chul

625
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:53,016
at the Seoul Prime Hotel on May 22nd.

626
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,101
On the day of the assault,

627
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:59,731
he was wearing a gray hooded jacket,
an olive green T-shirt, and navy trousers.

628
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:03,109
He wears glasses and has a gray beard.

629
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:06,071
He seems to be around 175cm tall.

630
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,365
If you have seen him
or know his whereabouts--

631
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,202
-What happened?
-What happened?

632
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,245
What happened?

633
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,830
-Did he collapse?
-Did he collapse?

634
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:16,748
What's wrong with him?

635
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,458
What's going on?

636
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:19,918
We're not sure.

637
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,503
Please wait.

638
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:27,258
-What happened?
-What?

639
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,803
See what's wrong with him!

640
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:34,474
What's going on here?

641
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,975
Shit!

642
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,977
Who are you?

643
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:44,984
Request assistance.

644
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,465
Chul.

645
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:10,927
Are you there?

646
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,638
Can you hear me?

647
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,436
I had to come because you were looking
so desperately for me.

648
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,646
I wanted to show you my face.

649
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,943
You suffered a lot because I didn't appear
for ten years, didn't you?

650
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,154
It was painful for me, too.

651
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,239
I wanted to appear in front of you,
but I had no means to.

652
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,743
This is me.

653
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,079
How's my face?

654
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,206
I love it so much.

655
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:46,463
I'll see you often.

656
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:03,688
Breaking news.

657
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:08,234
The face of the shooting suspect
has been released.

658
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:12,989
The man is presumed to be in his 60s,
and his identity is still unknown.

659
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,533
The police launched a manhunt
for the suspect.

660
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:21,039
Around 6 p.m. today,
he opened fire in W's studio.

661
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,930
Please help!

662
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,947
The killer must pay for this.

663
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,740
And now the killer has committed
a mass murder.

664
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:39,867
Who are you? Why are you here?

665
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,953
Why am I still here?

666
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,416
Yeon-joo, it's been bothering me.

667
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,626
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

668
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,588
How is this a happy ending?

669
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,923
I don't know why we bothered breaking up.

670
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,341
I know it all.

671
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,678
Shall I tell you what will happen
to the both of us from now on?

672
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,014
We will kill each other.

673
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,849
I want to know the truth.

674
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,560
Are you suspecting me right now?

675
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:11,065
