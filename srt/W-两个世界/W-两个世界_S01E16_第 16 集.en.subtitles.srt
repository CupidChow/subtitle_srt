1
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,460
Requesting assistance.

2
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,295
The suspect is with someone.

3
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,758
Please confirm the vehicle.
The vehicle number is 28M4740.

4
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,509
Once again, 28M4740.

5
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,638
I was drawing Han Cheol-ho's video.
Let's give it to the police first.

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,599
We can circulate it via e-mail.

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,770
Let's report
where they're keeping Do-yoon as well.

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,438
They can catch Cheol-ho there.

9
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,355
Not now.

10
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,774
Why not?

11
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,693
With a happy ending like that,

12
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,404
your father will cease to exist.

13
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,868
My happy ending
is a sad ending for the killer.

14
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,664
The problem is that
whatever ending we might have,

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:23,083
either your father or I

16
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,044
won't be by your side.

17
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,297
We'll either die...

18
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,674
or disappear.

19
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,977
We need to make a decision

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,605
on what kind of ending it'll be.

21
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,191
What ending should it be?

22
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,085
What are you doing?

23
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,296
Why did you remove our rings?

24
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,008
What are you trying to do?

25
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,222
It's too cruel

26
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,643
for a father to have to kill his daughter
to avoid ceasing to exist.

27
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,353
That can't happen.

28
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,356
I'll remove you from my family.

29
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,944
You're free now.
You're safe no matter how this ends.

30
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,738
You need to make a choice now.

31
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,032
What kind of ending will it be?

32
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,581
I will follow your decision.

33
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,362
Who said you could remove me
from your family?

34
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,198
Why would you say such nonsense?

35
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:28,958
An ending where one of us
disappears is not an ending.

36
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,502
Why does it have to be that way?

37
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,297
We can all...

38
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,633
go back together.

39
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,177
You'll live here forever?

40
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:40,887
The three of us...

41
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:42,931
can live together.

42
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,558
How can we live together?

43
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:49,604
I'll have to go to prison,
and so will your father.

44
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,815
Both your father and I
will stay in prison for life.

45
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,030
If you behave well,
they might reduce your term.

46
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,742
That doesn't mean we'll be happy here.

47
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,245
We will only see each other
during prison visitation.

48
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,872
What's wrong with that?

49
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,336
It's better than not being able to see
each other at all. What's wrong with that?

50
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,090
Such a normal ending is impossible.

51
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,216
It's possible.

52
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,886
My dad

53
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,888
and you.

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,726
I need both of you beside me.
I can't imagine anything else.

55
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,689
You can die of sickness or old age.

56
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,401
Just live like that until you die

57
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,194
like everyone else.

58
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,571
We'll live a normal life like them.

59
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:43,992
You told me to decide.

60
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,911
That's my decision.

61
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,672
Draw a back door and a car.

62
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:03,094
Since you can't make a decision now,
we should leave this place first.

63
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:25,033
Remember what you told me back then?

64
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,164
You said your husband
never told you that he loved you.

65
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:36,711
I love you.

66
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,118
FREEDOM MOTEL

67
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,422
I have to get Do-yoon out first.

68
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,132
Stay here for a while.

69
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:52,120
Sir, what happened?
The police are after you.

70
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,413
Why is Do-yoon here?

71
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:57,375
Wait here for a while.

72
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,635
Chul is here.

73
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,762
Okay.

74
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,518
Chul is here.

75
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,356
-What about the tablet?
-He wants to see this guy first.

76
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:24,861
Okay.

77
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,914
Do-yoon!

78
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,294
Do-yoon.

79
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,924
-Take him straight to the hospital.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,259
How about you, sir?

81
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,569
Where is the tablet?

82
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,029
I don't have it.

83
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,624
I'll give you this instead.

84
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,382
It has all kinds of videos
including one of you torturing me.

85
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:29,759
See for yourself.

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,263
I won't have you arrested right away.

87
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,016
But if you bother my people again,
I won't let it pass.

88
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,977
I have a lot of copies.

89
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,148
Also know that catching me alone
won't really do anything.

90
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,985
And stop looking for the tablet.

91
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,531
Unless you really want to get a shot
in your neck.

92
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,911
By the way,

93
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,207
I heard this ends only when you die.

94
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,042
What?

95
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,402
What are you doing, sir?

96
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,150
I heard something strange
while waiting for you.

97
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,194
Two different worlds.

98
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,698
You guys wait outside.

99
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,241
Pardon?

100
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,495
Can't you hear me? Wait outside.

101
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,039
Yes, sir.

102
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,975
Do-yoon seems to have heard
some nonsense from you.

103
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,521
He said you were the main character
of a webtoon and I was the villain.

104
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,733
That the tablet belongs
to the artist who drew it.

105
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,486
And that the webtoon
was drawn by Oh Seong-moo.

106
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,497
I thought he had lost his mind,

107
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,500
but it somehow makes sense.

108
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,003
Everything that happened here a year ago

109
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,214
was indeed very strange!

110
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,633
Hey.

111
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:18,427
How do you think I feel now?

112
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,222
The election doesn't matter to me now.

113
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,224
Not when there is another world.

114
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,226
I was curious.

115
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,354
You could appear and disappear at will.

116
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,982
Why couldn't you escape
when I was beating you to death?

117
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:35,236
And why would you rot away in prison?

118
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,571
Why?

119
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,075
Why? Why is that?

120
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,702
Why?

121
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,121
Just why?

122
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,916
I thought it was because
you didn't have the tablet.

123
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,919
But it was because
this is the final chapter.

124
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,631
I drugged Do-yoon,
and he told me everything.

125
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:57,174
It was because this is the final chapter.

126
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,009
So,

127
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,763
either the main character
or the villain has to die for it to end.

128
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:06,058
I can go into that world
only after it ends.

129
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:14,942
Hey.

130
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,610
Hey.

131
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,489
I know one thing for sure.

132
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,533
There is another world.

133
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,786
I went there once thanks to you.

134
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,372
I need to check out that world
more thoroughly.

135
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,666
And apparently, you need to die
for me to do that.

136
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,754
Do-yoon wouldn't have lied
to me to kill you.

137
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,174
All right.

138
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,217
Okay.

139
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,224
I don't need you anymore.

140
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,353
I can find out the truth myself
once I go there.

141
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,860
Die! Die, you jerk.

142
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,820
Die!

143
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,824
Sir, what's going on in there?

144
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,286
Sir, what's going on?

145
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,829
-Here is the key.
-Give it to me.

146
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,244
Have you idiots lost your mind?

147
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,204
Why did you let him go in alone?

148
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,290
He told us to take you to the hospital.
I thought he only went in to talk.

149
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,385
Mr. Kang's out.

150
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,178
Hurry up.

151
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,602
Stop him.

152
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,160
DO-YOON

153
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,042
Hello?

154
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,586
Yeon-joo?

155
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,172
Is that you, Do-yoon?
What happened? Did you get out?

156
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,300
Yes. I'm alive.

157
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,761
Thank goodness.

158
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,346
-What about Chul?
-Chul--

159
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,852
I thought you were with him.

160
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,312
No.

161
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,857
I saw him run away, but I can't reach him.

162
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:01,859
Where did he go?

163
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,152
I'm looking for him.

164
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,696
He definitely got out, though.

165
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,449
Please text me your address.

166
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,911
I will send some guys to guard you.

167
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,121
Okay.

168
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,506
The person you have reached
is not available.

169
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,523
Hello?

170
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,525
Can you...

171
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,736
pick me up?

172
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,738
Where are you?

173
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,168
My car ran out of gas.

174
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,754
I can't go on.

175
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,924
Where are you now?
Why didn't you answer your phone?

176
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,095
I fell asleep for a second.

177
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,055
You fell asleep?

178
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,392
Where are you?

179
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:20,896
I'm not sure.

180
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,607
I'm in front of a bus stop.

181
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,568
Are you hurt?

182
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,279
A little bit.

183
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,073
Which bus stop is it?

184
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,325
Tell me the name of it.
I'll be right there.

185
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:36,912
I can't really see.

186
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,375
I'll call you back.

187
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,837
Hello?

188
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:05,774
FREEDOM MOTEL

189
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:48,108
He just called.
I don't think he can drive right now.

190
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,402
I don't know where he is yet.

191
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,321
When will the guards get here?

192
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,656
Please take care of my dad.

193
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:19,473
DAESHIP-RI

194
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,954
CHUL

195
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:43,622
Hello?

196
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,835
Yangju...

197
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,421
Daeship-ri...

198
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,093
Bus stop.

199
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,514
Hang in there. I'll be right there.

200
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,745
I think I'll get there first.

201
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,081
I can't take him to a hospital.
What should I do?

202
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,208
I'll call his doctor.

203
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,169
Send him right over.

204
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,761
Hello?

205
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,559
Why aren't you coming?

206
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,813
I'm on my way,
but it's farther than I thought.

207
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,651
I'm waiting for you.

208
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,738
I'm on my way. I'll be there soon.

209
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,242
I don't think...

210
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,290
the final chapter
will be "50 Years Later."

211
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,011
That wasn't it after all.

212
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,891
Who would want such a boring ending?

213
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,484
Please come now.

214
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,363
I miss you.

215
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,241
I'm on my way.

216
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,994
I'm on my way to you now.

217
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,664
Please stay strong.

218
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,796
Please be strong. Please.

219
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,256
YEON-JOO

220
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,465
Do you hear me?

221
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,843
Hello?

222
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,513
Hello?

223
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,850
Do you hear me?

224
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,435
Hello?

225
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,879
I'm here!

226
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,637
Are you okay?

227
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,604
Are you okay?

228
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:21,965
DAESHIP-RI

229
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,646
DAESHIP-RI

230
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,004
Goodness.

231
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,756
What on earth?

232
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,802
How could no one answer their phone?

233
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,595
Goodness.

234
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,224
Seriously.

235
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,405
It disappeared.

236
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,874
FREEDOM MOTEL

237
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,876
I HEARD THIS ENDS ONLY WHEN YOU DIE.

238
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,680
Shit.

239
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,602
Yeon-joo.

240
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,402
Yeon-joo.

241
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:11,366
Yeon-joo, are you okay?

242
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,467
THE END

243
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,198
Hey, where's Yeon-joo?

244
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,074
-She's in the ER.
-The ER?

245
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,493
Tell her to come see me after.

246
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,496
No. Yeon-joo is being treated in the ER.

247
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,499
-What?
-I heard she fainted.

248
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:02,918
She fainted? Why?

249
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,262
Yeon-joo.

250
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,307
Why are you crying?

251
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,354
Is something wrong?

252
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,068
Welcome.

253
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,237
Have you seen

254
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,156
a man roaming around in a hospital gown?

255
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,033
-A hospital gown?
-Yes.

256
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,995
It's this man.

257
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,665
I'm sure he was somewhere here.
Have you seen him around?

258
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,916
I haven't seen him.

259
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,584
Does he have dementia?

260
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,546
No, he's from a mental hospital.

261
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,925
He's not sane right now,
so he's probably lost. We must find him.

262
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,137
Please help me. He must be
somewhere in this building.

263
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,097
Please help me look for him.

264
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,142
-He didn't come here.
-Could you please check?

265
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,459
Wait, I'm glad to see you
because I have a question for you.

266
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,378
Is that really the end of W?

267
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,298
Why did the main character die
instead of the villain?

268
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,258
I didn't want such a sad--

269
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,302
Please stop!

270
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,429
Shut your mouth!

271
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,264
If you say one more word...

272
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,482
What was that?

273
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:32,400
Gosh.

274
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,653
Why does he go crazy
every time he sees me?

275
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,906
I feel hurt again.

276
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,957
-Yeon-joo.
-Where's my dad?

277
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,001
He isn't at the motel.

278
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:54,339
W has ended,
so Mr. Oh should return like you, right?

279
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:59,094
But no one has seen him around.
I don't know what's going on.

280
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:06,601
What are you doing?
What's wrong, Yeon-joo?

281
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,769
Where are you going?

282
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:09,979
Yeon-joo.

283
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,253
Yeon-joo, I told you the tablet is gone.

284
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,173
It disappeared as soon as
the webtoon ended. It wasn't real anyway.

285
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,718
It was a drawn replica.

286
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,803
Even if it were here,

287
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:43,638
it wouldn't help.

288
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,975
You know it's finished when it says it is.

289
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,561
It's really the end.

290
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,137
Dad?

291
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,574
MISSING PERSON: OH SEONG-MOO

292
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,997
If you see this person, please contact me.

293
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,084
MISSING PERSON: OH SEONG-MOO

294
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,008
Hello.

295
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:47,846
If you see this person,
please give us a call.

296
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,932
Please. Thank you for your help.

297
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,442
Although Yeon-joo couldn't accept it,

298
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,905
after seven years of publication,

299
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,366
W ended in September of 2016.

300
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,745
KANG CHUL WINS GOLD
FOR MEN'S 50M PISTOL

301
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:16,624
I strongly urge the court to give
Kang Chul the death penalty.

302
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,545
As the main character, Chul,
was given a tough life upon birth.

303
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,756
He refused the fate given by the writer.

304
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,889
He even refused
the limitation of his existence.

305
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,019
He dreamed of a happy ending
as a human being, but...

306
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,698
Are you okay?

307
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:54,871
But he couldn't escape his fate
and was shot by the villain

308
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,791
and ended up dying in front
of the woman he loved.

309
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,383
Several journalists came to ask
about the ending,

310
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,386
but the writer wasn't there
to give the answers.

311
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,644
Even after the webtoon ended,
Mr. Oh didn't come back.

312
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:25,109
Most people didn't doubt the ending.

313
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:30,281
It was sad, but they considered it
a plausible sad ending.

314
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,534
However...

315
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,217
THE END

316
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,804
Nobody knew that it was not a sad ending.

317
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,233
What happened?

318
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,612
Sir.

319
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:13,658
Sir?

320
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,788
Sir!

321
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,959
What happened? What happened here?

322
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,627
Are you hurt?

323
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,349
Do-yoon, we just arrived.

324
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,102
He looks very serious.

325
00:33:41,978 --> 00:33:44,230
And I overheard them.

326
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,024
I think Mr. Kang got shot.

327
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,650
He got shot?

328
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,986
Han Cheol-ho shot him.
We didn't know earlier.

329
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,156
He must've bled a lot. What do we do?

330
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,534
Chul was shot by Han Cheol-ho?

331
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,164
Han Cheol-ho shot him?

332
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,498
Yes.

333
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,459
Where is Chul?

334
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,544
We don't know.
We're still looking for him.

335
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,714
That's Do-yoon, right? Let me talk to him.

336
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:12,175
Come on.

337
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,722
You want me to untie you?

338
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,307
Untie me right now.

339
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,018
Yeon-joo said to never untie you.

340
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,270
Please untie me.

341
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:27,648
No. If you need anything,
you can ask the guys.

342
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,609
You heard of the truth.

343
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,155
If I know the location,
it's faster to help him with a tablet.

344
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,077
Untie me. Please untie me!

345
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,667
He's not normal.

346
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,046
He can suddenly become aggressive.
Don't let your guards down.

347
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:50,963
Okay, sir.

348
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,243
He ran away?

349
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,079
You idiots lost a man who was shot?

350
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,706
Kill him on the spot.

351
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,168
You don't need to bring him here.
Just kill him as soon as you see him!

352
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,256
Sir, you can't do this.

353
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,341
Why are you creating more problems?

354
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,677
You can just let the police handle it.

355
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,512
This is not the right time.

356
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,850
Do you know when the right time is?

357
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,477
I can die any moment. What does it matter?

358
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,271
I could get killed any time.

359
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:52,316
That file Chul distributed
is enough to kill me tomorrow.

360
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,319
How will you stop him? How?

361
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:57,321
Get out.

362
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,490
Get lost, asshole!

363
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,393
-Sir.
-What is it?

364
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:30,313
A man named Oh Seong-moo is on the line.

365
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,397
Who?

366
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,274
He said you'd recognize his name.

367
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,532
Hello?

368
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,242
It's me.

369
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,745
Oh Seong-moo?

370
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,121
Yes.

371
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,124
I'm glad I caught you in your office.

372
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:54,670
You are Oh Seong-moo,
the one I saw at the hospital?

373
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,590
Yes. I'm the man who created you.

374
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,719
I created you.

375
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,971
As the villain.

376
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,517
What happened to you though?

377
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,520
You used to never get blood on your hands.

378
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,564
Yet you fired a gun.

379
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:18,027
How are you here?

380
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,781
The other time, I had to go there--

381
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,784
Did you shoot Chul
because you wanted to find me?

382
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,831
I was here all along.

383
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,167
Since a year ago.

384
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:40,716
What's this?

385
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,930
Do you also want to know
the reason for your existence?

386
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,351
When you have a lot of things
you want to find out,

387
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,980
you go crazy
because you can't satisfy the curiosity.

388
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,400
That's how the others were.

389
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,777
That's why I ended up like this.

390
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,113
But...

391
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,573
you shouldn't.

392
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,410
You wanted to be president.

393
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:12,665
What do you think will happen
to this world if you learn the truth?

394
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,376
You are a villain, too.

395
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,922
It's too dangerous.

396
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,135
You shall go with me.

397
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,306
I failed at everything,

398
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,934
but I'll get rid of you before leaving.

399
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:36,480
No.

400
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:37,732
Don't kill me.

401
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,027
Is anyone--

402
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,380
I'M SORRY TO EVERYONE

403
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:54,934
What is this?

404
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,728
"The truth behind
Son Hyeon-seok's murder"?

405
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,605
I got that, too.

406
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,677
Hello?

407
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,013
Did Yeon-joo go to Chul?

408
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,598
Yes.

409
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,852
Where are they? Tell me.

410
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,689
I want to see

411
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,442
my daughter one last time.

412
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,379
We can't

413
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,840
go together.

414
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,733
If it's happy for you,

415
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,902
it's sad for me.

416
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,414
I'm here!

417
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,897
I love you,

418
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:07,858
my dear daughter.

419
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:18,202
Goodbye.

420
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:35,886
W ended

421
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:38,889
not when Chul died,
but when the villains were gone.

422
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,017
The readers couldn't see
the villains' end.

423
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:46,355
Contrary to his reason for existence,
the killer helped Chul become happy.

424
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:51,402
Because of that paradox, his last moment
was edited out completely.

425
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,785
Isn't that him?

426
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,251
Chul!

427
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,503
-Sir!
-Chul!

428
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,005
Nobody knew

429
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,923
that Chul didn't die.

430
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,384
It was just that the webtoon ended
before he was saved.

431
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,358
Chul.

432
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,485
Chul.

433
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,823
How do you feel?

434
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,785
I thought you had died!

435
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,581
Yeon-joo.

436
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:47,666
She's not here.

437
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:49,084
I only found her car.

438
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,676
That's when Chul realized...

439
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,847
his role as the main character was over.

440
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:15,861
Well, I haven't checked on that.
I just arrived in Seoul.

441
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,489
I'll check that for you now.

442
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,240
Okay.

443
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,706
The video file of Congressman Han
abducting and torturing Kang,

444
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,668
the recorded call between him
and Han Sang-hun, the killer who died,

445
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,628
and the recorded call of him

446
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:36,215
inciting a gangster to murder
Kang are spreading on the Internet.

447
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,051
The police announced
that they're tracking the source.

448
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,846
After Congressman's Han's suicide
was reported on the news...

449
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,264
Han Cheol-ho died?

450
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,404
Hey, So-hee.

451
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,668
Are you okay? I heard you were shot.

452
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,922
I almost died, but they sent me here
as soon as I got better.

453
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:20,008
You were cleared of murder,
so your remaining sentence won't be long.

454
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,513
I'm sorry.

455
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,473
For what?

456
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,143
I suspected you and never called.

457
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:33,397
I would've suspected myself.
I pretended to be dead.

458
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,109
Your suspecting me and not calling

459
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,111
made me glad.

460
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,072
What do you mean?

461
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,660
You proved that you can
have a life on your own.

462
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,601
I couldn't find Mr. Oh Seong-moo.

463
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,147
I couldn't reach him after he called
and said he'd go see Yeon-joo.

464
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:16,482
The car was just left there.

465
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:20,402
-You couldn't find him?
-Not even a trace of him.

466
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,281
That's right. He left a letter for you.

467
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:27,117
I'll give it to you with a book.

468
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,213
To Chul.

469
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,467
I hoped you would let me go in peace,

470
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,012
but in the end,
I had to leave here myself.

471
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,016
I'm already dead.

472
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,561
My soul is terminally ill.

473
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,356
I can't be sure when I'll go crazy again.

474
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,402
I'm going to end my life here today.

475
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,158
You'll go out to the real world,

476
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,453
and I'll end my life here.

477
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,040
You'll become a human being...

478
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,710
and I'll be left as a webtoon character.

479
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,007
You'll escape the setting that I've made,

480
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,720
and I'll be trapped in the setting
I've made

481
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,222
and die.

482
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,851
Isn't life funny?

483
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,399
Please be happy.

484
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:44,319
And make Yeon-joo happy.

485
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:46,905
And...

486
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,658
if you see Yeon-joo,

487
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,828
tell her I'm still alive.

488
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,791
So that she won't be sad.

489
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,068
Tell her that...

490
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,948
I'm living happily in this world.

491
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,411
In the world of the webtoon I drew.

492
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,720
Chul spent two more years in prison

493
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,474
to end the world of W properly.

494
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,979
Time passed slowly.

495
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,446
Are you going out?

496
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,241
-I'm going to see a friend.
-You're sick. You should rest.

497
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,912
What happened to your dad?
It's been over a week now.

498
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,044
I'm sure he'll be back
if we wait a few more days.

499
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:50,487
Dad.

500
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:35,240
Hello?

501
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,161
Yes, this is Yeon-joo's phone.

502
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:43,457
She left her phone at home.

503
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,377
May I ask who's calling?

504
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,487
You're awake.

505
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,531
How do you feel?

506
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,124
I told your mom to go back home.

507
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:55,297
I thought she'd ask me many questions,

508
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,048
but she didn't say much.

509
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:01,011
I couldn't tell her I was your husband.

510
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:02,929
I said I was your boyfriend.

511
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,224
By the way,

512
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:10,687
was the last place you saw Yeon-joo
at a bus station?

513
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:12,981
Yes.

514
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,864
Pardon me, but what do you do?

515
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:21,907
Right.

516
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,543
I was in a hurry,
so I gave her this business card,

517
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,045
but she didn't say much.

518
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,094
I spent two years in prison,

519
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,180
but it's only been a week here.

520
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,559
I was worried that the time
would pass at the same rate.

521
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,690
I was worried you'd die
of sadness in those two years.

522
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,402
I was so relieved.

523
00:54:35,271 --> 00:54:36,731
What about my dad?

524
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,254
You know,

525
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,715
I'm three years older than you now.

526
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:31,137
So you have to accept that
and show me respect.

527
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,182
I've had three more tough years.

528
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:35,975
Okay, kid?

529
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,185
Gosh.

530
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,442
Did it...

531
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,320
really end?

532
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:49,781
It did.

533
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,825
It really...

534
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:55,995
ended, right?

535
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:00,917
It really ended.

536
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:33,491
Kang Chul's story in the webtoon
had a happy ending,

537
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:37,036
but the ending
of Chul and Yeon-joo's story

538
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,122
is unclear yet.

539
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:40,498
However...

540
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:44,961
The two will no longer be in danger
like in the webtoon.

541
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:49,007
Though it may be boring and ordinary,
hopefully, their story

542
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,217
