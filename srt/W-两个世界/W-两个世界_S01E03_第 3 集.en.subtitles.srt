W BY OH SEONG-MOO

2
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:40,540
Kang Chul is attacked on a hotel rooftop.

3
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,794
A woman appears
shortly after and saves him.

4
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,755
Excuse me. Hello? Wake up!

5
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,221
She leaves a business card with the name
"Oh Yeon-joo" and disappears.

6
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,809
Oh Yeon-joo. Where are you right now?

7
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,229
A nurse follows orders
from an unidentified person,

8
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,523
and Chul is put in danger once again.

9
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,861
-Please let me in.
-No, you can't--

10
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,196
Oh, no. Please. Stop it.

11
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,698
-Yeon-joo suddenly appears and helps him.
-Are you okay?

12
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,908
We finally meet,

13
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,535
-Yeon-joo.
-And thus, he avoids death once again.

14
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,206
Yeon-joo keeps appearing in his life.

15
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,207
Why don't you...

16
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,253
Chul senses...

17
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,632
that she holds the key to his life.

18
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:35,053
I drew it.

19
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,721
It's my artwork.

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,266
He's a monster.

21
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,979
I had created a monster.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,150
So I decided to judge him.

23
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
I should've ended his life
a long time ago.

24
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,046
Who...

25
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:11,881
are you?

26
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,188
-Yeon-joo.
-Hey.

27
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,566
-Dad is in his room, right?
-He went out.

28
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,609
Where did he go again?

29
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,570
I don't know.
He packed his things and went out.

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,946
He even took his computer.

31
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,324
He kicked us out.
He suddenly told us to leave.

32
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,994
I sent Seon-mi and Yoon-hee home.

33
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,998
But I can't stop thinking
that it's strange.

34
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:49,460
I think Mr. Oh kicked us out
because I told you Chul was going to die.

35
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,921
But that would mean that woman...

36
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,132
That she is you.

37
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,384
I told you that Chul was going to die,

38
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:59,762
so you went into the cartoon,
saved his life, and got out again.

39
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,391
Yes. But it just doesn't make any sense.

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,645
It doesn't make sense,
but it actually does.

41
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,815
It doesn't make any sense,
but it actually does.

42
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:12,525
It's...

43
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:19,991
Yeon-joo, your dress...

44
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,953
Su-bong, listen to me carefully.

45
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:28,583
Do you know how much this dress costs?

46
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:30,793
It costs over three million won.

47
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,712
What about these shoes?

48
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:36,591
Would I, or would I not,
have bought these with my own money?

49
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,597
That's right.

50
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:46,476
Then who would buy

51
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,854
this very expensive dress for me
without a problem?

52
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,483
Kang...

53
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,860
Seok-beom?

54
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:58,196
Professor Park?

55
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,531
Your dad?

56
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,996
Kang Chul?

57
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,332
Do you believe me now?

58
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:12,377
Do you?

59
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,511
-Gosh, Su-bong.
-Don't come any closer!

60
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:22,845
What's wrong?

61
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,724
-Get up--
-Don't come closer!

62
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,644
Still, it doesn't make sense.

63
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,647
-How can this happen?
-Stop talking.

64
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,483
I will. How did you go into the cartoon?

65
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,111
Can you go in whenever you like?
Can I go in too?

66
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,321
I don't know why I keep going in.

67
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,199
Before I realized it,
I was in the webtoon.

68
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,163
However, a few things became clear.

69
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,583
Everything in that world
revolves around Chul.

70
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,795
I don't appear in the cartoon
unless I get involved with Chul.

71
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:58,548
Things I do on my own
and my thoughts don't show up.

72
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,465
It all gets edited out.

73
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,885
Chul is the main character
and I'm just a supporting role.

74
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,764
Also, even time revolves around Chul.

75
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,143
It skips the time
when Chul isn't doing anything.

76
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,770
That's why two months
passed in an instant.

77
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,858
Less than five minutes in this world

78
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,902
can be as long as two months over there.

79
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,572
It can even be two or 20 years.

80
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,616
How is that possible?

81
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,410
Think about it.

82
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,912
This cartoon has been running
for seven years.

83
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,624
During those years,
15 years passed in Chul's life.

84
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,210
It makes sense
that time passes faster in it.

85
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,296
It only shows important incidents.

86
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,884
Also, my means for returning
also depends on Chul.

87
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,595
He must undergo a change
for there to be an ending,

88
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:46,846
which is how a chapter ends.

89
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,974
I can only come back
when the chapter ends, and that's why...

90
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,312
-I did it.
-Did what?

91
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,439
You mean the kiss?

92
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,776
Did you really kiss Chul?

93
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,737
I didn't have a choice.
I had to surprise him or something.

94
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,238
I needed an ending.

95
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,824
No way. You did it on purpose.

96
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,327
-Everyone knows you're his fan.
-I did not!

97
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,455
Was it nice?

98
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,665
What?

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,375
I mean...

100
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,338
he's a webtoon character.
He's not a real person.

101
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,590
How was the touch of his lips?

102
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,759
How did you feel when you kissed him?

103
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,844
I was in a rush. I didn't feel anything.

104
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,639
And he's not a webtoon character.

105
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,349
He's definitely human.

106
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,143
He's not different from us.

107
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,020
So you were in a hurry.

108
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,440
Tell me this. Is he handsome?

109
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,154
He is.

110
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,621
And did you see So-hee, too?

111
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,540
Sure, I did.

112
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,375
-Are her breasts really big?
-Goodness.

113
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,211
Why are all men so crazy
about women's breasts?

114
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,254
I'm not crazy about it.

115
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,716
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.
You're making it sound real!

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,135
It is real.

117
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,638
You'll see the reason
why I tried to save him soon.

118
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,976
He's an actual human being just like us.

119
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,979
How could I just watch him die?

120
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,689
Besides, I'm a doctor.

121
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,402
Right. Mr. Oh said he will end it today.

122
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:25,695
End what?

123
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,822
He said he'd draw the ending today.

124
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,700
He said he'd redo it,
so he'll probably kill Chul.

125
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,911
I think he left because he didn't want
to be disturbed.

126
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,580
He's going to kill Chul again?

127
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,510
I should've ended his life
a long time ago.

128
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,847
Right there at the Hangang Bridge.

129
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,774
He'll come back when he's done.
Even if you find him...

130
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:08,696
Do you remember when Chul almost
threw himself from the Hangang Bridge?

131
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,990
In what year was that published?

132
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:15,286
It was in Volume Five,
so probably in 2009.

133
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,204
In 2009?

Yeon-joo left.

140
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,368
I'm all alone now.

141
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:12,843
Let's go.

142
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,643
I'm left alone in this house.

143
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,814
I no longer have a family.

144
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,046
I've lost my will to do anything.

145
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,013
I can't draw a single thing.

146
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,473
How will I continue my series?

147
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:37,136
That's right.

148
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:39,972
I'm sorry.

FROM FALLING OFF A BRIDGE

00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,685
I'M SORRY, BUT I HAVE TO END IT HERE.

151
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:45,853
I need to end it here.

152
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,107
Was Chul supposed to die here?

153
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,817
What?

154
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,023
Goodbye.

155
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,707
Hello?

156
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,420
It's all right.

157
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,338
I'll send it soon.

158
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,173
It's all done,

159
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,342
but I fell asleep.

160
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,387
Actually,

161
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,181
I'll have to end the series with this.

162
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,560
It's due to a personal matter.

163
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,355
I already have the ending.

164
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,490
It's strange.

165
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,244
I could swear I ended it last night
with him in the water.

166
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,538
However, Chul is still alive.

167
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,543
He was holding onto the railing
with one hand...

168
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,421
all night long.

169
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,139
Was I drunk?

170
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,476
Did I think I killed him
without actually doing it?

171
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:53,772
However,

172
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,195
this feels like a message

173
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,032
to find strength again.

174
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,130
That's why

175
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,634
I decided to save Chul.

00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:44,198
This is his first public appearance since
the Supreme Court's decision in 2007.

180
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,909
JN Global is an e-commerce company

181
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:50,496
that went public last year,
and it is maintaining its market value...

182
00:13:52,831 --> 00:13:55,417
-Hey, did you wait long?
-Yes.

183
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,548
What if I buy this broadcasting company?

184
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,594
Hey. What did you just say?

185
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,014
Now that I have the money,
I should catch him.

186
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,394
You always said money
and labor force were the problems.

187
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,772
It's illegal to hire a private army,
but I can't use national agencies.

188
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,607
So I thought I could buy
this broadcasting company.

189
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,819
I'll create a crime-solving program
and search for the killer.

190
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:26,115
The staff will be composed
of Korea's top experts.

191
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,909
I'll hire only the best prosecutors
and detectives.

192
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,286
I'll provide all the funding.

193
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,163
I want you to be the supervisor.

194
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,335
I have already decided
on the channel name. It'll be W.

195
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,922
W for "who" and "why."

196
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:45,801
The purpose is to find out who
committed the crime and why.

197
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,095
Who killed my family...

198
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,306
and why?

199
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:52,933
It's time to find out.

200
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,935
It was like I was possessed.

201
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,937
I respect you, sir.

202
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,442
Thank you very much.

203
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,403
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you!

204
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,780
Hello. I'm a huge fan of W!

205
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:07,823
Thank you.

206
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,868
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

207
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,828
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

208
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:13,913
My gosh!

209
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,457
Mr. Oh, I respect you very much.

210
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,501
-Please accept me as your student.
-Please stand up.

211
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,963
-Thank you.
-Things are working out so well

212
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,299
-that even I can't believe it.
-Oh, my gosh!

213
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,551
Do you enjoy reading webtoons?

214
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,595
There's one that's lauded

215
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,890
to have changed the dynamics
of Korean media contents.

216
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,391
He's become popular recently.

217
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,602
The creator of W,

218
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,271
Oh Seong-moo, is with us today. Hello.

219
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,481
Hello.

220
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,984
I've really wanted to meet you,
and I finally get a chance today.

221
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,861
-It's nice to meet you.
-Same here.

222
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:49,823
I'm actually a big fan of yours.

223
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,492
Thank you.

224
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,329
How do you feel these days?
Does the popularity of W

225
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,622
feel real to you?

226
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,749
I'm not sure.

227
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,460
I've only been working at my desk

228
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,837
and busily trying to meet deadlines.

229
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:07,049
Now that I'm sitting here,

230
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,551
-it seems more real.
-I see.

231
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,637
There's Sherlock Holmes in London...

232
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,639
I have succeeded.

233
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,809
Su-seon must regret leaving me.

234
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,442
DARN, I LOST HIM!

235
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,742
Strange things keep happening these days.

236
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,332
At times, my drawings
don't turn out the way I want.

237
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:45,170
It feels as if Kang Chul is rejecting
the story because he doesn't like it.

238
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,964
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

239
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,882
Is it because of the alcohol?

240
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,394
It happened again.

241
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,106
I woke up in the morning
and saw another scene I didn't draw.

242
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,650
Have I lost my mind?

243
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,757
He's alive. He's definitely alive.

244
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,301
I can definitely feel it, but how...

245
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,553
How is he alive?

246
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,565
2016 REFERENCE DOCUMENTS FOR W

247
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,952
MONSTER

248
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,592
I WON'T BE EATEN UP
I WILL EAT HIM UP INSTEAD

249
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:14,551
Monster.

250
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,097
He's a monster.

251
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,058
He'll kill me someday.

252
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:24,561
I won't be eaten up.
I will eat him up instead.

253
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,315
No.

254
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,859
I should have killed him a long time ago.

255
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,670
The Hangang Bridge.

256
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,506
That's where everything went wrong.

257
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,858
-What are you taking?
-I have a headache.

258
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,280
You probably caught a cold after
only wearing a dress on a rainy night.

259
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,493
-I know.
-Why did you go out so late?

260
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:22,661
No one cares.

261
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:27,958
I'm leaving.

262
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,304
Goodness, what on earth is this?

263
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:41,972
Gosh.

264
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,851
Why with Yeon-joo?

265
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,270
What kind of bullshit is this?

266
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,149
Stand clear of the closing doors.

267
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,154
I felt some negative energy just now.

268
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,640
-What the heck?
-Kang Chul kissed her.

269
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,016
Oh, my gosh.

270
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,727
What's with this girl? She's so annoying.

271
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,064
Everyone in the country is reading it.

272
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,532
Su-bong, I just got off work. How's Dad?

273
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,409
He's not home yet.

274
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:49,706
No matter how much I think about it,
it's still hard to believe.

275
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,333
How could that happen?

276
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,835
This is what I don't understand.

277
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,171
Let's say you initially went inside
because Chul pulled you in,

278
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,007
but why did it happen again?

279
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,718
I don't know either.

280
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:05,097
You said you need an ending
in order to get out.

281
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,683
That means there's a rule
for entering it as well.

282
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,059
And why is it only you?

283
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,311
Isn't that the biggest problem?

284
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,397
What if you're suddenly dragged back in?

285
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,315
What then?

286
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,610
How do you know what will happen
if you get involved with Chul?

287
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,531
Yeon-joo.

288
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,827
Hello? Yeon-joo, are you still there?

289
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,289
Hello?

290
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,708
Hello?

291
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,167
Yeon-joo?

292
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,795
Hello?

293
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:39,840
Who is this?

294
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,759
The phone was on the floor
at the bus stop.

295
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,221
Where is the owner?

296
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,641
I only saw the phone and the bag.

297
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,643
Oh, no.

298
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,397
I'm sorry, but would you
wait for me there? I'll be right there.

299
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,357
Yes. Okay.

300
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,444
I had to go and jinx it.

301
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,778
Yeon-joo.

302
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,741
Hello. This way, please.

303
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,744
I didn't hear the details on the phone.

304
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,662
What exactly happened?

305
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:15,167
I made sure no one mentions it
since Mr. Kang asked.

306
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,544
Anyone who talks about it will get fired,

307
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,504
so you don't have to worry about us.

308
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,299
But we have no right
to stop our customers.

309
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,677
We got the phone number
of the person who recorded the video.

310
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,055
You should meet and settle things
with that person yourself.

311
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,099
What is the video about?

312
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:32,976
It's...

313
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:37,022
It seems like he had an argument...

314
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,317
with the lady that he came with.

315
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,152
An argument?

316
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,237
I don't know what exactly happened.

317
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,864
Why don't you...

318
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,369
She suddenly got upset
and slapped him across the face.

319
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,248
Then they somehow became fine again

320
00:22:57,375 --> 00:22:59,336
and started to kiss.

321
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,593
Kiss?

322
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,722
And they went inside
the fitting room together.

323
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,476
They locked the door too.

324
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:21,066
Then after a very long time,
Mr. Kang came out alone.

325
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,822
But that's not what he wanted to hide.

326
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,241
He wanted to hide the fact
that she disappeared.

327
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,659
She disappeared?

328
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,036
Yes. They went in together,

329
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,914
but only Mr. Kang came out.
She just disappeared.

330
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,379
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

331
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,798
I don't understand it either.

332
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,218
-But everyone says the same thing.
-Where is the fitting room?

333
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,719
It's over there.

334
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,015
Not there. It was the next one.

335
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:59,229
There's no way out. How did she...

336
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,650
-She's here.
-Excuse me?

337
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,820
Oh, my!

338
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,339
Hello?

339
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,300
I'm at the store right now.

340
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,968
Did you meet the manager?

341
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,845
Yeon-joo is here.

342
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,222
-What?
-She's here.

343
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:36,433
Inside the fitting room.

344
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:48,987
What happened?

345
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,406
That's what I want to ask. What happened?

346
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,241
She was in there.
Why did you say she wasn't?

347
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,078
Yeon-joo.

348
00:24:58,496 --> 00:24:59,623
She won't wake up.

349
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,335
Is this the paramedics?

350
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,879
-A person fainted--
-Don't call an ambulance.

351
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,881
-Pardon?
-Hang up.

352
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,094
What do you plan to do?

353
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,474
Where are you going?

354
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,517
No hospitals. I'll take her to the hotel.

355
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,685
And then what?

356
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,188
Please send over Dr. Yoon.

357
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,023
I'll go first.
Wrap things up here and come.

358
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:43,708
What?

359
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,169
Why am I here again?

360
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:50,382
I'm curious too. Why did you come back?

361
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,593
I don't know either.

362
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:24,082
Sir.

363
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,750
What's going on?

364
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,003
Who is she?

365
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,171
Welcome home.

366
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,799
-Where's Dr. Yoon?
-He's not here yet.

367
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:35,010
Mr. Kang.

368
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,056
Detective Park is here.

369
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:41,766
Hello.

370
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,729
Hello. What brings you here?

371
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,898
It's about the witness Oh Yeon-joo.

372
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,110
I see. You haven't found her yet?

373
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,778
She's really strange.

374
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,282
Just how did she manage
to avoid all the surveillance cameras?

375
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,576
You don't have to try too hard.

376
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,995
She's not a suspect.
It's okay if you can't find her.

377
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,164
What are you talking about?
We will find her.

378
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:06,708
But...

379
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,587
It's nothing serious.

380
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,006
I need to put her in bed.

381
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,425
You don't have to see us out.

382
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:17,302
We'll get going, then.

383
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,861
What's going on? Isn't that Yeon-joo?

384
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,112
What happened?

385
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,705
Finally, it's in my possession.

386
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:46,956
What is?

387
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,751
The key to my life.

388
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,463
Anyway, is she really pretty?

389
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:56,966
Is she considered pretty?

390
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,593
What?

391
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,013
Why does everyone say she's pretty?

392
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:40,552
You're awake.

393
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,937
How do you feel?

394
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,648
I feel dizzy.

395
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,901
You're probably still drowsy
from the medicine.

396
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,154
You're not dying, so don't worry.

397
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,282
Where am I?

398
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,369
My room. It's where I live.

399
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,038
The penthouse?

400
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,084
How do you know that?

401
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:18,298
You live in a hotel penthouse.
On the 33rd floor, the top floor.

402
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,637
You really know everything about me.

403
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,891
I know everything.

404
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,394
What else do you know?

405
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,189
I know that your family...

406
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:40,069
was suddenly killed in your house
and it traumatized you.

407
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:46,701
That's why you live in hotels
and not in a house.

408
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,372
That's interesting.

409
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,583
What else do you know?

410
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:00,590
You keep a gun underneath your pillow.

411
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,969
You always keep it there
even though it's illegal.

412
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,640
You can't sleep without it.

413
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:15,939
How do you know that?

414
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,526
I saw it.

415
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,904
Where did you see it?

416
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,743
That was the saddest scene.

417
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,121
The Hangang Bridge.

418
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:38,044
I cried with you back then.

419
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,005
I was afraid...

420
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,552
Chul would really kill himself.

421
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,407
Die!

422
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,506
Die!

423
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,675
Die!

424
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:02,475
Why weren't you guarding the door?

425
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,812
-We received a text to go downstairs.
-From who?

426
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:07,855
The message was from Do-yoon's phone,

427
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,440
but he said he didn't send it.

428
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,151
I will

429
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,944
find you soon.

430
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:56,946
Just wait.

431
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,397
Where am I?

432
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,487
Is this Chul's room?

433
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,492
It is! This is his bed and that is...
Oh, my gosh.

434
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,287
Did I get dragged in here again? Why?

435
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,580
Why? How?

436
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,461
You're awake.

437
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,465
-Yes.
-How are you feeling?

438
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,218
I'm okay.

439
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,179
A nurse checked on you.
She said you were fine

440
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,515
-and that you can get up now.
-Did she say why I fainted?

441
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,644
-She said it was fatigue.
-Fatigue?

442
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,813
You exhausted your body,
which caused fatigue.

443
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,399
I exhausted my body?

444
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,151
You were in bed for two days.

445
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:20,279
Maybe you overexerted yourself.

446
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,658
What?

447
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:31,582
Right, I guess maybe I did.

448
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,794
Why don't you have lunch
with Mr. Kang? He'll be back soon.

449
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,464
-Will he come back here?
-Yes.

450
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,385
I prepared some clothes.
You can change in the bathroom.

451
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:43,970
-I see.
-Okay, then.

452
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,687
What now?

453
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:55,231
What am I supposed to do now? My goodness.

454
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,334
It's huge.

455
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,805
It's see-through.

456
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:29,765
Gosh.

457
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:32,435
Isn't that the biggest problem?

458
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,938
How do you know what will happen
if you get involved with Chul?

459
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,400
What if you're suddenly dragged
back in again?

460
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:56,500
It's here.

461
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,382
-She's alone?
-She's in the shower.

462
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,885
I told you not to leave her alone
when she wakes up.

463
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,680
-I can't go in there with her.
-Seriously.

464
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,736
What should I do?

465
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,197
Which one should I go with?

466
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,244
She can't run away from here.
This is the 33rd floor.

467
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,768
I heard she woke up.

468
00:39:57,103 --> 00:40:00,564
-Yes, you can see her later.
-Why? What is she doing?

469
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,194
She's having an honest talk with Mr. Kang.

470
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:07,321
In the bathroom?

471
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,290
There you go again, Yeon-joo.

472
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,585
What is this now?

473
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:25,005
It's 11:00 a.m. and you just woke up.
What are you trying to do here?

474
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:27,883
Nothing!

475
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,555
-Excuse me?
-It's nothing.

476
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:35,891
You always do things and say it's nothing.

477
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,477
Don't come near me.

478
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,107
Stop or I'll shoot you.

479
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:46,402
Gosh, you are one weird woman.

480
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,279
You showed up out of the blue,

481
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,323
slapped me in the face, kissed me,

482
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,534
disappeared, and then you showed up again.

483
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:57,246
Now, you're suddenly taking
your clothes off and pointing a gun at me.

484
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:00,583
I know you don't understand me.
I wouldn't either,

485
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,711
but there's a reason why I'm doing this.

486
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,380
-What reason?
-Don't move.

487
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,925
I'm really going to shoot you.
I'm not kidding.

488
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,055
-Go ahead then.
-I'm serious.

489
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,307
It's dangerous!

490
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,350
You're worrying about someone
you're going to shoot?

491
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,436
I'll really shoot!

492
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,736
You need bullets first.
Don't you know that?

493
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,613
I wanted to see

494
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,366
what you'd do since you knew
that I kept a gun under my pillow.

495
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,635
Why are you doing this?

496
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:55,846
I really don't like doing this,
so let's talk it out.

497
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,766
I have about 100 questions,

498
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,268
but I'll let you live
if you answer the first one.

499
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,979
How did you disappear that day?

500
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,863
I'll have to report you to the police
if you don't answer.

501
00:42:13,322 --> 00:42:14,323
How cruel!

502
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,284
You said I saved your life.

503
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,204
You certainly did.
That's why I let you go before.

504
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,373
Aren't you the one who broke your promise?

505
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,251
You disappeared without answering any
of my questions.

506
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,503
You must keep your promise now.

507
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,923
I waited two months for you
like a gentleman.

508
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,383
Do you agree?

509
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,803
How did you disappear?

510
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,680
There must have been a way.

511
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:42,226
I'll report you to the police
if you don't answer.

512
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,898
If you can't answer that,
here's my next question.

513
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,109
Why did you slap
and then kiss me that day?

514
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,407
I'll wait since we still have
a lot of time.

515
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,716
So I can disappear.

516
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,009
What did you say?

517
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,553
I had to do it so I could disappear.

518
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:18,887
Do what?

519
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,101
Kiss you.

520
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,938
The kiss?

521
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:29,982
Yes.

522
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,902
You had to kiss me in order to disappear?

523
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,196
Yes.

524
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,868
I didn't imagine an answer like that.

525
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:43,537
So you disappeared because you kissed me?

526
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,039
That was the way?

527
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,041
It's true,

528
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,502
so please stop this and let me go.

529
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,130
-Is that so?
-Yes.

530
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,744
Why are you still here?

531
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,413
You're still here.

532
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:31,543
I... I wasn't saying just kissing
makes me disappear!

533
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,255
There has to be a change in emotions!
That's what the kiss meant!

534
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,007
Emotions?

535
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,301
I didn't like it at all back then.

536
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,012
You may not have liked it,
but you were surprised.

537
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,972
-Yes, I was.
-That's what I mean.

538
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:48,352
There was some kind of change
in your emotions. That's the rule.

539
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,398
-You seem surprised. You're blushing.
-Not me, you!

540
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,859
-What do you mean?
-Your change of emotions is what counts.

541
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,194
What kind of rule is that?

542
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,531
-Why are my emotions important?
-Because you're the main character.

543
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,283
The main character?

544
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,411
For what?

545
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,794
What you just did can be
considered sexual assault.

546
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,129
I'm going to press charges.

547
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,423
You committed sexual assault first.

548
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,049
And assault on top of that.

549
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,386
Besides, I was doing
a scientific experiment

550
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,430
to prove the theory that you presented.

551
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,890
What you're saying now

552
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,937
is that you can only disappear
when there's a change of emotions in me.

553
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:32,980
Is that correct?

554
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:37,359
-Yes.
-Is that why you slapped me?

555
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,070
Did you take off your clothes
and shoot the gun to surprise me?

556
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,448
That's right.

557
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:45,909
That's very weird.

558
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,829
I thought you'd say you teleported.

559
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,081
But it doesn't seem like a lie

560
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,501
since you're still here
even when you had a chance to disappear.

561
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,629
I'm not lying.

562
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,635
Just because it's not a lie
doesn't mean it's the truth.

563
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:07,139
You're only talking about what happened

564
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,600
without including the important context.

565
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,607
I know you're hiding your reasons.

566
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:20,110
There must be a context that explains
why you can disappear

567
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,238
only when there's been
a change of emotions in me.

568
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,116
You need to tell me about that.

569
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:28,869
I don't know any more than that.

570
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,288
How could you not know?

571
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,956
Answer before I count to ten.

572
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:34,625
One.

573
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,586
-Two.
-I said I don't know.

574
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,587
Three.

575
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:42,090
-Four.
-Don't scare me.

576
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,218
You won't even shoot.

577
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,260
Five.

578
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:49,681
What's going on?

579
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:51,975
Get out.

580
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:54,853
What are you doing?

581
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:57,481
I'm investigating instead of the police

582
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,899
since you talk too much.

583
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,527
However, Yeon-joo keeps teasing me

584
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,487
instead of telling the truth.

585
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:06,448
Are you all right?

586
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,451
-Stop it.
-Get out.

587
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,745
-Stop it. She's not even well.
-Get out!

588
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,881
That is how you fire a gun.

589
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,637
This is a very important problem
that my life depends on.

590
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:31,557
It doesn't matter if you saved my life.

591
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,102
You saved my life,
but you're also very dangerous.

592
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,523
If you don't answer me,
I'll really shoot you.

593
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:42,985
I stopped at five, right?

594
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:45,445
Six.

595
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,489
Seven.

596
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,955
How important is the secret
that you can't tell me even at gunpoint?

597
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,251
You won't shoot me.

598
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,503
Eight.

599
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,839
How can you be sure?

600
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,425
You...

601
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,553
wouldn't do that.

602
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,388
Nine.

603
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,808
I thought you knew everything about me,

604
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,643
but you're wrong about certain things.

605
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,022
I can do it if I want to.

606
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,693
That can't be.

607
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,992
You really won't answer me?

608
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,456
Ten.

609
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:29,758
Were you surprised?

610
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,721
I guess you didn't know
what abilities you had.

611
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,563
What happened?

612
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:45,190
Did you shoot her?

613
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,317
Did you?

614
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,445
She got scared and fainted.
Put her in a room.

615
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:59,621
Have you lost your mind?
What were you thinking?

616
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,873
I was only trying to scare her,
and I missed.

617
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:08,672
You've completely lost your mind.

618
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,948
Please come now.

619
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:36,992
She fainted again.

620
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,827
Something...

621
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,246
shocking happened.

622
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:44,207
Yes. Please hurry.

623
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,629
-Please bring her some water.
-Okay.

624
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:55,469
Did he lose his mind after being
in the hospital for too long?

625
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,180
He's weird but she's very weird too.

626
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,098
They're both weird.

627
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,190
Did you call the nurse?

628
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,025
I said to hand her over to the police.

629
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,069
Did you bring her to act like a thug?
Are you a gangster?

630
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:15,572
How could you threaten a woman with a gun?

631
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,992
Didn't you want a thorough investigation?

632
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:23,079
-Hand her over to the police.
-Not the police.

633
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,415
I won't sit back and watch anymore.

634
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,417
Give her to the police,
and if they can't solve it,

635
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,170
that's when we investigate.
That's the proper procedure.

636
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:32,714
Why make things complicated?

637
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:35,383
Who knows what will happen later?

638
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,429
I said no police.

639
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,433
It will never be solved
once the police are involved.

640
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,394
I told you.
Yeon-joo is the key to my life.

641
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:54,569
Change my flight to an evening flight.
I'm dropping by Busan.

642
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:11,837
Is she awake?

643
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:17,050
How is she?

644
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,262
I gave her a sedative,
and her blood pressure is normal.

645
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,222
-Please give us a minute.
-Sure.

646
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,570
Are you angry?

647
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,448
Am I angry?

648
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:44,411
That is a major understatement.
You shot me with a gun!

649
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,415
I'm sorry for scaring you.

650
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,168
Actually, I knew
that a gunshot wouldn't kill you.

651
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,338
Why don't you know that?

652
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:57,757
You're immortal, Yeon-joo.

653
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,010
You can never die.

654
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,723
You really didn't know that?

655
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,351
How do you know that?

656
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,230
If you answer my question, I'll tell you.

657
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,901
Since we both witnessed what happened,

658
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,612
let's admit that you are
not an ordinary person.

659
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,281
You're probably from another world.

660
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,034
Another world that I don't know about.

661
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:28,330
And you work as
a cardiothoracic surgery resident there.

662
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,581
Right?

663
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:33,418
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY RESIDENT
OH YEON-JOO

664
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,756
Where is that?

665
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,890
Anyway, I'm relieved.

666
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,560
I confirmed that you can't disappear
whenever you want.

667
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,187
If everything is up to me,

668
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,439
that means there is no way you can escape.

669
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,444
You know me well, don't you?

670
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,947
Once I make up my mind,
I never get swayed.

671
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,074
That's my talent.

672
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,826
I even won a gold medal with that.

673
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,246
So now, you can't go back

674
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,999
until you've answered all my questions.

675
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,962
Stay here with me.

676
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:19,214
Since you saved my life,

677
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,591
I will protect you
from the police and the media.

678
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,426
Stay as long as you like.

679
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,097
And if you want to go back,
just answer my questions.

680
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:31,726
It seems like you have a lot
of surprising things to tell me.

681
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,271
If you say the truth and surprise me,
you get to go back,

682
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,899
and I'll find the answers that I want.

683
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,486
What can you say? Isn't that a fair deal?

684
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,658
Surprise me if you want to go back.

685
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,203
What kind of world
is the world you live in?

686
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,838
You said you knew
and saw everything about me.

687
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:01,506
Where did you see me?

688
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:05,927
Is it hard to answer?

689
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,762
It is hard.

690
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:12,183
Then let's stay here together.
I don't mind.

691
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,393
We have plenty of time.

692
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,311
You want me...

693
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,815
-to live here?
-If not here,

694
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,191
where would you go?

695
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,571
I don't think you have anywhere to go.

696
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:34,539
We're ready.

697
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,586
I planned to have lunch with you
before going on a business trip,

698
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:42,547
but something came up in Busan.
Let's eat when I'm back.

699
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:46,426
I'll be back on Friday. My assistant
will be here in my absence.

700
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,470
Right.

701
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,142
Here's the cell phone
you dumped last time.

702
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,727
Call me if anything happens.

703
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:10,158
I'm asking for a truce.
Sorry for what I did a while ago.

704
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,544
I sincerely apologize.

705
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:25,965
Rest well.

706
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:30,136
I love you.

707
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,070
Never mind.

708
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:50,365
Right.

709
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:54,869
You must've thought I'd be really
surprised to see you naked.

710
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,289
Did you think my heart would pound
and my eyes would glaze over?

711
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,417
No, I just took a chance.

712
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,129
-Do you realize you're ridiculous?
-I do.

713
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:08,800
Take care.

714
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:10,927
Let's go.

715
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:25,900
-What was that, really?
-What?

716
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,696
You said if she's considered pretty,
a stray dog would be pretty,

717
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,030
but you act like you're in love.

718
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,824
You've seen her naked,

719
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:35,827
she kissed you and said she loved you.
She even slapped you.

720
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,245
That looked like a lover's spat.

721
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:40,165
And now that?
You're going to live together?

722
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,375
That's like a couple moving in together.

723
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,171
-You're right.
-Anyone would get the wrong idea.

724
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,215
-Right.
-This is about you.

725
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:52,010
It's complicated. Think whatever you want.

726
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:57,849
Wait.

727
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:01,186
What is it?

728
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,354
You're going somewhere?

729
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,025
I'm stopping by Busan,
then I'm going to New York. Why?

730
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:09,652
Be careful.

731
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,325
Am I going to die on the way?

732
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,161
Will the train derail?
Or will the airplane get hijacked?

733
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,581
I don't know. I'm just worried.

734
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:25,835
So you're not sure
how I'm going to die this time.

735
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,088
When I'm here, I don't know things either.

736
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,882
So I can't help you.

737
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,551
You know when you're there?

738
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,513
Yes.

739
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,476
I'm getting more curious.

740
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:50,235
You never answer my questions.
Why are you worried that I might die?

741
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:56,241
I am one of those people

742
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,868
who want your life to have a happy ending.

743
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,916
I'm your fan. I swear.

744
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:13,675
Are you saying I'm going to
be unfortunate if I hear the answer?

745
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:18,972
Perhaps.

746
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,310
That's why I can't answer.

747
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,612
Besides, you are the first patient
that I saved on my own.

748
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:38,491
Is that right? I'm honored.

749
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,786
-You are my second patient too.
-I'm even more honored.

750
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:42,745
So

751
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,624
always be careful.

752
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,510
I will.

753
01:00:03,057 --> 01:00:04,892
I guess you can answer this question.

754
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,436
How old are you?

755
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:09,772
I'm 30.

756
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:14,027
We're the same age. Are you married?

757
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,113
No.

758
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:19,407
That's good.

759
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,840
I found out later on
why I was the only one

760
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,675
who kept getting dragged here.

761
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,429
It was because this man...

762
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:44,891
said that I was the key to his life.

763
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,520
At that moment,

764
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:53,232
the heroine of this cartoon changed

765
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:55,860
from Yoon So-hee...

766
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:57,987
to Oh Yeon-joo.

767
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,192
I'm sure Yeon-joo is the key to my life.

768
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,945
She's the only one who can
open the door to all the secrets.

769
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,364
Would you have a glass of wine
with me then?

770
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,532
Aren't you...

771
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,991
You're the doctor from the rooftop.

772
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:46,285
What do I do?
I can't have the police take me.

773
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:47,412
Reveal your identity.

774
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:49,330
I have no identity to reveal.

775
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,916
If she's innocent,
why can't she identify herself?

776
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:54,460
They're convinced
that you're the criminal.

777
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,170
So answer my question.

778
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,005
- You will regret it.
- I won't regret it.

779
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,383
What do you mean by the world I live in?

780
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:02,385
The world inside a cartoon.

781
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,888
