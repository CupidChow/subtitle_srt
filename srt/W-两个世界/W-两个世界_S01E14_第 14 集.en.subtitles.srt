1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,164
With sales totaling ten million copies,

2
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,583
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

3
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:43,543
The main character, Kang Chul,

4
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,630
learns from Oh Yeon-joo
that he is a webtoon character.

5
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:50,508
After becoming a murderer and fugitive,

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,387
he loses his right to be
the main character and almost disappears.

7
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:58,725
Thus, Chul returns to the world
of W and catches the killer.

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,483
Just as it was going to end
with a happy ending...

9
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,651
If I think of a character
from the webtoon,

10
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,280
they can be summoned into the real world?

11
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,074
I said bring Han Cheol-ho!

12
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,492
Yeon-joo.

13
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,995
-Where is Chul?
-He went back there.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,705
That means Kang Chul isn't here, right?

15
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,251
The killer comes to the real world
and abducts Yeon-joo.

16
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,378
Want to go with me to find your husband?

17
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,343
He shoots Yeon-joo in order to catch Chul.

18
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,808
-Give me a defibrillator.
-Yes, doctor.

19
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,894
-What should I charge it to?
-Charge it to 150J.

20
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,688
-Is it charged?
-Yes, it's charged.

21
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:48,316
Step back. One, two, clear!

22
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:50,735
One more time.

23
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,613
-It's charged.
-Step back.

24
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,657
One, two, clear!

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,956
It's PEA.

26
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:05,291
Continue the heart massage
and bring some blood!

27
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,251
-Hurry!
-Okay.

28
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,641
YUJIN FACTORY. CHILSAN-DONG 63-2,
EUNHA-GU, GWANGMYEONG

29
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,215
Damn it.

30
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,415
What's that bloodstain?

31
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,958
He shot...

32
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,044
some girl.

33
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,631
What girl? I don't see any girl.

34
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,092
I saw her fall.

35
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,338
Su-bong!

36
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,635
Yeon-joo!

37
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,263
Where is it?

38
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,529
Don't kill me.

39
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,460
No, Yeon-joo...

40
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:23,800
Yeon-joo.

41
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,305
PARK SU-BONG

42
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:33,684
Please answer your phone. Gosh.

43
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,063
Hello? Hello, Yeon-joo?

44
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,565
Where are you? Are you okay?
What happened?

45
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,067
-Hello?
-Is that you, Su-bong?

46
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,486
Mr. Oh?

47
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:45,154
Where's Yeon-joo?

48
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,908
Where are you now? Where are you?

49
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,203
Mr. Oh! Where are you going?

50
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,330
Yeon-joo is there. I have to find her!

51
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,916
Take my car!

52
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,585
Here. Over here!

53
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,797
Wait! You should sit on the other side!

54
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,382
Wait. Mr. Oh...

55
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,853
We're going to the killer's hideout,
aren't we?

56
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,691
Are you all right? You are okay, right?

57
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,625
Hello, hi. Excuse me.

58
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,127
Who are you?

59
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,839
By any chance,
have you seen an injured woman?

60
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,674
Oh, that girl.

61
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,010
An ambulance took her a while ago.

62
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:50,887
An ambulance...

63
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,936
What happened?

64
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,233
I'm sure she's fine.

65
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,235
They took her to the hospital
straight away.

66
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,655
The paramedics are really good, too.

67
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,201
No. It can't be.

68
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,079
No.

69
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,999
Chul took her.

70
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,420
Then she's okay. Chul...

71
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:26,714
Chul took her.

72
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,800
No.

73
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:31,928
No.

74
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,394
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

75
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,148
The woman who was shot...

76
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,067
Are you Ms. Oh Yeon-joo's guardian?

77
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,944
Yes, we are.

78
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,988
Where is Yeon-joo?

79
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,117
Well...

80
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,799
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

81
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,353
PARK SU-BONG

82
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:34,949
Are you Ms. Oh's husband?

83
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,659
Yes.

84
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,204
The surgery went well,

85
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,292
but she lost too much blood
before the surgery

86
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,626
and went into cardiac arrest.

87
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,837
We performed CPR on her
for over 30 minutes.

88
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,466
She hasn't regained consciousness yet.

89
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:56,012
She can't breathe on her own,
her pupils are dilated,

90
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,471
and she won't react to any stimuli.

91
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,100
Then...

92
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,476
She...

93
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,105
She might not make it.

94
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,610
She might not make it?

95
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,908
-Brain-dead?
-We're not sure yet.

96
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,536
If she doesn't wake up...

97
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,997
-Mr. Oh!
-Sir, are you okay?

98
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,332
Mr. Oh!

99
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:25,791
My daughter...

100
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,961
Where is my daughter?

101
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:33,007
Gosh. The thing is...

102
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,031
She's not going to wake up?

103
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,784
-Yes.
-What a pity.

104
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,497
Where's her husband? We need
his statement since she was shot.

105
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,456
He's inside.

106
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,129
This way.

107
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,423
Oh, my.

108
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,175
Where did they go?

109
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,556
-What?
-She suddenly disappeared.

110
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:05,433
Her husband, too.

111
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,394
We haven't found them yet.

112
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,314
Gosh. We also find it very strange.

113
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,947
Oh, my. Look at that.

114
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,866
Why isn't she home yet?

115
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,117
I should call her.

116
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,705
-He's good.
-She never comes home early anymore.

117
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,040
Maybe she's seeing someone.

118
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,466
MOM

119
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,637
Sir, it's Ms. Gil.

120
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,851
What should I say?

121
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,896
Say you don't know.

122
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,497
Hello, Ms. Gil?

123
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,832
Is that you, Su-bong?

124
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,168
Yes, it's me.

125
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,505
Yeon-joo left her phone in the workroom.

126
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,132
Why did she leave her phone there?

127
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,259
She was hanging out here,

128
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,429
but she got paged
and went to the hospital.

129
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:29,058
I'll tell her to call you
if I hear from her.

130
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,810
I just don't feel so well.

131
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,230
Good night.

132
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,035
Yeon-joo.

133
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,592
Yeon-joo!

134
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,927
Yeon-joo!

135
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,804
Chul?

136
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,724
Open the gate, please.

137
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,350
Okay.

138
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,524
-Is Mr. Oh back?
-Yes.

139
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,320
Hold on, Chul. What happened to Yeon-joo?

140
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:11,660
Chul.

141
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,497
Chul, where's Yeon-joo?

142
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:21,962
You're back.

143
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,132
Where's Yeon-joo?

144
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,842
Where is she?

145
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,969
I took her to the other world.

146
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,597
Why?

147
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,349
Why did you do that?

148
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:35,893
They said she won't wake up.

149
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,733
If something goes wrong here,
you can't turn it back.

150
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,406
She spent three days in the hospital.

151
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,493
They also said she won't wake up,
so I moved her to the hotel,

152
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,329
because I couldn't explain
her gunshot wound.

153
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,887
She spent another week there.

154
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,561
She opened her eyes just once.

155
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,637
Yeon-joo.

156
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:57,891
Can you see me?

157
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,071
Very briefly.

158
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,412
And?

159
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:27,254
What about now?

160
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,724
She died.

161
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:44,688
Mr. Oh.

162
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,566
Mr. Oh!

163
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,318
Are you okay?

164
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,444
Mr. Oh.

165
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,821
Oh, my gosh.

166
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,615
Mr. Oh.

167
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,997
-Hello, sir.
-Hey.

168
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,208
I heard Mr. Oh was hospitalized.

169
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:05,793
Yes, he came in this morning.

170
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,086
Why?

171
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,463
He was under great stress.

172
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,801
He took medicine with alcohol.
He's okay now.

173
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,429
Gosh. This is driving me crazy.

174
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,723
-Why?
-I...

175
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,812
I left some nasty comments saying
he shouldn't draw such rubbish.

176
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,356
I also used some swear words.

177
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:30,567
What if it was the comments
that stressed him out?

178
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,694
That's possible.

179
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,279
Shit.

180
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,157
What room is he in?

181
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,131
CHUL

182
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,300
Hello, Chul?

183
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,928
Yes. He woke up a while ago.

184
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,805
Okay.

185
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,974
Right.

186
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:06,603
Hold on.

187
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:17,614
Sir, I'm Park Min-su, the surgeon
who operated on you. Do you remember?

188
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:22,744
I told you not to drink alcohol.
Why did you drink it again?

189
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:26,081
No matter how hard your work is,
you shouldn't do this.

190
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,754
Hang on. Where is Yeon-joo?
Why isn't she here with you?

191
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:38,427
Actually, may I ask you something?

192
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,639
Why did Yeon-joo die so suddenly?

193
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,685
She was a useless character,

194
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:51,023
but still, it doesn't feel good
to see her die like that.

195
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,984
A grim and sad ending isn't so bad, but...

196
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,592
What...

197
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,052
What are you doing?

198
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,595
Mr. Oh?

199
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,263
Mr. Oh.

200
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,841
Let go. Let me go!

201
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:05,806
Why are you doing this?

202
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,725
I did it.

203
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,186
I shot her.

204
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,440
I shot Yeon-joo. I did it.

205
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,234
You didn't shoot her.

206
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,694
No.

207
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:20,904
I shot her.

208
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,493
I remember everything. I...

209
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,830
I shot my own daughter.

210
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,959
No, that wasn't you.

211
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,210
I can't...

212
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,713
live any longer.

213
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,841
I can't live anymore.

214
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,342
Snap out of it and listen to me!

215
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,888
Do you know why I came to find you?

216
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,182
There's something you must do.

217
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:51,893
Don't blame yourself.

218
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,521
It's the killer who shot your daughter.

219
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,190
But you're the only one who can save her.

220
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,194
You must come back to your senses.
Don't fall apart.

221
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,740
You must save your daughter.

222
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:07,701
How can I?

223
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,037
She's dead.

224
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,457
She's dead,

225
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,500
but you can save her.

226
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,549
Because she married me, she unwittingly
became a webtoon character

227
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:23,842
like me.

228
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,636
That's why she gets hurt
and bleeds in the webtoon.

229
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,805
That's how she got shot and died.

230
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:34,728
And just like a webtoon character,
she can be saved by drawings.

231
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,605
Just like how I came back to life.

232
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:39,816
Do you understand?

233
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,653
Your drawing can bring her back.

234
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,699
That's why I took her
to the webtoon world before she died.

235
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,244
It's not over yet.

236
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,748
I won't ever give up.
I will bring her back to life

237
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:56,792
no matter what.

238
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,590
How can I draw when everything is broken?

239
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,636
I destroyed the tablet with a hammer

240
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,346
because he ordered me to.

241
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,809
I destroyed all of it
because he ordered me to.

242
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,063
The tablet isn't there anymore.

243
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,357
Yes, it is.

244
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,692
It has to be.

245
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,654
I'm sure it's there somewhere.

246
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,993
Gosh, where did he go?

247
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,331
Why did he leave so suddenly?
What did you tell him?

248
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,250
I didn't say much,

249
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,210
just a few questions about the webtoon.

250
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,296
He got up when I asked him
why Yeon-joo died.

251
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,298
What's wrong?

252
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,092
What's wrong?

253
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:51,763
Why did you ask him that? Why?

254
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,641
Why did you ask
such a question to a patient?

255
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,226
Are you out of your mind?

256
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,729
How could a doctor
be so rude and clueless?

257
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,857
Why did you ask such a question?

258
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,234
Have you lost your mind?

259
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:05,193
Mr. Oh!

260
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,279
-Please call a nurse.
-Please call a nurse.

261
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,780
Mr. Oh.

262
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,825
Mr. Oh, are you okay?

263
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,161
Did I do something terribly wrong?

264
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,704
I mean,

265
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,082
can't I ask why a webtoon character died?

266
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,213
Oh, no, I think I've been hurt.

267
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,553
I'm going back in,
so please take care of him.

268
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,432
Wait, Chul.

269
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,518
What...

270
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,983
You probably don't know
what Yeon-joo means to me.

271
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,784
Yeon-joo...

272
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,579
is my only family.

273
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,583
She isn't a family
you created out of your imagination.

274
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,335
She's my real family that truly exists.

275
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,840
I have memories with her
that are real and not fabricated.

276
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,012
She's part of the destiny that I chose,
not one written out for me.

277
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,099
For the first time,
it was based on my own will.

278
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,522
That's why I can't give up on her.

279
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,527
Yeon-joo...

280
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,572
is proof that I'm a person just like you.

281
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:34,574
That I'm human.

282
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,913
I'll save your daughter
and live with her happily.

283
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,915
I won't ever back down this time.

284
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:45,835
No one can discourage me.
I'll come from behind and win.

285
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,087
And it shall be...

286
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,714
a happy ending for us.

287
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,939
I almost forgot.

288
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:09,234
Your life is also important to me.

289
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,779
Not because you created me,

290
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,948
but because you're the father of my wife.

291
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,703
You're already my family.

292
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:24,374
You may not agree, but you are to me.

293
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,588
So please don't do anything stupid
like that again.

294
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,173
Do you understand?

295
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,102
That arrogant brat.

296
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:51,693
Chul.

297
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,612
Please be careful, okay?

298
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,906
Goodness, this is killing me.

299
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,577
Stop crying and wait.
I might call for help.

300
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,537
Me? For what?

301
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,081
I don't know yet.

302
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,251
Be careful, okay?

303
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,840
How is there another one?

304
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,304
Up until now, I've used only one tablet.

305
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,181
I'm sure there's a substitute.

306
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,017
If there wasn't,
the killer wouldn't have destroyed it.

307
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,144
It was the most important thing to him.

308
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,192
Draw that first.

309
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,610
Your tablet.

310
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,204
He destroyed it
so that we can't use it again.

311
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:47,999
I'm sure he drew a copy
of the tablet in the webtoon.

312
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,960
Otherwise, he wouldn't have destroyed it.

313
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,880
Can't you remember?

314
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,394
I put it in a trunk.

315
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,062
The trunk of a car?

316
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,567
There was no tablet in evidence
with the police.

317
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,113
-Han Cheol-ho.
-Han Cheol-ho.

318
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:57,485
It's used by illustrators.

319
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,154
It's for drawing.

320
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,948
-Drawing?
-Yes.

321
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:05,702
This looks like something
professionals would use.

322
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,829
How do we use it?

323
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:11,666
You can draw on it like it's paper.

324
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:14,753
This is the pen for the tablet.

325
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,092
Why did he leave it in the trunk?

326
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,428
-It's not a weapon.
-Pardon?

327
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,054
Never mind.

328
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:29,017
Sir, Mr. Park is asking
when you'll be arriving.

329
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,019
-Tell him I'll be right there.
-Okay, sir.

330
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,562
Hello? Yes.

331
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,356
Turn it off for now.

332
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,650
Do you think...

333
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,862
the copy will function like the original?

334
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:42,697
I'm not sure.

335
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,158
We'll have to try it
to see how it's different.

336
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:56,336
Still, we have to find it.

337
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,379
We must.

338
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,995
This is not the copy.

339
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,373
It's a trap.

340
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,224
Hey, Chul.

341
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,686
Is this what you're looking for?

342
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,089
Gosh.

343
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,176
It's been a long time
since we met like this.

344
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:33,349
I couldn't touch you ever since
you became the president and CEO.

345
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,269
But now,

346
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:38,354
you're dead.

347
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,815
You put on a show and faked your death.

348
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,819
So nobody will say anything

349
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,697
even if you die again here.

350
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,699
You're already dead anyway.

351
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,078
Even if I kill you here,

352
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,832
it won't be considered a crime.

353
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,459
Got it?

354
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,879
You dug your own grave, asshole.

355
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,134
Are things still hazy? Do you feel dizzy?

356
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:14,182
Hey.

357
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,434
Aren't you curious?

358
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,937
Want to know where I got that drug?

359
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,112
Here it is.

360
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,457
Isn't it fascinating?

361
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:52,095
How can a thing like this exist?

362
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:00,937
Turn it off for now.

363
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,106
Yes, sir.

364
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,402
Wait.

365
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,738
Tell them to park the car again.

366
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,281
I need to check it before I go.

367
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,242
Yes, sir.

368
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,787
DOCUMENTS

369
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,249
What are all these?

370
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:30,133
This asshole really was a lunatic.

371
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,760
He got lost in delusions while drawing.

372
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,932
Were you trying to form
a terrorist organization, Chul?

373
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:42,979
What...

374
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,108
What's this?

375
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,741
REVOLVER

376
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,167
Where did it...

377
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,427
Not only guns.

378
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,345
It has all kinds of drugs.

379
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:26,397
"Sodium amytal, scopolamine,
sodium pentothal, amphetamine, mescaline."

380
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,485
All right. Which shot do you want to get?

381
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:31,903
Which one?

382
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,529
Sodium?

383
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,741
SODIUM PENTOTHAL

384
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,224
Mr. Kang,

385
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,478
I saved you from a drug overdose.

386
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,276
You've been appearing
and disappearing like a phantom,

387
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,321
but I guess it's hard now
with the drug in your body.

388
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:24,247
Isn't this something
that only happens in cartoons?

389
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,874
It appears when you press enter.

390
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,543
It disappears when you press delete.

391
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:34,549
I understand now
why you and Han Sang-hun fought.

392
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:36,717
However,

393
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,846
what I'm really curious about is...

394
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:46,102
what on earth is this?

395
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,197
From now on, you have to answer.

396
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,367
Where did Han Sang-hun get that?

397
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,077
And how are you guys related?

398
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,079
How did you know that I had it?

399
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:08,166
Who originally owned it?

400
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,459
Who is the girl that disappeared
after being shot?

401
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,462
How do you come into my office so easily?

402
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,050
Okay.

403
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,012
Let's begin.

404
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,690
This is payback for being
such an annoyance in the past ten years.

405
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,336
Asshole.

406
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,922
Hey.

407
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,424
Talk.

408
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,134
Hey.

409
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,844
Talk.

410
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,096
Hey.

411
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,026
-Yes?
-Why are you not coming?

412
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,487
Something came up.

413
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,323
I'll be there right away.

414
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,581
Since you were young,

415
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:34,335
you were an expert
at keeping your mouth shut.

416
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,423
But it'll be different this time.

417
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:40,967
You know, right?

418
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,761
You know what's in here.

419
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,348
You should prepare yourself.

420
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,354
Hospital.

421
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,690
What?

422
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,734
Hospital.

423
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,617
Say that again. What did you say?

424
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,245
I need to bring it to the hospital.

425
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,830
Speak louder. What about a hospital?

426
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,127
Why can't I reach him again?

427
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,170
I should've quit sooner.

428
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,968
It's up. It's up again.

429
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,344
Please.

430
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,888
Please.

431
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,473
W - TWO WORLDS

432
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,100
"SECRET OF THE TABLET"

433
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,184
Please.

434
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,654
Shit! I told you to be careful.

435
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,249
So you expect me

436
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,752
to believe that?

437
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,547
It's true.

438
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,913
-Go in and guard him.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,375
Also, he's already dead.

440
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,669
It's okay if he dies,
so don't give him any water.

441
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:41,962
Yes, sir.

442
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:55,810
Pick him up.

443
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,117
It's me.

444
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:14,954
Tell him I need to take care of
something urgent on my way there.

445
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,299
What time is it?

446
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:29,510
What?

447
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,680
Just tell me what time it is.

448
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:34,723
What time is it?

449
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:36,725
It's 2:30 a.m.

450
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:39,603
2:30 a.m.

451
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,360
It's been 30 minutes now.

452
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,738
He should be there by now.

453
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:51,449
What?

454
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,583
Su-bong, the item is coming to you.

455
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,293
Guard it well.

456
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:04,920
What are you saying?

457
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,468
TO BE CONTINUED

458
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:13,053
SU-BONG, THE ITEM IS COMING TO YOU.
GUARD IT WELL.

459
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,805
What is this? Is this my name?

460
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,765
Is he calling me?

461
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,938
Stop crying and wait.
I might call for help.

462
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,611
Was that what he was talking about?

463
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,030
Was it?

464
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:44,126
Are you going to carry it yourself?
It looks heavy. Let me carry it.

465
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,837
-It's fine. Lead the way.
-Yes, sir.

466
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,473
Mr. Oh!

467
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,727
A new chapter came up.

468
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:04,772
A new chapter?

469
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:08,442
Did things go wrong with him, too?

470
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:10,861
I'm not sure what happened,

471
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,572
but Chul is dying.

472
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,118
Take a look at this.

473
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,495
SU-BONG, THE ITEM IS COMING TO YOU.

474
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,330
He left a message for me.

475
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:26,085
This is for me, right?

476
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,419
He says the item is coming here.

477
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,756
What does he mean by that?
What is "the item"?

478
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
Is it the tablet? It is, right?

479
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,895
Which floor is it, sir?

480
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,107
It's on the 8th floor.
Internal Medicine Ward, Room 810.

481
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,412
Hospital.

482
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,084
Say that again. What did you say?

483
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,087
I have to bring it to the hospital.

484
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,088
Bring what?

485
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,132
That tablet?

486
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,675
Why?

487
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:16,885
I need to save someone.

488
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,721
Who?

489
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,943
Let me get this straight.

490
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,779
That girl who got shot
by Han Sang-hun and disappeared...

491
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,575
was Oh Yeon-joo, your wife.

492
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,830
That's why you killed Han Sang-hun.

493
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,125
Your wife, who was brain-dead,

494
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,336
stayed in your penthouse

495
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,921
and died recently.

496
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,590
That's right.

497
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,550
She died.

498
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,011
And?

499
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,600
I can bring her back to life
with the tablet.

500
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,146
You saw what that tablet can do.

501
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,149
That's why I went to get it.

502
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,401
Bring her back to life?

503
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,281
Can you bring someone back from the dead
if you press enter?

504
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:24,578
It needs to be drawn.

505
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:25,996
Drawn?

506
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,582
The tablet's owner must draw it.

507
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,003
That's why I was going to bring it
to the hospital.

508
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,047
The owner is in the hospital now.

509
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,391
You crazy bastard!

510
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:47,726
Do you think
this is some kind of a cartoon?

511
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,937
How can you draw someone back to life?

512
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,733
Wasn't what you saw
like a cartoon as well?

513
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,113
So?

514
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:01,573
Keep talking.

515
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:10,416
Go and get some more boys.
I need to check something.

516
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,417
Yes, sir.

517
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,794
-Get them.
-Yes, sir.

518
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,891
Who are you?
You can't come here without permission.

519
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:29,351
We got Mr. Kang's permission.

520
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,061
Let us in.

521
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:35,607
What are you talking about?

522
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,276
Did you say Mr. Kang?

523
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,446
He's dead. How dare you use his name?

524
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,449
We rented this place for our VIP clients.

525
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,033
You can't barge in here.

526
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:54,251
Hello? Seo Do-yoon won't let us in.

527
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:56,003
Okay.

528
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,548
Please talk to Mr. Kang.

529
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,682
Hello?

530
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,309
Do-yoon.

531
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,186
Let them in.

532
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,479
Are you insane?

533
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:15,147
What are you going to do?

534
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:18,150
Let them see her.

535
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,048
-Is she really dead?
-Yes.

536
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:44,468
She definitely died recently.
She has a gunshot wound as well.

537
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,720
Okay. Back off for now.

538
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,567
How am I supposed to take this?

539
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,404
You can confirm it yourself.

540
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,073
How?

541
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,827
What better proof is there

542
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:14,122
than bringing my wife
back to life with a drawing?

543
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,584
It will answer all of your questions.

544
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:27,928
Sungjin Medical Center,
Internal Medicine Ward, Room 810.

545
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,847
His name is Oh Seong-moo.

546
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,142
2:30 a.m.

547
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,024
It's been 30 minutes now.

548
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,444
He should be there by now.

549
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,196
What?

550
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,412
Su-bong,

551
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,372
the item is coming to you.

552
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,124
Guard it well.

553
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,421
TO BE CONTINUED

554
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,341
What the...

555
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,844
What happened?

556
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,906
Here it is, Room 810.

557
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,201
YOON SEON-AE

558
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,454
What is this? It isn't Oh Seong-moo.

559
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,416
Excuse us.

560
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,088
Congressman Han Cheol-ho.

561
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,259
Hello. Is there a patient

562
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:52,429
other than that patient here?
Someone named Oh Seong-moo?

563
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,723
This is a private room.

564
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,309
-Shall I help you find him?
-No, thank you.

565
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,563
I must have the wrong room.
I'll let you go back to work.

566
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:09,029
Why would he lie about something
you'd figure out so quickly?

567
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,166
The third hypothesis.

568
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,419
I am currently in the real world,

569
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,923
so I can summon characters
by thinking about them.

570
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,718
Now, I summon Han Cheol-ho...

571
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,429
into the real world.

572
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,853
Shit.

573
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,397
It's the tablet, isn't it?

574
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,859
But how would that come here?

575
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,194
What is this?

576
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,910
Mr. Oh, it's Han Cheol...

577
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,705
Are you Oh Seong-moo?

578
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:03,166
Yes, that's me.

579
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:04,960
You're Oh Seong-moo?

580
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:07,295
You weren't here just now.

581
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,798
Hold on.

582
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:13,677
Why do you look so much like Han Sang-hun?

583
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:16,763
You're...

584
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:20,183
You're Han Sang-hun, right?

585
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,310
-How are you--
-Hey!

586
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:25,355
What are you doing? Give it to me!

587
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,524
What do you think you're doing?

588
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:28,859
Who are you?

589
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,612
-Help me!
-Who are you, asshole?

590
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,913
Mr. Oh.

591
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,834
How did he bring that here himself?

592
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,887
Is that really your tablet?

593
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,849
So there was a copy of it.

594
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,893
Will it function like the original?

595
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,362
Mr. Oh, Han Cheol-ho...

596
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,490
He went back.

597
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,633
Goodness, I'm sleepy. Do you have the key?

598
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,051
Yes.

599
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,602
Oh, my gosh. What is that?

600
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,813
-What do we do?
-What happened?

601
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:48,980
Oh, my gosh.

602
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,485
Hello? Sir? Wake up.

603
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,320
Are you okay?

604
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,988
Untie him first.

605
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:17,843
Hey.

606
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:23,515
Come to the hotel.
I have to explain something to them.

607
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,685
Chul is in danger.

608
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,104
He is actually...

609
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:38,989
Yeon-joo?

610
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,244
Nurse!

611
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:50,542
TO BE CONTINUED

612
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:59,759
When was that?

613
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:02,804
It was about 20 minutes ago.

614
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,180
-About 20 minutes ago?
-Yes.

615
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:05,932
I see.

616
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,316
-Hello?
-Su-bong.

617
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,318
Yeon-joo?

618
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,486
It's me. What happened?

619
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:22,324
Yeon-joo? Is that you?

620
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,867
Is that really you?

621
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:26,786
Goodness, are you really Yeon-joo?

622
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,956
Yes, I must have survived.

623
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,958
Where are you?

624
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,919
Where are you right now?

625
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,253
I...

626
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,965
I'm at a hotel. I suddenly came back.

627
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,801
Are you okay? Can you talk?

628
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,219
I guess you're talking now.

629
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,472
Are you hurt?
Do all of your fingers and toes move?

630
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,307
Do you remember everything?
What about your wound?

631
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,476
It doesn't hurt.

632
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:52,646
I feel completely fine.

633
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:56,358
You scared me to death.

634
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,485
How did I come back to life?

635
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:02,405
It was Mr. Oh! Mr. Oh drew you!

636
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:04,407
Is my dad back?

637
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:06,201
Of course, he is.

638
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:07,953
He didn't answer his phone.

639
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:11,373
What? He's probably in his workroom now.

640
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,875
He was waiting for the webtoon
to be uploaded.

641
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,336
W BY OH SEONG-MOO

642
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:25,428
He probably went there
after seeing the webtoon.

643
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,389
I'm actually looking for Chul.

644
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:28,807
Where?

645
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,267
At the place where he was tortured.

646
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,853
He was tortured?

647
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,898
I came to pick him up, but he isn't here.

648
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,069
Hey, hold on.

649
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:42,737
Goodness.

650
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,825
Shouldn't we call an ambulance?

651
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,118
Tell the boss.

652
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,411
Okay.

653
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,166
Goodness.

654
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:58,044
-Taxi.
-What?

655
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,048
Please get me a taxi.

656
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,342
I need to go to a hotel.

657
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:07,178
You should go to the hospital first.

658
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,181
Gosh.

659
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:15,311
He said he called an ambulance,
but Chul disappeared in the meantime.

660
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,064
Maybe he went to see you.

661
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,983
Was he hurt badly?

662
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:26,364
I see. How about my dad? Is he okay?

663
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:31,536
You were dead. Of course, he was worried.
Who's worried about whom right now?

664
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,204
Okay.

665
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:37,500
I'll read the webtoon
to see what happened.

666
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,836
That will be faster.

667
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:43,631
Okay.

668
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,220
-Thank you for letting me use the phone.
-Sure.

669
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:53,224
May I use a computer
to go online for a bit?

670
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,687
I NEED TO SAVE SOMEONE.

671
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,100
Why isn't he coming?

672
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:28,611
FINAL CHAPTER

673
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,486
We'll only be free once it ends.

674
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:10,945
What took you so long?

675
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,822
We can't get out of here

676
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,116
until this final chapter ends.

677
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,785
Get off me! Let me go!

678
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:20,288
So I got myself a hostage
in order to live.

679
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:21,581
Come here.

680
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,375
Why are you still alive?
I definitely shot you.

681
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,002
Why are you still alive?

682
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:28,630
The police are on their way here.
They will find this house soon.

683
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:30,381
We need to make a decision

684
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,634
on what kind of ending it'll be.

685
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,056
