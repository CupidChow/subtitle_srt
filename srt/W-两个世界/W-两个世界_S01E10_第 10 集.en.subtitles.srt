00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,287
W BY OH SEONG-MOO

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,205
With sales totaling ten million copies,

3
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:41,207
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

4
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,460
The main character, Kang Chul,

5
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:46,254
learns from Oh Yeon-joo
that he is a webtoon character.

6
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,093
They realize their feelings for each other

7
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:54,637
and dream of a new, happy life together.

8
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,349
I'll put a bullet in her head.

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,898
I almost died.

10
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:09,611
The real killer appears and threatens Chul
by saying he'd kill Yeon-joo.

11
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,613
I've waited ten years

12
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,531
for him to find me.

13
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,533
So how can it end?

14
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,243
How can this be the end?

15
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,662
Because of the existence
of the killer and Yeon-joo,

16
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,415
other characters in W lose their purposes

17
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,751
and start to disappear.

18
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:29,297
Make everything that happened
two months ago when we first met

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,924
to this moment a dream.

20
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,842
Forget me. Take care.

21
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,928
Chul joins forces with Seong-moo

22
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,847
and turns back time
to two months before he met Yeon-joo

23
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,849
in order to protect Yeon-joo
and the world of W.

24
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,394
Chul, how are you?

25
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,313
Are you happy these days?

26
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,072
What a pretty ring.

27
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:59,202
He completely forgot about me.

28
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,581
If it's for your daughter, you can do it
this time. Give W a happy ending.

29
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:07,127
I plan to end W with a happy ending.

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,004
We must come up with a face
that Chul can believe.

31
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:14,342
He is the only person
Chul will accept as the real killer.

32
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,096
I know him. He stabbed me on the roof.

33
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,307
The killer from ten years prior
was created and was about to be caught.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,393
Han Cheol-ho, who framed Chul
as the killer,

35
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,602
was also about to be caught.

36
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,854
You asshole!

37
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,316
Before all of that happened...

38
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,110
Where is Kang Chul?

39
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,573
...the killer shows up
with Seong-moo's face

40
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,741
and sends Chul's plans down the drain.

41
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,506
I'm going to pick up some snacks.
Do you want pork trotters?

42
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,757
You like pork trotters.

43
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,010
Yeah.

44
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,263
I'll be right back.

45
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:13,526
Su-bong!

46
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,363
Su-bong!

47
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,646
I WON'T BE EATEN UP.
I WILL EAT HIM UP INSTEAD.

48
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,075
You finally kept your promise.

49
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,254
So this was my face?

50
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:23,680
Yes.

51
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,808
This is me.

52
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,770
I was you.

53
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,485
This face suits me very well.

54
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,995
You've been wanting to kill Chul, too.

55
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:48,621
Just as I have.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,584
Let's stop this now!

57
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:28,953
That's when I realized

58
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,165
you and I...

59
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,834
share one soul.

60
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,760
Maybe that's why.

61
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,431
I think this face is perfect.

62
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,787
Let me go!

63
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,622
I gave you an identity.

64
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,916
I kept my word!

65
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,044
You're right. You kept your word.

66
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,213
But you're trying to kill me now.

67
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,424
You're working with Chul to kill me.

68
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,219
That's a betrayal.

69
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,723
All I did was follow your orders,
but now...

70
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,436
you are me, and I am you.

71
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,732
You shall follow my orders from now on!

72
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,669
I'm back, Mr. Oh!

73
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,421
Mr. Oh?

74
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,133
Have some pork trotters.

75
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,684
Mr. Oh, I bought some pork trotters.

76
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:17,895
Is he sleeping?

77
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:19,814
Sir?

78
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,899
Is that you, Su-bong?

79
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,572
It's me, Su-bong.

80
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:31,826
Su-bong.

81
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,290
SU-BONG

82
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,708
My face disappeared.

83
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:41,586
Su-bong.

84
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,927
Help me, Su-bong.

85
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,763
He took my face.

86
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,600
Where did my face go?

87
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,729
Su-bong.

88
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:02,565
Su-bong?

89
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:06,569
Sit down.

90
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,048
Draw me a gun. A nice one.

91
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,776
Bullets, too. Plenty of them.

92
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,536
More. Draw more bullets!

93
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,205
I'm going to kill many people.

94
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,333
Please take a close look at this picture.

95
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,880
This is the prime suspect
of the assault on Mr. Kang Chul

96
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,508
at the Seoul Prime Hotel on May 22nd.

97
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,262
On the day of the assault,
he was wearing a gray hooded jacket,

98
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,181
an olive green T-shirt, and navy trousers.

99
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:22,270
He wears glasses and has a gray beard.

100
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,439
He seems to be around 175cm tall.

101
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,568
If you have seen him
or know his whereabouts--

102
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,194
-What happened?
-What happened?

103
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,196
-What's going on?
-What was that?

104
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,949
-Did he collapse?
-Did he collapse?

105
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,117
What's wrong with him?

106
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,120
-What's going on?
-We're not sure.

107
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,788
-Did he collapse?
-Please wait.

108
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,377
-What is this?
-What's going on?

109
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,213
-What happened?
-Go and check.

110
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,013
Who are you?

111
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,186
Request assistance.

112
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,584
Chul.

113
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:30,087
Are you there?

114
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,882
Can you hear me?

115
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,721
I had to come because you were looking
so desperately for me.

116
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,806
I wanted to show you my face.

117
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,270
You suffered a lot because I didn't appear
for ten years, didn't you?

118
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,439
It was painful for me, too.

119
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,524
I wanted to appear in front of you,
but I had no means to.

120
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,071
This is me.

121
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,198
How's my face?

122
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,450
I love it so much.

123
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,331
I'll see you often.

124
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,540
Call an ambulance!

125
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,715
Help me.

126
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,941
The police are trying to find out
where he fled to,

127
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,445
but they haven't been able to
track him down yet.

128
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,238
Breaking news.

129
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,993
The face of the shooting suspect
has been released.

130
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,706
The man is presumed to be in his 60s,
and his identity is still unknown.

131
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,292
The police launched a manhunt
for the suspect.

132
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,210
-The suspect...
-What is this?

133
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,464
Why did Dad change the story again?

134
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,467
-Move!
-Especially to something this horrible.

135
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,260
What is he trying to do?

136
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,559
What about me?

137
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,145
Why am I here again?

138
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,482
Chul doesn't even recognize me now.

139
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,574
There was a false report
that you were badly injured.

140
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,783
Give them an interview.

141
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,786
You can do it in the lobby.

142
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,872
-Okay.
-Chul.

143
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,542
-I got a call from the police.
-Did they find him?

144
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,461
No. It was a bad tip.

145
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,966
They have no idea how he got in or out.

146
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,595
No camera caught him
going in and out of the set.

147
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,059
That was a false report.

148
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,686
I wasn't there,
and I wasn't injured at all.

149
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,064
Have you seen the video message
that the killer sent?

150
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:35,981
Yes, I have.

151
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:39,235
It was clearly addressed to you.

152
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,278
What did he mean by "ten years ago"?

153
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,239
Let me ask you that.

154
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,740
What do you think it means?

155
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,200
It sounds like he's saying

156
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:49,203
he's the killer who murdered your family
ten years ago.

157
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,414
Do you think it's the same person?

158
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,542
He said it himself.

159
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,295
-He said he came back after ten years.
-If he's really the killer,

160
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,297
that means the prosecutors' office
was wrong

161
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,299
and falsely accused you as the killer.

162
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,176
This isn't the right time for that,

163
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,513
but someone will definitely have to
take responsibility for that matter.

164
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,684
He missed the killer and accused
the victim as the murderer,

165
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,602
and now the killer has committed
a mass murder.

166
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,479
Are you talking about
Congressman Han Cheol-ho?

167
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,607
Even if I don't say his name,
everyone knows whom I mean.

168
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,528
And so does he.

169
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,698
That crazy psychopath bastard.

170
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:33,789
Sir, wouldn't it be better for you
to visit the crime scene now?

171
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,499
Before the public opinion get worse...

172
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,931
Excuse me. Who are you?

173
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,224
Pardon?

174
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,351
That's not our hospital's gown.

175
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,354
-Why are you here?
-I took my sister's gown by mistake.

176
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,440
She's also a doctor at another hospital.

177
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,650
You can move him now.
Please give him antibiotics,

178
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,068
and notify an orthopedic surgeon.

179
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,910
SAFETY CONTROL AREA

180
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:17,958
Excuse me?

181
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,807
STAFF ONLY

182
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,582
What's going on here?

183
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,001
What should I do?

184
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,254
Where do I go?

185
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,385
PLEASE WATCH THE PATIENT IN ROOM 1013
WHO KEEPS DRINKING SOJU

186
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,769
Why am I panicking?

187
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,647
He doesn't even recognize me.

188
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,892
Yeon-joo.

189
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,980
Is a doctor allowed to drink alcohol
in the hospital?

190
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,443
Isn't everyone on emergency call today?

191
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,698
They have enough doctors
working right now.

192
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,409
There are enough doctors
in the emergency room as well.

193
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,954
Plus, I'm not on call.

194
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,042
May I have a sip?

195
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,131
I'm desperate for some drink right now.

196
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:11,775
That feels better.

197
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,364
You can finish it.

198
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,125
Thank you.

199
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,349
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

200
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,395
It's been bothering me.

201
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,856
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

202
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,736
You look like someone.

203
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,488
I do? Like whom?

204
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,869
My husband.

205
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,962
Is that your wedding ring? No wonder.

206
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,387
Hello?

207
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,973
I'm on the roof.

208
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,934
Mr. Son's surgery is over.

209
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,894
Okay, I'll come down.

210
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,565
Thank you for the drink.

211
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,956
Seok-beom, what time is it?

212
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,713
It's been 12 hours since the incident.

213
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,923
-Turn down the volume.
-The suspect is still at large.

214
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,384
Two additional people died overnight.

215
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:45,762
As of now, 10 people died
and 13 were injured.

216
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:49,975
Three of the injured people
are in critical condition.

217
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,686
President Yoon Seok-jun

218
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,897
-expressed his condolences...
-Who are you?

219
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,942
-He considers the event...
-Why are you sleeping here?

220
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:03,196
-as an act of terrorism and will...
-I must have come into the wrong room.

221
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,163
What is this?

222
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:14,374
Why am I still here?

223
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,415
What's happening here?
Why am I still here?

224
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,003
We found no fingerprints or hair.
We couldn't find a thing.

225
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,590
How is this possible?
I just can't understand.

226
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,259
There should be some traces of him
on the surveillance camera.

227
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,595
-I don't understand.
-That day.

228
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:13,600
The suspect of the shooting,
which left more than 20 people injured,

229
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,519
is still on the run.

230
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,605
The police say
there's no recording of the suspect

231
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,274
entering or leaving
the scene of the crime,

232
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,360
which is causing difficulties
in the investigation.

233
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,238
-And the day after that.
-Kang Chul...

234
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:31,576
SIDE DISHES ARE SELF-SERVICE

235
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,548
Even the day after that,

236
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,717
I still couldn't go back home.

237
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,303
Although I no longer mean anything

238
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,930
to the main character...

239
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,224
Although I'm simply

240
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:39,060
an extra in this webtoon...

241
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,244
BLACK GARLIC

242
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:07,297
At 10 a.m. this morning,
a funeral was held at the W Office

243
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,591
for the ten shooting victims.

244
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,886
Among those in attendance were families
of the victims, the Prime Minister,

245
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,388
-the Chief Prosecutor...
-Hey.

246
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,474
Who are you?

247
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,856
I asked who you are.

248
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,068
You keep coming in here. Just who are you?

249
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,986
You are not from our department.

250
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,197
Is that my lab coat?

251
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,449
Hey!

252
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,784
Hey!

253
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,550
I'm hungry.

254
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,100
Isn't this So-hee's place?
I saw it often in the book.

255
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:43,727
Do you know the code?

256
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,941
DAEBAK BANK

257
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,404
I'm sorry.

258
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,031
I really don't want to do this.

259
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,575
I'll borrow this for a short while.

260
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,249
No, you don't need to come.

261
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,458
I'll take it.

262
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,168
What's the code?

263
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:33,920
-What is it?
-Oh, no!

264
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,051
I'm inside.

265
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:41,761
It's on the table?

266
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:43,972
Okay.

267
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,450
I found it. I'll come now.

268
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,035
You...

269
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,121
Oh Yeon-joo?

270
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,588
Not only did the government
not repay you for your hard work,

271
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:02,300
I can't believe this happened to you.
I am very sorry.

272
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,761
It's okay.

273
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,763
Don't say that.

274
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,140
I hope the killer is caught soon.

275
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,851
-We haven't solved the case,
-Do you know this girl?

276
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,104
yet we're having the funeral.
I don't know how to face the families.

277
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,986
I've never seen her before. Who is she?

278
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,571
The homeowner doesn't know you.

279
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,784
How do you know the code?

280
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,704
Hey, Yeon-joo.

281
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,965
If you don't explain yourself,
I'm calling the police.

282
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,551
Tell me. Why did you come here?

283
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,346
Why are you here?

284
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,561
I was hungry.

285
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:56,813
What?

286
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,151
I was too hungry.

287
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,363
I didn't eat for three days.

288
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,325
That doesn't make sense.

289
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,995
If you're hungry, you can buy food.
Why did you come here?

290
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,499
I don't have any money.

291
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,630
How can you not have any money?
You're a doctor.

292
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,467
I'm not a doctor.

293
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,890
I'm not a doctor there. You just assumed.

294
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,394
If you're not a doctor,

295
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,479
why were you in the ER that day?

296
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,067
She's not just a thief.

297
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,320
-Call the police.
-Yes, sir.

298
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,158
You know how things are these days, right?

299
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,119
I need to check everything
that's suspicious, no matter how minor.

300
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,872
The police are coming, so make
your statement at the station.

301
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:57,582
Okay.

302
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,587
You don't mind going to jail?

303
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,507
It's better there. They feed you,

304
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,343
and you can sleep there.

305
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,930
You don't even know what a jail is like.

306
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,767
-You must think it's like a hotel--
-I know. I've been there before.

307
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,980
Just turn me over to the police.

308
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,650
But...

309
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,488
before they get here,
can't I eat some instant ramen?

310
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,239
The water is boiling.

311
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,581
I'm just really hungry, that's why.

312
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,424
What's your name?

313
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,095
-Oh Yeon-joo.
-What's your real name?

314
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,721
Oh Yeon-joo.

315
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,100
Where do you live? What's your address?

316
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,477
I don't have one.

317
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,647
-You don't have a family?
-No.

318
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,441
You said you were married.

319
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,568
You said your husband looks like me.

320
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,088
-Do you need kimchi?
-Yes, please.

321
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,393
Ouch, it's hot!

322
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,357
That hurts!

323
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,067
Of course, it does.

324
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:12,383
Hold on.

325
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,888
It'll hurt for a few days.

326
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,232
I'm fine.

327
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,276
Stay still.

328
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,113
I'm fine. Please stop.

329
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,615
You just said it hurts.

330
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,949
I said stop it.

331
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:41,496
Why are you touching me?
You're making it hard for me to move on.

332
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,624
I tried my best not to run into you.

333
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,293
I was homeless for over a week,

334
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,631
and I even stole. But still,
I never asked you for money.

335
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,675
I wanted to stay out of your life.

336
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,140
So why did you show up here,
being all nice and stuff?

337
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,892
It's so annoying!

338
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,895
Why are you getting angry?

339
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:09,232
Yes, I'm married.

340
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,485
This is my wedding ring,

341
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,862
but I don't have a husband.

342
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,533
That's why I have no one to come help me.

343
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,036
How can you not have a husband
when you're married?

344
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,538
He disappeared!

345
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,665
He's not dead, and we aren't divorced.

346
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,999
He just disappeared.

347
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,505
We didn't even do much.

348
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,758
We only did four sweet things.

349
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,305
He disappeared
after doing those four little things.

350
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,058
He was gone after only a day.

351
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,519
Isn't it funny?

352
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:51,816
He never even...

353
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,987
told me that he loved me.

354
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,282
I was the only one that said it.

355
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,743
Then he disappeared.

356
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,791
This is so unfair.

357
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,505
But I tried to forget him
since he said it would be a happy ending.

358
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,341
How is this a happy ending?

359
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:20,219
I don't know why we bothered breaking up.

360
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,267
I don't know why I'm here
when he doesn't even recognize me.

361
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,814
I want to go home, but I don't know how.

362
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,277
I don't know anyone here,
and I don't have money!

363
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,907
Am I too dumb for this?

364
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,493
I don't understand a word you're saying.

365
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:49,040
I don't expect you to.
Just leave me alone.

366
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,474
Mr. Kang, they're here.

367
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,815
Thank you.

368
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,414
Why didn't you turn me over?

369
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:33,167
You seem to prefer the police over me,

370
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,461
so I feel like I'd be missing out
if I gave you to them.

371
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:39,257
I don't have anything.
I'm just a petty thief.

372
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:40,841
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

373
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,680
Why are you doing this to me?

374
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,974
Don't take an interest in me.

375
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,475
That's a strange choice of words.

376
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,310
I'm not interested. I'm suspicious.

377
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,944
MR. SON

378
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:01,862
Hello, Mr. Son?

379
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,406
Where are you?

380
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,368
I'm going to the office to talk to
the victims' families about consolation.

381
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,997
Can you come by here before you go?

382
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,833
Okay, I will.

383
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,628
-Let's stop by Sungjin Medical Center.
-Okay.

384
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,591
It's been a week since the incident,

385
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,510
but the killer is still at large.

386
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,763
About 80% of the public believe

387
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:32,727
that he is the same killer who murdered
Kang Chul's family in 2006.

388
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,563
Moreover, over 70% think

389
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,816
that Congressman Han Cheol-ho should be
held responsible for this incident

390
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,987
since he had named
Kang as the killer ten years ago.

391
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:47,325
This incident is expected to have a major
effect on his presidential election.

392
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,955
The killer admitted it himself.
It's over now.

393
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:53,956
No.

394
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,668
That's not what he meant.

395
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,587
These two cases are unrelated.

396
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,799
-They have no evidence that--
-Look here.

397
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,135
Ten people were shot to death.

398
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,388
It's game over now.

399
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:12,850
You need to resign.

400
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:15,853
Are you telling me to step down

401
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,230
after getting this far?

402
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:23,277
Don't drag everyone down with you.

403
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,237
You are on your own now.

404
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,544
RESTRICTED NUMBER

405
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,129
Hello.

406
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,006
Is this Mr. Han Cheol-ho?

407
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,927
-Who is this?
-Don't you know me?

408
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,305
I'm the most famous person
in the nation right now.

409
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,057
Who are you?

410
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,267
I called to console you.

411
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,770
You must want to die right now
because of me.

412
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,610
RECORD

413
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,199
-You...
-That's right. It's me.

414
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,290
Do you know what will happen to you
if I get caught?

415
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:19,959
I do.

416
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,796
You will kill me.

417
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:30,428
You will order gangsters
to disguise it as a suicide.

418
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,182
You will make up a fake
suicide note to dump it on Chul as well.

419
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:42,022
You crazy asshole.
Who do you think you're talking to?

420
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,482
Who is it, sir?

421
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,152
Weren't you just thinking that?

422
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,237
You were going to do that if I got caught.

423
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,115
I'm right.

424
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,826
You will kill me to become president.

425
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,328
Just like you requested
the death sentence for Chul

426
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,289
ten years ago
because you wanted to be a politician.

427
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,293
I know it all.

428
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,923
Shall I tell you what will happen
to the both of us from now on?

429
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:11,886
We're playing second fiddle
for Chul's happy ending.

430
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,471
We will kill each other.

431
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,140
But I don't think

432
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,767
there's a need for us to do that.

433
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,311
For whose benefit?

434
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,153
I'll make you the next president.

435
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,405
What?

436
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:32,865
I'll help you.

437
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,827
I know a lot of things about Chul.

438
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,764
-Stay here and watch her.
-Yes, sir.

439
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,983
They haven't caught the killer yet?

440
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:09,401
Yes.

441
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:12,238
I heard they haven't found any evidence.

442
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,406
It's true.

443
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:20,746
Let's write some lines. Write this down.

444
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,503
First...

445
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,088
is Chul's line.

446
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,007
CHUL

447
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,094
"It's none of your business, Dad.
Who do you think you are?"

448
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,221
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, DAD

449
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,639
Chul's father now.

450
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,226
"How dare you get drunk
and give me an attitude?

451
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,519
You little brat!"

452
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,104
HOW DARE YOU GET DRUNK

453
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:49,024
Yes?

454
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,651
Hello.

455
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,363
My goodness, Chul. It's good to see you.

456
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:57,283
Honey, Chul's here.

457
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:01,245
You must be tired. Have you eaten lunch?

458
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:03,372
-I have.
-Do you mind...

459
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,083
giving us some privacy?

460
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:10,838
-What?
-Don't let anyone in.

461
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,215
Oh, okay.

462
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,969
-Grab a drink from the fridge.
-Okay.

463
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,688
-Did something happen?
-Yes.

464
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,356
Something happened.

465
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,860
On the day of the incident,

466
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,863
I received an e-mail.

467
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,949
But given what happened,

468
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,119
I couldn't check it until just now.

469
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,581
Someone had sent me a tip.

470
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,334
A tip? About the killer?

471
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,543
Yeah.

472
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,546
But not from this incident,

473
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,382
but from ten years ago.

474
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,221
It's an audio file.

475
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:03,641
You should hear it.

476
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,684
AUDIO FILE

477
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,438
It's none of your business, Dad.
Who do you think you are?

478
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:13,359
How dare you get drunk and give me
an attitude? You little brat!

479
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:14,943
What is this?

480
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,988
I said I won't stand it
if you hit me again.

481
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,367
Honey, please stop! Chul, stop it.

482
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,745
You punk. Get out and never come back.

483
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,747
I don't need a son like you!

484
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,249
I can't believe I've raised him--

485
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,168
Honey!

486
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,594
What...

487
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,264
-What is this?
-That's what I want to ask you.

488
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,184
What is this?

489
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,943
I said I won't stand it
if you hit me again.

490
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:59,113
Honey, please stop! Chul, stop it.

491
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,116
You punk. Get out and never come back.

492
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,159
I don't need a son like you!

493
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:06,203
I can't believe I've raised him--

494
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,247
Honey!

495
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,083
Mr. Kang.

496
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,877
I mean, Chul.

497
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,464
From that day until now,

498
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:24,263
I've never once had any doubt
of your innocence.

499
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,266
But what's this?

500
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,813
You said you didn't go back home that day,

501
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,065
but what's this?

502
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,235
It's fake.

503
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,446
-Fake?
-It is.

504
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,656
It doesn't make sense.
I never had this conversation.

505
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:44,199
How could someone fake this?

506
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:49,663
I still remember your parents' voices.

507
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:54,793
How can anyone fabricate voices
of people who died ten years ago?

508
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,548
If you're hiding anything,

509
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,300
tell me.

510
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:07,598
What if you can't remember
because you were drunk?

511
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,225
Are you...

512
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,937
suspecting me right now?

513
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,565
I want to know the truth.

514
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,610
Chul.

515
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:21,528
Right now,

516
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,740
I'm very scared.

517
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:27,826
Are you sure...

518
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,621
you're really innocent?

519
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,998
Who sent this?

520
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,167
This is all fabricated.

521
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,377
I don't know how they got the voices--

522
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,941
Sir?

523
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,108
Sir!

524
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,515
-What happened?
-What's going on?

525
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,141
-Honey!
-What is this?

526
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,226
Honey.

527
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,939
What are you doing, Mr. Kang?

528
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:41,191
-Move out of the way.
-Calm down.

529
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,088
Please send support!
There's been a murder!

530
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:04,673
The suspect is in the building!

531
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:08,135
Honey!

532
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,935
There's been a shooting.

533
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,528
Mr. Kang, stop right there!

534
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:33,702
Mr. Kang!

535
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,674
What's going on?

536
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,510
Freeze! If you don't, we'll shoot!

537
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,188
-Mr. Kang.
-Out of the way.

538
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,276
Get out!

539
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,324
Mr. Kang!

540
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,211
What's going on? Where are you going?

541
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,420
CALL SEO DO-YOON

542
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,214
-Hello?
-What happened?

543
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,465
-What are you--
-It's a setup.

544
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,258
What do you mean?

545
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,220
The police won't be able to solve it,
so I ran away.

546
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,262
I'll call you later.

547
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:42,145
Are you hurt? Where are you hurt?

548
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,606
I'll drop you off somewhere,
so go wherever you need to.

549
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,733
Aren't you hurt?

550
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,111
-Stop the car. Hurry.
-I don't have time for that.

551
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,207
Stop the car. I'll drive.

552
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,753
Stop the car.
Otherwise, both of us will die!

553
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,312
Sit in the back.

554
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,481
Go where you need to go.

555
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,567
I'm being chased by the police.

556
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:30,694
I'm worse than a thief like you.

557
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,738
Being with me won't be good for you.

558
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:35,407
And go where? I have nowhere to go.

559
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,243
I have nowhere to go.
I don't know anyone either.

560
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,953
Get out.

561
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:55,552
Why were you hurt?

562
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,224
Give me your wallet.

563
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,936
I have to buy medical supplies,
and I have no money.

564
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,619
PHARMACY

565
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,498
Welcome.

566
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:25,999
Hello.

567
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,251
We have another shocking news.

568
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,961
May I get some gauze, bandage,

569
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:32,047
antiseptic, and painkillers?

570
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:36,051
-Wait one moment.
-He died around 6 p.m.

571
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:40,639
Mr. Son was shot during a shooting at W

572
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,974
and was being treated at the hospital

573
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,102
when he was shot by Kang Chul.

574
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:50,941
-Kang is on the run at the moment.
-Did you hear that? How shocking.

575
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,652
Kang Chul killed someone and fled.

576
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:54,986
I don't believe that.

577
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,865
Do you really think
Kang Chul would do that?

578
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,283
Why would he flee then?

579
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,536
He fled because he did kill him.

580
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:06,623
Finally, all the weird happenings
made sense to me.

581
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:10,794
Dad and Chul's plan
to get rid of the real killer

582
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,379
had failed.

583
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,130
He was shot and killed.

584
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,633
Right after the incident,

585
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,969
Kang Chul avoided police capture

586
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:21,137
-and fled the scene with a gun.
-What's this?

587
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,473
-We're now in a state of emergency.
-It's very strange.

588
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,893
-Why would Kang Chul shoot Son?
-What on earth is going on?

589
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,563
-Go and find out.
-Yes, sir.

590
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,860
Hi, Mr. Park, I was about to call you.

591
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,571
What happened? Why did Kang Chul do that?

592
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,156
I found out why Kang Chul
killed Son Hyeon-seok.

593
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,409
I thought I should let you know first.

594
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,869
Why did he kill him?

595
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:46,621
Kang Chul really did kill his father.

596
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,456
He was really the killer.

597
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,917
-We have evidence to prove it.
-Evidence?

598
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,794
You were right.

599
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,754
You have my respect, sir.

600
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,506
Tell me in detail.

601
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,220
Is that so?

602
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,227
As of now,

603
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,647
we're in a world
controlled by the real killer.

604
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,318
It's the world where the villain rules.

605
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,081
Is there a place you can hide?

606
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,215
Where should I go?

607
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:41,134
Where should I go?

608
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,513
Wake up.

609
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,181
Can you get up?

610
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,332
Don't lift your head.
You'll get caught on the camera.

611
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:56,793
Did we...

612
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,254
know each other?

613
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:03,508
Do you...

614
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:05,593
know me?

615
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,143
We're here. Let's get off.

616
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,780
Just a little more. We're almost there.

617
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,533
Hang in there.

618
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,131
Why are you crying?

619
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,301
What is it?

620
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,096
Am I dying?

621
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,263
You're not dying.

622
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,391
And I'm not crying.

623
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:46,111
Where are we?

624
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:51,783
In a hotel.

625
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,370
I tried to pick an inconspicuous one.

626
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:57,831
But I'm still worried.

627
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,258
You were framed, right?

628
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,135
Of something absurd?

629
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:12,011
That's why you ran, right?

630
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,433
I'll try to find out

631
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,893
what happened and how you can solve it.

632
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,521
I think something serious has happened.

633
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:23,982
I just don't know what it is yet.

634
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:30,196
It's too dangerous to stay here for long.

635
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,824
And you need more medical supplies.

636
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,326
That's why...

637
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,288
I have to get out of here.

638
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,708
Will you be okay alone?

639
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:48,131
-Look, Yeon-joo.
-Hang in there and wait for me.

640
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,217
I don't understand

641
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:53,052
anything you just said.

642
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,138
What are you talking about?

643
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,308
How can you help me?

644
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,144
Because I'm one of those people

645
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,856
who want your life to have a happy ending.

646
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,404
So our breakup would not be in vain.

647
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,413
Yeon-joo.

648
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,710
Who...

649
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:28,755
are you?

650
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,185
I have to get out of here.

651
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:44,479
So...

652
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,691
I really hope this works again.

653
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,367
TO BE CONTINUED

654
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,501
Do you know what happened to Kang Chul?

655
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,836
I'm trying to make it a dream again
like last time.

656
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,213
How about going further back?

657
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:18,216
Let's make it a dream he had
before the killer had appeared.

658
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:19,342
Are you Oh Yeon-joo?

659
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,261
The main character isn't
the only one who can pull me in.

660
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:25,264
-He must have died.
-What's your relationship to Mr. Kang?

661
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,684
I'm just curious
whether or not he's alive.

662
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,019
Mr. Kang has been looking for you.

663
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,312
He is...

664
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,147
alive?

665
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,902
