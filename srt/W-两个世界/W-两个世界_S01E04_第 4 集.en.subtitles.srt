1
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,582
With total sales hitting
ten million copies,

2
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,667
W is Korea's best webtoon series.

3
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,838
Kang Chul is the main character.

4
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,638
The artist of the best-selling W,
Oh Seong-moo,

5
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:59,559
is terrified by Kang Chul
who has come to life,

6
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:00,894
and tries to kill him.

7
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,353
GROANING

8
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,737
Oh Seong-moo's daughter, Oh Yeon-joo,
gets dragged into the cartoon world

9
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,781
and saves Kang Chul's life.

10
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,909
You also saw him, didn't you?

11
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,369
You saw the living Chul.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,581
She realizes that Kang Chul
is not just a cartoon character.

13
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,212
-Please let me in.
-No, you can't--

14
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,505
Oh, no. Please.

15
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,881
She tries to stop her father.

16
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:31,257
Are you okay?

17
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,094
Yeon-joo appears in front of him
when he is in danger

18
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,971
and disappears after saving him,

19
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,307
bringing Kang Chul closer to the truth.

20
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,022
I can do it if I want to.

21
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,691
That can't be.

22
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,948
Finally, it's in my possession.
The key to my life.

23
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,825
Anyway, is she really pretty?

24
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,787
Why does everyone say she's pretty?

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,748
As time passes,
his feelings for Yeon-joo change.

26
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,000
Are you married?

27
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,669
No.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:09,963
That's good.

29
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,518
He's not there?

30
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,689
Hey, are you really sure about that?

31
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,860
All right. Pull everyone out.

32
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,196
They haven't done anything.

33
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,198
Okay.

34
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,040
SON HYEON-SEOK,
PRODUCER OF CRIME INVESTIGATION PROGRAM

35
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,670
You didn't have to come here.
No one likes seeing you here.

36
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,338
Why not?

37
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,340
They're ashamed.

38
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:58,011
Their employer was attacked,
and they found no clues for two months.

39
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,345
Of course they're ashamed.

40
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,557
They're all getting ready to resign.
That includes me, too.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,558
Gosh.

42
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,643
You're only saying that
to stop me from nagging.

43
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,270
I mean it.

44
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,149
We lost the lead once again.
There's no trace at all.

45
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,779
I got video footage of the truck
entering here, but not when it left.

46
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,115
It's driving us nuts.

47
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,784
Is that right?

48
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,371
By the way, what happened to Oh Yeon-joo?

49
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,918
So-hee said something, right?

50
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,213
The case is not advancing
because you lost her.

51
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:37,133
You know that all of us
are desperately looking for her.

52
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,509
Why would you hide her?

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,639
She can't disclose her identity,
so I'm protecting her.

54
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,767
So, why can't she reveal her identity?

55
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,603
And why do you want to protect her?

56
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,730
What's going on between you two?

57
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,692
-What?
-I saw the video from the store.

58
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,070
There's definitely something going on.

59
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,030
You saw that?

60
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,616
Gosh, seriously.

61
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,327
I think Ms. Yoon is upset.

62
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,079
She must be.

63
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:10,416
I was wondering
when you two would get married.

64
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,961
You won't find someone better.

65
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:16,256
I'm old-fashioned, so what do I know?

66
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,924
You two figure it out.

67
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,551
Anyway, I need you to explain to me.

68
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,637
You shouldn't keep anything from me.

69
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,224
That's precisely why I'm here.
I have something to tell you.

70
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,601
About that nurse...

71
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,104
-Why did you switch the drug?
-...who switched drugs on me.

72
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,564
I really don't remember anything.

73
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,444
I really have no idea.
I don't know why I switched them.

74
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,571
If you don't know, why did you run?

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,449
I don't know why I tried to run away.

76
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,537
It's just that, after a while,

77
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,790
I realized something wasn't right.

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,669
That woman is still insisting
that she doesn't know anything.

79
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,879
It's actually very strange.

80
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,674
She has no motive to kill you.

81
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,384
She was a hard-working nurse.

82
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,885
Why would she do that?

83
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,680
It just doesn't make any sense.

84
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,515
I'm stuck.

85
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,185
You have to be stuck. There's no context.

86
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,397
-Context?
-Yes, context.

87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,110
Things without context like this
keep happening to me.

88
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,738
I suddenly got stabbed
with a knife without reason

89
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,740
and was saved by a girl
who appeared without reason.

90
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,950
I almost got hit by a truck
and almost died without reason.

91
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:29,037
And that truck just inexplicably
disappeared without reason.

92
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,247
I told you, right?

93
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,999
It was like this
the day I was stabbed, too.

94
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,013
I remember a guy calling me,
claiming to know who murdered my family.

95
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,433
But I don't remember who it was
or why I trusted him.

96
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,602
I'm fine.

97
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,397
I don't know why I ditched my guards
before a dangerous encounter.

98
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,357
That's why I was helplessly attacked.

99
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,489
That day, I acted foolishly
as if I was determined to die.

100
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,787
What's strange is that
I don't remember why I did it.

101
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,872
It's the same for that nurse, too.

102
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,501
The nurse doesn't know
why she tried to kill me.

103
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,752
It's the same with that truck.

104
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,087
It came out of nowhere.

105
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,839
There was no license plate either.

106
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,133
I looked at the driver,
and he wasn't even trying to stop.

107
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,220
He almost hit a person,
but he didn't even bother to stop.

108
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,306
Then he disappeared into thin air here.

109
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,936
Everything that's been happening
to me these days is like that.

110
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,857
There should be a motive and suspect
to every crime, but they're missing.

111
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,526
Just like what happened ten years ago.

112
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,825
I've been desperately trying
to find the answer to this.

113
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,494
We've done so much until now.

114
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,746
I even bought the broadcasting station.

115
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,541
We created the TV show
to find a legal means,

116
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,834
but it's an investigation center.

117
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:41,502
I've invested trillions of won in it.

118
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,212
But what did we get out of it?

119
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,090
Of course, other cases
were solved in the meantime.

120
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,884
We helped arrest 99 percent
of the suspects.

121
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,720
Thanks to that, I get treated like a hero.

122
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,804
However,

123
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,184
we found no clues about the killer
whom we're really after.

124
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,645
We don't know his motive.
He's not likely a psychopath.

125
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,899
We got neither a strand of his hair
nor a witness in the past ten years.

126
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:04,442
So?

127
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,070
These days, I even started
having weird thoughts.

128
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:11,449
Perhaps the person
we're desperately looking for

129
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,618
is in another dimension.

130
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,370
And that I may never find him

131
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,039
even if I devote my life to it.

132
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,166
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,377
Are you saying the killer
is an alien or something?

134
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,797
He could be an alien.

135
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,174
What?

136
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,719
But not the alien we imagine.

137
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,597
They look like us and behave just like us.

138
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:36,349
Like Yeon-joo for example.

139
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,936
She knows everything about me.

140
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,104
It's as if she's been looking
over my life from above.

141
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,776
That was the saddest scene.

142
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,196
The Hangang Bridge.

143
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,323
I cried

144
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,368
with you back then.

145
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:58,579
I was afraid...

146
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,917
Chul would really kill himself.

147
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,131
She even knows my feelings
and thoughts that I never told anyone.

148
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,677
-How is that possible?
-I don't know.

149
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,222
Thankfully, she genuinely wishes me well.

150
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,475
-She tries to save my life.
-Why?

151
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:20,935
I'm not sure.

152
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,397
I think there's someone who wants
to harm me there as well.

153
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,567
That person who created
those nonsensical events

154
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,485
and is dying to kill me.

155
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:30,945
And who is that?

156
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,573
I don't know.

157
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,033
But I realized one thing for sure.

158
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,536
That person did all of this.

159
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,377
-Are you stunned?
-Of course.

160
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:52,049
You'll think differently if you see
a girl survive a gunshot to her heart.

161
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,221
I'm positive that Yeon-joo
is the key to my life.

162
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,475
She's the only one who can
open the door to all the secrets.

163
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,205
What's all this?

164
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,084
They're things you'll need including
clothes, shoes, and cosmetics.

165
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,128
Are you saying they're all for me?

166
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,547
Goodness. I can't wear them all.

167
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,634
Mr. Kang ordered us to bring over
a generous amount.

168
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,595
If you have your own preference,
please let us know.

169
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,773
That dress he bought me
was over three million won.

170
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,734
How much would all those be?
Tens of millions of won?

171
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,110
No. Hundreds of millions?

172
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,201
Oh, dear. What is it?

173
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:01,994
I just wanted to give you a hand.

174
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:04,538
It's okay. I can do it by myself.

175
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,207
You can wait outside.

176
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,335
I was told to serve you from now on.

177
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,629
Did you say serve?

178
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,131
You will serve me?

179
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,299
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,594
That's not necessary.

181
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,597
-May I help you with that?
-It's fine.

182
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,141
-Here, let me.
-I can do it. It's okay.

183
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:31,774
You don't have to do my makeup.

184
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:32,942
I'll be done soon.

185
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,240
It's okay. It's a bit uncomfortable.
I'll do it myself.

186
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,827
Mr. Kang likes the feminine style.

187
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:45,371
What do you mean by that?

188
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:50,000
Why do I have to dress up
according to his personal taste?

189
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,336
I thought you were his fiancée.

190
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,132
-Excuse me?
-I heard you were his fiancée.

191
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,468
-Me?
-Yes.

192
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:01,512
I see.

193
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:09,228
Why is the story going this way?

194
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,274
W is a hero action cartoon.

195
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,611
Gosh. Why is it becoming
more like a romantic drama?

196
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,532
This is making my heart flutter.

197
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,205
Mr. Kang is calling.

198
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,207
Okay.

199
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,260
Hello?

200
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,678
What are you doing?

201
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,347
Even hearing his voice
makes my heart pound.

202
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,474
Are you doing okay?

203
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,565
I'm calling because
I'll be out of reach until tomorrow.

204
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:55,816
Are you comfortable there?

205
00:12:56,484 --> 00:13:00,029
Why did I become your fiancée?

206
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,489
Right.

207
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,658
The staff might find it strange.

208
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,619
I can't exactly say I'm locking you up.

209
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,287
Are you offended by it?

210
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,539
Not exactly.

211
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,252
Are you afraid
your boyfriend might find out?

212
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,962
I don't have a boyfriend.

213
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,256
You don't? Why not?

214
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,842
Do I have to have a boyfriend?

215
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:26,305
No. But you're an attractive woman.
I don't get why you're single.

216
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,681
Are you teasing me?

217
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,892
You said if I'm pretty,
a stray dog would be pretty.

218
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,979
You may not be pretty,
but you are charming.

219
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,566
How should I say it?
You're charming in an idiotic way.

220
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,491
Hello?

221
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,205
Are you upset? I was just joking.

222
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,998
I'm not upset.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,752
Even that made my heart flutter.
I really am an idiot.

224
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,175
Don't laugh while keeping me locked up.
You're enjoying this too much.

225
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,012
If you want to go home,
feel free to call me.

226
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:08,430
You know that, right?

227
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,310
Good night.

228
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,729
I love you.

229
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,699
You know that doesn't work on me.

230
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,036
I know. I just took a shot
since you told me I was charming.

231
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,996
I guess not.

232
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,833
Good night.

233
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,796
I am an idiot.

234
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,139
If I hear that one more time,
I might get swayed.

235
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,266
Hear what?

236
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,103
So this is how a penthouse looks.

237
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,898
Wow, it's nice.

238
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,367
Three days have passed.

239
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,663
How much time has passed in the
real world? 5 minutes? 30 minutes?

240
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,209
What do I do?
I'm getting used to the life here.

241
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,463
How can I go back?

242
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,257
My gosh.

243
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,926
So this is where you were.

244
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,177
Yes.

245
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,720
What are you doing?

246
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,765
I couldn't sleep,
so I was just looking around.

247
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,059
How are you feeling?

248
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,103
I'm fine.

249
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,272
Would you have a glass of wine
with me then?

250
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,024
Wine?

251
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,568
Yes. You seem bored.

252
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,072
I am a little bored.

253
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,324
Let's go.

254
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,250
Where are you going?

255
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,710
Upstairs.

256
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,169
Mr. Kang said...

257
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,880
We're just going upstairs
for a glass of wine.

258
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,173
You can come with us.

259
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,350
I assume you have a family.

260
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,645
-I do.
-They must be worried about you.

261
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,482
Chul is so selfish to lock you up here.

262
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,569
My family probably hasn't noticed
that I'm gone.

263
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,904
But it has been two days.

264
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,658
They don't really care about me.

265
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,745
I see.

266
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,459
I forgot I have a video call.

267
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,003
Please go ahead.
It'll just take five minutes.

268
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,256
Please show her the way.

269
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,340
Excuse me?

270
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,513
This way, please.

271
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,151
Thank you.

272
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,283
Yes.

273
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,327
She's seated.

274
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,454
Pardon?

275
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,213
It's pretty.

276
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,633
I guess it's not all that bad.

277
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,426
When else would I come
to a place like this?

278
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,431
-For two people?
-Yes.

279
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,809
Wait...

280
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,063
Aren't you that person?

281
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,317
You're the doctor from the roof
when Mr. Kang was stabbed.

282
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,612
What building is this?

283
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,366
This is a hotel. Seoul Prime Hotel.

284
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,451
It's you, isn't it?

285
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:43,205
Everyone looked all over for you
because you disappeared.

286
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,457
The police are looking for you, too.
Didn't you know?

287
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,793
You were even on the news.

288
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,503
Why didn't you come sooner?

289
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,213
Well, that's...

290
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,884
I didn't know it was this hotel.
So it was the roof of this hotel.

291
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,012
Excuse me for a moment.

292
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:05,477
Oh no. What should I do?

293
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,605
She's here!

294
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:11,567
The lady who gave Mr. Kang first aid
when he was stabbed.

295
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:13,944
What?

296
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,696
Gosh.

297
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:30,961
Who is she?

298
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,384
OH YEON-JOO

299
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,265
What's up?
What do you want to say this time?

300
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,226
What do I do? The police might catch me.

301
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,979
The police? Why?

302
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,398
Ms. Yoon...

303
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,777
Excuse me. Hold on a second.

304
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,488
We must find her right away. She's nearby.

305
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,325
-Someone passed by here.
-Over there.

306
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,911
Where should I go?

307
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,496
I can't have the police find me.

308
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:10,792
-Me neither. Where are you?
-I'm going down the stairs.

309
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,087
-She's over here!
-Oh no.

310
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,427
Stay calm. Hide somewhere
to buy time until I figure it out.

311
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,180
I'm on the 28th floor.

312
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:25,057
I'll call you back.

313
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:27,768
What's going on?

314
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,979
I told you to protect her.

315
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,523
Ms. Yoon said it was your order.

316
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,819
Go to the 28th floor.
She'll be hiding somewhere.

317
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,112
-Help her.
-Yes, sir.

318
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:43,825
There she is!

319
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,204
-Hurry up and get her.
-Gosh.

320
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,414
Check the surveillance camera.

321
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:52,834
Ms. Oh!

322
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,922
I'll use Room 2816.

323
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,891
Hey, stop!

324
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,581
Come with us.

325
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:49,975
Where are you?

326
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,685
It's me, sir.

327
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,770
I'm sorry. She was caught.

328
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,316
Why do you have her phone?

329
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,693
She secretly threw it to me
before she got caught.

330
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,529
I don't think she'll say anything about
what happened in the penthouse.

331
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,703
What's going on?

332
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,290
-So-hee created trouble.
-What?

333
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:30,390
-Where's Yeon-joo?
-She was caught by the police.

334
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,853
I heard it wasn't Mr. Kang's order.

335
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,647
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

336
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,069
Hello?

337
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,404
Hello, Detective Park.

338
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,158
Oh Yeon-joo has been caught?

339
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:49,868
Where?

340
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,829
She was in the hotel?

341
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,122
The first item on the news.

342
00:22:54,581 --> 00:23:00,879
The sole witness of JN Global's
Kang Chul's attack has been identified.

343
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,424
There are many assumptions and rumors
regarding the case

344
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,093
that has remained unsolved for months.

345
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,929
-We'll have to wait...
-She's finally caught.

346
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,514
...if we can finally find some clues.

347
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,349
Ms. Oh, who pretended to be a doctor,

348
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,268
was initially known as
and considered the only witness.

349
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:18,438
However, as time passes, it seems likely

350
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,315
- that she's a suspect.
-Tell us the truth!

351
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:22,984
-Please tell us about the case.
-Ms. Oh!

352
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:25,779
What's your name?

353
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,949
-Oh Yeon-joo.
-That's not your name.

354
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:30,534
What's wrong with you?

355
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,786
What's your real name?

356
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:35,705
Oh Yeon-joo.

357
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,793
What's your government ID number?

358
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,753
Your ID number.

359
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,548
-I don't know.
-What's your home address?

360
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,676
I don't have one.

361
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,560
You know Kang Chul, right?

362
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,395
He's more powerful than the police.

363
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,897
No one can touch him
because the public loves him.

364
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,483
The people hail him as their hero.

365
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,861
The hero was attacked and stabbed,

366
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,779
but we couldn't find any clues
for over two months.

367
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,992
Do you know how bad it has been?
Let's make things easier.

368
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,702
Please help me out.

369
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,622
What's your ID number?

370
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,088
I just can't understand.

371
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,174
Here you go.

372
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,093
There's nothing.

373
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,637
She won't give any answers
and her fingerprints aren't in the system.

374
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,389
She must be an illegal immigrant.

375
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:37,017
I sought help from the Chinese police,
but something's weird.

376
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,436
I can feel it. Something's off.

377
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,271
You can just tell.

378
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,648
No, that's not it. No.

379
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,849
Yeon-joo.

380
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,109
I'm sorry, but from my perspective,
this was for the best.

381
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:33,448
I was worried about Mr. Kang
looking down on the police.

382
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,284
And we can't keep you locked in forever.

383
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,453
It doesn't make sense

384
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,331
for him to be living with a suspect.

385
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,917
He doesn't even know who you are.

386
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:52,509
Cooperate with the police
in the investigation and we'll help you.

387
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,970
But for now, we can't help you.

388
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:59,099
How can a victim help a suspect?
You should prove your innocence first.

389
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,268
Reveal your identity.

390
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,770
Tell them everything you witnessed.

391
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:07,565
After that, we'll provide you
with everything including a lawyer.

392
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,112
I have no identity to reveal.

393
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,824
Everyone has an identity.

394
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:19,494
I don't. I really don't have one.

395
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:31,047
Someone must have told you
how they switched the drugs.

396
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,093
Why did you run in there
if you didn't know?

397
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,177
It doesn't make sense.

398
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,517
Why do you carry a fake business card?

399
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,438
There must be a reason why
you carry it with fake information.

400
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,108
What's the reason?

401
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,902
Someone must be behind all this.

402
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,821
Who's really behind this?

403
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,615
You won't talk?

404
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,617
Hey, you!

405
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,661
Keeping your mouth shut
won't make it go away!

406
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,829
What are you going to do?

407
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:05,749
Answer me already!

408
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,970
Did you admit to the crime?

409
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,889
-How do you feel?
-What was the reason?

410
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,183
-What was your reason?
-What happened?

411
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,894
Tell us the truth!

412
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:31,358
After interrogating her, the police
concluded she is likely an accomplice.

413
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,401
Because she is a flight risk

414
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,236
and may destroy evidence,
she's being detained.

415
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,948
Oh was sent to
Seoul Detention Center today.

416
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:43,203
The victim, Kang, got the news
while on his business trip to the US.

417
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,245
You have a new cellmate.

418
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,146
Mr. Kang, did you hear the news?

419
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,192
The police believe she's a suspect.
Do you remember what happened?

420
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,443
I don't remember at all.

421
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,404
Do you think she is the culprit?

422
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,531
Definitely not.

423
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,117
How could I have been attacked
and stabbed by a woman?

424
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:27,414
There are rumors of
your prior relationship with Oh.

425
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,040
What do you think about that?

426
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,336
I don't believe in such rumors.

427
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,171
Don't believe it.

428
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:39,259
-Excuse us.
-Excuse us.

429
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,635
-Could you say more?
-Mr. Kang.

430
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,429
-Mr. Kang.
-Could you say a little more?

431
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,597
-Is it true?
-Do you not remember?

432
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,975
-Could you say more?
-Mr. Kang.

433
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,018
-Please say a little more.
-Please, Mr. Kang.

434
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,815
I'm sorry.

435
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,693
Let's stop by the police station first.

436
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:59,529
Yeon-joo was sent to
a detention center this afternoon.

437
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:02,282
-Where?
-Seoul Detention Center.

438
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,911
Everyone's very quick
when making a mistake.

439
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:11,332
So-hee just texted me
saying you won't answer your phone.

440
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,923
Here's the information we prepared.
Please review it.

441
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:19,966
Okay.

442
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,100
-Hello, where's Chul?
-It's me.

443
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
Mr. Kang, did you arrive?

444
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,605
Everyone is waiting for you.

445
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,732
I'm going to the detention center.
Send them away.

446
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,944
Excuse me for a second.

447
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,203
Even the lawyers don't know
what to do about it.

448
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:50,663
We have nothing to defend her with
even if she goes to jail.

449
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,499
She's not saying anything.

450
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,126
That's why I protected her.
Because she can't say anything.

451
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,711
Yet you sent her to her grave.

452
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,214
That's not my fault.

453
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:02,217
If she's innocent,
why can't she identify herself?

454
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,637
She's keeping her mouth shut and can't
defend herself. That says it all.

455
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,556
Oh Yeon-joo is not a witness.
She's the suspect.

456
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,850
For whatever reason,
she pretended to save you

457
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,435
and approached you again.

458
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,687
You're completely fooled
by her illogical claim.

459
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,398
I was framed in that same manner
and almost lost my life.

460
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:18,858
Did you forget?

461
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:21,945
That's exactly what they did to me.

462
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,696
They said it made no sense.

463
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,241
They asked why I went to school
instead of watching soccer.

464
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,034
I couldn't answer because
I had nothing to say.

465
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,162
That's how the victim
suddenly became the killer.

466
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,790
That will probably happen
to Yeon-joo, too.

467
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,334
Because it makes no sense.

468
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,422
Everyone looks at the appearance
instead of looking at the context.

469
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,591
And they believe they're being logical.

470
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,344
You say you acted sensibly,

471
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,138
but in fact, you didn't understand
Yeon-joo's context at all.

472
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,683
She didn't want me to be harmed,

473
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,768
so she tossed my cell phone
right before getting caught.

474
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,478
Her identity is not important.

475
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,898
If you understood the essence
of her actions, you wouldn't doubt her.

476
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:03,361
I started my business to help people
sacrificed by logic.

477
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,154
And yet, you created another victim.

478
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,241
You're unqualified
to be my personal assistant.

479
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,830
You should just remain my friend.

480
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,165
You're fired.

481
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:45,445
It's hot.

482
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:50,950
Inmate 4205.

483
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:57,373
Inmate 4205.

484
00:31:58,875 --> 00:31:59,751
Yes?

485
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,568
Sorry, I came too late.

486
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,529
It took me two days to come back.

487
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,449
How is it in there?

488
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,286
It's hot.

489
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:36,579
I see.

490
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:38,998
It's hot, isn't it?

491
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,502
I stayed here for a long time, so I know.

492
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,214
I spent four seasons here,
and it's unbelievably hot in the summer.

493
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:53,262
Is it tough?

494
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,432
No.

495
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,480
Yes.

496
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,735
I just can't believe this.

497
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,446
I can't get used to it.

498
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,741
This only happens in movies.

499
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:18,454
I never imagined I would end up here.

500
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,583
I'm just a normal person.

501
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,215
Normal people come here, too.

502
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,677
Not many people know they would come here.

503
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,849
It happens unexpectedly.

504
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,853
When you wake up, you find yourself
sitting inside a prison cell.

505
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:46,899
Listen carefully.

506
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,985
The current situation is hopeless.

507
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,613
I have no reason to help you,
and the problem will only get bigger.

508
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,659
Attempted murder, murder-for-hire,
illegal immigration, and your instigator.

509
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,537
You'll be interrogated over and over
for various reasons.

510
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,998
There will be continuous
investigations and trials.

511
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,000
It'll be never-ending.

512
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,170
And like that, your life is ruined.

513
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,298
They're convinced
that you're the criminal.

514
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,633
They are exhausted
from the last two months.

515
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,470
You have to be the assailant.

516
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,056
They'll do anything to make that happen.

517
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,308
They'll humiliate you, scare you,
and wreck your mind.

518
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:23,394
It may last several weeks,
months, or even years.

519
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,855
After going through all that,

520
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,733
you won't be able to live
an ordinary life.

521
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,197
So answer my question.

522
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,326
I believe you've only told me the truth.

523
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,455
So there's only one way
to avoid what will happen.

524
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,249
Answer the questions I ask

525
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,169
and disappear from here.

526
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,049
Where are you from, Yeon-joo?

527
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,308
If I disappear from here,

528
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,061
all hell will break loose.

529
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,815
It probably will.

530
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,692
But you shouldn't worry about that.

531
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,946
You just have to disappear
and go back to your home.

532
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,448
I will take care of the rest.

533
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,408
This is my world after all.

534
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,038
Answer me.

535
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,998
I can't.

536
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,877
I told you.
You'll become miserable if I do.

537
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:36,968
I don't think

538
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,054
I'm too happy now anyway.

539
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,726
I don't know when I'll die,
so I can't even sleep well.

540
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,645
You know that.

541
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:53,276
Is it okay for you to be locked up here
for the rest of your life?

542
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,570
For 10 to 20 years?

543
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,572
No.

544
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,996
Answer me. We don't have much time.

545
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,748
I don't know what will happen if I do.

546
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,167
Things already happened.

547
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,918
Look where we are.

548
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,797
Where do you live, Yeon-joo?

549
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,098
Seoul.

550
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,100
We're both in Seoul.

551
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:27,852
So what's different?

552
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,439
That's where I live,

553
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,110
and this is where you live.

554
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,864
Then how do you know all about me?

555
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,282
I'm not there.

556
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,370
You said you saw everything about me.

557
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,290
Where did you see them?

558
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,672
A nude show would be better.

559
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,637
I told you that seeing you nude
won't affect me.

560
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:06,641
Answer me.

561
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,315
-You will regret it.
-I won't regret it.

562
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,985
What do you mean by

563
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,029
the world I live in?

564
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,213
The world inside a cartoon.

565
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:40,967
What?

566
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,804
Do you mean you came out of a cartoon?

567
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:47,848
No.

568
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,517
Then?

569
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,396
This world.

570
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:00,903
What do you mean?

571
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:07,285
This world is inside a cartoon.

572
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,126
A cartoon

573
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,086
that I read.

574
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:24,927
And you are...

575
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,266
the main character of that cartoon.

576
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:50,453
TO BE CONTINUED

577
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:12,475
MYUNGSEI UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTRE

578
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:27,823
What? Where did she go?

579
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,173
Yeon-joo!

580
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,342
Yeon-joo! Gosh.

581
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,053
Goodness.

582
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,017
Yeon-joo...

583
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,188
No way! Were you really in jail?

584
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,196
Really?

585
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:11,534
Come on. You must be lying.

586
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,873
It can't be true.

587
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,251
No, it can't be true. It can't be.

588
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,964
I must be crazy. Gosh.

589
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,595
Yeon-joo, here's something
you can change into.

590
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,599
It has only been 30 minutes.

591
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,518
You disappeared
as I was talking to you on the phone.

592
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,067
I went to the bus stop,

593
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,611
and got your wallet and bag
from that woman.

594
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,029
-You only found these?
-Yes.

595
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:57,538
There must be something like a key.
She can't just go in.

596
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,707
There must be something.

597
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,376
I parked my car for a while
and Seon-mi called me.

598
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,254
-Hello?
-Su-bong, did you see?

599
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,923
-See what?
-Mr. Oh uploaded a new chapter.

600
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,176
He did? Just now?

601
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,637
Yes. But the story looks very strange.

602
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:14,930
It's too strange.

603
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,142
I think Mr. Oh has lost his mind.

604
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,145
-Why? Did Chul die?
-It's not that.

605
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,608
You have to see it yourself.
It's very strange.

606
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,569
-It doesn't make any sense.
-All right.

607
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,820
All right. Bye.

608
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,492
My goodness.

609
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,368
W BY OH SEONG-MOO

610
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,121
Where are you, Yeon-joo?

611
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,998
WHAT IS THIS NOW?

612
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:41,957
Darn it!

613
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,503
Does she think she can do whatever
she wants just because it's a cartoon?

614
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,546
YOU HAD TO KISS ME IN ORDER TO DISAPPEAR?
YES.

615
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,257
Look at her. They're kissing again.

616
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,344
Looks like her dream came true.
She must be so excited.

617
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,767
Maybe I shouldn't worry too much.

618
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:03,354
She's not an ordinary woman.

619
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:04,980
Let's see.

620
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,776
THE POLICE CONCLUDED

621
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,693
What?

622
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:13,822
Is she... What is this?

623
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,115
THAT SHE IS LIKELY AN ACCOMPLICE

624
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,829
Oh no, Yeon-joo.

625
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,374
Yeon-joo!

626
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,084
Yeon-joo!

627
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,127
Yeon-joo!

628
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,130
All that happened within 30 minutes.

629
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,261
You disappeared at 10 a.m.
and came back around 10:30 a.m.

630
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,720
In the cartoon,

631
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,723
you spent three days in the penthouse,
three days in the police station,

632
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:40,975
and one day in jail.

633
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,811
That means you spent a week there.

634
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,188
It doesn't make sense.

635
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,651
Su-bong, I'm tired to death.
The detectives didn't let me sleep.

636
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,656
I remember each and every day.

637
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,784
I'm so tired.
I must have spent a week there.

638
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,119
How...

639
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:01,954
How is that possible?

640
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:05,708
Prison is no place for a person to stay.

641
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,085
-I couldn't bear a day, so--
-So?

642
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,254
Is that why you told Chul everything?
To get out of there?

643
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,382
What have I done?

644
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,384
What should I do now?

645
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,512
-I don't know that.
-What do I do?

646
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:19,930
I don't know.

647
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,392
It'll probably be okay.

648
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:32,067
SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

649
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,369
FAITHFUL LAW, FAITHFUL CORRECTIONS

650
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,873
There has been an escape attempt.
We'll shut down the exit for a while.

651
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,420
Hey, what on earth are you talking about?

652
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,256
She just vanished.

653
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,175
She just suddenly disappeared.

654
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,969
-Are you kidding me?
-It's true.

655
00:43:59,053 --> 00:44:00,471
She vanished into thin air

656
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,222
while she was talking over there.

657
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,933
My goodness. What are you going to do now?

658
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,852
It's your fault!

659
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:08,646
Shit!

660
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,442
What happened?

661
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,570
How did she escape?

662
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,678
-Hello?
-We have a situation.

663
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,055
What situation?

664
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,725
-Yeon-joo--
-Don't talk to me about her.

665
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,728
I got fired because of her.

666
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:53,273
I'm not his personal assistant anymore,
so it has nothing...

667
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,237
What?

668
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:00,989
Why do you carry a fake business card?

669
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:04,201
Sir!

670
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,997
That woman Oh Yeon-joo escaped.

671
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,292
-What are you talking about?
-She escaped a little while ago.

672
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:13,877
Park Jeong-wu just called.

673
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,963
She escaped during Mr. Kang's visit.

674
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,968
-How could she possibly escape?
-I don't know the details.

675
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,678
They're going to announce it now.

676
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,888
We have breaking news.

677
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:28,183
The only suspect in the assault
on the president of JN Global,

678
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,852
Kang Chul, last May

679
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:33,480
has escaped from
Seoul Detention Center at around 2 p.m.

680
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:36,859
What's this? She broke out?

681
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,028
Mr. Kang wouldn't have helped her, right?

682
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,072
That'll be a big problem.

683
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,202
Details of the incident
haven't been identified,

684
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,664
but it appears that Oh escaped
from the visiting room,

685
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:56,170
where the victim, Kang, was visiting her
after returning from abroad.

686
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,924
The police are blocking the roads
and searching around the detention center.

687
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,219
-Oh was wearing...
-How is that possible?

688
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,513
How can a woman
escape from prison by herself?

689
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,558
They said Chul was visiting her.

690
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,059
Pardon?

691
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,604
Don't you understand what that means?

692
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:19,151
It means I finally have an opportunity
to lock up that punk Chul.

693
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,029
That psychopathic murderer.

694
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,073
Dad!

695
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,332
He hasn't come back yet.

696
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,461
He must be knocked out drunk somewhere.

697
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,838
I've seen it many times.

698
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:43,842
Yeon-joo.

699
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,094
Let's just end it.

700
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,555
-What?
-Let's write

701
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,641
"The end" at the end of the chapter
and put it up again.

702
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,226
It will be the end of W.

703
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,311
That way, you won't
get dragged inside again.

704
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:58,649
You're a fugitive over there.

705
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,984
If you go back in,
you'll get shot by the police

706
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,071
or spend your life in jail
until you're an old lady.

707
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,156
What are you going to do then?

708
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,036
If we end it,

709
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,163
what happens to Chul?

710
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,832
What will happen to him?

711
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,380
You should worry about yourself, not Chul.

712
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,132
How can you worry about
a cartoon character

713
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,176
when we might end up in an asylum?

714
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,807
Anyhow, the editor
will make a fuss about this.

715
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,226
Let's pretend Mr. Oh
changed it and sent it.

716
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:35,936
I don't think I can explain it to them.

717
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:38,313
We'll end it,

718
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:41,191
and Mr. Oh will take care of the rest.

719
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,570
This is the best option we have.

720
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,991
ORIGINALITY, SINCERITY, AND SERVICE

721
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:49,950
Yes.

722
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:52,619
We have to stay here
until things settle down.

723
00:47:52,703 --> 00:47:54,413
Shut down gates 3 and 4.

724
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,165
He's not talking.

725
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,377
This world...

726
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,754
is inside a cartoon.

727
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,174
Your change of emotions is what counts.

728
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,387
What kind of rule is that?
Why are my emotions important?

729
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,722
Because you're the main character!

730
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,184
So you're not sure
how I'm going to die this time.

731
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,813
When I'm here, I don't know things either.

732
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,523
So I can't help you.

733
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:24,151
You know when you're there?

734
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,195
Yes.

735
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,575
It might take some time.

736
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,118
Yes.

737
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,706
I am one of those people

738
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,459
who want your life to have a happy ending.

739
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,634
-Keep searching.
-Yes, sir.

740
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:50,802
Search thoroughly. Move faster.

741
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,179
He wants to talk to you.

742
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,477
Chul. What's the matter?

743
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,690
-Who is it?
-Mr. Son.

744
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,407
-Hello, Mr. Son.
-What happened?

745
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,743
I heard she vanished
while you were with her.

746
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:16,870
Yes.

747
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,456
Was it just like you told me that day?

748
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,416
If it was,

749
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,503
she didn't escape,
but went to a different dimension.

750
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,756
I think so.

751
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:30,342
How is that...

752
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,177
How is that possible?

753
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,638
This is a huge incident.

754
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:37,974
You know Han Cheol-ho
is just waiting for his chance.

755
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,143
He'll definitely attack now.

756
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,770
I'm quite sure

757
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:45,649
he'll argue that you staged your attack.

758
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,150
I'm sure he will.

759
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,112
But Han Cheol-ho isn't the problem.

760
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,363
What?

761
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:54,866
He's not important at all.

762
00:49:56,785 --> 00:50:00,372
The reason for my existence
is what's important.

763
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,501
Did you hear something from Oh Yeon-joo?

764
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,089
I did.

765
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,091
What did she say?

766
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,636
Something completely crazy.

767
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,643
My first impression of her was right.

768
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,603
She's a wack job. She's crazy.

769
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,985
She said something...

770
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:32,738
completely crazy.

771
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:35,365
Why do you care about her nonsense, then?

772
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,369
After hearing what Yeon-joo said,

773
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:43,957
everything that has happened to me that
I couldn't understand makes sense now.

774
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,543
What?

775
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,087
All the incidents that had no context

776
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,006
suddenly has context now.

777
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,219
It's a context that explains everything.

778
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,182
And what context is that?

779
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:08,899
It's something...

780
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,486
I've never even imagined.

781
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,738
So what is the context?

782
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,410
This world...

783
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,708
This world...

784
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,796
is all fake.

785
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,717
Everything is fabricated.

786
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,370
Do-yoon.

787
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,546
Do-yoon.

788
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,809
TO BE CONTINUED

789
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:36,528
"The end. Due to personal reasons,
I'll end the story here.

790
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,655
Thank you for your support."
That should be good, right?

791
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,453
The fans will be angry,
but what choice do we have?

792
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,141
What? What happened?

793
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,810
What? What's going on?

794
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:11,229
What's going on?

795
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,316
Goodness, what's going on here?

796
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,235
What's going on?

797
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:23,760
SON HYEON-SEOK

798
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,536
When the main character realized
it was fiction,

799
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,871
everything...

800
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,582
in the cartoon world stopped.

801
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:03,174
Only Chul survived in the world
where time had stopped.

802
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,302
As if...

803
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,681
it was punishing...

804
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:12,475
the one who became aware.

805
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,896
What's going on here?

806
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:19,357
What the heck? Shoot.

807
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,111
What's going on?

808
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,197
Gosh, what's wrong with this?

809
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,991
Why is nothing working?

810
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,869
This is strange.

811
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,128
Something must have happened to Chul.

812
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,423
-What do you mean?
-Something bad

813
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:47,177
must have happened to him because of me.

814
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,387
Oh, no.

815
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,910
Someone claiming to be your fiancé
came to see you.

816
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,622
Did I get pulled in again?

817
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,956
I came here.

818
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,918
I came out into your world

819
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,587
because I wanted to say goodbye.

820
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,049
You're just an illusion. You're nothing.

821
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,967
You're just a character I created.

822
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,470
Do you have any idea what I went through?

823
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,640
That's how fiction is.
It's my job as an author.

824
01:00:45,016 --> 01:00:47,560
I still remember every painful moment.

825
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,483
This is the most logical ending
for the main character

826
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,569
who became a murderer
while searching for a murderer.

827
