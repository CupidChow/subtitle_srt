1
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:47,213
Chul kills the real killer
who shot Yeon-joo.

2
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,761
But she ends up dying.

3
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:57,432
Let go!

4
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,768
I shot Yeon-joo.

5
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,687
Your drawing can bring her back.

6
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,774
Just before Yeon-joo dies,

7
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,568
Chul sends her to the world of W.

8
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,486
TO BE CONTINUED

9
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,073
Using the tablet
in Han Cheol-ho's possession,

10
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,742
Chul tries to save Yeon-joo
who became a webtoon character.

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,912
I summon Han Cheol-ho into the real world.

12
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,246
Hey!

13
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
He summons Cheol-ho into the real world,

14
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,627
gets the tablet back, and saves Yeon-joo.

15
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,379
But as the final chapter of W begins,

16
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,673
the three of them are summoned
into the world of W.

17
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,431
You were definitely not there.

18
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,643
But you suddenly appeared,
collapsed on the floor.

19
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,561
I don't understand what happened.

20
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,899
And Chul...

21
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,734
ran away.

22
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,947
-What?
-I can't understand them either.

23
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,865
They said he just disappeared.

24
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,290
Hey, hold on.

25
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:05,667
Goodness.

26
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,131
Shouldn't we call an ambulance?
Tell the boss.

27
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,465
Okay.

28
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,971
Goodness.

29
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,099
-Taxi.
-What?

30
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,019
Please get me a taxi.

31
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,230
I need to go to a hotel.

32
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,858
You should go to the hospital first.

33
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,411
Boss, he doesn't want an ambulance.
What should we do?

34
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,871
Should we call the police?

35
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,588
What?

36
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,008
Where is he?

37
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,979
Taxi.

38
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,565
Is the taxi here?

39
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:29,751
FINAL CHAPTER

40
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,636
Look who's here!

41
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,558
I thought I'd never see you again.

42
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,159
W BY OH SEONG-MOO,
CHAPTER 398

43
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,917
Yeon-joo.

44
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,063
-Where are you going?
-The Miracle Hotel.

45
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,189
Get in.

46
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,675
FINAL CHAPTER

47
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:11,769
FINAL CHAPTER

48
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,402
May I help you?

49
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,906
What's today's date?

50
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,325
It's August 15th.

51
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,617
August?

52
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,828
It used to be September.

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,954
Sorry?

54
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,875
No way.

55
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,253
Is it 2017?

56
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,838
Yes.

57
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:10,620
Excuse me.

58
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,082
-You are Yoon So-hee.
-Yes.

59
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,376
-Who are you?
-Can we talk for a minute?

60
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,588
-You go ahead.
-Okay, see you.

61
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,925
You look familiar.

62
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,468
Who are you?

63
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,679
My name is Oh Yeon-joo.

64
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:32,058
Aren't you the person
Chul was with when he fled?

65
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,187
I'll contact Chul's office.

66
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,899
They were looking for you,
so they will probably help you.

67
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,860
I don't work there anymore.

68
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,447
-Why not?
-I quit last year.

69
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,368
Just a minute. The number changed.

70
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:52,870
What is...

71
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,873
Mr. Kang doing right now?

72
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,709
You haven't heard?

73
00:07:00,878 --> 00:07:03,798
I was out of the country the past year.

74
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,968
The police caught him last September.

75
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,688
Hello, boss.

76
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,448
He looked like he'd really die soon,
so I left him alone.

77
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:30,908
Leave him in front of a hospital.

78
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,410
We're releasing him?

79
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,997
If he still won't talk after this,
he really has nothing to tell.

80
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,000
For my benefit, we need to prove
that his suicide note was fake.

81
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,139
Crazy bastard.

82
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,869
Come here.

83
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,333
He was dumped at a hospital
and got arrested right away.

84
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,880
It was discovered that he faked his death.

85
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,716
Ever since then,
he's been at a detention center.

86
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,887
He's been in jail for a year?

87
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,472
Since it was murder.

88
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,393
Murder, fleeing, fabricating evidence,
and forging official documents.

89
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,108
COURTHOUSE

90
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,410
The decision for his appeal
comes out tomorrow.

91
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,496
It will be at Seoul High Court.

92
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,750
You can go there tomorrow
if you want to see him.

93
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,671
Aren't you going, Ms. Yoon?

94
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,341
I'm on my way to the airport now.
I'm going to the US on business.

95
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,267
I sincerely hope
everything will turn out well.

96
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,145
Please say hi to him for me.

97
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,409
COURTHOUSE

98
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,625
In the initial trial held in March,
he received the death sentence.

99
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,836
His appeal will be decided today.

100
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,550
I will summarize the facts.

101
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,304
Before committing the crime,
the defendant looked for ways

102
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,306
to kill the victim and flee.

103
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,266
After the crime,

104
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,810
he took the victim's phone as planned,

105
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,645
threatened the police with a gun,

106
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,315
and fled the scene in his own car.

107
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,900
The majority of things he bought
during the flight

108
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,028
-was for his survival.
-Yeon-joo!

109
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:02,328
Defendant.

110
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,121
Are you listening?

111
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:12,588
The brutality and cruelness
of the crimes you have committed

112
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,049
-are against social...
-What happened?

113
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,801
Were you alive all this time?

114
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,763
You suddenly opened your eyes
and disappeared back then.

115
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,723
I was so shocked.

116
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:30,731
It is a crime against humanity.

117
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,985
His relationship with the victim,

118
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,071
his motive, the means,
the result of the crime,

119
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,323
the circumstances after the crime,

120
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,159
and everything else on the report show

121
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,078
that the original verdict

122
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,748
to sentence Kang Chul to death
is not unjust.

123
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,501
The lower court's decision
is thus confirmed.

124
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,682
You can't go in.

125
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,687
I'm sorry. Please give us a moment.

126
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,409
What took you so long?

127
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,996
I came right away, but a year had passed.

128
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:29,707
You came right away?

129
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,169
I came as soon as I woke up.

130
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,382
That's unfair.

131
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,343
I've been worried sick by myself
for a year.

132
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,473
"Why won't she come?
Do-yoon said he saw her open her eyes.

133
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,517
Did she change her mind
and start seeing someone else?"

134
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,020
I kept thinking things like that.

135
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,776
"Did she see the webtoon
and decide not to come

136
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,570
because I'm on death row?"

137
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,532
You married a millionaire
but he became penniless

138
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,451
and is now even on death row.

139
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,954
That's understandable, actually.

140
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,252
How can you joke right now?

141
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,592
You need to go.

142
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,429
Just a moment, please.
I haven't seen my wife for over a year.

143
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:26,680
Just a moment more.

144
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,395
Why didn't you go out into the real world?

145
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,356
I couldn't.

146
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,196
I am...

147
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,908
going back.

148
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,205
I am...

149
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,791
going back.

150
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,546
I tried to go back for the whole year,

151
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,508
but I couldn't. I can't get out of here.

152
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,927
Why all of a sudden?

153
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,930
Maybe because this is the final chapter.

154
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,017
You need to go now.

155
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,235
Did you know?

156
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,655
This is the final chapter of W.

157
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,547
You should come with me.

158
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,340
The trials aren't over yet.

159
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,594
We need to be strong
and prepare for the next one.

160
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,275
He said

161
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,611
that was when...

162
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,989
he had this thought.

163
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,371
He was so tired,

164
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,833
that he just wanted W to end.

165
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,835
He thought

166
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,047
he wanted to quit
being this webtoon's main character.

167
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,507
And that's when...

168
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,261
FINAL CHAPTER

169
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,765
...the final chapter really begun.

170
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,690
We can't get out of here

171
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,028
until this final chapter ends.

172
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,909
We'll only be free

173
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,036
once it ends.

174
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,747
Whether it's a happy ending

175
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,832
or a sad ending.

176
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,002
Let's go to the penthouse.

177
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,630
Chul said you'd be back
and told me to keep it for you.

178
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:50,342
Are you telling me to stay alone
in that big place? No way.

179
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,844
All I need is just a room.

180
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,512
That makes it hard for us to guard you.

181
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,847
Just come with me.

182
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,391
Hello?

183
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,685
We're on our way now.

184
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,062
What?

185
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,523
Chul did what?

186
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,407
Gosh, Su-min. You're a great artist.

187
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,992
Su-min, who is this?

188
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,120
-It's you.
-Oh, my. Is this me?

189
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,956
You made me so handsome.

190
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,375
Gosh, Su-min. You're adorable.

191
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,630
Am I really this handsome?

192
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,924
Congressman Han, please look here.

193
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,762
After winning Changmin Party's
candidacy for president,

194
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,306
Han Cheol-ho kicked off his campaign

195
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:44,646
by visiting a kindergarten
and spending time with the children today.

196
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:48,567
The trust that he gained
from the public is expected

197
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,404
to positively affect the election for him.

198
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,864
How beautiful.

199
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:00,829
Kids these days are so tiresome.

200
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,415
Don't their parents discipline them
at home?

201
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,883
How did it go?
Did he get the death penalty?

202
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,303
What? He escaped?

203
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,723
How could he run away?

204
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,725
He removed the handcuffs and had a gun.

205
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,436
Just how did he remove the handcuffs?
That punk.

206
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,316
I'm not even surprised anymore,
with all the crap he's been pulling.

207
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,528
We should go back to the courthouse.

208
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,738
Please drop me off somewhere.

209
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,538
Going with you may be more dangerous.

210
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,374
If he calls you, tell him that I'm here.

211
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,292
Let me ask you one thing.

212
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,087
Chul told me,

213
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,673
but I couldn't believe it.

214
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,343
He says there is another world
just like this one,

215
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,179
and that you are from that world.

216
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,974
Is that true?

217
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,521
Yes.

218
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,234
I see.

219
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:41,388
He removed the handcuffs himself
and ran away holding a gun.

220
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,682
He didn't take it from the officers.

221
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,061
By the way, sir,
you know Oh Yeon-joo, right?

222
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,521
She showed up.

223
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:57,362
Chul's wife who died in the penthouse.
Remember? We confirmed she was dead.

224
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,531
I'm sure of it.

225
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,242
But she's with Chul's friend right now.

226
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,997
Chul disappeared,

227
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,417
and Yeon-joo showed up alive and well.

228
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:15,464
Does that mean Chul has the tablet now?

229
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:16,965
SODIUM PENTOTHAL

230
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,736
Now you know how
to be the heroine of a thriller.

231
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,447
What took you so long?
I thought you got caught.

232
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,909
-I had to meet someone.
-What's wrong with you?

233
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,369
Why did you run away?

234
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,330
How can it be a happy ending
if you keep committing crimes?

235
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,915
How many criminal records do you have now?

236
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,669
The happy ending we planned
already failed when I got caught,

237
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:39,131
which makes us unable to punish
Han Cheol-ho by the law.

238
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,174
So what do we do now?

239
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,886
We should plan another happy ending.

240
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,436
Wait.

241
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,482
Let me see your face.

242
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,986
What?

243
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,113
It's not the face I remember.

244
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:04,990
Excuse me?

245
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,201
Maybe I forgot because it's been so long.

246
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,414
You were very beautiful
in my imagination when I was in prison.

247
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,126
I was wrong. You're just a little pretty.

248
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,670
You...

249
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,382
have aged a bit.

250
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,596
You look old now
after aging a year by yourself.

251
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:30,223
I'm serious.

252
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,395
That hurts.

253
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:37,606
Then I'm older than you.

254
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,816
You're older?

255
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,777
I'm a year older than you now,

256
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,278
so show me respect.

257
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,114
-Whatever.
-"Whatever"?

258
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,575
You're very rude.

259
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,871
What happened to you in that year?

260
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,830
What?

261
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:59,544
Dad drew the gun and handcuffs, didn't he?

262
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,173
That's right.
He also drew this car and my clothes.

263
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:07,552
What is he thinking?

264
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:10,347
Why did he want you to run away?

265
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,767
Let's go to see your father.

266
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,439
-What?
-He also got dragged in here a year ago.

267
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,332
39-5 JINMYEOK-RI, GWANGCHON-EUP,
PAJU, GYEONGGI-DO

268
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:56,059
KIM JONG-SU

269
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,120
Hello?

270
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,250
Sir?

271
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:03,960
Mr. Oh?

272
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,676
You came.

273
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,349
What happened?

274
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,726
Why are you here?

275
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,645
How long have you been here?

276
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,189
A year.

277
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,235
It's been a year
since I got dragged into the webtoon.

278
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,574
Who tied you up?

279
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,868
I did.

280
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,204
I tied myself up.

281
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:43,625
Why?

282
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,877
I didn't...

283
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,172
see Yeon-joo.

284
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,551
I couldn't even check...

285
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,972
whether or not Yeon-joo was alive
before coming here.

286
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,307
She's alive.

287
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,938
She's alive. I was with her just now.

288
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,691
She's alive?

289
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,484
Is she really alive?

290
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,153
She is. She's healthy.

291
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,115
I didn't come with her as a precaution.

292
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:18,785
She's alive?

293
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,539
I thought she died.

294
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,042
I didn't know.

295
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,004
For the past year...

296
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,509
What happened to you?

297
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:38,388
Why didn't you call?
You should've called my company.

298
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,558
Why is that tablet here?

299
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,518
I was locked up.

300
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,068
Where to, sir?

301
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,031
Seoul Prime Hotel, please.

302
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,449
Okay.

303
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,847
You know, you look a lot like him.

304
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,768
No offense, but you look like
Han Sang-hun.

305
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,812
You know, the criminal who died?

306
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,454
My goodness.

307
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,374
Help!

308
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,125
Help!

309
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:54,005
-What happened?
-That man tried to kill me.

310
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,757
He suddenly strangled me.

311
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:06,351
Your name and a contact, please.

312
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,315
-I'm Oh Seong-moo.
-Oh Seong-moo.

313
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,691
A contact we can call?

314
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,612
-Kang Chul.
-Did you say Kang Chul?

315
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,572
Please let me call him.

316
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,657
Are you talking about

317
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,450
Kang Chul, the CEO who died?

318
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:26,830
Is he dead here?

319
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:29,958
Sir, don't you have a family?

320
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,892
-What?
-Give it to me, you punk.

321
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,270
You don't even know how to shoot.
Let me shoot that.

322
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,856
-Grab him.
-Give it to me.

323
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,816
Hey! Get off me.

324
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,277
Get off me, you bastards!
I'll kill you all!

325
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,695
Do you know who I am?

326
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,364
I'm Han Sang-hun, you bastards!

327
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,658
Let go of me!

328
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,827
Get off me! Let me go!

329
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,328
They sent me...

330
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,288
You bastards!

331
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:11,207
...to a mental hospital
as I have no family here.

332
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,672
Do you know what happened
to my dear Yeon-joo?

333
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,720
I killed my Yeon-joo.

334
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,141
Please save her.

335
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,935
I'm sure she's alive. Don't worry.

336
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,396
She's alive?

337
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,106
Of course, she is.

338
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,275
-Why is she alive?
-What are you doing?

339
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,860
I killed her. Why is she alive?

340
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,154
-I put a hole in her head.
-Is anybody out there? Help!

341
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,491
-My purpose is to kill her.
-Let me go! Help me!

342
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,204
Oh Yeon-joo! I'll kill you.

343
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,747
I'll kill you.

344
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,917
I'll kill you, Oh Yeon-joo.

345
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,585
I'll kill you.

346
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,257
Untie me!

347
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:05,720
Hey! Untie me, you bastards!

348
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,307
Can't you hear me? Untie me!

349
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,446
Yeon-joo.

350
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,994
Yeon-joo.

351
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:35,708
The killer died, so he got his body back,

352
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,752
but the killer's memories remained.

353
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,296
And it became worse here.

354
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,050
He can't bear it because
he remembers things from both worlds.

355
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:47,887
He's in a terrible shape.

356
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,058
I'm telling you this
because I'm afraid you'll be shocked.

357
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,983
What happened?

358
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,862
-Wake up! Are you okay?
-Where did the patient go?

359
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,531
He escaped from the mental hospital
this morning.

360
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,452
He went to find the tablet.

361
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,840
Mr. Oh, I will go look for Chul.

362
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,009
Okay.

363
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,720
What are you drawing?

364
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,015
I can't help feeling anxious.

365
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:33,892
Okay.

366
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,769
Since it was a replica, he was worried

367
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,606
that it might be a single-use
or that it will disappear.

368
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,483
So he drew one more
and hid it in the webtoon.

369
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,110
Just like the killer had done.

370
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,661
It took a year to come and get that.

371
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:33,493
When he got out, he saw the news
about it being the day of my trial

372
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,203
and removed the handcuffs.

373
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,289
Where...

374
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:40,541
is he now?

375
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,467
He's in his hideout.

376
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,435
In one of the previous chapters,
he drew his workshop

377
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,562
as a vacant hideout.

378
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:19,580
Dad.

379
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,836
Dad.

380
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,300
Dad.

381
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,511
Dad!

382
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,102
Why did you tie him?

383
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,981
He asked me to tie him.

384
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,859
He said he couldn't control himself.

385
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,115
Dad.

386
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:57,785
Dad.

387
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,665
Dad.

388
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:04,375
Who is it?

389
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,172
Yeon-joo, is that you?

390
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,549
It's me, Dad.

391
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,470
You were alive?

392
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,138
I am alive.

393
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,807
You were alive?

394
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,561
I am alive, Dad. I'm fine.

395
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,022
What happened to you?

396
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,318
What do we do about this?

397
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,427
How can you say that?

398
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,639
I can't do it.

399
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,642
Do as I say.

400
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:04,727
I can't.

401
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,399
Please do as I say.

402
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,530
That can never happen.

403
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,615
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

404
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,619
How is he?

405
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,166
He seems better.

406
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,212
I made some porridge. Can you eat, Dad?

407
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,263
He fell asleep.

408
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,098
Have a seat. I'll make dinner.

409
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,307
Dinner?

410
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,935
We should eat. We didn't even have lunch.

411
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,694
Let's eat.

412
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,495
This is surprising.

413
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,374
-What is?
-I've never had your cooking before.

414
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:09,584
It's not bad.

415
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,961
-Really?
-Yes.

416
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,298
Considering that you are a busy doctor,
this is really good.

417
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,217
You don't mean it, do you?

418
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,261
You're just trying to make me feel better.

419
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,305
It's half and half.

420
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:23,931
Gosh.

421
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,268
-Do more.
-Do what?

422
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,228
Either compliment me or comfort me.

423
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,856
It's nice to hear it
from a picky person like you.

424
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,193
Okay, a compliment.

425
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,035
Is there nothing to compliment me on?

426
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,745
I'm thinking.

427
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,041
Your hair is long.

428
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,168
Your skin is fair.

429
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,420
Are those compliments?

430
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,631
You are pretty tall.

431
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,883
Is your nose bridge high?

432
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,844
Those are not compliments.
You're describing facts.

433
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,056
Your ears are at the right place.

434
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,894
Gosh, this is no easy task.

435
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,978
Gosh.

436
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:16,234
So be polite to me,
then I will praise you.

437
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,236
Are you that proud
that you're a year older?

438
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,154
Yes, I'm very proud of myself.

439
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,697
Why do I feel so proud?

440
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:25,243
I am 31 years old, Yeon-joo.
You are only 30.

441
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,410
Got that, kid?

442
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,748
It's nice to see you smile.

443
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,209
It's been a year. Please smile more often.

444
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,132
What did you talk about with Dad earlier?

445
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,428
I mean, when I was cooking.

446
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,515
No comment.

447
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,517
You won't tell me?

448
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,602
I'll do the dishes after we eat.

449
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,144
Anyhow,

450
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,105
you and I...

451
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,234
can't go together.

452
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,737
What?

453
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,406
If you have a happy ending,

454
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,118
I will have a sad ending.

455
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,664
And if mine is happy, yours will be sad.

456
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,628
Look at my hand.

457
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,673
It looks fine, doesn't it?

458
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,926
Do you know why it looks so fine?

459
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,765
I killed a person...

460
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,852
this morning.

461
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,952
I killed a nurse and escaped.

462
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,500
That's why it looks okay.

463
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:39,460
Do you get it now?

464
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:42,671
Now,

465
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,717
I can't go back to who I was before.

466
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:51,222
I cease to exist
when I stop doing bad things.

467
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,103
Even if I go back,

468
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,526
I can't live.

469
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,241
I am too sinful.

470
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,039
I've killed dozens of people
with these hands.

471
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,213
Even when I didn't remember any of it,

472
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,760
I still killed her with my own hands

473
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,720
this morning.

474
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,351
I won't

475
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,395
leave this world.

476
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,564
I can't get out.

477
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,026
How can I...

478
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,614
live the rest of my life...

479
00:40:52,324 --> 00:40:54,326
looking at Yeon-joo's face?

480
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,626
My life is already over.

481
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,670
It ended a year ago.

482
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,021
Before it ends with a happy ending,

483
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:26,692
please let me die here.

484
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,153
I beg you.

485
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,656
Please...

486
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,994
bury me in the webtoon.

487
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,833
How could you say that?

488
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,711
I can't do it.

489
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,714
Do as I say.

490
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,966
I can't.

491
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,639
Please do as I say.

492
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:19,995
Hello, sir.

493
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,765
Where's Chul?

494
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:44,270
He must really not know.
He isn't reacting to the drugs.

495
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:45,396
Where's Yeon-joo?

496
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,774
His phone.

497
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,364
How do you contact Chul?

498
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:15,259
Kang Chul, don't we still have
things to talk about?

499
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,970
Call Seo Do-yoon. Right away.

500
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,270
-Are you going somewhere?
-I need to make a phone call.

501
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:29,189
It's dangerous if they locate my phone.
Keep the door locked.

502
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,879
-Hello?
-Do-yoon?

503
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:52,963
Where are you?

504
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,008
Hello?

505
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,552
It's been a long time.

506
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,557
What are you doing?

507
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,601
Aren't you a presidential candidate?

508
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,812
A gangster who's holding an innocent
citizen captive wants to be president?

509
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,482
Is Korea mad or something?

510
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,818
It's true that Korea is mad.

511
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,280
A death-row convict was able to
escape easily from the courthouse.

512
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,910
So I got myself a hostage
in order to live.

513
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,995
I was afraid you might
inject something into my neck.

514
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,582
It's obvious that
you're going to take revenge on me.

515
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,001
I had to live, but there was no way.

516
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:33,170
Hey, Kang Chul.

517
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,464
Don't do anything stupid.

518
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:39,051
If you do something to me,
your friend will die immediately.

519
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,094
Shit!

520
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,639
I shouldn't have given you
to the police a year ago.

521
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,517
I let you live because I thought
you really didn't have it,

522
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,686
but you've been keeping it hidden?

523
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,105
Come here.

524
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,440
You remember where we last met, right?

525
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:55,776
We still have things to talk about.

526
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:58,320
You didn't give me answers last time.

527
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,697
We have to start talking again.

528
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,493
About Yeon-joo, you, and Han Sang-hun.

529
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,620
No.

530
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:08,497
Was his name Oh Seong-moo?

531
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:11,667
And that thing.

532
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,211
I have so many questions.

533
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:22,469
Meet me at 11 p.m. You have an hour.
Bring the tablet, too.

534
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,475
If you are late by even a minute,
you know what happens.

535
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,696
Have you seen a person like this?

536
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,616
He's in his 60s and was last seen
walking around in hospital gown.

537
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,285
You haven't seen him?

538
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,287
He killed a person and escaped
from a mental hospital.

539
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,997
A nearby CCTV caught him.

540
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,458
-He murdered someone?
-Yes.

541
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,127
He's dangerous, so make sure
to call us if you spot him.

542
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,086
Okay.

543
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,115
What are you doing?

544
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,160
You're up.

545
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,245
What are you doing?

546
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,749
I'm going to draw a little
before he comes back.

547
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:36,835
What are you drawing?

548
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,505
I want to get out of here soon.

549
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,508
This is hell, Dad.

550
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,511
I have to try everything
to get us out of here.

551
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:51,600
There was a scene before
where Cheol-ho was torturing Chul.

552
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,310
All right.

553
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,522
This is payback for being
such an annoyance in the past ten years.

554
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,571
I'll draw a CCTV screen
on top of that scene.

555
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,908
I think things will be easier
if we give the video to the police.

556
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,577
We have to put Cheol-ho behind bars first

557
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,829
for us to have a happy ending.

558
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,083
Why are you still alive?

559
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:01,920
Why are you still alive?
I definitely shot you.

560
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,841
Die!

561
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,259
Dad!

562
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:11,013
Mr. Oh!

563
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:18,103
Mr. Oh!

564
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,358
Are you all right?

565
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,004
What did I do?

566
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,969
You didn't do anything.

567
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,765
What happened to your neck?

568
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,686
What did I do to you?

569
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,691
It's nothing.

570
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,657
I told you.

571
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,035
I'm a monster.

572
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,165
Please do as I say.

573
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,875
Please.

574
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,972
Dad, your hands...

575
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,326
What's wrong?

576
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,038
What's wrong with your hand?

577
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,041
You said you were okay
when you were in jail.

578
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,336
I escaped without paying for my sin,

579
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,255
and now I'm just letting my friend die.

580
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,882
Who is dying?

581
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,218
Cheol-ho took Do-yoon.

582
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,764
He's threatening me
to bring him the tablet.

583
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,683
I only have about 40 minutes left.

584
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:25,981
Also...

585
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:31,069
your father...

586
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,198
killed someone.

587
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:38,952
What did you say?

588
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,954
The police are on their way here.

589
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,124
They will find this house soon.

590
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,379
Have you seen this person?

591
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:55,594
Him? I saw him this morning
in a hospital gown.

592
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,887
Where did he go?

593
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,055
He went into that house.

594
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,477
I was drawing Han Cheol-ho's video.
Let's give it to the police first.

595
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,312
We can circulate it via e-mail.

596
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,357
Let's report
where they're keeping Do-yoon as well.

597
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,234
They can catch Cheol-ho there.

598
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,194
Not now.

599
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,487
Why not?

600
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,531
With a happy ending like that,

601
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,201
your father will cease to exist.

602
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:24,831
My happy ending
is a sad ending for the killer.

603
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:29,377
The problem is that
whatever ending we might have,

604
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,962
either your father or I

605
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,965
won't be by your side.

606
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,010
We'll either die...

607
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,304
or disappear.

608
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,606
Requesting assistance.

609
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,399
The suspect is with someone.

610
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,863
Please confirm the vehicle.
The vehicle number is 28M4740.

611
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,240
Once again, 28M4740.

612
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,534
Go on.

613
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,706
Keep talking.

614
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,834
There are two different worlds?

615
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,505
You said another world exists,

616
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,507
and that Yeon-joo is from that world.

617
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,343
That's what I heard.

618
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,807
So the place where I saw Oh Seong-moo...

619
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,560
Shit.

620
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,936
It's the tablet, isn't it?

621
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:30,897
So that was the other world.

622
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,608
I see.

623
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:38,905
All right, now I understand a little.

624
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,741
I couldn't understand at all before.

625
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:50,375
So? What's the difference
between this world and that world?

626
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:05,724
Fill me in.

627
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:09,811
This car has the same license plate
as the car Kang Chul fled in.

628
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:11,479
I think they're in there together.

629
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:14,733
What does he have to do with
a lunatic murderer?

630
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,359
We don't know that yet.

631
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,738
We're waiting for backup
since he might have a weapon.

632
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:53,688
Did I get it all?

633
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,033
Can we talk?

634
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,461
What is this?

635
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:18,380
There's no door.

636
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,131
There are no windows either.

637
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,591
Shit.

638
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,097
What now?

639
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,015
We can't hold out for long.

640
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,101
They'll break the wall and come in.

641
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,895
We only have 30 minutes to save Do-yoon.

642
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,368
We need to make a decision

643
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,037
on what kind of ending it'll be.

644
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:53,957
How?

645
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,919
What ending should it be?

646
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,650
What are you doing?

647
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:23,987
What do you mean?

648
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,158
Why did you remove our rings?

649
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,870
What are you trying to do?

650
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,083
It's too cruel

651
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:41,379
for a father to have to kill his daughter
to avoid ceasing to exist.

652
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:43,590
That can't happen.

653
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,012
I'll remove you from my family.

654
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:51,556
You're free now.

655
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,434
You're safe no matter how this ends.

656
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,148
You need to make a choice now.

657
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,358
What kind of ending will it be?

658
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,907
I will follow your decision.

659
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,057
MYUNGSEI UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

660
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,811
Why are you telling me to do it?
Do it yourself.

661
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,399
I'm so tired. I have dark circles
covering my whole face.

662
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,986
I said I don't know.

663
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:50,323
Do whatever you want.

664
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,076
What was that about?

665
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,453
Gosh.

666
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,872
-That's right.
-What?

667
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,834
You're a fan of W, right?

668
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:04,129
That webtoon. I heard it ended.

669
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,506
-When?
-This morning.

670
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:07,507
Really?

671
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,716
-But...
-What?

672
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,717
the ending is--

673
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:12,470
Hey, no spoilers!
I'm going to read it myself.

674
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:13,930
-Don't say a word.
-I just--

675
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:15,306
Be quiet. Don't say it.

676
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,393
-No. That's--
-Hey.

677
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,812
I can't hear you. I can't hear anything.

678
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,022
You'll be surprised to see how it ends!

679
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:27,360
Gosh. That jerk tried to spoil the ending.

680
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,782
The final chapter.

681
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,162
All right.

682
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,707
I once hated it, but I should be
respectful for the finale.

683
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,756
W, let's go!

684
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:56,181
W BY OH SEONG-MOO

685
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,812
FINAL CHAPTER

686
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,029
FINAL CHAPTER

687
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:37,514
I need both you and my dad by my side.

688
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:39,265
I can't imagine anything else.

689
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,100
I love you.

690
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:46,314
I heard something strange
while waiting for you.

691
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,649
About two different worlds.

692
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,776
This ends only when you die.

693
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,739
We can all go back together.

694
00:58:57,325 --> 00:58:59,327
