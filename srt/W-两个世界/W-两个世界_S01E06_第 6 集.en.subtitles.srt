00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,914
With sales totaling ten million copies...

2
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,917
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

3
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,421
Author of the popular W, Oh Seong-moo,

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:54,262
is afraid of his cartoon's main character,
Kang Chul, who came to life.

5
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:56,181
Who are you?

6
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,687
So he tries to kill Kang Chul.

7
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,490
-Research some poisons.
-Chul drags Oh Seong-moo's daughter

8
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,116
Oh Yeon-joo

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,493
into the cartoon world...

10
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,536
-Are you okay?
-...and she ends up saving him.

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,164
-Why are my emotions important?
-Because you're the main character.

12
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,415
KANG CHUL, THE MAIN CHARACTER

13
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:27,295
Through Yeon-joo, Chul finds out that
he's the main character in a cartoon.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,048
WHO KILLED HIS FAMILY?

15
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,553
Chul comes out into reality,
Yeon-joo's world.

16
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,518
Mr. Oh Seong-moo?

17
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,479
He goes to the author Oh Seong-moo.

18
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,403
-There is no real killer.
-Are you serious right now?

19
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:55,156
-That's how fiction is.
-Think of a solution.

20
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,158
You are just an illusion.

21
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,078
You're nothing.
You're just a character I created.

22
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:04,082
Why are you continuing the story
by getting my daughter involved?

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,709
You're just a character.
Do you understand?

24
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,378
You're just something I created!

25
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,509
If you call an ambulance right away,

26
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,762
he might live if he's lucky.

27
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,024
Mr. Oh?

28
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,825
Miss!

29
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,881
POLICE

30
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,383
What did you do?

31
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,053
Miss! Stop!

32
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,305
I'm here at the scene.

33
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,307
There's been a shooting.

34
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:29,852
-Mr. Oh.
-The victim is injured badly.

35
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,150
-Dad!
-Mr. Oh.

36
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,031
Dad!

37
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,956
Dad!

38
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,509
Gosh. Look at this mess.

39
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,268
-Su-yeong, pick up the phone.
-Okay.

40
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,229
Yes, hello?

41
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,732
Yes, this is Yeon-joo's mom's phone.

42
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:18,234
What?

43
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,115
What? Okay, thank you.

44
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:27,952
Who was it?

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,790
It was a guy named Su-bong,
who works for Seong-moo.

46
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,126
Why would he call me?

47
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,462
He says Seong-moo
is in critical condition.

48
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,798
They're taking him to Yeon-joo's hospital.

49
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:42,633
Why?

50
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,761
He got shot.

51
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:51,225
We found him awake
with a gunshot wound in his chest.

52
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,395
His daughter is a doctor,
so we're moving him to her hospital.

53
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,982
Dad, we're almost there.
Please hang on just a little more.

54
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,570
You'll be fine. It's nothing serious.
Don't be afraid.

55
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,784
We can't get a pulse or BP.

56
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,577
The ECG shows ventricular fibrillation.

57
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,537
No. Massage his heart!

58
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,582
-How far is the hospital?
-We are two kilometers away.

59
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,293
Move!

60
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,590
Please.

61
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,051
Please.

62
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,637
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

63
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,849
Yeon-joo, what's going on?

64
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,310
Please move him to the trauma room. Hurry!

65
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,694
-What happened?
-Professor.

66
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,030
He has a gunshot wound.
He had been given him CPR.

67
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:49,117
The chest X-ray shows
massive hemothorax on the left side.

68
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,328
I inserted a chest tube.
He lost more than a liter of blood,

69
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,913
and the bleeding isn't stopping.

70
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,290
I gave him a lot of fluid,
so his pulse and BP returned,

71
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,667
but the echo showed that

72
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,920
the bullet got lodged onto
the left ventricle apex.

73
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,380
Book an operating room

74
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,799
and get the cardiothoracic
surgery team ready.

75
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:05,883
Send him up now.

76
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,552
Move it!

77
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,068
Yeon-joo, leave the room.

78
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,404
I'm staying.

79
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:30,199
You'll only put massive pressure on me.
Don't you trust me?

80
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,370
-Watch his vitals carefully.
-Okay.

81
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,746
We'll perform a sternotomy first,

82
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,499
and we will do a repair
after checking the wound.

83
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,793
If we can't, we'll start pumping
blood to the heart.

84
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,045
Let's begin. Scalpel.

85
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,138
You're still here.

86
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,303
MAIN OPERATING ROOM

87
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,445
Chul was there.

88
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,495
I saw him. It was definitely Chul.

89
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,164
He was holding a gun.

90
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,416
Where did he go?

91
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,461
I don't know.

92
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,964
It was too hectic.

93
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,802
The police asked if I saw the shooter,
but I couldn't say.

94
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,470
I didn't know what to say.

95
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,474
So that's why he was like that.

96
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,978
There was a reason
Mr. Oh wanted to kill Chul.

97
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,814
He knew from the start
that this would happen.

98
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,775
Why...

99
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,989
Why did you save Chul back then?
You should've let him die.

100
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,244
This happened
because you saved him that night.

101
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,373
He's just a cartoon character.

102
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,296
Yeon-joo!

103
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,008
Yeon-joo.

104
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,643
Fortunately, the bullet is still in here.

105
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,191
Get me the 3-0 prolene suture, please.

106
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:18,159
Visitation has ended.
If you're a patient, the ER is...

107
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,536
TO YEON-JOO

108
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:22,455
Please give this to her.

109
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,832
Who?

110
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,417
Dr. Oh Yeon-joo of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

111
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,752
Okay.

112
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,310
Good afternoon. We have breaking news.

113
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,146
Popular webtoon artist of W,

114
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:52,318
Oh Seong-moo, is currently in critical
condition after being shot last night.

115
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,237
After being shot by an unidentified man
at around 11 p.m.,

116
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,282
he was immediately brought to a hospital,
where he underwent an operation.

117
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,327
According to the police,
he has yet to regain consciousness.

118
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:04,455
Mr. Oh Seong-moo is a star cartoonist,

119
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,875
whose most famous work, W,
was first published in 2007.

120
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:13,798
Hey, shouldn't we call Mr. Oh's daughter?

121
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,966
We can't talk to her about that
at a time like this.

122
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,220
-He's fighting for his life.
-That's why we should tell her.

123
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,180
This can be an evidence.

124
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,683
This is too strange.

125
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,425
Are you okay? Are you not hurt?

126
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,677
He's a monster.

127
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,054
I didn't know it at first,

128
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,265
but I had created a monster.

129
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,144
So I decided to be the judge of him.

130
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,146
I never should've created him
in the first place.

131
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:14,525
How can I let him be?
I'm about to be eaten alive.

132
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,710
You should go get some rest.
I'll stay with him.

133
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,963
Where's my mom?

134
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,007
She just went home with her sister.

135
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,509
I've sent them off in a taxi.

136
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,345
Good.

137
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,431
Thank you.

138
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,183
Go and rest.

139
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,101
The on-call room is empty.

140
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:05,326
INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

141
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:10,080
-Hello?
-Yeon-joo, this is Mr. Park, the editor.

142
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:11,415
We met earlier at the hospital.

143
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,292
Oh, hello.

144
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,836
How is Mr. Oh?

145
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:20,966
He's still in critical condition,
but he didn't get worse.

146
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,426
I see.

147
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:28,307
Look, I'm not sure if I should talk
about this at a time like this,

148
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,850
but I need to check something.

149
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,102
What is it?

150
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,313
It's about W.

151
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:38,526
A new chapter came in,
and we were wondering who sent it.

152
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,445
I'm sure it wasn't Mr. Oh,

153
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,491
but it does look like his drawing.
So do you know who sent it?

154
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,577
Is there any chance
Mr. Oh finished it beforehand?

155
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:52,414
-The content seemed a little strange.
-When was it sent?

156
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,624
Early this morning.

157
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,459
We only saw it a while ago.

158
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,753
We haven't uploaded it online yet.

159
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:01,090
I thought we should check first.
This may cause an issue.

160
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,800
May I see it?

161
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,532
THE NEW CHAPTER OF W

162
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,911
DO YOU WANT TO OPEN THIS FILE?

163
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:35,749
OPEN

Dr. Oh.

171
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,048
What is it?

172
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:14,051
-Is Dad--
-No. It's not that.

173
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,804
It's this.

174
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,557
I should've given it to you earlier.
I didn't know you were in here.

175
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,684
Someone left it for you.

176
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,689
I'll just put this here.

177
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,608
Who...

178
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,819
is this from?

179
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,864
I'm not sure.
I wasn't there when it arrived.

180
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,537
TO YEON-JOO

181
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,919
TO YEON-JOO

182
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,715
TO YEON-JOO

183
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,360
THIS IS THE MOST LOGICAL ENDING
FOR THE MAIN CHARACTER

184
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,279
WHO BECAME A MURDERER
WHILE SEARCHING FOR A MURDERER

185
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:28,625
TO YEON-JOO

186
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,827
This is the most logical ending for
the main character

187
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,497
who became a murderer
while searching for a murderer.

188
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,597
LIFE IS SOMETIMES...

189
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,162
THE END

190
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,085
THE END

191
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,169
Hello. Someone please come here!

192
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,837
He opened his eyes!

193
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,299
Hey! He opened his eyes!

194
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,009
Nurse!

195
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,096
There are ten surveillance cameras
in the vicinity of the house,

196
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,849
but none of them recorded anything at all.

197
00:22:31,349 --> 00:22:33,727
He should've been caught on camera
if he went inside anywhere,

198
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,020
but there was nothing.

199
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,897
We haven't found the gun either.

200
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,825
What's very strange is that...

201
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,419
the bullet extracted
during surgery disappeared.

202
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:03,340
Someone must have stolen it.

203
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,843
Is there anyone you suspect
in the hospital?

204
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,931
I'm not sure.

205
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,391
This case is quite strange.

206
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,979
Since your father woke up,
it'll be revealed soon.

207
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,315
He's the most trustworthy witness.

208
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:26,363
Hello? Did you look into it?

209
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,082
Dad, can you hear me?

210
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,464
There's something you should know.

211
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,094
Kang Chul...

212
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,145
Kang Chul killed himself.

213
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,607
The scene where he shoots you
and then drowns in Han River,

214
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,027
including your conversation,
appeared in the cartoon.

215
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:09,739
The editors saw it already.

216
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,701
They'll report it to the police soon.

217
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:16,163
We should try to cover up
what happened together.

218
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,082
If we can't explain the cartoon's content,

219
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,751
the situation will get more complicated,

220
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,337
so Yeon-joo and I had a discussion.

221
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:35,390
The police concluded that the attack
on cartoonist Oh Seong-moo

222
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,894
was actually his attempted suicide.

223
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,647
While drawing the last chapter
of his cartoon that ran seven years,

224
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:45,942
Oh was suffering from
extreme stress and depression.

225
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,110
On the day of the incident,

226
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:50,488
intoxicated and unable to decide
on the ending,

227
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,449
he thus made an extreme decision.

228
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,701
The ending of Oh Seong-moo's
popular webtoon, W,

229
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,745
was revealed this morning.

230
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,205
The ending was unexpected

231
00:24:58,288 --> 00:25:00,207
and completely different
from what people hoped for.

232
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,668
-Many were shocked and angry.
-What is this?

233
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,129
It ends with the main character,
Kang Chul,

234
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:11,092
killing the artist who created him
and jumping into the Han River.

235
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,179
Many people posted complaints
and called to protest,

236
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,473
causing the site to crash temporarily.

237
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,184
Avid readers are extremely disappointed

238
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,062
and pressuring the artist
to change the ending.

239
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,148
They have started a petition
to bring Kang Chul back to life.

240
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,989
Dr. Park, could you sign here?

241
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,247
-Are you busy tonight?
-Yes.

242
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,083
Then let's go have a drink.

243
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:47,379
-Pardon?
-This webtoon is driving me nuts.

244
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,258
Let's go.

245
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,551
Okay.

246
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,568
I heard Mr. Oh was discharged
from the hospital.

247
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,322
He was back at home
because he hated hospitals.

248
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,366
He should still get treated
at the hospital.

249
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,702
I'm taking time off and staying with him.

250
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,245
I see.

251
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,498
-It must be difficult for you.
-It's all right.

252
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:08,335
It's fine since I haven't been
with him in a while anyway.

253
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,086
I see.

254
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,172
Did you hear?

255
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,592
People are still angry
even though it's been a month.

256
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,344
They want Kang Chul revived.

257
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,889
Did you hear about the petition
that's circulating?

258
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,599
Really?

259
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,269
I don't go online much these days.

260
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,063
I see.

261
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:32,317
Actually, our producer Mr. Seo
is going through a hard time.

262
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,695
-The movie is the biggest problem.
-We're in serious trouble.

263
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,489
There's not much excitement anymore.

264
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,492
No one's interested in watching
the movie version

265
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,410
since they know the main character dies.

266
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,747
Since Mr. Oh's been discharged
from the hospital,

267
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,208
we thought he might have changed his mind.

268
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,334
No.

269
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,797
-Does he want to change the ending?
-He wants to retire.

270
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,634
He's quite old,

271
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,220
and he had worked hard until now.

272
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,597
Please be understanding.

273
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:06,643
Certainly, I understand.

274
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,854
He must have been very stressed out,

275
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,981
but I'm just asking for a few more scenes.

276
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,609
-If he draws a couple more--
-He won't.

277
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,531
He won't draw again. He can't.

278
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,616
He's gone through

279
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,452
a lot of difficulties
than you can imagine,

280
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,579
so I can't persuade him.

281
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,081
I'm very sorry.

282
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,260
Yeon-joo, I'm very disappointed
to be honest.

283
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,178
The main character's death

284
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,390
isn't cool or touching at all.
How could he

285
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,643
have such an unfortunate death?

286
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,524
It's just a cartoon.

287
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,235
Pardon?

288
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,656
He's just a character in a cartoon.

289
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,453
Don't get too emotional
over a mere cartoon.

290
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,957
You'll forget it soon.

291
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,200
Dad, I'm home.

292
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,036
Yes. I'm in the bathroom.

293
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,873
I was with Mr. Park just now.

294
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:53,666
What did he say?

295
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,504
He finds it hard to give up
especially because of the movie.

296
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:04,803
I turned down his offer.
He will give up now.

297
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:09,057
That's good.

298
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,504
Yeon-joo...

299
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,340
Yeon-joo.

300
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:45,009
Are you here to pick up your things?
I haven't finished packing them yet.

301
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:47,095
That's not it. Come here.

302
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,763
I got a call from the police.

303
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,602
They said they found a drowned body
a few days ago,

304
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,730
and it looks like it's been about
a month since the person died.

305
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,358
They only found it now
because it was entangled in seaweeds.

306
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,112
The time of death is close,
and they found it

307
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,155
near Hangang Bridge.

308
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,700
The description is also...

309
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:11,202
I think it's Chul.

310
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:17,041
Yeon-joo!

311
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,546
-Yes?
-What are you doing? We should go.

312
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,341
-Okay.
-They're cremating him this afternoon.

313
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,135
Hurry up. Come on.

314
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:30,847
-Okay.
-We'll be stuck in traffic. Hurry.

315
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,781
What if it's really Chul?

316
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,247
I asked them to call me
if they found anything,

317
00:31:56,456 --> 00:32:00,001
but even if it's Chul,
we can't really take his body.

318
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,629
What would we say
if they ask us who it is?

319
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,340
We should leave it
as an unidentified body.

320
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:08,426
We can't bury him or not bury him.

321
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,386
That's...

322
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,521
-You said you're a friend of Mr. Park?
-What?

323
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,066
Yes. I am his friend.

324
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,485
Please come this way.

325
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,714
Since it's summer and has been a while,
it's severely decomposed.

326
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,675
It may be hard to see.

327
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,845
This may be too shocking,
so you can just check the document.

328
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,097
I'm a doctor.

329
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,224
I'll be fine. Please show me.

330
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,685
I see. Okay.

331
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,195
Please check his clothes.
Is this what he was wearing?

332
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,949
It's not him.

333
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,327
This person is wearing a ring.
It's not him.

334
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,663
Are you sure he wasn't wearing a ring
on the day he disappeared?

335
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,582
This is not the person we're looking for.

336
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,209
Definitely not.

337
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,551
Here you go.

338
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,558
What about you? Are you not eating?

339
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,227
I don't have an appetite.
I'll eat later if I get hungry.

340
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,731
You should eat your meals on time.

341
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,065
You'll get sick.

342
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,359
I know.

343
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,070
It's become a habit
since I started working at the hospital.

344
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,907
Where did you and Su-bong go
this afternoon?

345
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,996
I think you lied
about going grocery shopping.

346
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,798
The police called
and said they found a drowned body.

347
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,302
But it wasn't him.

348
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,891
Why can't we find him?

349
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,018
It's been over a month now.

350
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:29,484
I think he went back
into the cartoon as he died.

351
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,027
Don't you think so?

352
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,781
He's from the cartoon,
so that makes sense.

353
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,451
I wonder.

354
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,203
I'm not sure either.

355
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,291
I want to ask you something, Dad.

356
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,753
If it says "the end" in the cartoon,

357
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,380
what happens next?

358
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,261
Does the world inside it
end just like that?

359
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:01,099
Or do they continue their lives inside it?

360
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:09,357
The ending is always the same
in fairy tales.

361
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,860
"And they lived happily ever after."

362
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,324
Do you think they really lived
a happy life until they died?

363
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,995
Or do they stop existing
on the last page of the book?

364
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,293
Yeon-joo.

365
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,341
Do you want me to draw something

366
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:39,137
and bring Chul back to life
like everyone else?

367
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,266
No. I didn't mean that.

368
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,017
You don't have any reason to do that, Dad.

369
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,648
I have reasons I can't do it
and reasons I won't.

370
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,780
The police came to see me last week.

371
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,615
You were not home then.

372
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,534
Put it here.

373
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:05,705
We found it on the rooftop of a motel
and kept it as evidence.

374
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,373
Since the case is closed now,

375
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,917
we brought it because you might need it.

376
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,796
They brought my tablet
that I had left at the motel.

377
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,141
Die!

378
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,773
It seems the police went to the motel
and took it as evidence.

379
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,944
They brought it back
since the case is closed.

380
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,947
Is that so?

381
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:41,908
I didn't know that.

382
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,746
When I got it back,

383
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,541
I thought about bringing him back to life.

384
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,468
He didn't shoot me right

385
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,554
despite never missing his target
even by an inch.

386
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,475
He couldn't kill me on the spot.

387
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,478
No. I should say he didn't.

388
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:15,775
I know Chul better than anyone else.

389
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:33,209
THE END

390
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,336
Since he gave me a chance to live,

391
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,006
I thought I should do the same for him.

392
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,132
THE END

393
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,175
But...

394
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,888
THE END

395
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,308
I couldn't change it.

396
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,646
So I gave up.

397
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,108
Why couldn't you change it?

398
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,528
I'm not sure.

399
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,531
He and I both betrayed each other.

400
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,993
Maybe we can't turn things back again.

401
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,245
That's what I think.

402
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,873
I don't think
my drawings will work anymore.

403
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,837
I see.

404
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:20,881
That's the reason I can't draw it.

405
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,509
And I won't draw it

406
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,094
because of you.

407
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,142
Do you know why you kept
getting dragged back into that world?

408
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,979
No.

409
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,856
I think I know now.

410
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:41,152
I realized it when I saw that
he had left his suicide note with you.

411
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:45,990
You became one of
the main characters of the cartoon.

412
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,285
In other words, you became the heroine.

413
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,374
That's why I should end it here.

414
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,794
You're a real person.

415
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,671
You're my daughter

416
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,965
and your mom's daughter.

417
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,801
Don't you think so?

418
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,185
Yes.

419
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:21,609
So let's leave the ending of W at that.

420
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:52,932
But...

421
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,020
what does "The end" really mean?

422
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,775
Did So-hee find Chul's body

423
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,112
and have a proper funeral for him or...

424
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,076
is he still

425
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,578
floating in the cold water?

426
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,254
Will he...

427
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,509
drift endlessly,

428
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,512
forever alone?

429
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,871
We still have time. Let's get some coffee.

430
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:59,206
Just get some inside.
The line will be long.

431
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,583
Let's do that, then.

432
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,045
We're at the airport
and about to go in now.

433
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,423
Take care of yourself.

434
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,633
Call me as soon as you arrive.

435
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,760
The flight takes about 12 hours, right?

436
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,763
Right! Dad, don't drink.

437
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,932
You must never drink. Okay?

438
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,852
Not even one sip.
I'm going to call and check.

439
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,147
And don't forget to take your medicine.

440
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:26,317
Have a safe trip. Make sure to call me.

441
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,402
Okay.

442
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,948
-Dr. Park!
-Is your father going somewhere?

443
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,450
He's going to New Zealand.

444
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,077
He's already going on
a long-distance trip? That's not good.

445
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,871
I couldn't stop him.

446
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,540
Plus, he's not going there to travel,
but to rest.

447
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,959
-His friend lives there.
-I see.

448
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,338
-You managed to wash your hair.
-Pardon?

449
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,672
What are you wearing today?

450
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:50,090
What are you doing?

451
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,051
Let's go. I'm taking you out.

452
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,178
Take me out? But I'm okay.

453
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,056
-I'm not hungry at all.
-Meet me in the lobby in five.

454
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,933
Put on some lipstick and wear perfume.

455
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,521
What's wrong with him now?

456
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:10,653
Dr. Park, this is not cool.
You didn't even warn me.

457
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,072
-How can I go on a blind date now?
-You're a substitute.

458
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,990
Substitutes should be ready all the time.

459
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,867
But I don't want to be a substitute.

460
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,285
You don't have a boyfriend.

461
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,079
I checked and it seems
nobody has a boyfriend.

462
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:23,290
But you're the only one who's washed
her hair. That's why you're the sub.

463
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:26,168
-Consider yourself lucky.
-I shouldn't have washed my hair.

464
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,587
Why did I wash my hair?
I never wash my hair.

465
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,214
Stop the nonsense and sit!

466
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,174
Okay.

467
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,097
How long has it been
since you've been on a blind date?

468
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,057
-A blind date?
-Yes.

469
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,018
-Was it six months?
-Goodness.

470
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,438
Your father felt so bad for you

471
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:49,942
that he put in a lot of romance
at the end of his work.

472
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,278
Isn't that it? He wanted to give you
vicarious satisfaction.

473
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:54,822
He probably did.

474
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:56,949
He's here.

475
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,511
Isn't he handsome?

476
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,764
-Handsome?
-He's so manly.

477
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,099
Professor, this is--

478
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,476
He graduated in the top of his class
in law school.

479
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,064
Besides, nobody can be tall, handsome,
and smart at the same time.

480
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,483
At least he has one.

481
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,778
There might be a man with all three.

482
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:36,447
Who? Me?

483
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,075
-Doctor.
-Here.

484
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,412
-Have a seat. Yes.
-Have you been well?

485
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:49,293
This is Oh Yeon-joo,
a Cardiothoracic Surgery resident.

486
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,961
You can introduce yourself.

487
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:56,842
Hello. My name is Kim Pung-u.

488
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,721
Hello.

489
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,809
You're totally my type.

490
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,478
Sorry.

491
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,939
Your standards are so low.

492
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,776
It's easy for me
to find a girl to introduce you.

493
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,028
He's humble, too!

494
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,738
-Am I?
-Of course.

495
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,912
You must be happy.

496
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,624
I've never seen her so happy.

497
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,336
KANG SEOK-BEOM

498
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:35,130
Was washing your hair a jackpot or a bust?

499
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,174
I need to use the ladies room.

500
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,427
Be careful.

501
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,430
-She's really pretty.
-Is she all right?

502
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,808
-I think she's really into you.
-You think so?

503
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,643
I felt it a little, too.

504
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,855
-It's a bust.
-I knew it.

505
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,649
Mad Dog must've really gone mad.

506
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:56,151
I suddenly came to my senses.

507
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,820
I'll use this blind date
as a starting point

508
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,948
and work really hard from now on.
I'm totally motivated.

509
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:04,868
Yes. I haven't been dating for a while.

510
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,580
Yes. You've been too busy
being a good daughter.

511
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,583
I'll work until the moment
I lose the lottery.

512
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:14,169
Hey, you have work to do too.

513
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:17,423
You have to set me up
with one person a week for a month.

514
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,340
Am I indebted to you?

515
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,510
How can I set you up
with one person a week? I'm too busy.

516
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,096
-Hello?
-Hello?

517
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,432
Hello?

518
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,435
What's up with the sound? Hello?

519
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,247
I read it, too.

520
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,208
So that Oh Yeon-joo in it is--

521
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,253
It's his daughter.
He used his daughter's name.

522
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,338
His daughter? That's amazing.

523
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:06,174
He got lucky.
He was never going to be saved.

524
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:09,595
But he was lucky enough
to meet the greatest doctor.

525
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:12,180
If it weren't for me... What is this?

526
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,225
What's up with your hair?

527
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,602
Please lend me your phone.

528
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,814
-What happened to you?
-Please lend me your phone.

529
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:22,733
You can use my phone.

530
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,863
Did you get doused with water?
Did the pipe explode in the bathroom?

531
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,706
TO BE CONTINUED

532
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,464
Thank you.

533
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,594
-Hey! Where are you going?
-Bye.

534
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,316
Su-bong.

535
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,196
Draw the eyes a little bigger.

536
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,989
Ma'am.

537
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,660
If the eyes get any bigger,
they'll take over half the face.

538
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:17,496
-It's better to make the nose big--
-Shut up.

539
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:20,374
You haven't adjusted to my style yet.

540
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:25,170
The characters in my work
should have eyes as big as these.

541
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:30,509
They cannot escape
from the world of emotions.

542
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,677
Keep drawing.

543
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,388
Still, isn't it better
to make the nose bigger?

544
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:39,851
I'll get the door. Make the eyes this big.

545
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,353
Expand them.

546
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,688
Who is it?

547
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,440
She's a loony.

548
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,610
-Hello.
-Is Su-bong here?

549
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,696
Who are you? Goodness.

550
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,783
What happened to you?

551
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,535
-Is it raining outside?
-Let's talk.

552
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,497
Wait. Let me ask... I'll be right back.

553
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,917
What's going on?
Could you let go of my arm first?

554
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:05,836
What brings you here?

555
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,090
Did they find his body?

556
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,592
No. Please save Kang Chul.

557
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,387
-What?
-Please save him.

558
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,055
He can still be saved.

559
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,349
What do you mean? Isn't it over?

560
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,269
Time didn't pass. It had stopped.

561
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:25,480
"The end" meant that the time stopped
in the last scene.

562
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,066
He's still in the river right now
suspended in time.

563
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,653
-How do you know?
-I saw him.

564
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:34,531
I saw him in the water a moment ago.

565
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,248
So you went into the water.

566
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:48,211
Yes, I saw it just now.

567
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,589
I don't know.

568
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,758
I couldn't get a hold of Mr. Oh.

569
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,719
So you're saying
the editors didn't change it?

570
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,889
I don't know.
I'm not in charge of it either.

571
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:02,309
Mr. Park is on vacation,
but people keep calling

572
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,852
and posting messages.

573
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,021
What do I do?

574
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,108
It's "to be continued, and not "the end"?
Did I read it wrong?

575
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,110
-That's awesome.
-I look forward to what's next.

576
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,653
No more nonsense please.

577
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:16,615
Did the author come back to his senses?
Bring Kang Chul back to life.

578
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,283
You must have gotten better, Mr. Oh.

579
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:22,037
I believed in you despite
what the others said. You can do it.

580
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:27,542
That's not possible
because Mr. Oh went to New Zealand.

581
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:30,837
I'll call him in the morning since
he'll arrive then.

582
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:32,547
I haven't called him yet.

583
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,840
Okay.

584
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,302
I fixed the tablet my dad used.

585
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,346
Can you use it to draw?

586
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:40,931
Are you sure Mr. Oh didn't do it?

587
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,850
He's on a plane right now,
so how could he?

588
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,311
He said he couldn't fix it either.

589
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,647
Are you saying "The end" changed to

590
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,900
"To be continued" by itself? Why?

591
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,443
I have no idea.

592
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:57,322
I can't understand this.
The story is over.

593
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:02,202
He doesn't get killed without context.
He kills himself willingly,

594
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:03,578
so why won't it end?

595
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:08,124
There must be another reason
it can't end yet.

596
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,545
Another reason it can't end? What?

597
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:21,972
Wait a minute.

598
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:24,057
There's someone over there.

599
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,268
What are you talking about?

600
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,770
Isn't he going to jump?

601
00:52:29,437 --> 00:52:30,689
No way.

602
00:52:31,106 --> 00:52:33,400
-Let's go over there.
-Okay.

603
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,198
Excuse me, sir.

604
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:43,285
Why are you standing there?
It's dangerous.

605
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,995
Excuse me, sir.

606
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,628
What's the reason?

607
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,090
-I'm asking what the reason is.
-Su-bong.

608
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:01,094
The reason isn't important right now.
Saving Chul is.

609
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,222
This means we must save
the main character.

610
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,684
He can't save himself,
so it can't continue,

611
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,102
but he has no will to live.

612
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:12,731
-That's why we have to save him.
-What's with you?

613
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,026
Time didn't pass.

614
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,528
It stopped at the last moment,

615
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,114
so anything is possible. Look.

616
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,033
That's right.

617
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,660
We should draw a police boat
in the first scene.

618
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:29,247
A police boat happens to pass by
Hangang Bridge right at that moment.

619
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,418
Draw a diver on the boat as well.

620
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:37,297
If the diver jumps right in,
he can be rescued.

621
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:40,258
His death isn't confirmed.
We only see him in the water,

622
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:42,802
so we can wake him up.

623
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:45,513
We can assume that he hasn't died yet.

624
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,974
Wait a minute. Just a moment.

625
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:51,311
You're not telling me to draw it, are you?

626
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,857
-You're the only one. You can--
-No, I can't.

627
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,567
I don't think it'll work.

628
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,527
I mean I can't do it.

629
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,071
It's Mr. Oh's work.

630
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:03,114
I can make it look similar,
but it won't be the same.

631
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,283
I've told you many times
that there's a difference,

632
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:08,161
-so talk to Mr. Oh when he comes back.
-He won't do it.

633
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,498
He won't ever draw it because of me.

634
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:14,167
He's afraid I'll get dragged in again.

635
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:19,381
That's right! You just came back
from the Han River, didn't you?

636
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:20,715
I shouldn't draw it.

637
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:24,219
-You escaped from jail last time.
-Who cares about that right now?

638
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,845
Can't you understand me?

639
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:29,432
There's nothing else more important
than saving Chul right now.

640
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,395
Sure.

641
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,774
It's true that Chul shot Dad,

642
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,151
and it can't be forgiven.

643
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:42,988
It's true that this cursed cartoon
should end,

644
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:45,782
and it's also true
that I shouldn't get dragged in again,

645
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,243
but Dad is still alive.

646
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,080
He got much better
and is on a trip with his friends.

647
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:56,751
You and I are both fine
as if nothing happened.

648
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:57,919
And the readers?

649
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,130
They'll only be temporarily upset.

650
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,881
He's just a cartoon character after all.

651
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,467
However, only Chul

652
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,847
has been blaming himself
of being a murderer in that cold river

653
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,349
for over two months already.

654
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,772
Isn't that cruel?

655
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:22,068
And...

656
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,572
what about me?

657
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:29,951
I think all of this happened
because of me.

658
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,543
Yeon-joo...

659
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:45,675
I'm asking you to save him first.

660
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,094
I beg you.

661
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:50,972
Goodness.

662
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:58,146
Yeon-joo, I don't think it will work
even if I draw it. I'm not Mr. Oh.

663
00:55:58,229 --> 00:56:00,315
You worked with him for three years.

664
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,233
This is Dad's,

665
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:06,738
where everything first started.

666
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:20,752
Fine! I'll try it.

667
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,130
I'll try it. My goodness.

668
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,800
Wait a second.

669
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:52,325
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

670
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,370
Why isn't it working?

671
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,707
This is not working!

672
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:02,085
It's been an hour since I finished,
but nothing happened.

673
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,087
If it's working, something should change

674
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:07,465
like the next scene
drawing itself or something.

675
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,634
I told you I couldn't do it.

676
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:12,303
This isn't my work.
I was only his assistant.

677
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,639
If it were possible by
having anyone draw it,

678
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,349
a fan would've brought him back already.

679
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:22,021
Just ask Mr. Oh to do it
when he comes back.

680
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,151
Dad won't do it especially
after finding out what happened today.

681
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,069
Yeon-joo. Please.

682
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:32,574
There's no other way
than having Mr. Oh draw it.

683
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:36,703
I'm getting exhausted.

684
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,414
Is there any food?

685
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,499
I'm hungry.

686
00:57:44,169 --> 00:57:47,714
Dad won't ever do it.

687
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,221
I'm cooking some ramen. Do you want some?

688
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,641
She doesn't even answer me

689
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,894
after making me do all the work.

690
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:04,063
Why did Mr. Oh leave...

691
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:16,034
-I don't want ramen.
-Forget the ramen.

692
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,369
Do you remember?

693
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:24,959
I think I heard it from Mr. Oh
a really long time ago.

694
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,253
Something about W.

695
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,047
That you...

696
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,483
She's here!

697
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,110
The one who broke out is here!

698
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:53,571
Over here!

699
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,914
LIFE IS SOMETIMES...

700
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,168
-Someone jumped off.
-He fell in the water.

701
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:09,254
-Hurry and rescue him.
-Okay.

702
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:48,918
Freeze! Don't move!

703
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,870
THE END

704
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:27,123
TO BE CONTINUED

705
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:40,720
I brought you back to life.

706
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:44,766
From now on, let's think of this
as a sequel we're making together.

707
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:47,185
Who are you to decide
what to do with my life?

708
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,062
Because I love you!

709
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,231
Married? Not going to get married,
but we're already married?

710
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,192
I'm giving up on finding the real killer.

711
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,611
The real killer is looking for me.

712
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,489
This isn't the sequel I was hoping for.

713
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:03,576
I was afraid I would never see you again.
