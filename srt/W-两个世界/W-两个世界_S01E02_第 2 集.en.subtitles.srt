1
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,376
Korea's most popular webtoon
with a sale of ten million copies.

2
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,920
W.

3
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:55,513
The main character, Kang Chul,
is an Olympic gold medalist in shooting.

4
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,639
KANG CHUL WINS GOLD

5
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,100
His entire family
is mysteriously murdered.

6
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,436
I strongly urge the court to give
Kang Chul the death penalty.

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,189
Chul is sentenced to death for murder,

8
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,191
but he's eventually found not guilty.

9
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,529
The moment he chooses to end his life,

10
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:14,157
he decides...

11
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:17,327
to fight rather than die.

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,875
Chul becomes a multimillionaire
with a net worth of 800 billion won.

13
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,877
While hunting for
his family's real murderer,

14
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,796
he receives a suspicious call.

15
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,632
Mr. Oh disappeared.

16
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,549
What?

17
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:35,678
Meanwhile, the author of the hit webtoon
W, Oh Seong-moo, disappears overnight.

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,599
His daughter, Oh Yeon-joo,
gets dragged in by someone

19
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,519
and ends up saving Chul's life.

20
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:48,233
To Chul, Yeon-joo is a mysterious woman
who disappeared after saving him.

21
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,776
What is that now?

22
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,319
"Oh Yeon-joo."

23
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,279
Where are you right now?

24
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,406
He starts looking for her.

25
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,159
Kang Chul is looking for me. He's alive.

26
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,454
A different world exists in W.
The world where the real Kang Chul lives.

27
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:25,311
Oh, dear.

28
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,107
I'm here.

29
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,484
It's pouring outside.

30
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,319
They say it will rain all night.

31
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,739
Yeon-joo, let's eat.

32
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,262
It looks delicious.

33
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,597
YEON-JOO

34
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,224
Jeez, seriously.

35
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,899
-Hello?
-Su-bong, I think...

36
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,819
Why do you think so much?
Stop thinking now.

37
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,363
Dad didn't run away from home.
He was abducted.

38
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,575
By whom?

39
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,869
Dad was drawing that night

40
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,788
and got dragged into the webtoon
just like I was!

41
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,249
He is still stuck in there!

42
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,710
I don't know who abducted him,
but that's why he's out of reach.

43
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,004
No matter how much
we wait for him, he won't--

44
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,631
Please, Yeon-joo.

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:38,760
Stop already. How can Mr. Oh
get dragged into the webtoon?

46
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,638
You're being ridiculous.

47
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,475
You said you didn't understand
how Dad left his room!

48
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,937
Even so, how can you say
he got dragged into the webtoon?

49
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,231
That's completely nonsense.

50
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,523
We drew everything.

51
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,901
I drew each background with my own hands.

52
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,905
They are just drawings.
What can exist in drawings?

53
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,657
And I know he drew them.

54
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,909
Do you think I can't even recognize
his drawing?

55
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:06,663
We draw the backgrounds, but he is
the only one who can draw the characters.

56
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,457
Even if we try,
there's a noticeable difference!

57
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,252
And I know him better than you do!

58
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,301
Yeon-joo?

59
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,886
Are you there?

60
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,765
Now I know
how Galileo Galilei must have felt.

61
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,101
Galilei? What?

62
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,646
He coined the phrase, "And yet it moves."

63
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,149
Gosh, you're unbelievable.

64
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,277
Jang-geum said it, too.

65
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,862
"I said it tastes like persimmon
because it tastes--"

66
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:40,822
Mr. Oh?

67
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:47,078
-Mr. Oh!
-Mr. Oh.

68
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,753
-Where are you going?
-I'm going out for a while.

69
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:58,715
Eat first. You said you just
have to be there by 7:00 a.m.

70
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,924
I'm late. I got paged.

71
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,884
-I'm going. Bye.
-Yeon-joo.

72
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,013
Hey, Yeon-joo!

73
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,391
My goodness.

74
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,646
She's so busy, it's like she's my boss
rather than my daughter.

75
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,315
Gosh.

76
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,277
When will she finish residency, start
a practice, and let me live in luxury?

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,696
Maybe you should've just
let her major in art.

78
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,699
Maybe you shouldn't have forced her
to go to medical school.

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,618
By the way,

80
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:30,413
Seong-moo really made it big.

81
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,915
I hear his cut is trillions of won.

82
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,958
Gosh.

83
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:38,046
You should've been more patient
and not divorced him.

84
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,923
If you had endured for a while more,

85
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,094
your later years would be so good
and you'd be living a comfortable life.

86
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,306
Just eat.

87
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,640
Okay.

88
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,371
-Hi, Yeon-joo.
-Where's my dad?

89
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,414
He's in his room.

90
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,333
Yeon-joo.

91
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,711
I told you. Stop having wild fantasies.

92
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,713
Where was he all this time?

93
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:25,927
By the way, he lost a little weight.

94
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,151
Dad.

95
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:49,992
Dad?

96
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,746
I'm here.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,918
Hey. Hi, Yeon-joo.

98
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,255
What happened? I was worried about you.

99
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,925
Where have you been?
Why couldn't we reach you?

100
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,595
I went around for a bit.

101
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,890
Where did you go?

102
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:16,477
Here and there.

103
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,565
How about you?

104
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,860
Are you okay? You're not hurt?

105
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,362
Hurt?

106
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,281
I'm not hurt.

107
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,784
-Why are you asking that?
-Never mind.

108
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,245
As long as you're fine.

109
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,586
By the way, Dad...

110
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,714
-it's about W.
-Yes?

111
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,424
I heard from Su-bong.

112
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,634
I heard you've been saying strange things.

113
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,096
I needed to come up
with a new female character.

114
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,641
I couldn't think of any,
so I just made it in your liking.

115
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,019
It was just easier that way.
Is that strange?

116
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,564
Did you really draw that?

117
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,361
Did you really draw the last two chapters?

118
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
Who else would draw them?

119
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,202
-Actually--
-Who are you saying

120
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,413
drew them if I didn't?

121
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,126
What are you trying to say?

122
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,759
Never mind.

123
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,679
Never mind.

124
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,726
Aren't you supposed to be at the hospital?
Why did you come here?

125
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,102
You should go now.

126
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,481
Okay.

127
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,860
I have to start working again.

128
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,030
-You should rest for a while.
-I'm sick of it.

129
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:53,074
I'm so sick of it...

130
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,868
that I want to finish it quickly and rest.

131
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,331
Let's meet again when I feel better.

132
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,334
Okay.

133
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:06,462
How's your mom? Is she well?

134
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,840
She's always the same.

135
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,718
Okay. Give her my regards.

136
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,178
See yourself out.

137
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,806
Okay.

138
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,477
Hang in there, Dad.

139
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,439
My professor is your fan, too.

140
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:30,820
I'll get going.

141
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:48,921
Yeon-joo, would you like to
have breakfast with us?

142
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,381
I have to go to work.

143
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,758
Su-bong.

144
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,596
Did my dad say anything
about where he was?

145
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,848
No, he didn't.

146
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,560
What about how he got out
of the room unnoticed?

147
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,651
He said he'll start drawing right away,
so we'll be working all night.

148
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,114
Thank you. I'll get going now.

149
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,532
-Okay.
-See you, Yeon-joo.

150
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,700
-Bye.
-Can't you stay and eat?

151
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,201
-Bye, Yeon-joo.
-Bye.

152
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,995
-I'll see you soon.
-Take care.

153
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,497
Be careful. It's raining.

154
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,833
Don't forget your umbrella.

155
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,930
Su-bong.

156
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,016
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,148
Yes, sir?

158
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,650
Research some poisons.

159
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,234
Poison?

160
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,362
Those that can be easily found
in hospitals.

161
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,072
Okay.

162
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:04,455
MYUNGSEI UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

163
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,837
The rain is making me crave coffee.

164
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,923
Not this vending machine crap,
but good coffee.

165
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,216
I want some cake.

166
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,844
Cafe Bonjour has the best tiramisu.

167
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,971
Bonjour sounds great.

168
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,307
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
Loser goes to Bonjour.

169
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,142
Forget it. I'll go.

170
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,395
Yeon-joo, what would you like?

171
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:31,190
Being nice isn't something we do.
What's wrong with you?

172
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,985
Loser goes. Rock-paper-scissors shoot!

173
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,946
-Yeon-joo, you lost.
-You lost.

174
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,077
Hey.

175
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:44,870
Go.

176
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,372
Go where?

177
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,833
What's wrong with you lately?

178
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,168
You scared me. Why? Was I paged?

179
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,296
We played to see who goes to Bonjour,
and you forfeited.

180
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,101
Su-bong, are you busy?

181
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,020
PARK SU-BONG

182
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,105
I can talk.

183
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,493
Hey, Yeon-joo.

184
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,078
Is Dad still working?

185
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:27,621
Yes.

186
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,290
What is this week's chapter about?

187
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,377
I think he is going to...

188
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,629
kill Chul again.

189
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,715
What?

190
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,911
Hello?

191
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:10,748
Yes.

192
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,502
No one's in his room
except for his bodyguard.

193
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,340
You want me to do it now?

194
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,973
HANDLE WITH CARE

195
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,892
He's working on it right now.

196
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,105
He's drawing a scene where someone
tells a nurse to inject a drug into Chul.

197
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,190
Who?

198
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:38,609
I don't know. It's over the phone.

199
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,152
How?

200
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:44,782
Instead of giving him antibiotics,

201
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,077
she'll inject him with potassium.

202
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,620
Potassium?

203
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,165
She'll stop his heart
by injecting it into his IV?

204
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,086
Yes. I looked it up,
and it seemed like the easiest way.

205
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,846
HANDLE WITH CARE

206
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,006
Your three cups of latte
and three pieces of tiramisu are ready.

207
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:45,009
Thank you.

208
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,645
I should stop thinking about it.

209
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,064
Dad is home and fine.

210
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,984
It's just a webtoon.

211
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,237
He's just a webtoon character.
Who cares if he dies?

212
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:08,991
Goodness.

213
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,164
Hello?

214
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,876
Dad? Are you working?

215
00:16:02,002 --> 00:16:03,128
Yes. What is it?

216
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:06,090
I'm so sorry to bother you.

217
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,635
Are you going to kill Chul?

218
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,224
Why? Why do you have to kill him?

219
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,227
You're meddling in my work now?

220
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,939
I just feel bad.

221
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,024
Why does he have to die
when he did nothing wrong?

222
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,028
That's unfair. He was determined
to find the real killer.

223
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,780
That was his goal for 10 years.

224
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,699
He didn't catch the killer or get revenge.

225
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,409
Why must he die? He's the main character.

226
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:38,122
Who says the main character always
gets his revenge before he dies?

227
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,039
It's up to me.

228
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,417
Still, that's not fair, Dad.

229
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,169
That defeats the purpose of saving him.

230
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,879
After barely saving him...

231
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,215
If you kill him again
after only two chapters,

232
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,592
the readers would think it's absurd.

233
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,928
So why did you have to do that?

234
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,808
Dad?

235
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,477
What do you mean by that?

236
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,859
You asked why I did that.

237
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,486
Never mind.

238
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,448
You're talking about

239
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,909
how I saved Chul, right?

240
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,494
What on earth are you talking about?

241
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,623
You know about it too, don't you?

242
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,794
You know that I saved Chul's life.
You didn't draw that, did you?

243
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,797
Are you out of your mind?

244
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,466
If I'm wrong, please explain!

245
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:33,093
How did you know
what I was wearing that day?

246
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,845
She looked exactly like me
from head to toe!

247
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,765
I never wore those clothes before.

248
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,314
You also saw him, didn't you?

249
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,399
You saw the living Chul.

250
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,321
I saw him.

251
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,157
His blood was hot
and his heart was beating.

252
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,951
The way he looked at me
is still vivid in my mind.

253
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:01,955
I saw him with my own eyes.
But how? How can he be real?

254
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:08,170
It doesn't make any sense.
How can he be a real person?

255
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,588
That's why.

256
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,926
That's why I have to end his life
right now.

257
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,719
You can't!

258
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,429
That's murder!

259
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,558
What did you just say? Murder?

260
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:26,980
I don't know what is happening,
but he is alive.

261
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:30,359
If you kill someone who's alive,
that's murder, Dad!

262
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,364
Dad, we have to talk.
I'll come over right now.

263
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,323
Hello?

264
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,997
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

265
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,291
-Hello?
-The tax deducted from...

266
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,835
What's wrong with my phone?

267
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,295
-Gosh.
-They won't get their money back.

268
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:54,258
The economy hasn't recovered yet.

269
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,926
They decided to keep deducting taxes

270
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,554
since the economy may stagnate even more.

271
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,890
It's been ten days
since Kang Chul was attacked.

272
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,309
The police still have no leads

273
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,478
and are struggling with the investigation.

274
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:11,066
They're looking for a female doctor,
who was the sole witness.

275
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:15,070
The doctor is believed to be
in her late 20s to early 30s.

276
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,407
That's the only information
the police have so far.

277
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,742
Hankuk Sungjin Medical Center stated

278
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,079
that Kang's surgery was a success,

279
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,540
-and he is recovering quickly.
-Kang Chul.

280
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:34,089
MYUNGSEI UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

281
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,677
I can just use a picture
of Myungsei University Medical Center

282
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,596
for Hankuk Sungjin Medical Center, right?

283
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,181
Yes, sure.

284
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,730
HANKUK SUNGJIN MEDICAL CENTER

285
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,690
Over here.

286
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,197
Please take me
to Hankuk Sungjin Medical Center.

287
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,782
-Excuse me?
-How long will it take? Is it far?

288
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:04,870
What are you talking about?
This is Hankuk Sungjin Medical Center.

289
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,915
No, it's not. This is Myungsei
University Medical Center.

290
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,627
HANKUK SUNGJIN MEDICAL CENTER

291
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,973
This is our hospital.

292
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,726
How does it look exactly the same?

293
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,779
KANG CHUL

294
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,708
I'll give you your antibiotics.

295
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,425
-Where's So-hee?
-She's with company people downstairs.

296
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:17,567
Kang Chul is here, right?
Which room is he in?

297
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,237
OH YEON-JOO

298
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,948
I'm sorry. I cannot tell you
for security reasons.

299
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,491
This is an urgent matter.

300
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,500
HANKUK SUNGJIN MEDICAL CENTER
CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR FIVE YEARS

301
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,918
MYUNGSEI UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER

302
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,338
That's right. This hospital has
exactly the same structure as ours.

303
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,699
-Didn't you take a week off?
-I couldn't.

304
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,617
It's harder being home.

305
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,032
-Please let me in!
-No, you can't.

306
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,079
Oh, no. Please. Stop it.

307
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,664
Are you okay?

308
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,628
ARE YOU OKAY?

309
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,513
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

310
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,139
What do you mean?

311
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,767
This isn't antibiotics, it's potassium.
It stops the heart.

312
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,451
Mr. Seo, what's wrong?

313
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:34,913
Who is the nurse in charge?
Call security and lock down the ward.

314
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:35,831
Okay.

315
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,833
When did she put it in?

316
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,085
Just before you came in.

317
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,297
Then it's okay. Minute volumes are fine.

318
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,050
How did you know about this?

319
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,427
Sorry?

320
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,559
I was just passing by.
It was just by chance.

321
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,644
The nurse looked suspicious.

322
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,108
What happened?

323
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,902
-Ms. Jeong switched drugs?
-I think it was potassium.

324
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,738
Since your attending physician is here,
I'll get going.

325
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:13,952
Yeon-joo.

326
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,166
You're Oh Yeon-joo, right?

327
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:22,711
No, I'm not.

328
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,965
It says "Oh Yeon-joo" there.

329
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:28,967
OH YEON-JOO

330
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,135
Oh Yeon-joo?

331
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,469
The woman who...

332
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,307
We finally meet,

333
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,683
Oh Yeon-joo.

334
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,735
WE FINALLY MEET, OH YEON-JOO.

335
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,059
-Do you work here?
-No, I don't.

336
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,562
Well, yes.

337
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,565
Then why does your business card say
"Myungsei"?

338
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,901
Well, that's because

339
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,612
I used to work here before.
I don't anymore, though.

340
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:33,907
-I work at Myungsei now.
-That hospital doesn't exist.

341
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,075
Pardon?

342
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,080
No, it doesn't because it closed down.

343
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,208
-It closed down?
-Yes, it went bankrupt.

344
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,794
So that means I'm currently unemployed.

345
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,759
What brings you here, then?
It's not your workplace.

346
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,513
-Pardon?
-How did you end up in my room?

347
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,307
Well...

348
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,311
You were looking for me.

349
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,563
I saw on the news
that you were looking for the witness.

350
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,107
You said you were here by chance.

351
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,404
I saw the nurse by chance.
She looked really suspicious.

352
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:17,659
It's not that I came here by chance.
I originally came here to see you.

353
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,621
That's right.

354
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:29,504
What happened?

355
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,925
I just heard. Why would the nurse do that?
Are you okay?

356
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,803
Isn't she Yoon So-hee?

357
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,099
That's right, she's the heroine.

358
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,684
Kang Chul's friend and personal assistant.

359
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,602
In that case,

360
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,188
that man must be

361
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,107
Seo Do-yoon.

362
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:51,651
MMA fighter-turned-bodyguard.
Kang Chul's right-hand man.

363
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,071
Is she...

364
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,741
Are you Ms. Oh Yeon-joo?

365
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:01,870
Yes.

366
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,956
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

367
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,208
We've been looking all over for you.

368
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,503
Hello. I'm Yoon So-hee,
Mr. Kang's personal assistant.

369
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,213
Hello.

370
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,383
Why have you been out of touch until now?

371
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,928
Do you work at this hospital?

372
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,806
I couldn't find Myungsei University
Medical Center anywhere.

373
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,726
She just explained that.

374
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,562
Oh, did she?

375
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,608
Anyway, she's pretty.

376
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,235
You're pretty.

377
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,613
The sketch was wrong because of you.

378
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,993
Yes, she's pretty. Did I say otherwise?

379
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,791
IF SHE'S CONSIDERED PRETTY,
A STRAY DOG WOULD BE PRETTY

380
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,959
What the...

381
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,172
You don't need to pay me
empty compliments.

382
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,092
You said if I'm considered pretty,
a stray dog would be pretty.

383
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,103
Oh, no. I read that in the webtoon.

384
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,232
That was addressed to Mr. Kang, right?

385
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,567
How did you know...

386
00:28:15,068 --> 00:28:16,403
Well, that's...

387
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,659
I'm sorry,

388
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,869
but I'd like to speak alone with Mr. Kang.

389
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:27,163
Pardon?

390
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,457
-With me?
-Yes.

391
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,042
Just us. I have something to tell you.

392
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,345
Wait outside.

393
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,222
Mr. Kang, that's a bit...

394
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,642
We know nothing about her.

395
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,896
We know nothing about her?
She saved my life.

396
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,065
What more do we need to know?

397
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,575
The police will be here soon.
We'll talk more about this later.

398
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,785
Let us know when you're done.
We'll be outside.

399
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,885
-Isn't she suspicious?
-She's suspicious.

400
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:24,846
How did she know about today's incident?

401
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,056
She couldn't have known
unless she was close to the suspect.

402
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:28,516
That's right.

403
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:32,187
How did she know what Mr. Kang said
about stray dogs being pretty--

404
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:34,856
Did you tell her?

405
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:36,566
I'm not crazy.

406
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,821
What did you want to tell me?

407
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,825
You said that I saved your life, right?

408
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,243
Of course.

409
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,204
Then you can help me, right?

410
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,122
Of course. I will compensate you, too.

411
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:53,249
You don't need to compensate me.

412
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:57,128
Just help me get out of here quietly.

413
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,924
I can't be questioned by the police.

414
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,300
I can't give a statement either.

415
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,219
Why is that?

416
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,013
I'm in no position to do that.

417
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,391
You're not? Are you an illegal alien?
Or a wanted criminal?

418
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,186
Don't ask me why.

419
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,357
You said I saved your life.
You could do that much for me.

420
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,610
You may have saved my life,
but I can't do that.

421
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,279
I don't know anything about you,

422
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:25,365
and the police suspect
you are an accomplice.

423
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,534
You should talk to the police
to prove your innocence--

424
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,162
You know well that I'm not an accomplice.

425
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,499
What makes you so sure?

426
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,002
Instincts.

427
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,674
Your instincts tell you that.

428
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,141
It seems you know me well.

429
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,102
You knew what I said
about being pretty, too.

430
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,896
Yes. I know a lot about you.

431
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:00,316
You think that I might be
the key to your life.

432
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,742
Yeon-joo, who are you?

433
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,203
If you want to know, let me go for now.

434
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,372
I will tell you next time.

435
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,624
I just can't tell you right now.

436
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,545
You negotiate well.

437
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,172
I'm not negotiating.

438
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,174
I'm asking you for a favor.

439
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,802
I have my reasons. Please?

440
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:35,643
Wait a minute.

441
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,654
Why is he asking us to go down?

442
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,574
I don't know. Maybe Detective Park
has a secret to tell us.

443
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,039
You'll tell me everything next time?

444
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,833
When is that "next time"?

445
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,171
I can't let you go
until you make me a promise.

446
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,257
I have many questions for you.

447
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,760
I'm not sure.

448
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,263
Perhaps when you get discharged.

449
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,432
When I get discharged? Okay.

450
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,559
Your cell phone number is fake.

451
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,480
So take this. I have several phones.

452
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,441
I will call you when I get discharged.

453
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:27,528
If this is to track my location,
I have to tell you that it's useless.

454
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,407
I wouldn't do that to someone
who saved my life.

455
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,034
You said you knew me well.

456
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,121
You just have to keep your promise.

457
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,541
I trust that I'll be able to reach you.
That's why I'm letting you go.

458
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,379
How do you know that?

459
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:48,800
My instincts.

460
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,275
Stand clear of the closing door.

461
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:18,329
You can go now.

462
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,833
Wait.

463
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,003
I take back what I said.

464
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,007
It was dark that night,
so I didn't realize, but you are pretty.

465
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,801
I take back what I said
about you not being pretty.

466
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,139
You must have felt guilty.

467
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,850
Yes, very.

468
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:44,063
You're just saying that.
You still don't think I'm pretty, do you?

469
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,692
I told you I know you well.

470
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,361
I know that you flatter women all the time

471
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,946
even though you're not interested in them.

472
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:56,743
You've piqued my interest.

473
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:58,661
I'm excited about our next meeting.

474
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,668
You should go now.
The police are coming up.

475
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,089
See you next time.

476
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,352
Follow me.

477
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,499
Please get in.

478
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,217
Right.

479
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,863
My stomach hurts.

480
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,125
How do I go home?

481
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,837
How do I go back now?

482
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,464
How did it work last time?

483
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,466
I remember...

484
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,762
What is that now?

485
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,680
TO BE CONTINUED

486
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:44,058
Right. The words
"To be continued" appeared.

487
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,811
That became the ending for the chapter.

488
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,813
I went back when the chapter ended. Right.

489
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,278
Did I stay about half an hour last time?

490
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,071
Let's wait a little longer.

491
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,073
I think it's been a while already.

492
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,096
What's this?

493
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,891
Thirty minutes have passed already.
Why isn't anything happening?

494
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,232
What?

495
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:34,650
What?

496
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,767
HANKUK SUNGJIN MEDICAL CENTER

497
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,857
What?

498
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,234
Oh, my gosh!

499
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,658
-Hello?
-Yeon-joo?

500
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,119
How are you? We should meet.

501
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,747
-Pardon?
-Do you have time today?

502
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,541
-Pardon?
-Where are you now?

503
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:33,626
Seoul?

504
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,504
-Yes.
-Where?

505
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,758
The bus stop near the hospital.

506
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,009
Wait there. I'm coming.

507
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,845
Hello?

508
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,893
What is going on?

509
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,353
What the...

510
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,148
Why do these weird things
keep happening...

511
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,500
How have you been, Yeon-joo?

512
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,137
What a coincidence that you're here.

513
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,596
I just got discharged.

514
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,057
What? Already?

515
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:32,226
You've fully recovered already?

516
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,231
What do you mean, "already"?
I was in bed for two months.

517
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,200
What? Two months have passed?

518
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,163
Get in.

519
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,582
Why?

520
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,378
We can't talk on the street.
Let's go somewhere else.

521
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,321
Let's grab lunch. What would you like?

522
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,656
Anything is fine.

523
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,789
What have you been up to?

524
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,126
I haven't done anything.
It's only been half an hour.

525
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,338
What's new with you?

526
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,591
How could there be anything new?
It's only been half an hour!

527
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,597
This can't be right.
How could two months have passed?

528
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,268
But he looks totally fine.

529
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,980
He really must have recovered.

530
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,822
I'll take you to one of my usual spots.
Is that okay?

531
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,286
Goodness.

532
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,230
Maybe this is it.

533
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,232
This is a webtoon, right?

534
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,860
Wouldn't time pass
as quickly as needed for the story?

535
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,155
That's right. Chul is the main character.

536
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,699
We don't need scenes where
the lead character isn't doing anything.

537
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,993
So it skipped the time
when he was in the hospital.

538
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,329
I think that's it.

539
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,418
What about me? What happened to me?

540
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:04,962
Did I go missing for two months, then?

541
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,971
-Aren't you hot?
-Excuse me?

542
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:17,349
The forecast said it will be 29℃ today.

543
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,643
I see.

544
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,192
You haven't been sleeping
on the bench, have you?

545
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,111
No.

546
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,282
I think you wore the same outfit
two months ago.

547
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,548
Let's go.

548
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,636
My company will officially compensate you,

549
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,387
but I have to buy you
summer clothes first.

550
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,932
No thanks. I'm fine.

551
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,476
You look very hot.

552
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,895
No, not at all.

553
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,397
You have sweat on your forehead.

554
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:31,966
You can pick anything you like.

555
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,347
What should I do now?

556
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,809
If I knew I would see him in 30 minutes,
I wouldn't have agreed to meet him.

557
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:45,145
I wouldn't have answered the phone.
What do I do?

558
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,320
You still haven't heard from
Oh Yeon-joo, have you?

559
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,364
You were a fool to trust your instincts.

560
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:58,450
You let the culprit go. You're an idiot.

561
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,123
CHUL

562
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,083
I'm with Yeon-joo right now.

563
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,591
Why is one chapter so long?

564
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,342
I was here less than 30 minutes last time.

565
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,469
It's been two months already,
so why won't it end?

566
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,723
What if the time keeps running like this?

567
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,102
That's right. This is a series.

568
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,813
This is a series.

569
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,357
Do we need an incident that could lead
to the next chapter?

570
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,111
That's right. Something should
happen to the main character.

571
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,071
An incident that can be an ending.

572
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,740
An incident.

573
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,325
What kind of incident?

574
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,000
Hey.

575
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,960
Hi. How did you meet her so soon?

576
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,755
She was near the hospital.

577
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,007
Not yet. I had to stop by somewhere.

578
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,967
No, don't come.

579
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,727
Hold on.

580
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,398
It looks good on you. Why don't you--

581
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,361
Hello, Chul?

582
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,613
That woman is crazy.

583
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,073
-What did she just do?
-Goodness.

584
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,282
This is shocking, right?

585
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,117
She's crazy.

586
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,912
This is enough for an ending scene, right?

587
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,249
-I can't believe it.
-What a strange woman.

588
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,169
-Why did she do that?
-She's crazy.

589
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,216
What is this? Was I wrong?

590
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,636
What was that for?

591
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,015
Why do I have to get slapped
for buying you clothes?

592
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,185
-Oh, dear.
-What does this mean?

593
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,271
Well...

594
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:54,566
I'm sorry.

595
00:44:58,237 --> 00:44:59,238
Yeon-joo.

596
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,867
You must have reasons
for slapping someone.

597
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,869
If that didn't work...

598
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,080
Yeon-joo?

599
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,249
Maybe...

600
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,003
Would this work?

601
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,843
-Look at them.
-What is she doing?

602
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:23,512
-What is this?
-What are they doing?

603
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,431
-Goodness.
-I can't believe this.

604
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:28,225
-Why would she do that?
-Gosh.

605
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,519
-What's wrong with her?
-What is this?

606
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,479
-She's crazy.
-Who is she?

607
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:36,567
What should I do?
This isn't working either.

608
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:39,069
What are you...

609
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,156
Why did she kiss him after slapping him?

610
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,407
TO BE CONTINUED

611
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,874
Gosh, how absurd.

612
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,006
Hello? You got slapped? What happened?

613
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,300
Chul, are you still there?

614
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:04,928
Hello?

615
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,638
Gosh, you startled me.

616
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:08,182
What happened?

617
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,311
Yeon-joo makes quite an impression.

618
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,771
What kind of impression?

619
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,485
She's totally the "I'm the crazy bitch
in town."

620
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,175
I'll call you back.

621
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,516
Yeon-joo.

622
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:12,746
Mr. Kang?

623
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:15,249
Is there any problem?

624
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,688
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY RESIDENT
OH YEON-JOO

625
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,096
Jeez, were you growing the coffee beans
yourself or something?

626
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,514
Hey.

627
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,433
What are you wearing?

628
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,186
Oh, my. Yeon-joo. Your clothes...

629
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,188
Were you late because you went shopping?

630
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,901
How long was I gone for?

631
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,321
Goodness. About 30 minutes.

632
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,366
Only 30 minutes? Not two months?

633
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,412
Did you buy those sandals, too?
From where?

634
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,540
-All the stores should be closed already.
-What?

635
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:39,625
What is it?

636
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:41,668
Goodness.

637
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,920
You haven't seen it yet?

638
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:46,882
It just came up. Look.

639
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,303
-It's up already?
-Just a little while ago.

640
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:56,016
It came up early today.
People are posting comments like crazy.

641
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:00,479
They're upset and asking why Chul's
first kiss scene is with a crazy woman.

642
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,065
They're also upset
that it wasn't with So-hee.

643
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:05,067
Gosh. But...

644
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,569
I love this kind of thing.

645
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:09,655
An unexpected love story.

646
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:15,118
Please tell your father
that it made my heart flutter.

647
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:17,162
Did you say a love story?

648
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,080
Right.

649
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,167
I hate it when the hero and heroine
always end up together.

650
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,003
-It's so obvious.
-What are you talking about?

651
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,508
He should end up with So-hee.
So-hee is amazing and has big breasts.

652
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,842
What a pervert!

653
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:36,098
Why did you turn it off?

654
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,643
The screen is a bit too big.
It's kind of uncomfortable.

655
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:42,354
I mean, the monitor
doesn't have to be this big.

656
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,522
You're the weird one.

657
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,399
Do you feel like you were the one

658
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,901
who kissed Kang Chul
because her name is Oh Yeon-joo?

659
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:51,988
Oh, my, Yeon-joo.

660
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,574
You haven't even removed the tag yet.

661
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,120
-It's okay. I can do it myself.
-Just a second.

662
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,081
-Just leave it.
-Did you steal it or something?

663
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,961
Where are you going? Aren't you eating?

664
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,548
Seok-beom!

665
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,845
Do you know how much that dress is?

666
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,514
It's 3,550,000 won.

667
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,309
My gosh! This is unbelievable!

668
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:25,897
Hello?

669
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:27,566
How are you?

670
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:30,152
We're working on it right now.

671
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,904
What? When?

672
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,199
That's not possible.
Please wait one moment.

673
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,453
They're saying the editor
already received the manuscript.

674
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,830
-What do you mean?
-Take this.

675
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,083
Hello?

676
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:48,754
We haven't even finished half of it yet.

677
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,088
Yes. Who did?

678
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,049
What's going on? It's online already!

679
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,261
Just a moment, please.

680
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,977
What? What is this?

681
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,145
Who did this?

682
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,607
No, we didn't upload it.

683
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:11,651
This is a mistake.
We are still working on it.

684
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,530
Pardon me? Please wait a moment.

685
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,373
Mr. Oh, I just received a call
from the editor's office.

686
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,458
The manuscript was...

687
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,924
Did you send it to them?

688
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,136
I thought...

689
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,306
Okay, I got it.

690
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,980
Yes. It seems like Mr. Oh sent it
to you himself.

691
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:52,484
Yes. He did it without telling us.

692
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:54,861
Yes, I see.

693
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,321
-Give me the phone.
-Please hold.

694
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,198
He wants to speak to you.

695
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,827
Hello. This is Oh Seong-moo.

696
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,537
Hello, Mr. Oh.

697
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,455
I'm just very curious.

698
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,749
It's fun with the love scene and all,

699
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,877
but it seems very different
from your usual style.

700
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,963
Delete it. I sent it by accident.

701
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,548
Pardon?

702
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,634
Take it down. I'll send you another one.

703
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:18,677
That's the wrong one.

704
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,805
Why not? It's super fun.

705
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,182
Readers are posting comments like crazy.

706
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,684
Take it down at once.

707
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:31,523
But Mr. Oh, over 10,000 people
have already read it.

708
00:52:32,148 --> 00:52:35,360
Can't you fix it in the next chapter
if you're not satisfied with one?

709
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,071
Do as I say and take it down now!
Stop arguing with me!

710
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,993
I'll send another one by dawn.
Delete it at once. Got that?

711
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,914
All of you.

712
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,542
Pack your things and go home.

713
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:51,751
Excuse me?

714
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,170
It's going to be the final chapter.

715
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:58,383
I can tie things up myself,
so I don't need you anymore.

716
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,973
I'm dismissing the team.

717
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:06,975
Go home and rest.

718
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,604
Why are you suddenly doing this?
We want to stay...

719
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,944
Thank you for all your hard work.

720
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,571
Wait...

721
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,239
Mr. Oh.

722
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,912
Su-bong, why is he angry at us?

723
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,624
I don't understand him.
He sends it without telling us,

724
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,959
and now he says it's the wrong one
and to take it down.

725
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,462
Right, and how did he draw it so quickly?

726
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,088
That's insane.

727
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:40,342
We didn't even finish half.
How could he finish within a few minutes?

728
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,136
Not only that. The content is so strange.

729
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,930
What's with the sudden kissing scene?

730
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:48,642
Mr. Oh never includes
kissing scenes or sex scenes.

731
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,273
YOU'VE FULLY RECOVERED ALREADY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "ALREADY"?

732
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,108
Goodness.

733
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,277
THE FORECAST SAID IT WILL BE 29℃ TODAY.

734
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:01,279
How is everything I do...

735
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,989
SLAP

736
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:09,037
Even I'm speechless.

737
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,121
YEON-JOO?

738
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,737
YEON-JOO

739
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,498
Hello, Dad?

740
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,335
You saw it, right?

741
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:58,878
The new chapter.

742
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:04,050
Don't pretend like you don't know anymore.
You can't.

743
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:09,097
I already met Chul twice, just as you saw.

744
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,558
I experienced it all myself.

745
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,768
I spent two months there.

746
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,188
What is happening?

747
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,524
Why is Chul alive?

748
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,942
-Why did you--
-You said...

749
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,195
it would be murder, right?

750
00:55:26,781 --> 00:55:29,492
I drew it. It's my artwork.

751
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:33,329
In my work, I'm God,
since I created everything.

752
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:35,123
So,

753
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,501
how is it murder
if God destroys its own creature?

754
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,336
It's not murder.

755
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:42,756
It's called judgment.

756
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:45,467
He's a monster.

757
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,594
I didn't know it at first,

758
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:49,929
but I had created a monster.

759
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,309
So I decided to judge him
because he never should've been created.

760
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,606
How can I let him be?
I'm about to be eaten alive.

761
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,526
I should've ended his life
a long time ago.

762
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,570
Right there at the Hangang Bridge.

763
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:07,906
What are you talking about?

764
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,326
Forget it. What you saw today
was just an illusion.

765
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:12,577
Forget it all.

766
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,662
It was not an illusion, Dad.

767
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,289
I experienced it all.

768
00:56:16,372 --> 00:56:18,583
-How can it be an illusion?
-I'm telling you to forget it!

769
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,295
Do you want people to call
both of us crazy?

770
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,550
Let me be the only crazy one.

771
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,762
You stay out of it. It's dangerous.

772
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,389
Hello?

773
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,818
Mr. Oh!

774
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,612
Mr. Oh, where are you going?

775
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,863
Mr. Oh!

776
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,956
Seok-beom, do me a favor.

777
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:00,208
I need to go out for a while.

778
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:05,171
Where are you going in your fancy clothes?

779
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:08,174
SEOINJANG MOTEL

780
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,686
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY RESIDENT
OH YEON-JOO

781
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,232
-Hello.
-What's going on?

782
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,693
-The manager called me--
-You heard, right?

783
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,194
Sorry, but take care of it for me.

784
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,113
Make sure the videos don't get out.

785
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,825
I'm on my way there,
but what videos are you talking about?

786
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,452
The manager wouldn't speak clearly.

787
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,872
If you see it, you'll get mad.
Then you'll curse me out.

788
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:43,168
But I swear this didn't happen
because Yeon-joo is pretty.

789
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,171
-And I finally found it.
-Found what?

790
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,631
The key to my life.

791
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:55,096
I'm not saying this
because she's pretty either.

792
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,640
If she's considered pretty,
a stray dog would be pretty.

793
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,602
She's the biggest wack job I've ever seen.

794
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:02,437
However, despite all that,

795
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,524
Yeon-joo saved my life, and I'm certain
that she is the key to my life.

796
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,819
That's why we should protect her identity.

797
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,696
We must hide her from the public
at all costs.

798
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,782
The police can't investigate her,
and the media can't talk about her.

799
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:17,035
You know what to do, right?

800
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:21,498
Please take care of it.
I need to go to the office...

801
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:55,985
Who...

802
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:00,740
are you?

803
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,430
You said you need an ending
in order to get out.

804
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:07,515
That means there's a rule
for entering it as well.

805
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:09,016
What if you're suddenly dragged back in?

806
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,309
Finally, it's in my possession.

807
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,436
The key to my life.

808
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,353
I love you.

809
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,524
He's a monster. He will kill me someday.

810
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,693
I'm sorry, but I have to end it here.

811
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,486
Why did you slap
and then kiss me that day?

812
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:23,698
-So I can disappear.
-I know you're hiding your reasons.

813
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,450
If you don't answer me,
I'll really shoot you.

814
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,160
You won't shoot me.

815
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,245
I can do it if I want to.

816
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,126
