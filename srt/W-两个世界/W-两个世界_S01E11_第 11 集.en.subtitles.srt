1
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,164
W is Korea's top webtoon series.

2
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,168
The main character, Kang Chul,
learns from Oh Yeon-joo

3
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,712
that he's a main character of a webtoon.

4
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:49,507
In order to get rid of the killer,
you have to create his identity first.

5
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,925
So this was my face?

6
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,722
Chul joins forces with Seong-moo in order
to protect Yeon-joo and the world of W.

7
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:58,558
You're working with Chul to kill me.
That's a betrayal.

8
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,310
Just before they could do it...

9
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,396
Let's write some lines.
First is Chul's line.

10
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,107
It's none of your business, Dad.
Who do you think you are?

11
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,735
-How dare you get drunk and--
-This is all fabricated.

12
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:13,281
He kills Son Hyeon-seok
who was like a father to Chul.

13
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,535
Hey! Stop!

14
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,039
-And frames Chul for the murder.
-Are you hurt?

15
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,049
Where are we?

16
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,554
In a motel.

17
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,058
I tried to pick an inconspicuous one.

18
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,602
But I'm still worried.

19
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,904
You were framed, right?

20
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:54,989
Of something absurd?

21
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,908
That's why you ran, right?

22
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,706
I'll try to find out what happened
and how you can solve it.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,292
I think something serious has happened.

24
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,920
I just don't know what it is yet.

25
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,968
It's too dangerous to stay here for long.

26
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:17,554
And you need more medical supplies.

27
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,101
That's why I have to get out of here.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,646
Will you be okay alone?

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,484
Look, Yeon-joo.

30
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,027
Hang in there and wait for me.

31
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,740
I don't understand anything you just said.

32
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,951
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,163
How can you help me?

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,166
Because I'm one of those people

35
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,794
who want your life to have a happy ending.

36
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:56,301
So our breakup would not be in vain.

37
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,143
Yeon-joo.

38
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,607
Who...

39
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,526
are you?

40
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,081
I have to get out of here.

41
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,208
So...

42
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,546
I really hope this works again.

43
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,305
TO BE CONTINUED

44
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,187
Su-bong.

45
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:56,856
Su-bong!

46
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,695
Dad?

47
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,908
Dad.

48
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,537
Why did you do that? You said
you'd end it with a happy ending.

49
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,081
Why did you kill everyone

50
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,374
and frame Chul for it?

51
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,545
Can't you just let him be happy now?

52
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,216
Dad.

53
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:26,636
Dad?

54
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,797
I'm sorry.

55
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,549
I'm sorry.

56
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,801
Hello?

57
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,761
Yeon-joo, where are you?

58
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,763
I came to the hospital.
Why are you not here?

59
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,348
I came to the work room, and my dad...

60
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,641
What happened to him?

61
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,019
You saw him? His...

62
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,354
His face disappeared.

63
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,481
I know! What happened?

64
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,152
His eyes, nose, and lips disappeared.

65
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,204
Shoot Son in the heart.

66
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,293
Draw a handgun in Chul's hand.

67
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:55,349
He was drawing like a madman.

68
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,521
So, my dad was drawing
according to the killer's orders?

69
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,648
I don't know.

70
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,983
I just...

71
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,068
I am just...

72
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,945
too terrified.

73
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,406
What will happen to him now?

74
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,242
Is my dad the killer?
Then how about that...

75
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,578
I have no idea.

76
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,289
It's dangerous there. Get out right now.

77
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,460
Chul was shot.
He might die if I leave him alone.

78
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:26,589
But you might die first!
Mr. Oh is not himself!

79
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,799
That's not him over there!

80
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:33,054
Just lock the door and get out of there.

81
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,226
Excuse me?

82
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,564
-Doctor.
-Yes.

83
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,025
Doctor, I am terrified.

84
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,361
Someone might come, Doctor.
Let's go inside.

85
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,988
-Okay. Let's go in.
-Let's hurry inside!

86
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,508
Open it.

87
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,774
The door is open.

88
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,200
Mr. Seo, you need to come with us.

89
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,744
This will be a very long investigation.

90
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:05,581
If I think about how I was fooled into
cooperating with you and sharing tips,

91
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,791
I could just...

92
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,127
Then again,
I guess you couldn't have known.

93
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,338
Mr. Son knew Chul for over 30 years,

94
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,256
but he was killed anyway.

95
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,133
Sir.

96
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,803
-We found out where Chul fled to.
-Where is it?

97
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,555
His car was caught on camera
at an intersection in Yongin an hour ago,

98
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,808
but it disappeared before reaching
Baekbong Intersection.

99
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,352
The stretch is only 3km,
so we'll find him soon.

100
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:28,562
He was shot, so he couldn't have gone far.

101
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,406
We need to search your car.

102
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,950
We're looking for a suspect on the run.

103
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,119
May I check your trunk?

104
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,849
What? Kang Chul is here?

105
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,270
I'm not sure. My shift just started.

106
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,231
-Let me see your guest list.
-Sure.

107
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,489
-Which room is it?
-Room 209.

108
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,124
-Who is it?
-It's the police.

109
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,170
-What is it?
-We're looking for a murder suspect.

110
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,381
-Please excuse us.
-Sure.

111
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:48,184
Who is it?

112
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,437
It's the police.
We need to search your room.

113
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,149
-What is it?
-Please excuse us.

114
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:14,919
Thank you for your cooperation.

115
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,587
Which room is next?

116
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,464
Room 213.

117
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,910
What is this? There is no Room 213.

118
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,246
Maybe there was a mistake.

119
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,003
Second floor is clear.
We're going up to the third floor.

120
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,325
MEDICAL SUPPLIES

121
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,080
Hang in there. Just hang on.

122
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,666
What if you can't remember
because you were drunk?

123
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,252
Are you...

124
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,880
suspecting me right now?

125
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,675
I want to know the truth.

126
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,428
Mr. Son.

127
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,639
It wasn't me.

128
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,934
It wasn't me.

129
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,888
Yeon-joo.

130
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,765
Is that you?

131
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,437
Answer me.

132
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:45,731
Where are you?

133
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,919
Come to your senses and get up.

134
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,880
I can't go there right now.

135
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,051
So you need...

136
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,178
to treat your wounds yourself.

137
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:17,763
Please get up.

138
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:35,697
Who are you?

139
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:41,995
Are you Oh Yeon-joo?

140
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,331
When did you get out?

141
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,421
Dad?

142
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,585
Dad.

143
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,343
So this is where he works?

144
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,345
Let's go in.

145
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,975
Wait.

146
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,239
Yeon-joo?

147
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,284
-Excuse me?
-Yes?

148
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,077
We just met.

149
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,705
Isn't it too much to hold hands like this?

150
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,334
-I...
-Let's take it slowly.

151
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,462
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

152
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,466
I'm sorry.

153
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:30,891
Yeon-joo?

154
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,934
Yeon-joo...

155
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,563
Gosh.

156
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:40,025
I thought something bad
had happened to you.

157
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,319
Are you okay? Is your lip okay?

158
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,031
How is Mr. Oh?

159
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,326
I put him to bed and locked the door.
I had no choice.

160
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,674
This is a great work room.

161
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:11,890
It's Kang Chul.

162
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,404
Is this the bathroom?

163
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,420
He became quiet
when I turned off the power.

164
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,380
Why?

165
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,509
Maybe he loses contact
with the killer when you turn it off.

166
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,885
I think so.

167
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,221
I'm not sure, though.

168
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,850
What do we do with Mr. Oh?

169
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,854
I'm trying to make it a dream again
like last time.

170
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:01,148
Dream? A Dream?

171
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:04,943
That's right.
We should make everything a dream.

172
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,737
How about going further back?

173
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,283
Something like ten years ago
before Chul's family died.

174
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:15,120
Let's make it a dream he had
before the killer had appeared.

175
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,205
Then we would be rid of him
from the start, wouldn't we?

176
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:18,373
But...

177
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,750
I can't turn this on.

178
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:23,211
What if the killer is just waiting
for me to turn this on?

179
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:25,964
We can't draw anything with it right now.

180
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,633
What else can we do, then?

181
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:30,927
Hello?

182
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,433
Wow, so this is her father's office.

183
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:40,770
Where's Yeon-joo?

184
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,564
She's right here.

185
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,107
Where?

186
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,449
What?

187
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,743
What is this?

188
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,078
What?

189
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,543
Wait, Seok-beom.

190
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,922
That's not what I meant. Wait, Seok-beom.

191
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,091
CHANGMIN PARTY

192
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,593
Oh Yeon-joo?

193
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,970
Is Oh Yeon-joo her real name?

194
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,099
Who is this Oh Yeon-joo?

195
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,101
Why did he run away with her?

196
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,772
HAN CHEOL-HO

197
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:28,360
Really? Then we should look for her first
to catch that punk.

198
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,865
What goes around comes around.

199
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,868
It means that heaven
is on the side of justice.

200
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,996
It also means that the world
is still going the way it should be going.

201
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,833
I told you that Kang Chul
was a psychopath.

202
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,379
That's right.

203
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,508
If Chul gets arrested,
the process will take too long.

204
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,928
He is better off being shot dead.

205
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,100
It will be even better
if he leaves a repenting suicide note.

206
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,228
Who are you?

207
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,773
Why are you here?

208
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm sorry.

209
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,026
Hey!

210
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,242
-Who is that woman?
-Pardon?

211
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,911
Have you all lost your mind?

212
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,205
Why did you let her in?

213
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,499
What are you waiting for? Go get her!

214
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,417
Yes, sir.

215
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,869
What's going on?
Why was I in Han Cheol-ho's office?

216
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:01,995
Why Han Cheol-ho?

217
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,873
Is it because he's looking for me?

218
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,251
Did he pull me into this world?

219
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,546
Are you Oh Yeon-joo?

220
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,341
When did you get out?

221
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,010
Then last time,

222
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,721
it wasn't Chul who drew me in,

223
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,431
but the killer?

224
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,809
The main character isn't
the only one who can pull me in.

225
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,353
Why all of a sudden?

226
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,114
-Did you catch her?
-We lost her.

227
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,327
How could no one notice
someone coming into my office?

228
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:43,620
I'm sorry, sir.

229
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,793
Who is she?

230
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,763
What's this?

231
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,518
Oh Yeon-joo?

232
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,733
What's today's date?

233
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,193
It's the 22nd.

234
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,404
What time is it?

235
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,615
It's 11 p.m.

236
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,078
Do you know what happened to Kang Chul?

237
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:26,704
Kang Chul?

238
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,289
Yes, I haven't seen the news.

239
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:30,959
He fled after killing someone.

240
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:32,669
He hasn't been caught yet.

241
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,130
Thank you.

242
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,511
If it's 11 p.m.,

243
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,180
only two hours have passed.

244
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:25,263
Welcome.

245
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:29,309
Pardon me, but what's today's date?

246
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,853
Today? It's the 22nd.

247
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,396
It's the 22nd?

248
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,107
It was the 22nd before, too.

249
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,442
Pardon?

250
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,695
Is it September 22nd?

251
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,530
Yes.

252
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,034
A month passed already.

253
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:51,915
Do you know what happened to Kang Chul?

254
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:52,874
Kang Chul?

255
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,710
Yes. I haven't seen the news
because I was abroad.

256
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,921
They're still searching for him.

257
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,965
It's been a month, but they haven't
caught him yet. That persistent asshole.

258
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,759
I heard a rumor that he died somewhere.

259
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,469
Some say he got shot
when he was running away.

260
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,095
He can't die that easily.

261
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,057
Someone like him should be taken to trial

262
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,725
so he can rot in prison forever.

263
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,644
-I'd like to pay.
-Okay, sir.

264
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,241
About 300 members
of the Citizens' Coalition for Justice

265
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,744
gathered in front
of the WBN Office requesting

266
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,372
for the broadcasting station
to close down.

267
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,084
-Under Kang Chul's management, WBN--
-Jeez.

268
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,712
I'm sick of the news.
It's always about Kang Chul.

269
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,298
I hope they'll stop talking about it.

270
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,509
It's not even good news.

271
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,971
How could a person do such a thing?

272
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:50,098
He shot his father.

273
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,766
He shot his mentor.

274
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:56,104
He's thick-skinned enough to pretend
to be a protector of justice and a hero.

275
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:28,761
Are you there?

276
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,226
Answer me. Are you there?

277
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,939
I heard a rumor that he died somewhere.

278
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,774
Some say he got shot
when he was running away.

279
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:43,962
Aren't you going down?

280
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,217
Join me. Have a drink.

281
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,428
This is the last day.

282
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,806
Let's celebrate.

283
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,319
He must have died.

284
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,990
He must have.

285
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,035
Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to
endure it this long.

286
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,704
What is he planning to do?

287
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,333
He must have either died
from the gunshot wound

288
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,211
or jumped into a reservoir somewhere

289
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,381
because he lacked the courage to show up.

290
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,885
It has to be one of the two.

291
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,637
Right?

292
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:45,982
If he really just died,

293
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,652
then that's so cruel.

294
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,530
How could he not even leave a message?

295
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:55,992
Do-yoon.

296
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,253
-Someone is here.
-Who?

297
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:08,838
Oh Yeon-joo.

298
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,841
I saw her that time. It is her.

299
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,801
She wants to meet you.

300
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:15,845
Where is she?

301
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,413
Ms. Oh?

302
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,252
-Yes.
-Are you really Oh Yeon-joo?

303
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,922
You were in the car with Mr. Kang.

304
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,549
Right.

305
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,927
The police were looking for you.
Why did you just come now?

306
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,388
-There was a reason.
-Why did you come to me?

307
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,307
I was wondering...

308
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:06,104
if you knew what happened to Kang Chul.

309
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,482
I haven't seen him since that day.

310
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,611
I was wondering
if you have any news about him.

311
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:17,740
How would I know where he is?
Even the police can't find him.

312
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,955
What's your relationship with him?

313
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,961
Nothing...

314
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:32,922
at all.

315
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:37,093
I'm just curious

316
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,680
whether or not he's alive.

317
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,891
Is he still alive?

318
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,561
I'm worried that he may be dead.

319
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,651
He was badly hurt when I last saw him.

320
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,864
I shouldn't have left him like that.

321
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,284
We ran out of medicine, so...

322
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,513
SINORI VILLAGE HALL

323
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,141
Go there.

324
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:27,768
I'll make a call.

325
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:32,440
Mr. Kang has been looking for you.

326
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,402
He is...

327
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,363
alive?

328
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,160
Also, I have a favor to ask.

329
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:47,455
I don't know
what your relationship with him is,

330
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,916
but please persuade him
to turn himself in.

331
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,877
There is no other option.

332
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,880
To reduce his sentence,
he has to turn himself in soon.

333
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,841
I can't help him any longer.

334
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,095
Please persuade him.

335
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,147
Who is she?

336
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,359
Hotel staff.

337
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,291
SINORI VILLAGE HALL

338
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,814
SINORI VILLAGE HALL

339
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:57,692
Ma'am, is this Sinori Village Hall?

340
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,818
It is.

341
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,727
Oh Yeon-joo.

342
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,190
Long time no see.

343
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:42,695
Get in.

344
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,839
How have you been?

345
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,094
I'm glad to see a familiar face.

346
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,391
Say something, will you?

347
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,810
I'm excited to finally have
someone to talk to.

348
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,691
I thought...

349
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,777
you were dead.

350
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:25,905
No way.

351
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,784
You explained
how to treat myself so clearly.

352
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,747
Come to your senses and get up.

353
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,792
I can't go there right now.

354
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,711
So you need to treat your wounds yourself.

355
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,505
Please get up.

356
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,270
COME TO YOUR SENSES AND GET UP

357
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,232
There were no antibiotics,
so I couldn't give you a shot before.

358
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,525
Get the antibiotics first.

359
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,495
You have to inject that into your vein.

360
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,205
Do as I say.

361
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,106
When I examined you earlier,
the bullet was lodged very deeply.

362
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,275
It'll hurt, but you have to
take it out yourself.

363
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,888
Close your wound.

364
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,518
And you're done.

365
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,520
You did great.

366
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,372
How dare you get drunk
and give me an attitude? You little brat!

367
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,459
I said I won't stand it
if you hit me again.

368
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,211
Honey, please stop!

369
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,712
Chul, stop it.

370
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,798
You punk. Get out and never come back.

371
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,550
I don't need a son like you!

372
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,011
I can't believe I've raised him--

373
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,930
Honey!

374
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,308
I said I won't stand it
if you hit me again.

375
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,018
Honey, please stop!

376
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:05,439
-Chul, stop it.
-You punk. Get out and never come back.

377
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,566
I don't need a son like you!

378
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,652
I can't believe I've raised him--

379
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,654
Honey!

380
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,180
The whereabouts of Kang Chul
who shot and murdered Son Hyeon-seok,

381
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:05,809
the former director of Channel W,
is still unknown.

382
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,355
Everything he has done to uphold justice

383
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:14,068
turned out to a charade to hide his crime.

384
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:16,612
The public is enraged.

385
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,238
Meanwhile--

386
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,067
I'm losing my mind.

387
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,914
After you left,
I moved from place to place.

388
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,833
This is the fifth place.

389
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,886
What took you so long?

390
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,389
You acted like you'd be back soon.

391
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,435
You told me you'd figure out a way.

392
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,020
That's why I thought you'd be back soon.

393
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,065
There was a reason why I couldn't.

394
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:36,900
What's the reason?

395
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:48,203
It looks like you couldn't
figure out a solution.

396
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,373
You only said it to console me.

397
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,626
I got my hopes up.

398
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,587
I thought you knew something.

399
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,549
I wondered why you were so sure
I was framed when everyone suspected me.

400
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,343
I thought, "Is she a secret agent?

401
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,430
Does she know the killer?

402
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,224
Is she the killer's friend?

403
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:11,685
Is she the killer's daughter?"

404
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,194
Why did you look for me
without a solution?

405
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,822
I was worried.

406
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:29,703
I felt bad about leaving you
there alone that night.

407
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,957
Has your husband returned yet?

408
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:40,422
Do you miss a man's touch? Is that why
you kissed me and then took off?

409
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,176
Because I look like your husband?

410
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:47,930
"A man's touch"? How can you say that?

411
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:51,350
You haven't eaten dinner, right?
Let's buy something to eat first.

412
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,601
I don't have food in my place.

413
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,191
You have nowhere else to go.

414
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,903
You have no money or a place to go,
and you don't know anyone.

415
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,906
That's why you have to mooch off
a fugitive.

416
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,575
Am I wrong?

417
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,328
You're right.

418
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,207
I don't have money, but I'll take you in.

419
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,501
I owe you my life.

420
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,843
You don't have other clothes, right?
I'll buy you some.

421
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,346
I'm fine.

422
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,308
I have to buy you clothes. I want to.

423
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,201
Aren't these better in a place like this?

424
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,078
It's just tacky. I like it.

425
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:55,831
Pick something you like.

426
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,877
It's embarrassing,
but I can't buy you expensive clothes.

427
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,088
I do have a lot of money,

428
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,674
but I don't have access to it now.

429
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,596
How is this?

430
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:14,224
Well...

431
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,226
It's 5,000 won. It's cheap.

432
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,771
We both have no money, so let's be frugal.

433
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,735
If I could, I would buy you
a dress worth three million won.

434
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,278
Just so you know.

435
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,913
I can't show my face,
so you have to pay for it.

436
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:44,963
-How much is this?
-It's 5,000 won.

437
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,673
You picked a nice one.

438
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:08,403
It's too hot. Let's cool off.

439
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,490
Where's my change?

440
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,410
I can't waste any money.

441
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:17,329
Let's go.

442
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:26,588
It's good.

443
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:29,466
How is yours?

444
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:33,637
It's vanilla.

445
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,263
Give me a bite.

446
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,186
I don't like it. Mine tastes better.

447
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:43,397
Try it.

448
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:50,862
Isn't mine better?

449
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,033
What's wrong with you?

450
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,120
-What do you mean?
-You're a fugitive on the run.

451
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:00,122
You've been on the run for a month.

452
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:04,418
Besides, do you even know who I am?

453
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,463
You don't know me, but you let me
stay with you and bought me clothes.

454
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,091
You're having ice cream instead of
thinking about clearing your name.

455
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,551
What are you thinking?

456
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,971
Are you going to just idle your time away?

457
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,766
People go crazy if illogical things
keep happening.

458
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:25,105
Consider me crazy.
I can't think about anything.

459
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:31,069
I did everything I could for a month,
but there was no solution.

460
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,488
Now I have two choices.

461
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,533
Keep running until I get caught
or turn myself in.

462
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,452
After that, it will be a fight in court.

463
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:41,413
I'll be stuck in prison forever
either way.

464
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,667
I think this is my fate.

465
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:49,421
No matter how hard I try,
the result is the same.

466
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,467
Maybe I'm destined to have a sad ending.

467
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,935
We did two things, right?
We shopped and ate ice cream.

468
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,604
Let's go grocery shopping now.

469
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,283
Shall we get some snacks?

470
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:29,711
Have you tried this?

471
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,421
Let's get it.

472
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,385
Strangely, I have a huge appetite
now that I have someone to eat with.

473
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,179
Shall we get a watermelon, too?

474
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,531
I'll make you spaghetti.
Do you like cream spaghetti?

475
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:03,286
You can't cook.

476
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,873
Who says I can't cook?

477
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,254
You're right.
I can't, but I studied online.

478
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,924
I didn't have much to do, and I wanted
to cook for you once you did appear.

479
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,676
What?

480
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,179
Go wash.

481
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,267
The bathroom is that way.

482
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:35,694
Did we do four things now?

483
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:38,572
Two more and I'm done
with today's homework.

484
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,585
Grocery shopping.

485
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,754
Cake.

486
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,924
Going shopping.

487
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,979
Do you like it with a lot of bacon?

488
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:12,898
What did you just say?

489
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,024
What?

490
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,194
You said something about homework.

491
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,032
-Oh, that.
-What do you mean by that?

492
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,328
The homework to do ten sweet things a day.

493
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:29,205
You said your husband disappeared
after doing only four.

494
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,668
I wanted to do them
on behalf of your husband

495
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:35,754
since you saved my life.

496
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,175
You said your husband looked like me.

497
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,095
Isn't that why you're following me?

498
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:50,018
How did you know?

499
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,772
I never mentioned anything about homework.

500
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:56,858
I read it.

501
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:58,944
From where?

502
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,365
Where did you read it?

503
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,338
Here.

504
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,426
You know this webtoon, right?

505
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,430
Your face says you know it well.

506
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,849
I read it in here.

507
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:33,395
Your husband disappeared
after doing four sweet things.

508
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,607
He's so mean.

509
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,944
How could he do that to a woman
after marrying her?

510
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,710
There's no way out.

511
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,296
I looked at everything, but there's
no proof that it was fabricated.

512
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:03,717
Chul.

513
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,970
Turn yourself in. There's no other way.

514
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,266
Have you looked into Oh Yeon-joo?

515
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,936
She did hang around the Department
of Cardiothoracic Surgery for a week,

516
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,022
but no one knows who she is.

517
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,190
Also,

518
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,027
Han Cheol-ho is also looking for her.

519
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,656
-Why?
-He wants to take his chance.

520
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,992
He rummaged through everything.

521
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:31,745
There was nothing left for me to find

522
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,580
except for this one thing.

523
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:45,717
It's a comic book which mentions
Oh Yeon-joo, so I brought it.

524
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:48,928
I haven't read it closely yet.

525
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,270
I thought I should give it
to Kang Chul when I see him,

526
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,272
but then, that happened.

527
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,357
It's a comic book.

528
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:02,942
Kang Chul is the main character.

529
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,111
There's also a character
named Oh Yeon-joo.

530
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,206
I'm so sleepy.

531
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:23,546
What's this?

532
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,050
Chul.

533
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,011
How are you?

534
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:33,306
Yeon-joo.

535
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,394
-Are you going to sleep?
-Yes, for ten minutes.

536
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,321
Code Black, Code Black emergency.

537
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,032
Shooting victims will arrive soon.

538
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,326
There are too many victims
for the ER to handle.

539
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,579
Doctors of all departments
who are not on duty...

540
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,207
I thought this comic book was yours.

541
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:01,000
Am I wrong?

542
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,506
You wouldn't show up,
and I had nothing to do here,

543
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,175
so I read this over and over.

544
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,469
I even memorized the lines.

545
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,184
I wasn't interested in it at first.

546
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:21,813
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

547
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,690
SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE!

548
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,488
OH YEON-JOO...
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

549
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,369
YEON-JOO?

550
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:42,625
ANSWER MY QUESTION.
YOU WILL REGRET IT.

551
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,613
YOU COULDN'T SHOOT ME, TO BEGIN WITH.

552
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,092
The story was fun and interesting.

553
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,055
I felt bad for Kang Chul,
but he also seemed foolish

554
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,765
just like me.

555
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,269
That's why I didn't turn myself in.

556
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,355
So I could meet you.

557
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,525
I was going to ask you what happens next.

558
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,654
I couldn't go to prison
without finding that out.

559
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,118
Have you read the book after this one?

560
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:01,955
What happens...

561
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,666
to Chul and Yeon-joo next?

562
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:09,921
So?

563
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,424
Does Chul forget Yeon-joo forever?

564
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,052
Answer me.

565
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,014
Is your husband
who suddenly disappeared...

566
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,105
me?

567
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,516
Do you remember me?

568
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:07,353
Let's go on dates like other couples.

569
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,314
Give me a chance to catch up.

570
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,442
You're no longer the main character.
You're a murderer and a fugitive.

571
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:13,735
You'll disappear soon.

572
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,570
There is only one solution.

573
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,698
Proceed with the story your father
and I had planned from the beginning.

574
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,908
Promise me something.
Draw something for me.

575
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,036
Do you want me to make it a dream again?

576
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:25,538
All I have to do
is wait for you to disappear.

577
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:28,166
It's time that we use
the variables to our advantage.

578
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,585
From now on, I'll summon myself.

579
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:35,965
