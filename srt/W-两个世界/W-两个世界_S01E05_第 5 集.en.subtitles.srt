1
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,041
Chul's entire family is murdered...

2
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,628
and Chul is falsely charged for it.

3
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,964
But eventually, he is found not guilty.

4
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,508
After ten years,

5
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,803
he becomes super rich
with a net worth of 800 billion won.

6
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,724
He starts W Broadcasting Station to
find his family's killer.

7
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,811
One day, he is attacked
by an unidentified man.

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,901
A woman suddenly appears
and saves his life.

9
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,860
"Oh Yeon-joo."

10
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,695
Where are you right now?

11
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:13,239
But she disappears leaving behind
her business card.

12
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,450
-Please let me in.
-No, you can't--

13
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,410
Every time Chul's life is in danger,

14
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,038
-Yeon-joo shows up and saves him.
-Are you okay?

15
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,874
What do you mean by the world I live in?

16
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,918
The world inside a cartoon.

17
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:29,631
And you are
the main character of that cartoon.

18
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:35,929
Chul realizes that he is
the main character in a cartoon.

19
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,348
And in that moment,

20
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,850
Chul's world comes to a stop.

21
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,686
What's wrong with this?

22
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,499
Chul steps into the real world.

23
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,099
WILL CHUL BE ABLE TO FIND OUT
WHO KILLED HIS FAMILY?

24
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,039
-Hey, are you crazy?
-Do you have a death wish?

25
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,167
Watch where you're going!

26
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,712
-That bastard!
-What is he doing?

27
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,675
-Shit.
-What's wrong with him?

28
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,514
-What are you doing?
-Get off the road!

29
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,177
KANG CHUL, THE MAIN CHARACTER

30
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:23,638
YOON SO-HEE, CHUL'S FRIEND
AND PERSONAL ASSISTANT

31
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,473
SEO DO-YOON, CHUL'S BODYGUARD

32
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,608
He must shoot within 75 seconds.

33
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:39,237
-He looks really nervous.
-He needs to clear his mind.

34
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:43,533
-Three, two, one...
-He must shoot!

35
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,827
-It's 10.9!
-It's 10.9!

36
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,287
-It's 10.9 points!
-It's 10.9!

37
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,497
-Kang Chul scored 10.9!
-He came from behind to win!

38
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,499
I'm home.

39
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,175
Mom?

40
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:14,063
Dad...

41
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:48,473
We have all this evidence.
You can't stay silent forever.

42
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,020
People with early success
always cause problems.

43
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,900
Tell me. Did you learn shooting
to kill your family?

44
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,666
What are you looking at?
You sick psychopath!

45
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,212
I STRONGLY URGE THE COURT TO GIVE
KANG CHUL THE MAXIMUM PENALTY...

46
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:22,340
YOU CRAZY BASTARD!

47
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,926
HOW IS THIS YOUR CONCLUSION?

48
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,025
FORMER PROSECUTOR, HAN CHEOL-HO...

49
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,945
Former prosecutor Han Cheol-ho
entered politics today

50
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,863
as he joined the Changmin Party.

51
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,408
"Rebuild the social justice system
that has collapsed."

52
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,911
That is the mission
the nation has given me.

53
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,539
And I will fulfill my duty

54
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,208
for the sake of the nation.

55
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,389
-What? What are you talking about?
-Please take a look.

56
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,015
CONGRESSMAN HAN CHEOL-HO

57
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,020
Kang Chul is the co-CEO.

58
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,816
I expected him to be an alcoholic
who ended up dead in some alley.

59
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:25,778
It looks like he continued his studies
after dropping out of school.

60
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,281
He's been hiding his name
to avoid the press.

61
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:31,367
We confirmed that it was him
after the company went public yesterday.

62
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,577
What a crazy world.

63
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,830
He's a murderer who should
rot in prison forever,

64
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,832
but he's now a company CEO.

65
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:47,550
Go.

66
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,099
Do-yoon.

67
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,485
Why do you want to learn from me?

68
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:09,071
I heard you were the best.

69
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:11,782
-I like people who are the best.
-But why?

70
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,785
With your wealth, you can hire
a slew of bodyguards.

71
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,915
Money can't always protect you.

72
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,168
Besides, it looks like I'll be
surrounded by enemies from now on.

73
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,545
Let's do it.

74
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,381
Should I put these on?

75
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,848
-Good, again. One, two.
-One, two.

76
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,141
Dodge. Dodge again.

77
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,352
Dodge.

78
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:42,188
Go. That's right.

79
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,398
Go lower. Good.

80
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,734
You can do it. Go again.

81
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,819
-Go!
-Good.

82
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,282
That was good.

83
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,826
-You jerk!
-How dare you?

84
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,998
Come here, you punk!

85
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,501
CLEAN COMPUTER ART ACADEMY

86
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,548
-Hey!
-You punk.

87
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:19,058
Last night, gang leader
and wanted criminal, Park Eun-hyeong,

88
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,435
was arrested by the police.

89
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,064
It was revealed that the criminal
had evaded police arrest,

90
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:29,694
but was caught by Kang Chul,
the CEO of JN Global.

91
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,363
This is a video of the scene
taken by someone who was there.

92
00:09:32,446 --> 00:09:36,200
FOOTAGE OF KANG CHUL'S MERITORIOUS DEED

93
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,078
He's just putting on an act!

94
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,913
Even so,

95
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,082
people are praising him.

96
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:48,796
Kang Chul is solving cases
that even the police have given up on.

97
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,423
Furthermore,

98
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:54,343
he's funding the lawsuits for the victims.

99
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:58,889
Mr. Assemblyman, he's basically buying
the public with money.

100
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,601
He's the real criminal.
There's no doubt about it.

101
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,604
-That's why I prosecuted him.
-Mr. Han.

102
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:08,065
You shouldn't get upset. Stay calm.

103
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:12,737
As Chul's popularity grows,
your support rate is dropping.

104
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,822
They are inversely related.

105
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,701
In the last two years,
the number of people who believe

106
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,537
you conducted a witch-hunt against Chul

107
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,080
rose to over 80%

108
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,500
This is no time to get upset.
You must establish countermeasures.

109
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,842
You're the face of our party.

110
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,386
You should consider

111
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,182
what will happen to us

112
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,018
if Chul finds the real killer.

113
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,066
How can he find the true killer?

114
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,818
Kang Chul is the true killer.

115
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,198
Excuse me, sir.

116
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,450
Are you all right?

117
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,496
We're closed for the day.

118
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:47,498
We have to lock up.

119
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,460
Does this book

120
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,171
sell well?

121
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,714
Pardon?

122
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,342
Is it popular?

123
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,262
Of course. It's been
a bestseller for over five years now.

124
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,101
I see.

125
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,188
That's funny.

126
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,073
I'll bag them for you.
Please wait a moment.

127
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,411
That's not necessary.

128
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,288
I already know the story.

129
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,837
IF I HEAR THAT ONE MORE TIME,
I MIGHT GET SWAYED.

130
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,400
PARK SU-BONG

131
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,695
Hello? What happened?

132
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,031
I called a technician,
but he said there's nothing wrong with it.

133
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,700
There's no problem with the server either.

134
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,870
Is everything okay with you?

135
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,246
I'm at the hospital.

136
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,374
I just left the workroom.
I'm too scared to be there alone.

137
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,711
It felt like it was haunted.
I'll go back once Mr. Oh returns.

138
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,088
Alright then.

139
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,843
Dr. Oh, you have room three.

140
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,386
Okay.

141
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,528
Yeon-joo.

142
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,446
Did you...

143
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,325
Did you get engaged?

144
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:47,910
Engaged?

145
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,703
What nonsense is that?

146
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,456
Someone claiming to be your fiancé
came to see you.

147
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,832
My fiancé? Who?

148
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:58,170
He didn't give his name. He just said
you'd know if I said he was your fiancé.

149
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,173
He must be confusing me with someone else.

150
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,508
He's not, right?

151
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,803
How could I be engaged
when I'm not seeing anyone?

152
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,388
Right, that's true.

153
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,265
Is he drunk?

154
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,516
Anyway, good luck.

155
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:34,290
OPERATING ROOM

156
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,041
I think you might be mistaken.

157
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,335
I think you have the wrong person.

158
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,630
Seok-beom.

159
00:14:58,814 --> 00:15:00,065
Do you know each other?

160
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,276
Yes.

161
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,627
Have you been well?

162
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,298
I wondered how you were
after the jailbreak.

163
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:25,841
You look good.

164
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,179
How...

165
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,723
Did I get pulled in again?

166
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:36,143
It can't be. This is definitely
the hospital where I work.

167
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,478
Even Seok-beom is here.

168
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,438
I came here.

169
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,067
I came out...

170
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,402
into your world.

171
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,448
How?

172
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,075
How did you come here?

173
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,287
The world I live in stopped.

174
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,206
What?

175
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,084
Everything stopped.

176
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,627
Except for me.

177
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,298
That's why I escaped
and left everything behind.

178
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,260
I don't know why
I'm the only one who survived.

179
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,515
Maybe because
I'm the main character as you said.

180
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,519
Maybe it's a privilege
the main character gets.

181
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,692
I read all 33 volumes of W
with all the money I had.

182
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,403
Now I'm convinced

183
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,323
as to how you knew me so well.

184
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,453
You must have been a fan.

185
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,914
You watched me for seven years after all.

186
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,004
Do you know...

187
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,257
how much I'm regretting it now?

188
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,013
I should have listened to you back then.

189
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,682
Answer me.

190
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,559
I can't.

191
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,438
I told you.
You'll become miserable if I do.

192
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,692
I didn't imagine...

193
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,405
the truth would be like this.

194
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,658
I should have listened to you.

195
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,622
I understand now

196
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,917
that it was for my sake
that you didn't say anything.

197
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:25,961
I came here

198
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,714
because I wanted to say goodbye.

199
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,181
Thank you so much

200
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,932
for being considerate of me.

201
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,645
You're a very good person,

202
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,856
and you're qualified to become
a good doctor.

203
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,994
Dr. Oh, Professor Park is here.

204
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,496
I'll be right there.

205
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,208
You're busy. Go back in.

206
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,918
Are you going somewhere?

207
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,963
Where are you going?
Just wait here for me.

208
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,050
It's not a big operation,
so it will be over soon, okay?

209
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,219
Don't do anything and just stay here.

210
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,471
Think of me as your guardian
and wait for me.

211
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,766
Are you trying to act like me?

212
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,977
It's because you don't have anything.

213
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,271
You don't have money,
a place to stay, or an ID.

214
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:31,777
I know well how lost you must feel.

215
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,405
And I'm really a doctor in this world.

216
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,701
Sure, I can't compare to you,
but I have money and a home.

217
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,370
Just trust me and wait

218
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:43,831
until I come out.

219
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,292
Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.

220
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,420
All right?

221
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,299
Please do as I say.

222
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,312
It won't take long.
I'll finish in 40 minutes.

223
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,257
Why did you do that?

224
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,553
After I finished reading all the books,

225
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,056
I'm 99 times unhappier than before,

226
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,642
but one good thing came out of it.

227
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,146
I always felt that
I was at a disadvantage,

228
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,398
but I read everything
you thought and felt as well.

229
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,822
So don't try to act shy
and say things you don't mean.

230
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,504
Wait here.

231
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,760
If something happens while I'm gone,

232
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,720
look for Dr. Kang Seok-beom
of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

233
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,265
He'll help you if you say
you're my friend. Okay?

234
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,517
The guy from a while ago?

235
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,396
He acted sassy when I told him
I was your fiancé.

236
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,398
He's not your boyfriend, is he?

237
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,858
I told you I don't have a boyfriend.

238
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,038
Sorry I'm late.

239
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:35,794
The name Oh Yeon-joo is the problem.
Everything with that name is doomed.

240
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,296
Look at W for instance.

241
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,298
Ever since that
Oh Yeon-joo character appeared,

242
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,049
it has been going downhill.

243
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,885
It's not just going downhill.
It's going down the Himalayas.

244
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:46,013
And the other Oh Yeon-joo is about to ruin

245
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,432
the great Myungsei's
cardiothoracic surgery department.

246
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,185
-You're dead. See you after the surgery.
-Sorry?

247
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,022
Okay.

248
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,529

ANESTHESIA: 24 MINUTES

Excuse me. Hello? Wake up!

00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,035
Can you hear me?

258
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,288
-Please let me in.
-No, you can't--

259
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,874
Oh, no. Please.

260
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,419
Are you okay?

261
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,140
I am one of those people

262
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,809
who want your life to have a happy ending.

263
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,397
I'm your fan. I swear.

Good work, everybody.

266
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:16,176
-Good work.
-Good work.

267
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,805
-Where are you going?
-Pardon?

268
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,807
Did you forget that
I was going to dismiss you?

269
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:26,061
-I didn't forget.
-So where are you going? Come here.

270
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:29,314
Right now? There's someone
waiting for me outside.

271
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,693
Assume position in one, two...

272
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,405
Hey, you've always

273
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,617
been bad and thoughtless,

274
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,372
but when I thought about it,
you started getting smart with me

275
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,791
precisely after I said I was a fan of W.

276
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,503
That's when you started
to get really smart with me.

277
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,089
How dare you use your father
to your advantage?

278
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,759
It's not like that.

279
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,552
What do you mean it's not like that?

280
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,805
And since it's out,
I'll get this off my chest, too.

281
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,308
I'm so stressed these days because of W.

282
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,268
What's up with your father?

283
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,439
Why is there romance when they
should be busy looking for the killer?

284
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,733
What's going on?
It's like he's forgotten the genre!

285
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,236
That can happen, can't it?

286
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,785
-What did you just say?
-How can people work all the time?

287
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,870
I think that's more unrealistic.

288
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,706
Even a hero can fall in love.

289
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,750
No matter how important his revenge is,

290
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,169
there must be a moment
when he's blinded by love.

291
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,963
Chul is human, too.

292
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,299
Are you upset
because I insulted your father?

293
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,136
-No, sir.
-Besides, that's not love.

294
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,637
It's just a fling.

295
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,433
Chul and that girl with your name
are just having a fling.

296
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,809
It could be love, too.

297
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,812
-Why are you so sure it's not love?
-What?

298
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,940
How can you think of that as just a fling?
I didn't see it that way.

299
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:56,776
Hey. What have they done?

300
00:28:56,901 --> 00:29:00,613
Chul never said anything to her.
Has he ever told her that he loves her?

301
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:04,826
Do you have to say it out loud?

302
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,244
How would she know otherwise?

303
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,246
How would she know?

304
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,916
I know how,

305
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,045
-but I won't tell you.
-Wait! Spoiler alert!

306
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,548
You must have heard something.

307
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,217
Is that right? Don't tell me

308
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:23,845
that girl will end up with Chul.

309
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,056
No. Stop it!

310
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,727
That's craziness! That cannot happen!

311
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,645
Why is that crazy?

312
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:35,106
-It can happen, too.
-Does it make sense?

313
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,525
He needs to marry Yoon So-hee.

314
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,652
Why? Why does he have
to marry Yoon So-hee?

315
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:42,530
They've been friends
for almost ten years since high school.

316
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,784
-It's obvious they should marry.
-No, it's not obvious.

317
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,077
Do you have to get married
if you're together?

318
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,580
Why do you think Chul likes So-hee?

319
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:55,001
Okay, I see. It's obvious
that So-hee has a big crush on Chul.

320
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,086
It was mentioned many times.

321
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,964
But there isn't a single scene

322
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,258
suggesting that Chul sees So-hee
as anything more than a friend.

323
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,219
I remember everything.

324
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,638
Do I have to vocalize it?

325
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,724
Even if he doesn't say it,
it's meant to go that way.

326
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,975
It's obvious.

327
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:15,271
"So-hee, I didn't realize until now,
but the person I truly love is you."

328
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:18,024
He professes his love,
they kiss, and that's the end.

329
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,902
-It's like a formula!
-There's no formula in human feelings!

330
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,822
Why do you judge Chul however you want?

331
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,114
You don't even know him well.

332
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,242
Chul likes me.

333
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,785
That is a fact.

334
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,500
Dr. Oh.

335
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,421
Chul likes you?

336
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,715
No.

337
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,219
I mean the character with my name.

338
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,889
You have the same mental age
as my daughter.

339
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:54,435
My daughter in junior high
acts just like you. Like a fangirl.

340
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:57,272
Should I introduce you to her?
Would you like to meet her?

341
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,857
No, thank you.

342
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,067
Why not? You would share
a deep friendship.

343
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,654
Professor, I'm so sorry, but I have
something very urgent to attend to.

344
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,197
Can you scold me later?

345
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,408
I'm not scolding you.
You're the one who raised your voice.

346
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,534
I'm sorry!

347
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,830
Yeon-joo, where are you going? Yeon-joo!

348
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,713
Where did he go? I told him to stay here.

349
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,497
I understand now

350
00:31:57,165 --> 00:32:00,001
that it was for my sake
that you didn't say anything.

351
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,086
I came here

352
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,881
because I wanted to say goodbye.

353
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,432
DAD

354
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,478
The person you have reached
is not available.

355
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,026
Dad, where are you?

356
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:26,796
PARK SU-BONG

357
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,131
Sir, where are you?

358
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,092
It looks like Yeon-joo got dragged
into the cartoon again.

359
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,847
This is Park.

360
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,559
Is the one you sent me this morning
the final draft?

361
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,185
The content seems a little strange.

362
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,605
Since you're not responding,
I uploaded it.

363
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:45,857
PARK SU-BONG

364
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,192
Sir, have you read the new chapter?

365
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,862
Yeon-joo is safe,
but I can't deal with the story.

366
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,905
Please call me.

367
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,201
YEON-JOO

368
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,579
Dad, where are you?

369
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,458
YEON-JOO

370
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,715
Mr. Oh Seong-moo?

371
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,202
Hello, Dad? Where are you?

372
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,788
Hello?

373
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,458
It was you.

374
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,715
I had a feeling it was you.

375
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,722
We've met several times now.

376
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,141
You remember, right?

377
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,980
Please come.

378
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,816
We have a lot to talk about.

379
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,241
How...

380
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,077
How did I come to this world?

381
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:25,706
You should explain that to me.

382
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:28,167
I thought you created me.

383
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,381
Come here.

384
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,147
Have a seat.

385
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,585
Dad!

386
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,907
Get up.

387
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,170
Be grateful to your daughter.

388
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:57,798
I'm going easy on you because of Yeon-joo.

389
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,802
While you were determined to kill me,

390
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,430
your daughter worked hard to save me.

391
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,289
Hello?

392
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:32,500
Su-bong, where are you?

393
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:35,628
I'm at an Internet cafe,
just killing time.

394
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:39,382
Hurry over to workroom.
I think something bad is happening.

395
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,800
Something bad?

396
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,928
Chul went to Dad.

397
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,098
What? What are you talking about?

398
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,766
Chul is here.

399
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,726
He is with Dad right now.

400
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,311
What are you...

401
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,980
Chul is here?

402
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,357
Run to the workroom now!

403
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,318
Go and tell Chul to wait.
Tell him I'll be right there.

404
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,947
Tell him to wait and do nothing
because I need to talk to him. Okay?

405
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,119
Hello, Yeon-joo? That's... Yeon-joo?

406
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,581
Chul... Chul is here?

407
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,542
Why did he come?

408
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,546
Sir, please shut down computer number 35!

409
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,782
You're bleeding.

410
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,162
I guess you're not immortal in this world.

411
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,831
You're an ordinary human being.

412
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,708
You get hurt and bleed.

413
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,463
This is how it's supposed to be.

414
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,131
It's fair this way.

415
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,468
It's so unfair that I was the only one
who bled and got hurt.

416
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,060
Yeon-joo wasn't the first person
I grabbed after being stabbed.

417
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,355
It was you.

418
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,878
Help me. Please help me.

419
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,716
Please call an ambulance.

420
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,084
Let's stop.

421
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,758
Let's stop this now.

422
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,852
The stabber didn't fatally injure me.
It was you.

423
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,775
Then your daughter appeared and saved me.

424
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,822
Nobody knew

425
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,534
there were two people who stabbed me.

426
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,665
I kept quiet as I had no evidence,
but I could tell instinctively.

427
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:25,918
The person who wanted to kill me
without rhyme or reason

428
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:27,086
was you.

429
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,258
I didn't even know who you were then.

430
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,475
You must have created me here.

431
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:44,853
With your pen in hand,

432
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,356
you thought of ways to kill me here.

433
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,943
Now that you have money, honor
and success, you don't need me anymore.

434
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,279
You created me and made me suffer.

435
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,532
You became successful by making
my life a roller coaster ride.

436
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,410
Then you wanted to kill me,
so you stabbed me,

437
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,620
injected me with poison,
and hit me with a truck.

438
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,250
Drawing it wasn't enough,
so you stabbed me yourself.

439
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,169
I asked for mercy,
but you stabbed me coldly and cruelly.

440
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,261
While I was waiting,
I did a research on you.

441
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,598
You're so popular

442
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,642
that you're all over the Internet.

443
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,647
-Stop drinking.
-I don't want to drink either.

444
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,191
I'm only drinking
because I'm so miserable!

445
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:32,818
-You drink because you're miserable?
-Yes.

446
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,195
Then I should double what you're drinking!

447
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,866
-Go ahead and drink. Drink.
-I'm sick of this.

448
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,701
I'm sick of it all too.

449
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,537
That's enough already!

450
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:45,581
Oh Seong-moo was an incompetent
head of the family.

451
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:51,545
He was a cartoon artist
who had never succeeded even once.

452
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,758
You couldn't live without alcohol
and had no will.

453
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,302
You felt inferior
like a loser all the time.

454
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,763
On top of that, you were old.

455
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,018
That's why you created me.

456
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:09,521
Someone young, successful,
wealthy, and famous.

457
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,231
Someone with a strong will.

458
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,068
A strong man
who is the complete opposite of you.

459
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:21,116
That's why you named me "Kang Chul,"
which means steel.

460
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,826
It was written in an article.

461
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,458
You wanted to live vicariously
through me to escape reality.

462
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,211
However, it didn't last long

463
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,838
because your wife finally left you.

464
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,051
You immediately fell into depression.

465
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,969
You've always been like that.

466
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,224
You have an inferiority complex,
lack confidence, and give up easily.

467
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,401
That's why you killed me...

468
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,738
unlike your original plan.

469
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:03,117
You made me commit suicide
because you weren't brave enough to do so.

470
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,291
Because the only thing you could control

471
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,752
was me.

472
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,550
That's when things started going wrong.

473
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,638
I kept having the same nightmare.

474
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,309
A nightmare of drowning in the Han River.

475
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,793
I wondered what it was.

476
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,673
I guess I was really dead

477
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,968
before you changed your mind and saved me.

478
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,303
I didn't save you.

479
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,347
You resisted death.

480
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,809
I actually

481
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,229
killed you there, but you resisted.

482
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,440
You pleaded with me to save you.

483
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,196
That's why I saved you

484
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,156
because I felt pity.

485
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,909
I was fond of you then.

486
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:29,912
And that was the problem.

487
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,457
From then on, you became a monster

488
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,083
like you are now.

489
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,962
You're right. I gave you everything.

490
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,883
I gave you everything
that I wanted to have,

491
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,052
but what happened?

492
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,764
You tried to learn about this world
with the brain I created.

493
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,143
It makes no sense.
You're nothing but a drawing!

494
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,770
You're not even human,

495
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,897
but you kept tormenting me.

496
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,066
And now, you show up here!

497
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:03,779
Sometimes, the pen moves on its own.

498
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,490
When I wake up in the morning,

499
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,575
I find a completely different drawing.

500
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:13,247
At first, I went to a psychiatrist
because I thought I had lost my mind.

501
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,001
Do you think I've lost my mind?

502
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,838
No, it's because you're always drunk.

503
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,632
You're not a child anymore.

504
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:27,261
I talked to my friends about it,
but nobody believed me.

505
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,744
I tried to run away
because I was so scared,

506
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:58,667
but I couldn't.

507
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,380
Because of Yeon-joo.

508
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:10,721
Dad.

509
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,275
I did...

510
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,696
nothing for her while she was growing up.

511
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,203
Yeon-joo, come here.

512
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,127
I'm sorry.

513
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,390
I told myself to keep working

514
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,060
because people liked my work

515
00:48:58,185 --> 00:48:59,394
and it made money.

516
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,115
If I earn a little more,

517
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:16,787
I could open up a hospital for her
and help her not worry about money.

518
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,381
Do you think you're
the only one who had nightmares?

519
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,425
I had a nightmare every night too!

520
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,637
A nightmare that you would come
to me like this.

521
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,724
It was hell to continue until now,

522
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:41,144
but I persevered
because I knew it would end soon.

523
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,772
That was my only light and hope,

524
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:46,316
that I won't have to
draw you anymore once I finish.

525
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:50,654
Yet you didn't die!
You pulled me into your world.

526
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:54,074
You even pulled Yeon-joo in,
which was why I stabbed you.

527
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,576
I didn't think
this curse would end otherwise.

528
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,749
You're just an illusion.

529
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,878
You're nothing.
You're just a character I created.

530
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,715
So why did you show up here

531
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,008
and act like you're human?

532
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:16,722
Why are you continuing the story
by getting my daughter involved?

533
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:21,935
You're just a character, understand?
Just something I created!

534
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,442
You want to shoot me?

535
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,819
Go ahead.

536
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,654
Do you think you can shoot me?

537
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,366
No, you can't shoot me.

538
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,994
Do you know why?

539
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,998
Because you're a character
who can never commit murder.

540
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:47,461
I made you a righteous man.

541
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:50,547
A man of morals who abides by the law.

542
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:55,594
Even when you take revenge,
it has to be lawful.

543
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,889
That's why you became a hero

544
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,766
and people like you.

545
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:06,229
You're a guy who can't shoot
a helpless and unarmed old man

546
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:09,232
just because you're angry.

547
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,234
That's who you are.

548
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,987
That's your character.

549
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,203
Do you think you're here by your own will?

550
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,537
By your free will?

551
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:26,291
No. It was all set up that way.

552
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,128
I made you into a person
with an unusually strong will.

553
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:34,674
You have the will to endure
and get through any hardships.

554
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,430
The problem was,
I took it a little too far.

555
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:42,891
I gave you such strong will

556
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:47,312
that you can even overcome death
even if you don't accept it.

557
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:48,939
However,

558
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:52,400
even that will is my creation.

559
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:58,073
You've never strayed
from the character I gave you.

560
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,120
Shoot me if you want to.

561
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:06,581
Dad, stop it.

562
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,209
Please don't say anything.

563
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,336
Can you shoot me?

564
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,423
Shoot me!

565
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,760
Sit and draw the ending
you originally planned.

566
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:06,016
You changed your initial plan
and made me commit suicide.

567
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:08,977
Everything went wrong
after I refused that.

568
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,398
If you follow the original plot,
I'll accept it.

569
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,859
Then everything will go back to normal.

570
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,944
Don't you agree?

571
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,699
My friends are still there.

572
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,036
Do-yoon?

573
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,957
They're neither dead nor alive.

574
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,254
I can't leave them so miserably like that.

575
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,299
That happened only
because you popped out of the cartoon.

576
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,176
Stop looking for reasons
and look for a solution.

577
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,720
Just draw and put everything back.

578
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,598
I don't know anything.

579
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:51,227
-What do you mean?
-There's nothing I can do.

580
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,439
I can't even end it the way I want.

581
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:58,777
The story continues
only when you accept it.

582
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,488
You know
what kind of ending I would accept.

583
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,156
It's simple.

584
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,034
Catch the real killer
and make him pay for what he did.

585
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:09,079
And I want to live a normal life.
That's all.

586
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,332
Just tell me who the real killer is.

587
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,294
As you said, my will to find the suspect
is so strong that I can't even die.

588
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,420
I even ended up here.

589
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,424
Draw the real killer's face

590
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,426
so that I can remember it.

591
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,431
Draw it.

592
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:47,492
I don't have it.

593
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,411
What?

594
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,121
There is no real killer.

595
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,125
It was just an initial set-up.

596
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,467
It was a set-up to make
the main character stronger.

597
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:07,470
Mom?

598
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,016
It's a common set-up for a hero cartoon.

599
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,978
A shocking trauma from his youth.

600
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:20,233
Oh, Victory Korea

601
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:25,530
Even I don't know who the killer is.

602
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,286
Are you...

603
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,039
serious right now?

604
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,917
You can only become a hero
if things don't get solved.

605
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:43,006
If you catch the criminal,
the story will simply end there.

606
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:48,011
If you're happy, why would you bother
to go through all that?

607
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,766
That's why there's no clue.

608
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,270
It never existed.

609
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,194
You don't know?

610
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,990
There's no killer?

611
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,955
You killed my entire family.

612
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,627
You framed me and put me in jail,
yet you don't know?

613
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:25,632
They died before my eyes.

614
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:30,303
They died miserably in front of me.

615
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,847
My parents and my younger siblings.

616
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,850
I saw the bodies with my eyes,
but there's no shooter?

617
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:42,273
Sir, please hurry up. Hurry.

618
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,652
I see.

619
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,156
That's why

620
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:52,575
you tried to kill me.

621
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,954
There could never be a happy ending.

622
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,997
If this never happened,

623
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,084
you would've continued to draw this
and enjoyed your success.

624
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:04,379
Meanwhile, I would be suffering
from insomnia every night

625
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,549
and get hurt every day
chasing a killer I can never catch!

626
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,635
I would go suffer endless pain
and repeat the same things.

627
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:14,973
Do you have...

628
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:18,601
any idea what I went through?

629
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,608
You wouldn't be able to
withstand any of it,

630
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,404
but I went through it countless times.

631
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:33,533
You drew like you were a god
with those fingers.

632
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,327
You took no responsibility.

633
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,876
I still remember every painful moment.

634
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,670
That's how fiction is.

635
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,214
It's my job as an author.

636
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,301
No.

637
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,638
You're not just an author.

638
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:01,060
You saw me alive and breathing,
but you tried to kill me anyway.

639
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:03,730
That's your true nature.

640
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,441
You're a brutal and abusive man.

641
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:09,903
It didn't show because you were
holding a pen instead of a knife.

642
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,826
You're a son of a bitch on the inside.

643
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,370
You might as well have committed murder.

644
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,335
No!

645
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,170
No! No, please!

646
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:48,107
Mr. Oh!

647
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:07,919
Mr. Oh!

648
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,005
Mr. Oh!

649
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:18,263
Think of a solution.

650
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,183
Do whatever it takes.

651
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,479
Figure it out before I come back.

652
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,114
Consider yourself lucky.

653
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,409
It's not that I'm lucky.

654
00:59:41,953 --> 00:59:44,122
You couldn't shoot me to begin with.

655
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:47,292
That's how you were written.

656
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,957
Why did you save Chul back then?
You should've let him die.

657
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,544
This happened
because you saved him that night.

658
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,255
This is the most logical ending
for the main character

659
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,633
who became a murderer
while searching for a murderer.

660
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:22,261
If it says "the end" in the cartoon,
what happens next?

661
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:25,556
What does "the end" really mean?

662
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,434
Please save Chul. Please save him.

663
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,186
He can still be saved.

664
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,522
