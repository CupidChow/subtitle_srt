1
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,207
Shall we take a look at a different event
from the 2004 Athens Olympics?

2
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,919
-We have good news from Shooting.
-That's right.

3
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:47,672
The finals for the Men's 50m Pistol
is currently going on

4
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,591
at the shooting center.

5
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:53,636
Kang Chul, from Korea,
is doing surprisingly well.

6
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,806
-He's young, but he's doing very well.
-You're right.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,933
He's only in his junior year
of high school.

8
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,353
I think we can expect him
to overcome the pressure

9
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,231
-and win a gold medal.
-That's right.

10
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:09,903
With hope for a gold medal, we'll take you
to the shooting center right now.

11
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,492
We're here at the Markopoulo
Olympic Shooting Center.

12
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,496
The final round for the Men's 50m Pistol
has already begun.

13
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,749
Kang Chul from Korea is aiming
for the gold medal.

14
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:25,835
Whereas he placed fifth in qualification,

15
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,547
he's currently leading the finals
after seven shots.

16
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,481
Honestly, we didn't expect Kang Chul
to be in the running for the gold medal.

17
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:50,193
The athletes next to him are ranked
first, second, and third in the world.

18
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:55,031
That's right. It's his first time
on the national team.

19
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,033
This is his very first
international event.

20
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:02,956
The 17-year-old is doing a great job
against the top shooters from the world.

21
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,666
I wonder if he can repeat

22
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,295
the historical moment by Yeo Kab-soon
in the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.

23
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,840
He's been performing very well so far.

24
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,154
Okay, this is the eighth shot.

25
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,460
It's 10.2. He scored 10.2.

26
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:51,045
The best in the world,

27
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,172
-Asimov, scored 9.5.
-Good job!

28
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,593
It will be difficult for Asimov
to catch up.

29
00:02:56,676 --> 00:03:00,096
Yes, but Kang Chul shouldn't
celebrate yet.

30
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,974
-He must remain calm until the end.
-That's right.

31
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,393
Stay calm and focus.

32
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,980
It looks like his coach is also
telling him to remain calm.

33
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:13,109
Kang Chul's coach, Kang Yun,
is also his father.

34
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,027
Is that so?

35
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,738
He taught him shooting
to help build concentration,

36
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,156
and he got this far in three years.

37
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,949
He must be gifted

38
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,118
-and inherited his father's talent.
-Yes, I agree.

39
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,830
Now, it's Kang Chul's ninth shot.

40
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,303
Oh, no. What happened?

41
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:42,472
He missed by a lot.

42
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,308
He only scored 7.9.

43
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,770
He made a critical mistake
on the ninth shot.

44
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,898
Asimov from Ukraine scored 10.2.

45
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,483
He scored 10.2.

46
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,487
-That means...
-Asimov is in the lead by 0.2.

47
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:58,738
Yes, right.

48
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,700
Asimov's total score is 653.4,
while Chul's total score is 653.2.

49
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,869
The difference between them is a mere 0.2.

50
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,289
Their final shots will determine
who takes home the gold.

51
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,084
Asimov's long experience
is shining through in the end.

52
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:14,712
Will Kang Chul's lack of experience
hold him back?

53
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,049
You may be right. This is his first
international competition after all.

54
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,133
Last shot. Focus.

55
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:22,387
-But he's more than capable.
-That's right.

56
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,681
-He must focus until the end.
-Right.

57
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,077
The tension is high.

58
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,163
This is the tenth and final shot.

59
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,005
It's 10.4.

60
00:04:57,588 --> 00:05:01,592
Asimov has scored 10.4.

61
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,470
Asimov is indeed a very skilled player.

62
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,889
This means in order to win the gold medal,

63
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,602
Kang Chul must score higher than 10.7.

64
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,076
Kang Chul is still just aiming
at the target.

65
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:31,039
He must shoot within 75 seconds.
He looks really nervous.

66
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:34,792
-He needs to clear his mind.
-Chul. Shoot.

67
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:36,753
Shoot.

68
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,338
Honestly, it's already a huge achievement

69
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,007
-that he made it this far.
-That's right.

70
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,468
All the other athletes already
took their shots,

71
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,012
but Kang Chul hasn't taken his yet.

72
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,431
He needs to shoot now.

73
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,476
It has been 55 seconds already.

74
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,603
He looks very nervous.

75
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,314
He needs to shoot now.

76
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,329
-He should at least get the bronze.
-That's right.

77
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,914
He only has five seconds left.

78
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,707
Five, four,

79
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,376
-three...
-He must shoot!

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,378
...two, one.

81
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,340
He took his shot.

82
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:26,260
He shot with one second left on the clock.

83
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,220
The result is...

84
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,488
-It's 10.9 points!
-It's 10.9!

85
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,201
-Kang Chul scored 10.9!
-He came from behind to win!

86
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,369
You did it!

87
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,621
He came from behind
and won the gold medal!

88
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,791
You won the gold. Good job.

89
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,836
-He won the gold medal!
-Awesome!

90
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,295
Isn't he just 17 years old?

91
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:04,382
Players tend to lose their calm
under great pressure,

92
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,175
but he did it!

93
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,345
You got the gold medal! You did it!

94
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,431
With just one second left,

95
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,891
he hit the target with great accuracy.

96
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,644
A new star has been born today.

97
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:21,274
KANG CHUL WINS GOLD
FOR MEN'S 50M PISTOL

98
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,443
He did an excellent job.

99
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,821
Now, he is

100
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,908
passing the ball further inside.

101
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,660
-It's working now.
-Okay.

102
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,872
-Now, he's breaking through...
-There's an opening.

103
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,165
Go. Pass.

104
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:38,916
-Kick it over there!
-Go.

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,711
-Go!
-Pass.

106
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,255
-Shoot! Go between them!
-Right there.

107
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:47,425
-No, not there.
-Oh, no.

108
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,844
-That way!
-Score!

109
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,471
-It's going up.
-Do it!

110
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,222
-That way.
-Oh, gosh.

111
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,474
Shoot!

112
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,018
-Oh, no.
-What was that?

113
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,270
Is that you, Chul? Why are you so late?

114
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,273
Where have you been?
You missed this important match.

115
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,816
It's almost over.

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,195
He is dribbling the ball further inside.

117
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,072
He broke through the defense.

118
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,116
Let's do it. Go.

119
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,827
-Do it!
-They just missed

120
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:18,331
a critical chance to score again.

121
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,917
-Honey.
-Shoot!

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,378
-Shoot already!
-The defense isn't there.

123
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,633
-Do it!
-Just one more goal.

124
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:31,802
I hope they can pull themselves together

125
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,430
and score just one more goal.

126
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,848
Here he comes. Goal!

127
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,975
-Oh, my god!
-Please.

128
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,353
-Oh, no.
-Please!

129
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,104
-Shoot!
-Oh, no.

130
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,778
-Do it!
-Shoot!

131
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,992
They are doing great.

132
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,914
There goes Ahn Jung-hwan.

133
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,500
Ahn Jung-hwan shoots! Goal!

134
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,757
GOAL

135
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,008
Ahn Jung-hwan!

136
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,762
For our first news item.
Two days ago, we reported

137
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,640
that an entire family in Sangdo
was shot and murdered.

138
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,102
The police named Athens Olympics
gold medalist

139
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,397
Kang Chul, their son,
as the prime suspect.

140
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,606
Park Sang-min.

141
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,526
I am at Seoul Dongjak Police Station.

142
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:33,239
Former national athlete, Kang Chul,
was arrested for murdering his family.

143
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,909
KANG CHUL ARRESTED
FOR HIS FAMILY'S MURDER

144
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,413
The National Shooting Team's coach,
Kang Yun, his wife Yoon Mi-ho,

145
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,290
their daughter Su-yeon, and son Jun-seok

146
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:47,336
were found shot to death in their
living room on the morning of the 15th.

147
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:51,716
While investigating Kang Chul,
who was not home at the time,

148
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,386
the police found many suspicions
regarding his whereabouts that day.

149
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,054
Go, Korea!

150
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, Victory Korea

151
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:02,602
Oh, Victory Korea

152
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,938
In addition to that, the murder weapon,
a pistol,

153
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,357
was found in the trash
500 meters from the crime scene.

154
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,654
The gun used in the crime
is a 5.56mm caliber Swiss-made pistol.

155
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:19,118
On it, we found the victims' blood
and Kang Chul's fingerprints.

156
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,662
The police confirmed that the gun used
in the crime

157
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,666
was the same pistol used by Kang Chul
in the Olympics.

158
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,419
Yes. It is very shocking indeed.

159
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,879
So-yeong.

160
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,131
Don't many people still remember

161
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,300
the touching moment
from the Athens Olympics?

162
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,928
I can still remember him running
into his dad's arms like a little boy.

163
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,015
If Kang Chul really did murder his family,

164
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,017
what do you think his motive was?

165
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,020
Although his motive is still unclear,

166
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,563
according to the people close to them,

167
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,899
there had been a conflict
between the father and son

168
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:54,278
after Kang Chul quit shooting
and decided to study computer science.

169
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,489
Well, that still doesn't fully explain

170
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,618
why a famous Olympian
would murder his family.

171
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,912
That's right. Because of that,

172
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,666
there's a strong public protest
against the prosecution's hasty arrest.

173
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,001
Two people saw you by the back door.

174
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,961
How would you explain that?

175
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,385
You had a fight with your father
a week before the incident.

176
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,514
Then you told your friends while drinking
that your father annoyed you

177
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:25,601
with his constant nagging,
and that you wished he was gone, correct?

178
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,729
No, I didn't. No.

179
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,730
Is that right?

180
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,526
I'm sure you wanted to move out.

181
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,111
Yes.

182
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,072
You must have.

183
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,157
Didn't you?

184
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,162
Even so,

185
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,666
you shouldn't shoot your father to death.

186
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,794
You shot your mom,
who tried to stop you too.

187
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,423
You lost control
and you shot everyone to death.

188
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,385
What? Were you too scared to die
after you killed them?

189
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,597
You ran away, came back, and cried
in front of your parents' pictures.

190
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,308
Do you know what people call
bastards like you?

191
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:07,685
A degenerate.

192
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,563
You should be permanently expelled
from this society.

193
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,523
And that is my job.

194
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,275
Do you understand?

195
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,623
Chul.

196
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,879
The prosecutor on your case, Han Cheol-ho,

197
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,922
is an ambitious man.

198
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,883
He's hoping to go into politics.

199
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,178
He's trying to score big with your case
since you're famous.

200
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,305
You got really unlucky.

201
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,308
Also,

202
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:52,438
we already held the funeral
since we couldn't postpone it any longer.

203
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:59,361
We buried everyone in a sunny field,

204
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,864
so don't worry.

205
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,160
Be strong.

206
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:10,039
We're doing everything we can.
Hang in there.

207
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,228
Considering the time
and means of the crime,

208
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,522
it's hard to say
that it was a crime of passion.

209
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,191
Murdering one's own family
under a carefully designed plan

210
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,610
is a terrible and shocking crime
that breaks moral laws.

211
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,531
Moreover, the accused
is a renowned athlete.

212
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,658
Since he is an icon for the youth,

213
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,537
this incident is incomparably
shocking to society.

214
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:53,165
In order to alert society to the danger,

215
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,209
I strongly urge the court...

216
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:59,964
to give Kang Chul
the maximum penalty allowed by law,

217
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,675
the death penalty.

218
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,304
-Well said.
-Hang that bastard!

219
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,809
You're a monster!

220
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,018
Die!

221
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:14,812
Punish him!

222
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,488
Chul.

223
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,156
You crazy bastard.

224
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,533
How is this your conclusion?

225
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,828
How is this your conclusion?

226
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,496
You bastard!

227
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,590
Hey, answer your phone.

228
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:28,636
Hey.

229
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:32,264
Seok-beom, it's your phone.

230
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,267
Hey.

231
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,649
I need to sleep!

232
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,860
MAD DOG

233
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,737
Hey. It's Mad Dog.

234
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,285
You're dead meat.
Your phone rang more than ten times.

235
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,790
Hello, Professor Park. This is Seok-beom.

236
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,041
-Hey!
-Yes, sir.

237
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,293
-Answer your phone, you idiot!
-No, it's...

238
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,045
-Where's Yeon-joo?
-Yeon-joo?

239
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,798
She's right next to me.

240
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:10,094
I'm not sure why she won't answer
her stupid phone.

241
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,472
-Yes, sir. Okay.
-Ouch!

242
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,307
That hurts!

243
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,184
He's looking for you.

244
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,560
Dang it.

245
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,771
10 MISSED CALLS FROM MAD DOG

246
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,902
Hey, why is my phone on silent?

247
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,447
If he called you ten times,
and you didn't answer, he'll murder you.

248
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,325
-Why is he looking for me?
-I don't know.

249
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,868
-Oh no.
-Good luck.

250
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,791
-Hello.
-Hello.

251
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,296
-Oh, my.
-Yes?

252
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,631
-You have drool on your face.
-What?

253
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,924
-Where's Professor Park?
-Sorry?

254
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,051
-Professor Park.
-I don't know. The drool...

255
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,648
Oh, no.

256
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,900
He's not going to kill me, is he?

257
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,069
Gosh, please.

258
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,629
-Where's Professor Park?
-He's not here.

259
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,847
-Have you seen Professor Park?
-He didn't come down here.

260
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,808
Aren't there any patients
for our department?

261
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,143
No, there aren't.

262
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,395
What is it, then?

263
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,079
Professor Park, it's Oh Yeon-joo.

264
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,039
Come in.

265
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,508
Do you realize
how long it took you to come?

266
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,635
-Do you have a death wish?
-I'm sorry.

267
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,386
I didn't know you were here.

268
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,597
I called like crazy,
but you wouldn't pick up.

269
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,681
Don't you have any respect?

270
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,434
-Do you think you can ignore my calls?
-I'm sorry.

271
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,937
It will never happen again. I'm so sorry.

272
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,232
Is your father Oh Seong-moo,
the cartoonist?

273
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,027
-Pardon?
-They say you're his daughter.

274
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:32,945
I didn't know that.

275
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,655
Yes, he's my father.

276
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,157
-Really?
-Yes.

277
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,701
-That doesn't make sense.
-Pardon?

278
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,205
Your father is the great Oh Seong-moo.
How can his daughter be...

279
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,250
just Yeon-joo?

280
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,214
I'm sorry that I'm just Yeon-joo.

281
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,799
Do you live with your parents?

282
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,468
No, I live with my mom.

283
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,554
-What about your father?
-My parents got divorced.

284
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,639
Is that right?
So you don't see your father often?

285
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,391
I see him from time to time.

286
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,645
But why are you asking me these things?

287
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,063
-I really--
-Give me a spoiler.

288
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,816
-Sorry?
-You see,

289
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,819
I'm really into this these days.

290
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,362
Your father's comic.

291
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,489
It's so much fun.

292
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,199
Of course, I knew it was a hit,

293
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,660
but webtoons are awkward,
so I didn't read it.

294
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,370
But I hear it's ending this week,

295
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,415
so I rushed to a bookstore

296
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:29,334
and bought the books.
All 33 volumes. Look.

297
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,962
It was so tough.

298
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,423
I stayed up two whole nights
to read these.

299
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,757
Why is it so fun?

300
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,761
Was this the reason

301
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,680
-you called me?
-You know what?

302
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,765
I love the main character.

303
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,226
This punk Kang Chul is very tenacious.

304
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,436
I am a man,

305
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,273
-but even I think he's cool.
-He's cool from a woman's perspective too.

306
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,567
-Are you his fan too?
-Of course, I am.

307
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,068
Who wouldn't like Kang Chul?

308
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,029
He's handsome, talented, well-mannered,

309
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,032
and his eyes are... He's so sexy.

310
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,580
I'm sorry. I went too far.

311
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,832
Gosh.

312
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,418
High-five.

313
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,631
I'm glad to meet another Kang Chul's fan!

314
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,258
I didn't know you were his fan!

315
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,095
Since when did you like W?
You should've told me.

316
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,473
You should've told me
that he was your father.

317
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,392
-My dad will be thrilled.
-Gosh.

318
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,352
Professor,

319
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:29,895
please sign this.

320
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:31,396
By the way,

321
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,732
who is the real murderer?

322
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:36,151
I'm not sure about that either.

323
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,487
It's ending this week,
but it still hasn't been revealed.

324
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,821
Didn't your father tell you?

325
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,199
My father never talks about the story.

326
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,409
-Not even to his own daughter?
-No.

327
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,246
Just bring me a spoiler.

328
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,082
I know her father. He's very strict.

329
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,333
Yes, he is.

330
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:55,087
You've never opened up
a chest during surgery, have you?

331
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,965
I'll let you open up a chest.

332
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,718
-Really?
-Find out who the murderer is.

333
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,224
But my father will never tell me.

334
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,644
-You can close it too.
-I will get you a spoiler right now!

335
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,855
If you lie because you want
to open up a chest, I'll kill you.

336
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,815
Don't worry.

337
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,192
Don't worry.

338
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,448
-Professor.
-Yes?

339
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:26,785
-I don't think it's fair.
-What isn't?

340
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,537
Even senior residents
haven't opened up a chest.

341
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,538
Is that right?

342
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:32,666
If you're bitter, you should have
a cartoonist father too.

343
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,215
This is awesome.

344
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,176
If I had known sooner
that he was into comics,

345
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,720
my life would've been easier.

346
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,805
Well, at least I know now.

347
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,432
Let's see.

348
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:50,976
DAD

349
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,147
No.

350
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:59,192
I'll just get in trouble if I ask.
Definitely.

351
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:01,945
PARK SU-BONG

352
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,249
-Hello? Yeon-joo.
-Is it Yeon-joo?

353
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,127
Su-bong, it's been a while.

354
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,088
-Yeon-joo, the thing is--
-You must be really busy.

355
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,467
I know you have a deadline today,
so things must be hectic,

356
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,013
but I have a favor to ask.
My life really depends on it.

357
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,016
-So don't tell Dad.
-Yeon-joo!

358
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,935
I was going to call you. Go sit down.

359
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,647
-We're in trouble.
-What do you mean?

360
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,902
Mr. Oh disappeared.

361
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,612
What?

362
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:45,989
The thing is,

363
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:50,160
he's been out of touch since last night.

364
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,038
So what?

365
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,749
He must be somewhere
drinking with his friends.

366
00:22:55,874 --> 00:23:00,003
No. I've called all his regular bars
and friends but nobody knows where he is.

367
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:03,298
He left his phone too.

368
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,176
He left his phone?

369
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,638
He left his wallet and car key.
He's gone missing.

370
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,140
Where did he go then?

371
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,727
The deadline is 4:00 p.m.,
yet he hasn't given us any instructions.

372
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,273
We don't know what to do.
He has never missed a deadline.

373
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,775
What do we do?

374
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,133
Yeon-joo!

375
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,511
-You scared me.
-Hi, Yeon-joo.

376
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,931
Hello, everyone. Any news from dad?

377
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,142
He's not back yet.

378
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:38,852
What?

379
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,075
You haven't talked to him?

380
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:57,370
I've been too busy.
It's been a while since we talked.

381
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,457
I should tell the editors.
I couldn't tell them yet.

382
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,586
Let's wait a little longer.
We still have time.

383
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,298
You know what's really strange?

384
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:12,677
We worked out there all night long,
and he never came out of this room.

385
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:23,271
Would you like some coffee?

386
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,109
Yes. At 10:00 p.m.

387
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,153
Okay.

388
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,503
We were out there all night.

389
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,338
But...

390
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:54,928
Your coffee...

391
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,270
Mr. Oh?

392
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,398
I went into his room
at exactly 10:00 p.m.,

393
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:09,276
and he wasn't there
although nobody saw him leave.

394
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,239
-Go out and look for him.
-Okay.

395
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,041
We were afraid that he fell somewhere,
so we looked everywhere.

396
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,835
Mr. Oh.

397
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,129
Where did he go?

398
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:30,964
But...

399
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,467
there was no trace of him.
Isn't that strange?

400
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,554
-Isn't that strange?
-It is. It's very strange.

401
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,141
Should I call the police?

402
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,270
It hasn't been 24 hours yet.
Let's wait a little longer.

403
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,772
Well, he might have gotten frustrated

404
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,817
and stepped outside to clear his head.

405
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,070
At night without saying anything?
Without money or his phone?

406
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,990
He's human, too.

407
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:59,492
He must be sad about saying goodbye
to the character

408
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:00,702
he's been drawing for ten years.

409
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,580
Who? Mr. Oh?

410
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:07,584
He wasn't sad at all.

411
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,628
He said he was sick of him
and that he wanted to kill him off.

412
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,672
Kill him? Kill who?

413
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:15,842
Kang Chul.

414
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:19,346
He said he was going to kill Kang Chul
in the final scene.

415
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:25,352
-He wouldn't kill Kang Chul!
-Gosh.

416
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,520
I saw it.

417
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,693
Wait a minute. Just wait.

418
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,321
Come here.
I really shouldn't show this to you.

419
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,281
Don't tell anyone, okay?

420
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,998
-What's this?
-What else? It's Kang Chul.

421
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,084
-Look. He's dead.
-Why?

422
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,629
-Why would you kill Kang Chul?
-I didn't kill him.

423
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,298
Why would he die? It doesn't make sense.

424
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,593
-Is he really dead?
-Look at all that blood.

425
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,553
How can someone survive
after bleeding this much?

426
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,554
You're a doctor.

427
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,064
We were all firmly against it.

428
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,233
I never opposed any of his ideas before,

429
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,402
but this time,
I was absolutely against it.

430
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:19,864
Seon-mi even cried.
But Mr. Oh was so stubborn.

431
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,449
Gosh.

432
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,411
He was so determined to kill him.

433
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:27,163
And brutally too.
He said that was his dream.

434
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,124
-No way.
-Gosh.

435
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:33,420
If this gets posted online,
people will go mad.

436
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,006
Everyone is expecting Kang Chul
to catch the killer and get his revenge,

437
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,801
but he ends up being killed instead.

438
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,679
Is this the killer? Who is this?

439
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,181
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

440
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,101
He drew up to this and disappeared.

441
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,146
Maybe he couldn't get himself
to actually draw it

442
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,399
-and wanted to think it over...
-No, that's not it.

443
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,942
I doubt it.

444
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,362
He was so determined.

445
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,048
I swear he was smiling.

446
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,304
He looked like he was enjoying it.

447
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:25,680
Why?

448
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,433
Why would he enjoy
drawing the main character's death?

449
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,312
How would I know? I can't read his mind.

450
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,273
Could it be

451
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:40,111
that a crazy fan somehow heard
about the ending

452
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,571
and kidnapped my dad?

453
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,281
-Like in the movie Misery?
-Exactly!

454
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,700
-Misery was about a crazy fan.
-I watched Misery.

455
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,243
Then...

456
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,455
-Then...
-We should call the police.

457
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,457
-I have a bad feeling about this.
-I'll call them.

458
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,000
I'll call them right now.

459
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:56,211
Seon-mi! Yun-hui! Give me my phone!

460
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,962
-My cell phone, quickly.
-What is it?

461
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,340
-Don't ask, and get me my phone!
-What if that's really it?

462
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,390
SECRET BEHIND HIS FAMILY'S DEATH,
INJUSTICE

463
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,561
FAMILY PROBLEMS, THE SUSPECT,
KANG CHUL, HAN CHEOL-HO

464
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,913
I won't be eaten up.

465
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,957
I will eat him up instead.

466
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,252
"I won't be eaten up.

467
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,504
I will eat him up instead."

468
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,058
What's going on?

469
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,561
Where am I?

470
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:21,689
Why am I here?

471
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,334
Excuse me. Hello? Wake up!

472
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,502
Can you hear me?

473
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,036
Why isn't it working?

474
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,622
Darn it.

475
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,502
Sir? Just hang in there a little longer.

476
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,296
What's going on here?

477
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,901
-Two main dishes--
-Excuse me!

478
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,988
Somebody call an ambulance!
A person is dying on the roof!

479
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,493
Can't you hear me?
A man was stabbed and is dying!

480
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,996
He won't last long
because he has lost a lot of blood!

481
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:00,997
Tell them to hurry!

482
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,290
Hurry up!

483
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,543
-What's going on?
-Go check it out.

484
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,711
You, call the manager.

485
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:22,810
What is that?

486
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,438
-Is he badly hurt? Who is he?
-I don't know him.

487
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,607
Shine some light here.
Is the ambulance coming?

488
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,902
-Did you call an ambulance?
-Yes.

489
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,696
There's a surgeons' conference downstairs.

490
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,115
-They're coming up now.
-A conference?

491
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,408
What is this place?

492
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,453
-Pardon?
-What building is this?

493
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,705
This is a hotel.

494
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,792
-Seoul Prime Hotel.
-It's a hotel?

495
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,710
Do you know what you're doing?

496
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,796
Let's just wait until the doctors arrive.

497
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,631
I'm a doctor.

498
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,758
Although I'm not a very good one.

499
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,805
Oh, no. What's wrong with him?

500
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,613
-I think it's a pneumothorax.
-What?

501
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:20,368
It's a pneumothorax, right? Yes, it is.

502
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,994
Yes, it is. Then I need
to make a puncture.

503
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,288
I need to make a puncture,
but I have nothing to do it with.

504
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,337
No, it's too dangerous.
You don't know anything.

505
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:35,883
Is he dying?

506
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:44,892
If I make a mistake and he dies sooner,
I'll be held responsible.

507
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,690
Whatever! Doctors in dramas just do it.

508
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,984
-They just do it.
-Are you really a doctor?

509
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:56,237
Leave him if you're not confident.
Wait for help!

510
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,615
I'm never confident.
I told you I'm not good at this!

511
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,578
But how can I just let him die?

512
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:40,364
Is he dead?

513
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,908
Is he dead?

514
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,785
This man just died!

515
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:46,913
-Is that him?
-He's dead!

516
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,585
-What's going on?
-What happened?

517
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,129
-What happened?
-Is he dead?

518
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,720
Move aside, please.

519
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,889
How is he doing?

520
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,600
His pneumothorax was tended to,
and his bleeding is under control.

521
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:09,435
-Take him to the hospital quickly.
-Okay.

522
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,395
-Move quickly.
-He should survive.

523
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,986
Mad Dog should've seen me earlier.

524
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,865
He should have seen how well Oh Yeon-joo,
the person he looks down on, did.

525
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,954
Does this mean I'm good
in real-life situations?

526
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,623
Am I a natural-born doctor?

527
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,334
-Thank you.
-Hello.

528
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,254
I'm the manager of this hotel,
Park Ho-yeong.

529
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,006
I see. Hello.

530
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:43,344
They say he would have died
if he hadn't been treated right away.

531
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:46,264
If someone had been murdered
in our hotel...

532
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,976
It's all thanks to you. Thank you so much.

533
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,102
Don't mention it.

534
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,397
I just carried out my duty as a doctor.

535
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,024
How lucky that a doctor found him.

536
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,985
He is extremely lucky.

537
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:04,156
Anyway, you'll have to give a statement
to the police when they arrive.

538
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,616
Sure, I will.

539
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,743
-May I ask your name?
-I am...

540
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,830
-It's a bit crumpled.
-It's okay.

541
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,874
I'm Oh Yeon-joo from Myungsei University
Medical Center.

542
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,378
-Are you staying at our hotel?
-No, I'm not.

543
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,714
Then what brought you up here?

544
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,549
Pardon me?

545
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:39,900
Doctor?

546
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,779
I asked why you came up here.

547
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,616
-Yes. But the thing is, I--
-Mr. Park!

548
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,911
That's Mr. Kang Chul.

549
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,499
-What?
-It's really Mr. Kang Chul, the CEO.

550
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,501
I didn't recognize him
because of all the blood.

551
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:58,919
What should we do?

552
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,088
What do you mean it's Kang Chul?

553
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,467
What the...

554
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,593
My gosh.

555
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,012
What on earth happened?

556
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:10,556
-Call his assistant's office.
-Pardon?

557
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,141
-Hurry up!
-Yes, sir.

558
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,520
-Mr. Kang, are you okay?
-What is wrong with them?

559
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,897
Who is Kang Chul?

560
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,067
Kang Chul is
dad's webtoon's main character.

561
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,360
Maybe he's a celebrity.

562
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,905
Right. There is a singer named Kang Chul.

563
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,283
Wait a second. That's Kangta.

564
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:46,384
-No, that's ridiculous...
-No. Don't try to speak!

565
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,469
We've called the company.

566
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,223
I'm so sorry. We should've protected you.

567
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,642
We tried our best, but...

568
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,062
Can't you hurry up? Be careful.

569
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:03,317
Sir, don't worry about a thing.
Just stay calm.

570
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,551
Be careful.

571
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,472
Don't worry about a thing.

572
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,349
Hurry up, please.

573
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,184
I'll take care of everything.

574
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,813
Gently. Please be careful.

575
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,565
Hey, watch out.

576
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:45,901
What is that?

577
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,820
TO BE CONTINUED

578
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,074
What is that?

579
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:55,453
What is that now?

580
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,246
TO BE CONTINUED

581
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,120
What if...

582
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,849
-What are you doing, Yeon-joo?
-Oh, my gosh! Hey!

583
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,602
-Hey.
-Why are you so jumpy?

584
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:06,232
What... What happened to me?

585
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,399
What do you mean?

586
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,860
Didn't I disappear for a long time?

587
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,696
You disappeared? When?

588
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:17,368
I mean I was in the room by myself
and you went out to call the police.

589
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,537
Yeon-joo.

590
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,830
I didn't call the police.

591
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,415
Mr. Oh is...

592
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,087
just fine!

593
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,255
What?

594
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,257
He met the deadline.

595
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,260
I don't know where he sent it from,
but he just sent it in.

596
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,804
And he saved Kang Chul too.

597
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,514
You were right.

598
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,182
He only went out to clear his head

599
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,685
because he was torn
about actually killing him.

600
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,437
I called you for nothing.

601
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,486
-He really sent it. I'll show you.
-Where is he?

602
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:56,073
He hasn't called, but he'll be here soon
since he finished it.

603
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,866
Come out now. Guys!

604
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,869
Yeon-joo.

605
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,290
Gosh, Yeon-joo. Hurry up.

606
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:06,125
Come out.

607
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,794
Gosh. Come on.

608
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,507
Have a seat.

609
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,470
Take a look.

610
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,639
Yeon-joo.

611
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:24,852
Our Chul is still alive! Cheers.

612
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,521
This isn't the ending, either.
I guess he will run it a bit longer.

613
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,856
Isn't that great?

614
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,693
-Gosh. I suddenly feel--
-Aren't you hungry?

615
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:36,530
Let's order jjajangmyeon.
Shall we have tangsuyuk too?

616
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,742
You're unbelievable.
Just eat this. Goodness.

Excuse me. Hello? Wake up!

621
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,896
SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE.

622
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,024
Somebody call an ambulance.
A person is dying on the roof!

This is crazy.

00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,853
He added a new character. A female doctor.

633
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,522
She has your name.

That is...

638
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,179
That is me.

639
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:43,907
The main character, Kang Chul.

640
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,202
Born in Seoul in 1987.

641
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,710
Co-CEO of JN Global,
an e-commerce company.

642
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,839
JN Global's total market value
is 1.5 trillion won.

643
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:03,218
Incredibly rich, with a net worth
of 800 billion won.

644
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,641
The story began 12 years ago

645
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:13,687
when the young Kang Chul won
a gold medal in the Olympics.

646
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,778
-It's 10.9 points!
-It's 10.9!

647
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:25,115
Handsome, talented, and hard-working,

648
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,367
he became a national star.

649
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:30,329
-He won the gold medal!
-Kang Chul!

650
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,415
But his entire family was murdered

651
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,375
and his life spiraled out of control.

652
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:40,380
-He was arrested as the prime suspect.
-You shot everyone to death.

653
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:46,386
The problem was,
there were no other suspects.

654
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,139
I strongly urge the court to give
Kang Chul the maximum penalty

655
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,432
allowed by law, the death penalty.

656
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,602
You crazy bastard.

657
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,395
How is this your conclusion?

658
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,162
Chul was sentenced to death
at his initial trial

659
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,998
and life in prison at his appeal.

660
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,294
Eventually, the Supreme Court found him
not guilty due to lack of evidence.

661
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,798
We find the defendant not guilty.

662
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:29,513
However, his hardship didn't end
just because he avoided being executed.

663
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,193
When Chul came home
after a year in prison,

664
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:29,698
he couldn't accept the reality
that his family was gone.

665
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,496
Isn't that him?

666
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:37,831
That will be 4,000 won.

667
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,459
He's so thick-skinned.

668
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,546
-Isn't he Kang Chul?
-No way.

669
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:45,881
I think it's him.

670
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,966
-No way.
-Come here.

671
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,509
It's Kang Chul.

672
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,220
He couldn't stand how people still
looked at him with contempt,

673
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:54,806
suspecting him as a murderer.

674
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,996
After a year of living as an outcast,

675
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,210
he decided to end his life.

676
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:36,992
In his short life, he had never imagined
that his life would end like this.

677
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,746
He was angry

678
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:42,372
and he felt hopeless.

679
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,077
In that final moment,

680
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:25,123
one thought suddenly came to him.

681
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:33,673
A come-from-behind win.

682
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:50,273
Kang Chul chose to fight rather than die.

683
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:55,237
He could not get his life back
unless he caught the real murderer.

684
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,076
Thus, he vowed to catch the murderer

685
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,663
before he dies.

686
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:49,833
The hospital stated
that Kang Chul underwent two surgeries

687
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,835
and is now in stable condition.

688
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:57,090
The hospital is crowded
with people worried about him.

689
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,677
The police are searching
for the assailant who attacked him.

690
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,347
However, they do not have
any clear leads yet.

691
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:06,391
According to the hotel manager,

692
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:08,977
the only witness claimed to be a doctor.

693
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,105
But her identity has not been confirmed.

694
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,066
The police announced that they will
do their best to find the witness

695
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:16,401
and arrest the assailant.

696
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,239
-Did you find her?
-No.

697
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,492
They searched the entire area,
but they couldn't find her.

698
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,704
She wasn't caught on any
of the surveillance cameras.

699
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,290
-Not at all?
-No.

700
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,292
That woman is a little strange.

701
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,419
She told the manager
she'd give her statement...

702
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,004
Ms. Oh Yeon-joo?

703
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,674
What? She's not here.

704
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,509
Where did she go?

705
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,929
She was gone when the police arrived.

706
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,182
She claimed to be a doctor
from Myungsei University Medical Center.

707
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:49,225
Where is that?

708
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,811
There is no such hospital in Korea.

709
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,731
So she was pretending to be a doctor.

710
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,194
Look at this.

711
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,742
"Cardiothoracic surgery resident,
Oh Yeon-joo."

712
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,869
She even made a business card.

713
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,456
But the cell number
and e-mail address are fake.

714
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,542
The police are suspecting
that this woman is an accomplice.

715
00:54:16,836 --> 00:54:18,296
I don't think so.

716
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:23,802
No, she's not.

717
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,680
How would you know that?
You don't remember anything.

718
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,723
My instincts?

719
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,687
Anyway, we have to find her.

720
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:37,983
I think that woman holds
the key to my life.

721
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,991
"The key to your life"?

722
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:52,205
That's so dramatic, it's making me cringe.

723
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,374
Find her.

724
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:56,501
They're putting together a sketch.

725
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,421
According to the paramedics,

726
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,339
she's quite pretty.

727
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:03,717
-No, she's definitely not pretty.
-They said she was.

728
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,927
If she's considered pretty,
a stray dog would be pretty.

729
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,262
Yet she's the key to your life?

730
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,514
I didn't say that because she's pretty.

731
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,141
I thought you fell in love at first sight.

732
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,393
What do you take me for?

733
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,645
The playboy of the century.

734
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:19,816
Have you seen an assistant
who is this rude to her boss?

735
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,234
Have you ever?

736
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,737
-No.
-Right.

737
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:27,615
Then how can a woman that you just met
be the key to your life?

738
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:31,995
The reason for my existence.

739
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,791
I think she is the key to find
the reason for my existence.

740
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,293
Satisfied?

741
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:42,547
This is frustrating.

742
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,549
I can tell you the reason
for your existence too.

743
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,508
Listen. It's simple.

744
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,676
Your parents loved each other,

745
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,429
-and a sperm and an egg--
-Don't make her sketch pretty.

746
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,847
We'll never find her that way.

747
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,600
And speak casually only when we are alone.

748
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,602
Yes, sir.

749
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,231
Okay, sir.

750
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,067
I will tell the police
exactly what you said.

751
00:56:02,317 --> 00:56:04,319
The woman who's the key to your life

752
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,072
is definitely not pretty.

753
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,126
She's pissed off again, isn't she?

754
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,295
Calling her the key to your life
is a bit much.

755
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,297
She must be very pretty.

756
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,549
I told you, she's not pretty.

757
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:29,344
Seriously.

758
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:34,974
"Oh Yeon-joo."

759
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,435
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY RESIDENT
OH YEON-JOO

760
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:40,980
"Oh Yeon-joo."

761
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,985
Where are you right now?

762
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,450
OH YEON-JOO
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

763
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,539
Where's Yeon-joo? Where is she?

764
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,707
There you are.

765
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,547
I understand
that your father loves you very much.

766
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:06,714
I do.

767
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,218
But how can he make you
a webtoon character?

768
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,345
How can a reader like me read it?

769
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,015
-Did you see it? Look.
-Oh, my gosh.

770
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,517
Did you see this?

771
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,103
Look. "Cardiothoracic Surgery
at Myungsei University Medical Center."

772
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:23,148
He's making it so obvious
that she's his daughter.

773
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:28,111
How can I concentrate
when a quack like you saved Kang Chul?

774
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,405
And what? Oh Yeon-joo is pretty?

775
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,365
This is crazy.

776
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,909
At that very moment,

777
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,579
I realized that I had
a violent side in me.

778
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,040
I realized that I can want to kill people
instead of saving them.

779
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,585
Professor, let's talk later.

780
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:46,004
I didn't want this either.

781
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,256
You asked your father to do this,
didn't you?

782
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:51,050
Instead of bringing me a spoiler,

783
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:53,470
you ruined a masterpiece
by putting yourself in the story!

784
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,389
-Would you please leave?
-What was that?

785
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,392
-This is not a good time.
-What are you doing?

786
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,561
-Please leave.
-Are you mad?

787
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,521
-Please.
-Are you touching me?

788
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,815
-You're touching and pushing me.
-Please get out!

789
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:07,108
Oh, my god.

790
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,614
Professor, what happened?

791
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,240
Did you see that?

792
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:17,160
She's driving me mad.

793
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,663
Come out!

794
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,123
What happened?

795
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,751
What's happening? Think, Yeon-joo.

796
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:30,798
Get it together.

797
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,938
-Hello, Yeon-joo?
-Su-bong.

798
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,941
You saw it, right?
Kang Chul is looking for me.

799
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,984
This is absurd. He's looking for me.

800
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:51,986
That's right. He's looking for you.

801
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,988
He has my business card
and is trying to find me.

802
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:56,157
That's the business card I gave

803
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,993
to the manager at the hotel.
It's my actual business card.

804
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,455
It says, "Myungsei University
Medical Center, Oh Yeon-joo."

805
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,124
That's right. "Myungsei University
Medical Center, Oh Yeon-joo."

806
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:09,170
I think that this story is taking
a strange turn too.

807
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:12,173
He's focusing
too much on that new character.

808
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,718
Where is he drawing this?
We still can't reach him.

809
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,596
My dad... My dad isn't drawing this.

810
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,431
Then who?

811
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,476
It took a life of its own
when Kang Chul survived.

812
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:29,315
Listen. He was supposed to die,
but he didn't.

813
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:31,693
And now, the story is moving on its own.

814
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,446
What on earth are you talking about?

815
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,156
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

816
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,159
I know. I don't understand
what I'm saying either.

817
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,286
I sound like a crazy person.

818
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:45,206
Kang Chul is alive.
He's alive and is looking for me.

819
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:49,043
A different world exists in W.
The world where the real Kang Chul lives.

820
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,796
Yeon-joo, calm yourself.

821
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,550
-I don't get what you're--
-I know I'm right!

822
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,847
Goodness.

823
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,735
OH YEON-JOO
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

824
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:18,031
Why are you looking for me?
What do you want from me?

825
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:23,870
Why?

826
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:27,373
How am I the key to your life?

827
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:31,336
OH YEON-JOO
WHERE ARE YOU RIGHT NOW?

828
01:01:15,421 --> 01:01:16,714
You know about it too, don't you?

829
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:19,634
You know that I saved Chul's life.
You didn't draw that, did you?

830
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,428
He's a monster.

831
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,305
So I decided to judge him.

832
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,348
Research some poisons.

833
01:01:25,598 --> 01:01:27,809
I think he's going to kill Chul again.

834
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:30,978
You can't! That's murder!

835
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,523
We finally meet, Oh Yeon-joo.

836
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:35,525
You've piqued my interest.

837
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:36,859
See you next time.

838
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,445
-Yeon-joo.
-You're fully recovered already?

839
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,490
What do you mean, "already"?
I was in bed for two months.

840
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,908
Two months have passed?

841
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,284
This is a series.

842
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,246
Do we need an incident that could lead
to the next chapter?

843
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,664
An incident! What kind of incident?

844
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,457
I was right about her.

845
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,543
She's crazy.

846
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:55,461
A madwoman.

847
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,423
I finally found it. The key to my life.

848
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,508
The editor already received
the manuscript.

849
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:01,467
What is this?

850
01:02:01,759 --> 01:02:02,969
Do as I say and take it down now!

851
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:07,390
That's why I have to end his life
right now.

852
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,148
