1
00:00:03,533 --> 00:00:05,733
What makes you like me?

2
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:07,233
I really like someone just like you

3
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,467
I truly like the way he is...

4
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,533
I'm sorry... but now...

5
00:00:13,167 --> 00:00:15,600
we won't make it if
it continues like this.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,967
The day after tomorrow is our wedding anniversary, right?
How about on that day.

7
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:21,767
We can do it just like
normal couples would.

8
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:24,967
Would you come home earlier?

9
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:29,033
Mhm... I will do my best.

10
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:38,267
Eh...

11
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:41,233
It's a man...

12
00:00:46,733 --> 00:00:49,467
That is... actually a man, right?

13
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,333
You're home now. It's pretty late.

14
00:01:09,033 --> 00:01:10,567
I once read in a book

15
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,067
the lie women tend to say the most is

16
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:16,167
"it's alright."

17
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:19,600
It's alright.

18
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,033
Dinner is ready. Let's dig in.

19
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,067
Misaki.

20
00:01:34,633 --> 00:01:35,767
Misaki…

21
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,233
You saw it, right?

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,533
What are you talking about?

23
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:44,000
You've seen it all, haven't you?

24
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,333
At this moment...

25
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,433
I'm dating a man.

26
00:01:58,067 --> 00:01:59,067
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,167
It's alright.

28
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,233
Anyway...

29
00:02:06,333 --> 00:02:07,833
we... shall have dinner first.

30
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,500
It's alright.

31
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,667
It's alright

32
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,333
I'm sorry that it happened this way...

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,167
Er...

34
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:33,367
Men lie all the time, don't they?

35
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,900
It's obvious that they are drunk
but they'd say they're not.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,167
The truth is they go for other women
but they'd say they're with men.

37
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:40,733
That's the truth, isn't it?

38
00:02:42,267 --> 00:02:43,667
It's not a lie.

39
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:47,867
So... you'd probably be drunk
and you kissed each other by accident?

40
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,067
Then you might mistake
this as you liking him.

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,500
I didn't drink anything.

42
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,200
Or...

43
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:02,333
you don't like me, do you?

44
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:05,767
It's not like this.

45
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,333
It just happened this way,
It's not because I don't like you.

46
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:09,533
Or...

47
00:03:13,133 --> 00:03:16,167
you don't treat me as a woman?

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,067
That's not the case...

49
00:03:24,767 --> 00:03:27,733
I can't do it at all
because I see you as a woman.

50
00:03:31,133 --> 00:03:32,000
Eh...

51
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:33,767
What does that mean?

52
00:03:33,867 --> 00:03:34,933
Misaki

53
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:39,333
I've liked you a lot, even now.

54
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,767
I do like someone just like you.

55
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,200
You like someone just like me.

56
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:49,833
Is that so?

57
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,490
I should've let you known it earlier, I
shouldn't have allowed it to turn out this way.

58
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,100
I'm really sorry about this.

59
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:05,400
Alright... I have to go to bed.

60
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:08,333
Good night.

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,633
Today... is our wedding anniversary...

62
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:21,967
Do you want to make love?

63
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:26,684
Just kidding.

64
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,800
"Me, My Husband and My Husband's Boyfriend"
(Episode 2)

65
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:44,767
Misaki.

66
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:52,484
Since things have
turned out like this,

67
00:06:52,968 --> 00:06:55,594
I think we shouldn't be a
married couple anymore...

68
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,067
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.

69
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,533
You're the one who cheated on me, you're
not allowed to say something like this.

70
00:07:14,133 --> 00:07:17,433
You've said that, it's not
because you don't like me, right?

71
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:21,200
Put another way...

72
00:07:23,767 --> 00:07:26,067
it's not my fault, right?

73
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,367
Then I'm the one who makes the decision.

74
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:37,667
I won't divorce.

75
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,433
I don't want to separate from you.

76
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:47,000
That's all I want to tell you.

77
00:07:58,067 --> 00:07:59,233
I got it.

78
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:17,667
What did you actually get?

79
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,133
Even though you like
someone just like me...

80
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:29,333
...so what?

81
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:37,167
(Husband Gay)

82
00:09:37,267 --> 00:09:41,133
(Learning your spouse is
gay, is it alright to divorce?)

83
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:44,100
(I want to divorce because I
learned my husband is gay)

84
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,067
(My husband is cheating on me with another guy,
I want to get divorced)

85
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:52,067
Divorce…

86
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,333
Miss Nakamishi, how's it going?

87
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,067
Eh?

88
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:06,000
Didn't you say you celebrated
your wedding anniversary?

89
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:08,367
Did the steak taste great?

90
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,667
Ah... it did.

91
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:12,633
I'm so envious

92
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:15,300
I'd like to have a marriage like yours, too.

93
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,433
Enjoy the married life like you've been,
it's so great.

94
00:10:23,467 --> 00:10:24,667
Are you alright?

95
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:26,567
Eh?

96
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,400
Are you forcing
yourself to do too much?

97
00:10:28,933 --> 00:10:30,900
Me? I'm alright.

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,300
Really?

99
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,433
You don't look great since this morning.

100
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,433
No... I'm alright.

101
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:38,333
If so, that's fine.

102
00:10:38,933 --> 00:10:41,767
You can come to me
if you've got something on your mind.

103
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,033
Thank you.

104
00:10:58,633 --> 00:10:59,567
Ah.

105
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,667
Hey, apologize to her.

106
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:05,367
Why should I? It's she who bumped into me.

107
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:08,200
Eh... Shyuuhei？.

108
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:09,700
Hey, where are you going?

109
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Hold on, just let go, Shyuuhei.

110
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,667
How can you let him get away like that?

111
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,800
Ma’am, long time no see.

112
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:34,433
I think... I still want to study
art rather than medicine.

113
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:37,133
If you want to study art

114
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:40,233
does that mean you changed your
mind to apply at an art college instead?

115
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,033
Yes.

116
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,600
But it's alright if it's not an art college.

117
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,867
Any college where I can learn art will do.

118
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,033
What are you talking about?

119
00:11:48,433 --> 00:11:51,185
Generally, now is the time to
decide which college you want to go to,

120
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:53,765
and to study hard
to achieve the goal.

121
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,700
Generally speaking, that's right.

122
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,933
But after thinking it over
I still want to study art.

123
00:12:01,033 --> 00:12:04,333
Let me tell you
normal people wouldn't think this way.

124
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,867
Your grades for the
college of medicine are As.

125
00:12:06,967 --> 00:12:09,733
But... I want to do painting.

126
00:12:10,667 --> 00:12:13,300
Or you might take painting as a hobby.

127
00:12:13,392 --> 00:12:15,859
You should hold on to the chance
to go to a good college,

128
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,933
then you can take the things
you like as hobbies.

129
00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:21,867
If you know what I mean,
just go back to rewrite it.

130
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,100
I think there's no need for everyone
to go for the same route.

131
00:12:33,767 --> 00:12:36,033
What are you talking about? Miss Misaki

132
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,533
I'm sorry for interrupting.

133
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:42,275
But something like this shouldn't
be thought of as a norm to follow.

134
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,933
We should think about the future life
of the students as well.

135
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,859
If you really have something
you want to achieve...

136
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,433
Just go for it.

137
00:12:54,633 --> 00:12:55,533
Yes.

138
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:04,167
How's going? How long since we met?

139
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:09,300
It's been three years since I graduated.

140
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:11,500
How are you doing right now?

141
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,567
I'm doing just fine.

142
00:13:13,682 --> 00:13:15,648
How about painting? Do you do painting now?

143
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:16,533
Mhm.

144
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,233
I'm an "eshi" now.

145
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:19,933
Eshi?

146
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:23,533
Doing illustration art on the internet.

147
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,100
You mean that "eshi"?
It's old-school to say so.

148
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,633
An old-school saying?

149
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:32,400
It should be called "illustrator" now.

150
00:13:32,507 --> 00:13:35,640
Ah... I am still way behind that.

151
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,133
Although I do illustration on the internet
it's not what I can count on for a living.

152
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,667
Ah... you've got some stains here...

153
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,767
Thank you.

154
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,867
That guy was really going too far.

155
00:13:50,882 --> 00:13:53,633
Shyuuhei, I really appreciate what you've done.

156
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,333
But never do it again.

157
00:13:55,433 --> 00:13:57,867
It's lucky that you are fine now, but
there're many strange people nowadays.

158
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:01,633
Why? I'm just being honest to myself.

159
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,767
Even though it's right to say so...

160
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,900
I would be suffering if I didn't do so.

161
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,633
You are still so straightforward.

162
00:14:12,733 --> 00:14:15,433
Eh... does that mean I haven't grown up?

163
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,933
Not really. It's a compliment.

164
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,167
Alright.

165
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:32,733
Ma’am, do you still remember?

166
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:33,967
Mhm?

167
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,067
It's over there.

168
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:47,100
Just as I expected.
You want to forget it for good.

169
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,767
- If I don't do so...
- Then you can't look at me properly?

170
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,433
Just as I thought so

171
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:59,467
I've stopped myself from seeing you.

172
00:15:15,433 --> 00:15:18,767
I would come here every time I got something on my mind.

173
00:15:19,867 --> 00:15:24,433
Just looking at this river,
I feel like it never stops flowing.

174
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:26,967
Then my problems won't feel so big, either.

175
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,500
I see. It turns out you'd
also be like this sometime.

176
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,407
Don't suppress yourself too much.

177
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,100
Anyone would be disappointed
when the result turns out bad.

178
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:41,467
There's no need to keep smiling...

179
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,233
It's you who just said...

180
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:53,967
don't suppress myself too much.

181
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,133
Ma’am...

182
00:15:58,967 --> 00:16:00,967
I've always liked you.

183
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,733
Is it alright to meet the
woman who doesn't love me

184
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,033
or just keep it deep in my heart

185
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:12,367
and never see you again...
I've been so confused.

186
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,333
Then...

187
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:18,967
I've made up my mind to follow my heart.

188
00:16:22,933 --> 00:16:25,333
I appreciate hearing you saying so, but...

189
00:16:25,433 --> 00:16:27,633
Don't say anything like that.

190
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:29,267
I don't want to hear it, either.

191
00:16:32,467 --> 00:16:34,633
By the way, may I go to your place?

192
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,367
Eh, of course not.

193
00:16:37,467 --> 00:16:38,333
Why?

194
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:39,933
Why are you asking?

195
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:42,300
My husband is not at home now.

196
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,567
You are my student
but you are a man after all...

197
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,967
What if I were a woman?

198
00:16:51,267 --> 00:16:52,900
What if you were not married?

199
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:56,167
Would it end the other way around?

200
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,167
Well...

201
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,733
You can just tell me I am not welcome.

202
00:17:04,067 --> 00:17:08,067
You and your husband... you
two have so much in common.

203
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:10,667
Er...

204
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,333
Why would you mention my husband?

205
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:18,167
Both of you are very naive,
thick-headed, and soft.

206
00:17:18,767 --> 00:17:22,067
You'd suppress yourselves
because you care for others.

207
00:17:23,533 --> 00:17:24,733
Only someone like this...

208
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,133
can satisfy my sexual preferences.

209
00:17:30,933 --> 00:17:33,267
What... does this mean?

210
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,133
Oh... you're back, Yuuki.

211
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:40,833
Yuuki？.

212
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,367
It really is... destiny.

213
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,633
The two people I like show up
in front of me at the same time.

214
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:02,900
Hold on...

215
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,633
What are you talking about?

216
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,333
I don't really get it.

217
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,467
- I...
- I don't want to listen to you.

218
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:17,867
Misaki.

219
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,300
Shyuuhei, save it for later.

220
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:30,533
Misaki.

221
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,667
- Misaki.
- Don't come closer to me.

222
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,367
Why...

223
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,900
Why him?

224
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:52,000
How did you get to know Shyuuhei?

225
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,233
He's...

226
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,967
He's my student.

227
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:03,167
He's... your student?

228
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,133
Why...

229
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:08,533
Why him?

230
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:10,667
Misaki.

231
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,433
You're hyperventilating.

232
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:16,033
Just breathe slowly.

233
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,567
Just breathe slowly.

234
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:25,167
Inhale, exhale.

235
00:19:25,933 --> 00:19:28,733
Inhale, exhale.

236
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:33,100
Inhale, exhale.

237
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,667
Inhale, exhale.

238
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:47,067
Inhale, exhale.

239
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,633
Inhale, exhale.

240
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,133
- How much was it before?
- It was 1,500 Yen

241
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:01,233
1500 Yen?

242
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,567
That's so little.

243
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:06,367
Sorry, I have to go now.

244
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:07,967
Alright, thank you.

245
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,667
Here you are.

246
00:20:12,733 --> 00:20:15,000
Let's talk somewhere else.

247
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,967
How about it? Here is my place.

248
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
You're Misaki's student?

249
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:39,767
Mhm.

250
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:41,967
That's correct.

251
00:20:43,633 --> 00:20:46,933
Mrs. Misaki, she's not just my teacher

252
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,967
I've always liked her, even now.

253
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:17,967
Yuuki？.

254
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,633
When did you find out I'm her husband?

255
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,467
Since I met you.

256
00:22:03,867 --> 00:22:07,367
But I've already
fallen for you by then.

257
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:09,767
So you knew I'm married
and you still decided to be with me?

258
00:22:10,433 --> 00:22:12,633
Besides, you still keep Misaki in your heart.

259
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,333
What the hell is going on...

260
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,467
I really like Yuuki.

261
00:22:30,033 --> 00:22:32,767
You and Mrs. Misaki, I like you both very much.

262
00:22:38,133 --> 00:22:39,833
I'm sorry to hurt you.

263
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:42,233
But...

264
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,933
I just want to be honest with myself.

265
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,367
Is it really correct

266
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:58,867
to just like one person at one time?

267
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:15,333
I like you.

268
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,767
(This is a work of fiction)

269
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:04,900
(Next Episode)
Is it alright like this?

270
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,433
You mean Yuuki?

271
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,333
If it's for you, I'd be happy to do so.

272
00:24:09,433 --> 00:24:10,233
Hold on...

273
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,433
I thought... I could finally live to be myself.

274
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:16,700
Next, I'm going to make love with you, Mrs.
