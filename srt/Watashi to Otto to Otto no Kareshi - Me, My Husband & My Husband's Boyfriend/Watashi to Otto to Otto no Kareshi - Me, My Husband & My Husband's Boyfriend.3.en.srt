1
00:00:05,333 --> 00:00:09,067
I've always liked you.

2
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:13,300
You and your husband...
you two have so much in common.

3
00:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,733
Why would you mention my husband?

4
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,667
Oh... you're back, Yuuki.

5
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:24,033
The two people I like
show up in front of me at the same time.

6
00:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,133
You're Misaki's student?

7
00:00:26,233 --> 00:00:28,933
I've always liked her, even now.

8
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:01,367
Excuse me.

9
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,833
Is Maki here?

10
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:05,133
You are Misaki, aren't you?

11
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,200
Misaki, here you are

12
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,500
I knew it's you.

13
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,667
Nice to meet you, I am Takigawa Daichi.

14
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,367
Alright, Daichi, step aside.

15
00:01:16,467 --> 00:01:17,333
No...

16
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,633
Sorry... we share the house here.

17
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:23,667
I see.

18
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:24,867
Misaki?

19
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,433
No worries, just stay here.

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,533
Got it? Just come in...

21
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,833
Thank you very much.

22
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,800
"Me, My Husband and My Husband's Boyfriend"
(Episode 3)

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Here you are.

24
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:48,867
Just sit down.

25
00:02:49,133 --> 00:02:50,167
Warm yourself up then.

26
00:02:51,133 --> 00:02:52,167
Thanks.

27
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,067
Of course... you were right.

28
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:28,133
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:30,567
I've been always right.

30
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:37,467
Excuse me, are you referring to Yuuki?

31
00:03:42,733 --> 00:03:44,533
Excuse me...

32
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,067
So about taking a bath...

33
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,767
I'd like to be the first one...

34
00:03:49,984 --> 00:03:53,651
You don't need to ask me for everything.

35
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,800
Just go.

36
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,000
What the heck.

37
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:59,067
He's a funny guy.

38
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,000
He's my classmate from high school.

39
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,267
We weren't so close back then.

40
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:05,933
One time, we met each other at a reunion

41
00:04:06,033 --> 00:04:08,733
and knew that we were looking
for a place to rent.

42
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,233
And we thought it'd save a lot
if we two live together.

43
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,533
I feel no stress at all when I live with him.

44
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:18,233
It's been two years now I suppose.

45
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,733
I see.

46
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Even though he's pretty self-centered,
he's not a conventional man.

47
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,400
So I don't need to be
worried about too much.

48
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:32,600
I see. It seems you've found the right one.

49
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,433
Don't misunderstand me.

50
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,533
He's just my roommate.

51
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,867
How about you? What happened?

52
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,400
Well...

53
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,133
What makes you come here?
Something must've happened.

54
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,567
Mhm.

55
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:12,267
Sorry, just hold on for me.

56
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,733
Daichi.

57
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,933
You need to invest in singing lessons!

58
00:05:16,033 --> 00:05:17,033
What?

59
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,733
- What the heck?
- Sorry…

60
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,767
Stop being so annoying.
I'm talking to my friend.

61
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,267
- Got it?
- Alright.

62
00:05:24,933 --> 00:05:26,300
I am so sorry.

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,100
He doesn't take it seriously.

64
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,700
Maki, I think I'd better just go back home.

65
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,500
Eh...

66
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,633
Just say thank you to Daichi for me.

67
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:40,033
Is it something so trivial?

68
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,033
Eh...

69
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,067
I mean...

70
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:50,433
you ran away from home just because
of something really trivial happening?

71
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:55,200
I have no idea, either.

72
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,333
How can you say that...?

73
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:58,700
It isn't right.

74
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,433
I just acted on impulse and ran away...

75
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,767
What happened?

76
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,533
Excuse me.

77
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,100
If I told you, it feels like
it would become real.

78
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,733
What do you mean?

79
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:15,067
I have to talk to Yuuki first.

80
00:06:18,633 --> 00:06:19,667
Misaki.

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,667
I'm happy that you really came to see me.

82
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,933
Mhm...

83
00:07:31,633 --> 00:07:33,200
Crying is alright.

84
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:37,733
One can directly express
their feelings, I think it's great.

85
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:15,967
Misaki.

86
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,467
You're home.

87
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,300
Let me take it.

88
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,633
Yuuki.

89
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,067
Why did you marry me?

90
00:08:42,433 --> 00:08:44,900
I'm sorry. I'm not blaming you.

91
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,367
I just want to understand.

92
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:52,300
I want to make a decision
after figuring out everything.

93
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,733
So I just came back here.

94
00:08:56,267 --> 00:08:57,167
Mhm.

95
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,467
Yuuki.

96
00:09:01,033 --> 00:09:03,500
How would you regard a person like me?

97
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,667
Did you just want to marry someone?

98
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,933
No... it's not like that

99
00:09:10,033 --> 00:09:12,133
I decided to get married because it was you.

100
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,133
It's all because of you...

101
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,433
Please believe me on this.

102
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,525
Then, why did it happen like this?

103
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:25,767
Honestly, I...

104
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,400
I haven't been able to
figure out my own heart and feelings.

105
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,667
But since I married you.

106
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:41,233
I thought I could've lived more carefree.

107
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,600
However...

108
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:48,400
I didn't expect another version of me,
inside of me, who I didn't know...

109
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,567
So you were with Shyuuhei?

110
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,367
I am sorry.

111
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,533
I really am.

112
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,000
Why are you saying sorry?

113
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,867
Because...

114
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:16,541
Even though this is
what the situation is...

115
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,367
I still like you.

116
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:22,467
I still want to be with you.

117
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:27,583
I got it.

118
00:10:31,767 --> 00:10:33,800
I'm really sorry for what's happened.

119
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,033
I will definitely take care of everything.

120
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,333
Shyuuhei.

121
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,733
Let's say goodbye forever.

122
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,700
Let's just break up.

123
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,767
Eh... Yuuki.

124
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,367
Eh... hold on.

125
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,767
Er... Yuuki?

126
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,333
Is it really alright?

127
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,833
This time

128
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:52,400
let me be your pillar of strength.

129
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:58,700
From now on, I'd do anything

130
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,000
as long as it's for you.

131
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,100
You don't need to suppress yourself.

132
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,933
So...

133
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,833
just kiss me.

134
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:03,067
Just feel your feelings,
say what you want to say.

135
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:04,867
Do what you want to do.

136
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,567
Just live the way as you want.

137
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,500
Yuuki.

138
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,267
I love you.

139
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:38,900
Good morning.

140
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:42,967
Good morning.

141
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:51,833
How many tomatoes would you like?

142
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,100
Two.

143
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,300
Great.

144
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,233
- Put this over there.
- Okay.

145
00:15:12,343 --> 00:15:13,167
It looks so great.

146
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:14,933
Yeah, I'm so hungry.

147
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:21,510
- I wanna ask you something.
- Mhm?

148
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:23,200
Do you know the cafe in front of the station?

149
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,667
- It's great.
- You know it?

150
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:25,933
- Do you want to stop by?
- Alright.

151
00:15:26,033 --> 00:15:26,833
- It's good, isn't it?
- Let's go there today.

152
00:15:26,933 --> 00:15:30,500
Excuse me
Did Satou take sick leave today as well?

153
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,133
Do you mean Ria?

154
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,367
She says she's been busy lately.

155
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,233
Yeah, it's said she got a part-time job.

156
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:39,033
A part-time job?

157
00:15:40,567 --> 00:15:42,233
Just go ask her yourself.

158
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,700
Thank you.

159
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,933
The number you're calling is unavailable.

160
00:15:50,033 --> 00:15:53,067
Or there's no signal...

161
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:56,833
What happened?

162
00:15:57,808 --> 00:15:59,741
That one is Satou Ria, right?

163
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,767
She's had a lot of sick
leave recently, hasn't she?

164
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,233
That's right.

165
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:07,600
I heard she got a job.
Her college is already decided anyway.

166
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,533
She just needs to keep
her attendance together.

167
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,233
Yeah...

168
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,333
Well... would you want to drink something?

169
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:20,233
It's good to talk about things
on our minds sometimes.

170
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,867
- Today?
- Yeah

171
00:16:21,967 --> 00:16:24,900
I've found a nice place to drink.
Let's go together, shall we?

172
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:28,500
But I'm busy today...

173
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,867
Oh yeah?

174
00:16:30,633 --> 00:16:33,567
I see. Your handsome husband
is waiting for you at home after all.

175
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:37,133
No. I want to know more about Satou
so I want to visit her family.

176
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:40,133
You are great and you really like your job.

177
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,333
In that's the case, let's take a rain check...?

178
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,667
- Alright.
- I gotta go.

179
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:48,967
Take care.

180
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,167
Thank you...

181
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:33,833
(Where are you right now?)
(At my boyfriend's)

182
00:17:43,233 --> 00:17:47,200
(I will go to school tomorrow)
(I'm sorry to make you so concerned)

183
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:56,800
(I believe you. You have to show up anyway)

184
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,167
It's for you.

185
00:18:10,933 --> 00:18:12,000
Thank you.

186
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:13,433
How much?

187
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:14,767
It's on me.

188
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,200
Because I just got a job.

189
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,167
Really? Congratulations.

190
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,733
Don't mind if I do.

191
00:18:23,233 --> 00:18:24,967
You got chips here as well.

192
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,500
Mhm, it tastes so great.

193
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,733
Do you want some?

194
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,400
- Is it alright?
- Mhm.

195
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,567
Thank you.

196
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:51,740
If you have no place to stay

197
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,267
you can still stay with me.

198
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,200
Didn't you just kick me out?

199
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:03,033
Even though we're dating,
you've got someone else in your heart.

200
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,700
I still do right now.

201
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,867
That's alright.

202
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,233
Mhm?

203
00:19:14,633 --> 00:19:15,633
It won't work.

204
00:19:17,033 --> 00:19:17,967
Why?

205
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:22,767
You thought I don't
understand you well enough?

206
00:19:24,533 --> 00:19:26,000
But now I...

207
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,133
I'm sorry.

208
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:30,300
This is how much I can give you now.

209
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:35,967
Hold on.

210
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,833
I do believe you.

211
00:19:41,033 --> 00:19:44,233
I believe you are the type who would
like many people at the same time.

212
00:19:46,433 --> 00:19:49,767
So I won't ask you who
you really like anyway.

213
00:19:57,525 --> 00:19:58,425
I'm sorry.

214
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:03,967
Although I would like many
people at the same time

215
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,267
it doesn't mean I'd
just like anyone I meet.

216
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:28,167
Not sure... how would you think about the island kitchen?

217
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,467
You mean...

218
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:35,200
I'm wondering
if it would look too messy.

219
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:39,367
Then would you want to block it up?

220
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:43,533
We've talked about this before, haven't we?

221
00:20:44,433 --> 00:20:49,300
Yeah. You said
it's better not to overdo the design.

222
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,067
That's right.

223
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:53,700
But...

224
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,267
What should I do with this?

225
00:21:02,933 --> 00:21:05,267
Just answer the call
I need more time to think about it.

226
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,400
Excuse me.

227
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:17,833
Yuuki...

228
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,300
I want to see you.

229
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:27,133
I really like you so much.

230
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:32,933
Yuuki.

231
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:35,333
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:37,058 --> 00:21:39,958
You think you can end up our relationship
just by one call?

233
00:21:39,983 --> 00:21:41,116
You've gone too far.

234
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,633
I'm sorry.

235
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:47,567
No. I don't want you to apologize.

236
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,300
I want to see you.

237
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:57,067
I'm sorry. I at work right now.

238
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:05,967
Excuse me.

239
00:22:07,433 --> 00:22:10,700
Something like this should be alright?

240
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,767
Ah...

241
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:17,633
Would you want to discuss this
with your husband?

242
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:24,900
My husband said I can decide everything.

243
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,833
I see.

244
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:32,067
It's better to discuss it with him, isn't it?

245
00:22:34,867 --> 00:22:36,567
I will contact you later.

246
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,233
Alright.

247
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,633
Thank you.

248
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,667
(Shyuuhei/Missed Call)

249
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:02,433
I'm home.

250
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,167
Nobody home?

251
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:44,100
(A good person)

252
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,667
(This is a work of fiction)

253
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:04,933
(Next Episode)

254
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:05,733
Yuuki.

255
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:07,533
This is the conclusion
we reached together.

256
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,467
Stop lying.

257
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,367
Men are always like this.

258
00:24:11,467 --> 00:24:15,533
Perhaps it's me who
made Yuuki lie to me.

259
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,532
Perhaps... the three
of us might die together.
