1
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,333
I…

2
00:00:28,667 --> 00:00:31,233
I… I'm gay.

3
00:00:44,433 --> 00:00:45,467
I did't expect…

4
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,067
to see it end like this.

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,033
Eh？.

6
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:58,367
I'm somehow aware of that.

7
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:02,900
So I'd kept adjusting the way to educate you

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,700
in order not to make you be this way.

9
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,533
I didn't expect you can't be changed.

10
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,767
"Adjusting the way to educate"
What do you mean?

11
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:29,600
Are you coercing your kid to be so?

12
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,533
Since I know my kid is not normal

13
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:35,133
how can I, as a parent,
not do things about it?

14
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:37,267
Why do you insist on changing him?

15
00:01:37,933 --> 00:01:39,933
Isn't it just unnormal?

16
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,167
Is it wrong for the parents
to worry about kids?

17
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:43,867
Papa, what you mean by "worrying"

18
00:01:44,433 --> 00:01:46,767
is not worrying, that's dominating instead.

19
00:01:48,267 --> 00:01:52,067
That's why Yuuki would think of you

20
00:01:52,167 --> 00:01:55,667
and accept such domination
to oppress himself constantly.

21
00:01:57,067 --> 00:01:59,167
The reason of his intention to be so...

22
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:02,067
How can't you understand him?

23
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,267
What you want for your kid

24
00:02:09,367 --> 00:02:12,233
is just sort of paranoid
to think it's for his happiness.

25
00:02:14,033 --> 00:02:15,900
Please set him free.

26
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,433
Yuuki

27
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,933
you just let your wife be like this?

28
00:02:25,033 --> 00:02:26,467
It's not so.

29
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,867
Misaki... just speaks up
what has been worrying her.

30
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:34,467
What?

31
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:38,867
She accepts who I really am.

32
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:43,967
So I hope you just stand by me
without saying anything.

33
00:02:45,867 --> 00:02:47,233
Papa…

34
00:02:51,467 --> 00:02:52,767
Suit yourself.

35
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,433
Yuuki…

36
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,400
Mama…

37
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,333
Don't you get it?

38
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,233
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,533
Are you alright?

40
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:49,067
I speak it up eventually.

41
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,200
Thank you.

42
00:04:05,833 --> 00:04:07,033
Yuuki…

43
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:11,300
Ma'am is surely so amazing.

44
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:16,967
No…

45
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,867
I am not the one that is amazing.

46
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,633
It is because of you.

47
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,100
Yuuki can speak it up.

48
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,133
You both are amazing.

49
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,633
Just because of your accompany...

50
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,833
I do sincerely appreciate you two.

51
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,800
Thank you... both.

52
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,067
I see.

53
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,867
I got it.

54
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,933
Misaki？.

55
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:56,967
I'm going to end my life.

56
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,367
Misaki？.

57
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:04,500
It's alright.

58
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,933
No need to worry about ma'am.

59
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:35,200
(Me, My Husband, and His Boyfriend
The Final Episode)

60
00:06:36,933 --> 00:06:38,033
Misaki.

61
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:41,167
I'm sorry. Just ask you regardless
of such a cold weather.

62
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:44,467
That's right. Just come to my place
would be fine, Daiichi is also home.

63
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,567
Daiichi thought it'd be great to be the trigger.

64
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:53,767
The trigger？.

65
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:57,333
To be the trigger that ends the embarrassing
relationship between you and Mr. Yuuki.

66
00:06:58,367 --> 00:07:01,233
Maki, you dislike him from
the very beginning, don't you?

67
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,633
Disliking Yuuki?

68
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,933
That's right. I dislike him.

69
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,800
Because he takes you away from me.

70
00:07:12,033 --> 00:07:13,833
Just joking around.

71
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,233
Maki, you did say it once.

72
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,433
You said I chose Yuuki but not you instead.

73
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,467
Yes, I did.

74
00:07:27,867 --> 00:07:30,133
Although I don't think so

75
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,800
it is probably the truth.

76
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,467
There is little choice in the matter.

77
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,033
Isn't truly no other way around?

78
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,067
What do you insinuate?

79
00:07:45,767 --> 00:07:49,900
What if one can like different people
at the same time

80
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,433
then we don't limit ourselves
to stay in one-on-one relationship?

81
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,633
Does falling in love with one person meam

82
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,067
one wouldn't see other people in the eye?

83
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,167
But…

84
00:08:05,467 --> 00:08:07,700
There are various forms of liking.

85
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,400
I like Misaki

86
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:26,733
so I'd like to touch you.

87
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:30,867
Let me ask you. May I kiss you?

88
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,100
My feelings for you
are actually liking you in this way.

89
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,533
Can you accept it?

90
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,600
Physically not alright, isn't it?

91
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,267
It's nothing when it is
only to do with feelings.

92
00:09:00,633 --> 00:09:01,867
Things like this…

93
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,433
I've been thinking about it

94
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,567
since Yuuki wouldn't make love with me.

95
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,700
I also think about Maki's feelings.

96
00:09:16,867 --> 00:09:18,133
I'm wondering …

97
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:20,900
is only one form of "liking" allowed?

98
00:09:21,967 --> 00:09:24,767
I do like you

99
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,967
though not in the form as you wish.

100
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:33,233
It means you don't like me
as you think of it this way.

101
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,900
Nope.

102
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,333
I don't want to choose whom to like.

103
00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:47,833
Although there are various forms of liking

104
00:09:47,933 --> 00:09:49,467
I do like everyone.

105
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:54,333
What you are just saying...

106
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,300
is the excuse commonly used
by the ones who cheat.

107
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,533
No, it's not.

108
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,700
This is not cheating.

109
00:10:02,133 --> 00:10:03,267
I take it seriously.

110
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:05,567
I do mean it to everyone.

111
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:11,733
I'm sorry…

112
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,400
Probably I still can't get it.

113
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:41,867
Ma'am is out way too long.

114
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,333
Shall we call her?

115
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:46,833
No.

116
00:10:47,467 --> 00:10:48,533
But…

117
00:10:49,033 --> 00:10:52,300
Don't you just say it's alright?

118
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:55,900
You are right.

119
00:10:57,667 --> 00:11:01,800
Just think of it closely
This is how dismissing work.

120
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,900
It's to cheer for all and look
for one's own happiness.

121
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,900
It is just being so.

122
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,267
Mhm…

123
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,367
Eh？.

124
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,400
Ma'am is back.

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Eh... Yuuki, just come with me.

126
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,367
- It's so big.
- Right?

127
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:36,867
Be careful.

128
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:41,500
I want to welcome the New Year
with refreshing feeling.

129
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:44,333
But this is way too big anyway.

130
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:47,233
If we put this at the door the god of
happiness wouldn't find ways to get in.

131
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,067
- Let me help.
- It's so heavy…

132
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,633
Fireworks？.

133
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:00,400
Where are they？.

134
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,133
- Hard to see them.
- Yeah.

135
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:13,033
Happy New Year.

136
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:19,133
I see. It's already passing to the New Year.

137
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,433
Ah…

138
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,933
Dear two, Happy New Year.

139
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,267
Mhm.

140
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,400
As for me…

141
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:48,667
it looks like we've found the way

142
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,933
we three can live without oppressing ourselves.

143
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:53,733
Eh？.

144
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,933
I would get out of the box
to be in one-on-one relationship

145
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,667
and like everyone at the same time.

146
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:07,200
It will be great if it is true...

147
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,900
Yes.

148
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:14,467
Just because we can't make it
we end up like this.

149
00:13:26,867 --> 00:13:27,800
Eh?

150
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:29,633
What's going on here?

151
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:30,567
Misaki？.

152
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,800
Isn't it great？.

153
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,667
Is it alright to put a light bulb in the gate pine?

154
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:35,667
Mhm.

155
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,467
I'm afraid it'd block the way
if we put it at the entrance

156
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,433
so I go check how to do it.

157
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:42,933
And I just learn it, it's not necessary
to put the gate pine at the entrance.

158
00:13:43,033 --> 00:13:44,933
You even don't need to use "pine" for that.

159
00:13:45,567 --> 00:13:46,867
Eh... it is so.

160
00:13:46,967 --> 00:13:48,567
It's so surprising, isn't it?

161
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:51,533
The tradition passing down
till today like this

162
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:56,667
is the rule which everyone
should follow strictly.

163
00:13:56,933 --> 00:14:00,700
But in fact, there is some space
left not to necessarily followed.

164
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:04,567
But this is another thing concerning
what we are talking about, isn't it?

165
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,000
Is it so?

166
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,667
I've stuck to the idea that
love should be one-on-one relationship.

167
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,900
So I couldn't accept the way as Shyuuhei's.

168
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,133
His idea is to love everyone equally.

169
00:14:18,567 --> 00:14:22,233
But is it really not achievable?

170
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,233
I want to take it seriously.

171
00:14:32,433 --> 00:14:34,867
Shyuuhei, haven't you said it before?

172
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:36,700
"I don't want to give up the one I've liked"

173
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,033
"even though I like someone else."

174
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:43,900
If you don't stick to the
one-on-one relationship

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,333
it means you don't need to
give up anyone, doesn't it?

176
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,267
Mhm... that's right.

177
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,667
Even though…

178
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,567
it's actually hard to realize, is it?

179
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:59,667
Yuuki makes it, right?

180
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,467
Eh？.

181
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,467
Although you like Shyuuhei

182
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:08,433
you still appreciate me a lot.

183
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,633
Although there are various kinds of "liking"

184
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:20,567
it actually means you like
everyone equally, doesn't it?

185
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:24,933
If it is so…

186
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,667
we don't necessarily
need to make the choice.

187
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,833
I like you.

188
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:34,300
Even though I might like
someone else later

189
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,533
I still want to hold the feelings for you.

190
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,433
I don't want to give up on you.

191
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,167
Mhm？.

192
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,967
What's the matter？.

193
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,633
You've tried so hard to hang in there.

194
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:57,233
Stop it.

195
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:01,333
Can we really make it? Things like this.

196
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,167
Hold on.

197
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:17,600
See.

198
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,533
Ma'am, you're so beautiful.

199
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,033
I didn't expect I would have
such expression like this.

200
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,000
Who did the shooting?

201
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,067
Daiichi.

202
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:35,567
Honestly, at that time,
as he was looking at me.

203
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:38,767
I was a bit moved.

204
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,167
Did you go to meet him?

205
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,267
Yes, I did. I talked about it with him.

206
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,200
I told him right now I like Yuuki.

207
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,767
But my crush for him is also a fact.

208
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,833
My feelings for Yuuki
might not disappear for life.

209
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:03,233
But I also want to like Daiichi
in my own way.

210
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:08,500
This can't be working.

211
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,133
But…

212
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,433
I still want to take photos for you.

213
00:17:30,067 --> 00:17:31,600
To capture this expression like this.

214
00:17:38,233 --> 00:17:42,533
Although it's not as much as
the feelings I had for Yuuki.

215
00:17:43,133 --> 00:17:46,867
It is the moment
which I did have the crush.

216
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,267
I want to cherish these feelings.

217
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:55,367
If it is the case...
we definitely need to get separated.

218
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,367
It's the same to Yuuki, isn't it?

219
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,500
As you met me
and had a crush on me

220
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,200
you didn't think about separating
from ma'am, did you?

221
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:13,600
It never happened.

222
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:16,967
Mhm.

223
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,400
So... we don't need to
make the choice, do we?

224
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,267
I envy you.

225
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:47,033
Although I've envied you like always

226
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,333
it will definitely get worse later.

227
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,233
You also called him to come?

228
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:02,767
Because Daiichi and you both like me.

229
00:19:03,867 --> 00:19:06,167
Alright, I'm gonna
stick to you all the time

230
00:19:06,267 --> 00:19:08,433
I guess you're gonna stick to me for life.

231
00:19:08,533 --> 00:19:09,833
Shut up

232
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:13,467
I will immediately leave you
as soon as I find someone.

233
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,133
- What's going on?
- Eh？.

234
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,733
You're surely having fun.

235
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,200
- Let's go.
- Alright.

236
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,133
Eh, just say it.

237
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:23,967
Excuse me, you two can't stay together.

238
00:19:24,067 --> 00:19:26,900
- What's it now?
- Why do you say so?

239
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,600
(Divorce Application)

240
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,867
We... we are fine.

241
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,767
I like my husband.

242
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,833
I also like his boyfriend.

243
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,967
That's why I'm gonna hand
in the divorce application.

244
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:04,200
It's for everyone to step forward
for the one they like.

245
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,567
So... off you go.

246
00:20:13,067 --> 00:20:14,700
Shyuuhei, don't you come along?

247
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,967
No. I will wait here for you.

248
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,000
Off you go.

249
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,267
Then I'm leaving.

250
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,600
Me, too.

251
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:04,500
Are you crying?

252
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,967
So pitiful.

253
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:12,167
Are you worried about me?

254
00:21:12,267 --> 00:21:13,567
You are so nice.

255
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:16,567
Don't cry.

256
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,933
Otherwise I will cry as well.

257
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,433
It's alright.

258
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,100
Me... it's crying for joy.

259
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,733
So.

260
00:21:31,967 --> 00:21:33,033
Come on.

261
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,533
Just smile.

262
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,733
Na, you can't behave like this.

263
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:41,967
Excuse me

264
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:45,100
I've told you not to talk to strangers.

265
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:49,467
I got it.

266
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,767
Welcome back.

267
00:22:01,133 --> 00:22:08,067
"With love one live
even without happiness"

268
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,967
so as Dostoyevsky said.

269
00:22:12,667 --> 00:22:18,100
He also said
"Even in sorrow, life is sweet".

270
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:21,400
Just with love...

271
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:05,033
(This is a work of fiction)
