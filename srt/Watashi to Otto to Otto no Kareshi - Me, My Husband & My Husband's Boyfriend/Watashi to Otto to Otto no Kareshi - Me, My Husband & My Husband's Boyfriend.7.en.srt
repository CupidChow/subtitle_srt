00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,233
Thanks…

2
00:00:21,667 --> 00:00:23,133
Let me sleep more.

3
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:38,633
Good morning.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,967
Good morning.

5
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,133
I go wash my face.

6
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,867
Mhm.

7
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:01,200
He's probably dazed with sleep...

8
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:09,767
Let me bring it over there.

9
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,033
Mhm.

10
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:15,800
Take care, ma'am, this is gonna spill

11
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:16,967
I'm sorry…

12
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:25,633
From tonight onward,
I will sleep in the living room.

13
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,167
I'm the one who lodges here
Sleeping on the Sofa is fine for me.

14
00:01:29,267 --> 00:01:32,067
No, Shyuuhei is the last one to go to bed.

15
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:34,233
It's a shame for you to sleep
in the living room.

16
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,133
In the morning, Misaki would go to tuck you in.

17
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,233
Misaki, you sleep in the bedroom.

18
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,867
Shyuuhei, you go sleep in the other room.

19
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,200
I got it.

20
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:53,833
Shyuuhie, is one piece of bread enough?

21
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:55,100
Mhm.

22
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,033
He would kiss me like that without realizing it.

23
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:20,467
Does this mean...
he would kiss like this with Yuuki?

24
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,367
- This is good.
- Is it so?

25
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,567
Good morning.

26
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,533
Good morning...

27
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:41,967
-Something wrong here, correct it
Alright.

28
00:02:42,067 --> 00:02:44,833
By the way, ma'am...

29
00:02:44,933 --> 00:02:45,867
Yes.

(Student Union News)

31
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,600
It's done.

32
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:55,433
Thank you.

33
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,533
Look.

34
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:01,300
Some people like to put this on lately.

35
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,733
Mhm, it's common to see people doing so.

36
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,767
Is it for real?

37
00:03:05,867 --> 00:03:08,967
Isn't it too weird?
(Ina Shyuuhei)

38
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:10,867
Don't you?

39
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,967
How should I put it...
I don't have such a habit.

40
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,067
It means...

41
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:16,167
Is it so?

42
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,000
Is the one who knows it from the school?

43
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,367
- Yes.
- It's been like this the whole day.

44
00:04:17,167 --> 00:04:21,667
(Me, My Husband, and His Boyfriend
Episode Seven)

45
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:25,333
I am home.

46
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,000
- Ma'am, you are home.
- Mhm.

47
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,900
- Here you are.
- I'm home.

48
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,767
What happened?

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,233
-Eh？
-You turned off the cellphone.

50
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:37,467
I'm sorry…

51
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:53,000
What's the matter?

52
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,167
Eh？.

53
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,100
What's going on with this?

54
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:24,567
Honestly… there was someone
who sent me this.

55
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,567
What's this?

56
00:05:32,133 --> 00:05:33,500
Who took the photos?

57
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,533
There were just photos earlier.

58
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:42,367
But I went to school today
the school journal from three years ago

59
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,367
was put on my desk...

60
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,867
Three years ago…

61
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:52,400
Shyuuhei's photo was marked.

62
00:05:55,567 --> 00:05:57,333
What's going on?

63
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:03,900
I'm sorry... to keep this unknown to you.

64
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:10,100
No... we are the ones who should apologize
How come we haven't noticed this...

65
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,367
It must be done by someone in the school.

66
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,133
Mhm.

67
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,467
But who would that be?

68
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:25,267
Ina Shyuuhei.

69
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,567
Yes…

70
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,933
Are you dating him because you know it?

71
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,633
I have to go now.

72
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,733
Well, you are a man after all.

73
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:39,233
This is just a one-time crush, right?

74
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,533
Misaki.

75
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,967
To be honest... there is one thing I haven't told you.

76
00:06:58,067 --> 00:07:01,067
- Good morning.
- Good morning, you are early here.

77
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,133
Yes.

78
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,233
(You got a new message)

79
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,633
(A Good Person)

80
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,467
As expected…

81
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,400
You freaked me out.

82
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,300
These messages...
are from ma'am Mizumi, aren't there?

83
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,533
What? What are you talking about?

84
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:02,100
Stop pretending.

85
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:05,033
Why did you do such things?

86
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,767
Do you have any proof that I sent these to you?

87
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,967
I heard you visited my husband
in his company.

88
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:22,533
That's for your own good
so I correct your wrongdoing.

89
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:25,267
Correct?

90
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,633
"It's just a one-time crush."

91
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:29,933
You call this a correction?

92
00:08:30,033 --> 00:08:31,933
It is so, isn't it?

93
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,767
As long as my husband breaks up with his lover
everything would be back on track.

94
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:38,600
You said this to him as well, didn't you?

95
00:08:39,767 --> 00:08:43,433
Do you know how much
you hurt him by saying so?

96
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:47,700
Why would he feel hurt?
You are the one who hurts.

97
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:52,033
Your husband is cheating.

98
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:56,633
And his lover is gay
He's also your student.

99
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,767
Such a twisting marriage life
wouldn't be happy for you.

100
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:07,333
But you accept all
and live together with them.

101
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,633
No husband and wife would live like this,
wouldn't they?

102
00:09:15,267 --> 00:09:19,767
You've been so compromising for him
Wouldn't you feel upset?

103
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:24,633
It's absolutely not like that.

104
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,967
Get yourself back on track soon, please.

105
00:09:36,567 --> 00:09:41,267
If I were you, I would divorce my husband
as soon as I find out he's cheating.

106
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:44,767
Since he is cheating...

107
00:09:44,867 --> 00:09:47,633
it means his heart is no longer loving me.

108
00:09:50,733 --> 00:09:53,400
His heart is no longer loving you.

109
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,667
Just leave him for good.

110
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,733
Even though it is so...

111
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,133
I still love my husband.

112
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:08,100
So stop doing things like this.

113
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:13,567
Let me ask you one thing.

114
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't you think your husband is pitiful?

115
00:10:19,767 --> 00:10:22,800
Your love for him makes him suffer a lot.

116
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,333
How can you not be aware of this?

117
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:43,100
The one who sent me photos...

118
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,800
is ma'am Misumi.

119
00:10:49,067 --> 00:10:51,233
Sure enough it is her.

120
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,100
I thought she probably can't understand
the relationship like ours.

121
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,700
- That's why she...
- Even it is the case

122
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,933
she couldn't take sneak shots
and sent them to ma'am.

123
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:11,933
Her personality is just so crooked.

124
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:17,467
But I told her not to do it ever again.

125
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,733
I think that's it.

126
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,433
Anyway, you have to take a good rest today.

127
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,767
Water for the bathtub is ready.

128
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:28,467
Mhm, thanks.

129
00:11:53,633 --> 00:11:57,567
Ma'am Misaki is obviously so sad
but she just pretends it's nothing

130
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,533
I can't bear seeing her like this.

131
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:04,733
Don't ever make her sad, please.

132
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:07,033
She is your beloved wife, isn't it?

133
00:12:17,533 --> 00:12:19,133
You can't sleep, either?

134
00:12:24,733 --> 00:12:29,433
Sure enough... the way of living like this
is still weird, isn't it?

135
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:37,033
I wish... you have a happy life.

136
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:43,433
This is the wrong one.

137
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,033
Me, too.

138
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:59,033
I also wish you a happy life.

139
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:14,567
It's alright.

140
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,233
We can make it.

141
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,900
It's definitely alright.

142
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,300
- Shyuuhei.
- Mhm?

143
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,967
Dust will pile up
if you don't clean that corner.

144
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,867
Yuuki takes it really seriously.

145
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,067
Give it to me for a second.

146
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:48,333
- Okay.
- Thanks.

147
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:13,267
I‘m going out.

148
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,633
- Take care.
- Mhm.

149
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,633
Misaki.

150
00:14:52,633 --> 00:14:53,700
It's so dangerous.

151
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,667
I see.

152
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,567
So you are free today, aren't you?

153
00:15:04,033 --> 00:15:06,067
So... you are out for a walk?

154
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,100
Mhm.

155
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,833
I kinda of want to see Maki.

156
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,500
Then... would you want to go home together?

157
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:15,433
Mhm.

158
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,133
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

159
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,867
I just feel Daiichi is quite different
when you take photos.

160
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,400
Do you fall in love with me?

161
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,767
Eh, what are you talking about?

162
00:15:48,567 --> 00:15:49,600
Look over here.

163
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Aren't you specialized in landscape?

164
00:15:53,467 --> 00:15:54,967
That's right indeed.

165
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Though I would take photos
whenever I see someone I feel touched.

166
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:02,833
Just kidding.

167
00:16:18,033 --> 00:16:19,400
Wait a second.

168
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:22,433
Ah, by the way.

169
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:32,567
Take a look of these if you feel alright.

170
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:34,833
Mhm.

171
00:17:06,267 --> 00:17:08,033
Sorry to keep you waiting.

172
00:17:08,533 --> 00:17:09,767
This photo...

173
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:11,433
Ah...

174
00:17:12,033 --> 00:17:15,600
This one, Morgenrot,
was taken at north Alps.

175
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,733
Morgenrot？.

176
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:23,500
It's called the landscape a couple of minutes
before the mountain is exposed to the sun.

177
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,767
It's Morgenrot.

178
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:26,367
Amazing.

179
00:17:27,367 --> 00:17:28,667
It's so beautiful.

180
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,467
As long as you put yourself in the nature

181
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:38,733
you can feel it with your body
and know how wonderful to be alive.

00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:41,567
This photo was taken at the moment like this.

183
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:44,400
How great…

184
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,633
I also want to look at it myself
but it seems quite difficult

185
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,933
I've never climbed a mountain like this.

186
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,400
Misaki, you might forget that

187
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,667
I'm good at guiding the way.

188
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,467
I see.

189
00:17:59,933 --> 00:18:01,133
Would you take me there?

190
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:06,867
As long as you want it, I will take you
to see the most beautiful landscape.

191
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:13,767
- How about this one?
- This one... it's the same case.

192
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:17,833
Well...

193
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,933
Here you are.

194
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,533
Why do you talk like this?

195
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:22,400
Eh?

196
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:24,700
Misaki, would you stay to have dinner tonight?

197
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,167
- Mhm... how to do with it?
- Eh?

198
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:30,567
- Just join us.
- Alright.

199
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,200
Great.

200
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,067
- Make it quick.
- I'm starving.

201
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:38,000
- Take care.
- It's very hot. Be careful.

202
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,333
Wow... it looks so delicious.

203
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:41,433
- It smells good.
- So great, isn't it?

204
00:18:41,533 --> 00:18:42,867
This one is my favorite.

205
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,133
It's so well-prepared.

206
00:18:44,233 --> 00:18:45,733
Maki is so amazing, isn't she?

207
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,767
She can finish this can

208
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:49,467
I can't. Who can do it?

209
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:51,500
- Really?
- Definitely. Just see it by yourself.

210
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,933
- She's gonna finish it all.
- You wish.

211
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,200
Cheers…

212
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,600
I'm home.

213
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,967
I'm home.

214
00:20:05,533 --> 00:20:07,267
Eh, how about ma'am?

215
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,233
Yuuki, don't you go to bed?

216
00:20:22,267 --> 00:20:23,133
Eh?

217
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:26,833
Yuuki?

218
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,100
I...

219
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,500
wait here just because I want to see you.

220
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,533
When I think that you will come back to me.

221
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:51,533
I would be too excited to fall asleep.

222
00:21:06,133 --> 00:21:09,833
As for Misaki, I appreciate her

223
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,467
and love her very much.

224
00:21:13,233 --> 00:21:14,200
But...

225
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:20,367
my feelings for you are the same.

226
00:21:24,633 --> 00:21:26,200
I want to touch you.

227
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:28,933
I can't help it.

228
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,833
The one I think of is you, not Misaki.

229
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,867
My own feelings...

230
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:44,533
Why can't I just control my feelings?

231
00:22:29,967 --> 00:22:31,667
I was asleep.

232
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,067
It's time to go back.

233
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:42,300
Don't go back.

234
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:55,100
Hold on…

235
00:23:02,467 --> 00:23:03,467
Excuse me.

236
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:24,967
Hello.

237
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:29,600
Misaki... she is at my home now.

238
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:35,233
I'm kinda of drunk, and...

239
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,667
I'm not sure if I should tell you this.

240
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,133
My roommate Daiichi...
he got feelings for Misaki...

241
00:23:50,567 --> 00:23:54,533
I think it's time for you
to set Misaki free, isn't it?

242
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:02,033
(It is a work of fiction)

243
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:04,467
(Next Episode)
Are you serious?

244
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,100
I've told you

245
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,667
just for the happiness of myself and Misaki.

246
00:24:09,767 --> 00:24:11,667
Let's take everything as a dream.

247
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:13,633
This is the real me.

248
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,900
I hope you don't choose your husband
You can choose me instead
