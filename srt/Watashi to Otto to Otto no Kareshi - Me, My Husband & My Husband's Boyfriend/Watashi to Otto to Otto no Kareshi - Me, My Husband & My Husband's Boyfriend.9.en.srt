1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,567
(Divorce Application)

2
00:00:10,133 --> 00:00:11,433
What is this?

3
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,267
Eh…

4
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:28,767
Tell me now.

5
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,067
I don't get it.

6
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,733
Why would you divorce？.

7
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:37,133
Don't we want to look for the
happiness for three together?

8
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm sorry. It was me who claimed to do so.

9
00:00:43,467 --> 00:00:47,400
But... I feel there are more and more things
which we can't share with each other.

10
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:57,367
Does that mean... at that time...

11
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:12,633
Ma'am…

12
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,500
Did you see it?

13
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,833
You saw it, didn't you?

14
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:23,567
Mhm.

15
00:01:24,767 --> 00:01:25,833
I saw it.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,933
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:39,133
It's me... who couldn't withhold myself.

18
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,633
No…

19
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:47,767
That's not like that.

20
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,033
That was not you as you used to be.

21
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:52,167
It's alright, Shyuuhei.

22
00:01:52,267 --> 00:01:54,100
Why? Why is it alright?

23
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:59,467
I see. Yuuki must have acted
on purpose to show it to ma'am.

24
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,433
He knew when you were coming home
and that's why he...

25
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,233
It must be so, right?

26
00:02:09,767 --> 00:02:11,367
At that time, Shyuuhei...

27
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,733
You were about to accept it, weren't you?

28
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
I…

29
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,533
This is the answer.

30
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,933
It means you follow your heart.

31
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:41,333
Same here…

32
00:02:42,467 --> 00:02:44,700
I try to like others

33
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,233
and not just to be appreciated.

34
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,367
I want to be loved as a woman.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,633
But you don't have to get divorced.

36
00:03:01,167 --> 00:03:05,233
You don't need to get separated
even though you like other people.

37
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,200
By doing so, it means everyone
follows his heart, doesn't it?

38
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,433
Doesn't it?

39
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,033
Ma'am, you still like Yuuki, don't you?

40
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,167
If it is the case...

41
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,467
Enough.

42
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,300
Don't make her feel awkward anymore.

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,533
Make her feel awkward? I just…

44
00:03:31,633 --> 00:03:32,833
It's my bad.

45
00:03:34,767 --> 00:03:36,367
I can't be like Shyuuhei.

46
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,267
I can't like different people at the same time.

47
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:46,500
I think it's better to keep

48
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,900
one-on-one relationship.

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,833
Yuuki.

50
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,833
Are you with her?

51
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:01,800
I thought about it, too
I wanted to hold the idea of love as you do.

52
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,400
One-on-one relationship...

53
00:04:13,567 --> 00:04:15,433
This is normal, isn't it?

54
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:32,967
Alright.

55
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,800
Let's dismiss.

56
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,133
Shyuuhei.

57
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,433
You have always…

58
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,500
fully cooperated with me.

59
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:02,200
I truly appreciate that.

60
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,667
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,467
Three of us,
let's celebrate the New Year, shall we?

62
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:24,733
Are you serious?

63
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,000
Mhm.

64
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,633
We can start our new lives
after the New Year.

65
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,367
Misaki, is it alright?

66
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,167
Do you need me to prepare
something good?

67
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,033
Yeah.

68
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,067
Let's make some sukiyaki

69
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,333
plus some snow crabs, how about that?

70
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:46,367
I also want some fried chicken.

71
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,933
Are these enough?

72
00:05:48,033 --> 00:05:50,000
Expensive food are not always tasty.

73
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,100
Fried chicken is great.

74
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,133
Yes, isn't it? I also want some Hayashi rice.

75
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:55,667
Hayashi rice?

76
00:06:57,167 --> 00:07:01,667
(Me, My Husband, and His Boyfriend
Episode Nine)

77
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,200
- New Year's coming.
- Yeah.

78
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,267
- Ma'am, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

79
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:08,800
Ma'am.

80
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,067
Thank you.

81
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,200
Mhm？.

82
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,733
If you didn't remind me
I would have had a grade retention.

83
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:19,400
You can't get loose
Your performance is not stable.

84
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,933
Don't worry. I already broke up with him.

85
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:22,867
Eh？.

86
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:26,633
Because he flirted with the woman I don't like.

87
00:07:26,733 --> 00:07:28,733
And I immediately see through his true color.

88
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,333
So you broke up with him?

89
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,100
I'm very surprised myself

90
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,100
I liked him so much

91
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,500
but now I think I was so blind at that time.

92
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,867
Are you faking it?

93
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:40,700
Not at all

94
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,833
Ria, let's go home.

95
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:44,767
Alright.

96
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:46,900
Ma'am, see you in the new semester.

97
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,867
Alright, Happy New Year.

98
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,267
Goodbye.

99
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,933
Ma'am Misumi.

100
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,733
Well... would you want to have a drink today?

101
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,600
Eh？.

102
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:11,267
Didn't I say last time?
"It's my turn next time".

103
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,100
Mhm…

104
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,633
Alright.

105
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,467
You still can not make up your mind?

106
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,033
I'm terribly sorry

107
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:35,900
I really... don't know what to do with it.

108
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,767
Would it be possible that
you've been standing in others' shoes?

109
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,867
Eh？.

110
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:47,767
Ah…

111
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:52,467
May I talk about... some of my own opinion?

112
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,967
Yes, please.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,100
Standing in others' shoes
is a very wonderful idea to me.

114
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:10,133
But to take others' happiness as yours...

115
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:16,700
Lately I've been thinking this might
just be the way to put the responsibility on others.

116
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,867
Please continue.

117
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:24,433
Honestly... I once made up my mind

118
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:27,933
to devote my life to my wife.

119
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,100
Devoting your life?

120
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:37,233
Yes. I really want her
to enjoy a happy life.

121
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:43,467
I want to make her understand
her happiness is also mine.

122
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,267
However…

123
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,600
this makes my wife burdened
with my happiness instead.

124
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:56,767
Why would you think so?

125
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,700
Because…

126
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:04,433
if someone tells you
"if you are not happy, I won't be happy, either".

127
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:06,633
Then wouldn't you try to
pretend you are happy?

128
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,200
I see…

129
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,733
That's true.

130
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:15,067
If it is the case... isn't it so cruel?

131
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:21,367
As long as your love can...

132
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,533
Does love really get it all over?

133
00:10:27,033 --> 00:10:28,367
Mhm…

134
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:30,933
It might be still very hard.

135
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,767
Something like "you are happy,
and I will be happy as well".

136
00:10:36,867 --> 00:10:41,667
Well... it is irresponsible to say so.

137
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:44,733
Happiness should be something
you go after yourself.

138
00:10:49,633 --> 00:10:50,533
Ah…

139
00:10:51,367 --> 00:10:52,533
Sorry…

140
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,267
I might be going too far.

141
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:58,767
Not at all.

142
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,500
I think you are right.

143
00:11:12,133 --> 00:11:13,500
I've made up my mind.

144
00:11:15,867 --> 00:11:19,600
My husband never says which is his favorite
and I've been so troubled.

145
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,467
But from the very beginning.

146
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:23,833
I like this design very much.

147
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,867
Happy New Year…

148
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,333
- Happy New Year.
- Take a good rest.

149
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:44,467
- Alright.
- I'm leaving now.

150
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,667
Shyuuhei.

151
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:54,467
Yuuki and Misaki won't go back
to the hometown?

152
00:11:55,033 --> 00:11:56,100
No, they won't.

153
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,567
And my dad accepted it?

154
00:11:59,233 --> 00:12:01,000
Mhm... I don't know.

155
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,967
After calling back home
Yuuki looked pretty out of sorts.

156
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,967
I see.

157
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:09,900
At least, he tried...

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,133
Sausages from the new year gift box
There're a lot. Take some back home.

159
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,567
Alright. Thank you, ma'am.

160
00:12:23,467 --> 00:12:24,867
It's so scary.

161
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,233
Let me ask you. Things about you guys.

162
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,900
Do you know how much
ma'am Naka is aware of that?

163
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:33,200
Things like that are not important anymore.

164
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,567
What do you mean?

165
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,500
Alright, ask no more.

166
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,967
It's not going well, is it?

167
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,000
Don't be gloating like that.

168
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,967
I don't, but...

169
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,667
I've thought about it, What if the idea
of love like this which I can't get it

170
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:59,233
becomes "normality"
What should I do?

171
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,633
I'm sorry. Are you mad?

172
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,933
The "normality" as you call it

173
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,433
refers to the three people loving each other
and feeling happy about it

174
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:23,433
but they can't achieve the happiness they want.

175
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:24,967
It is so sad.

176
00:13:25,867 --> 00:13:29,033
That's why I can't get it.

177
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,000
Or... Let's make it a comic book, shall we?

178
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:39,400
Just make your world
which I haven't got it right

179
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,033
into a comic book.

180
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,967
What's the matter? Shyuuhei.

181
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,767
Are you going to draw your own comic book?

182
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,767
No…

183
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,833
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- Thanks.

184
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,967
Eh…

185
00:14:04,033 --> 00:14:05,767
You are going to divorce?

186
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,467
I want ma'am Misumi to be the first one
who knows it.

187
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:13,133
I do it for your own good...

188
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,467
I got it.

189
00:14:15,567 --> 00:14:19,567
So I just want you to be
the first one to know it.

190
00:14:21,967 --> 00:14:27,200
However, I don't agree with
everything you said.

191
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,867
See. You come to scold me.

192
00:14:29,967 --> 00:14:31,467
No, I don't.

193
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,900
Just thinking back, ma'am Misumi has been...

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,933
You've been caring about me.

195
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:41,533
You invited me for a drink

196
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:44,800
because you worried about me
and wanted to listen to what's on my mind.

197
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:50,200
But I kept saying "I'm fine"
to turn you down.

198
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,800
You do know I was faking
all the way, don't you?

199
00:14:56,433 --> 00:14:58,633
So you did all that out of worries...

200
00:14:58,733 --> 00:14:59,967
It's not true.

201
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:02,767
Eh？.

202
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:04,800
Because…

203
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,633
I haven't worried about you at all.

204
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,667
Is it so?

205
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,200
Honestly.

206
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,100
It's not everyone as pushover like you.

207
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:24,900
As for me…

208
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:31,833
I'd been suffered

209
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:33,833
as I saw you had such a happy marriage.

210
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,900
So... as I found out
your husband was cheating.

211
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,333
Honestly, I was very happy about it.

212
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,733
But I do know laughing
at others' miseries sucks.

213
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:49,600
But I can't help thinking about it.

214
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,067
"Now you know how much agony I am in."

215
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,367
However, you said you wouldn't get divorced.

216
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:02,200
As for me…

217
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:06,533
when I found out my husband was cheating
I laid my cards on the table.

218
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,233
Then I just divorced him immediately.

219
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:14,200
I don't get it
You are being cheated.

220
00:16:14,733 --> 00:16:18,033
How could you sustain your marriage like that?

221
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:21,400
It's just beyond me.

222
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,833
One more, please.

223
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:29,933
Alright.

224
00:16:34,267 --> 00:16:37,367
I thought I got a company…

225
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:42,500
I'm pretty lame, am I not?

226
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,567
Yes, you are…

227
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:56,467
Excuse me, a whisky with soda.

228
00:16:56,567 --> 00:16:57,700
Alright.

229
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,500
Thank you for telling me your true thoughts.

230
00:17:09,667 --> 00:17:11,433
Let's cheers one more time, shall we?

231
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,900
It's alright if you want to dislike me.

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,033
But…

233
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,800
I don't want any misunderstanding between us.

234
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,700
Thanks for your patience.

235
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,600
Thanks.

236
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:39,033
Please.

237
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:51,533
Next time... let's go eat grills, shall we?

238
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:55,733
Eh？.

239
00:17:57,467 --> 00:17:58,667
Honestly…

240
00:17:59,267 --> 00:18:03,167
after back to be single
I often hang around myself.

241
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:06,667
But only grills and hot pot restaurants...
I'm afraid to go there alone.

242
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:11,767
Aren't there grills
and hot pot for one recently?

243
00:18:11,867 --> 00:18:13,667
If I go there alone

244
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:17,400
doesn't it look like I admit defeat?

245
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,367
Do you really lose anything?

246
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:29,167
Cheers.

247
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,767
Cheers.

248
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,667
This is the best one of today.

249
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:47,000
Same here.

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,133
My headache is killing me...

251
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:09,233
It turns out ma'am would
have a hangover as well.

252
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,900
Because I was too happy.

253
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,933
Whom do you go drinking with?

254
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:17,800
With ma'am Misumi.

255
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Eh？.

256
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
But she did all that...

257
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,967
Mutual understanding is very important.

258
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,667
Alright…

259
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,233
Mhm.

260
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,133
Who's it?

261
00:19:49,633 --> 00:19:50,833
What's the matter?

262
00:19:58,167 --> 00:19:59,767
It's my father…

263
00:20:05,633 --> 00:20:06,767
What's going on?

264
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,267
I will ask them to go back.

265
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:16,633
No…

266
00:20:18,767 --> 00:20:20,200
I will tell them about it.

267
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,367
This day... eventually comes.

268
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:28,800
You two go back to the rooms.

269
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:31,333
Mhm.

270
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,200
Now we are still... a married couple.

271
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,367
Papa, in fact...

272
00:21:11,467 --> 00:21:14,200
Aren't you aware that you are the oldest son?

273
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,967
You are the heir of the Naka family.

274
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:21,533
Going back to hometown and visiting
relatives in January, Isn't it common?

275
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:27,500
Besides, what do you
think about having a family?

276
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,933
You can't live like this forever, can you?

277
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,467
So we…

278
00:21:33,567 --> 00:21:36,433
I bought a piece of land near our home.

279
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:38,967
You just build a house over there.

280
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,233
Of course I will help with the cost.

281
00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:47,233
You can't afford it
with your salary now.

282
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,567
That's why Misaki has to go out for working.

283
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,700
No... I'm doing the job I like.

284
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,067
It would be right at the moment.

285
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:00,933
How about in the future?

286
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,333
You don't have kids
just because you both have a job?

287
00:22:05,433 --> 00:22:07,100
No... it's not like that.

288
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,833
Misaki…

289
00:22:08,933 --> 00:22:12,200
It's about time to give us grandchildren
isn't it?

290
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,733
Or... do you have any difficulties?

291
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:19,867
No... papa... it's not like that...

292
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:22,233
I was talking to Misaki.

293
00:22:26,733 --> 00:22:27,800
Hey.

294
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:29,467
Yes.

295
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,767
Misaki.

296
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:34,300
Well... I know things
like this are hard to tell.

297
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,567
If you feel awkward to talk about it

298
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:39,867
I can introduce you to a very nice hospital.

299
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,000
Alright?

300
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,267
Ah…

301
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:46,867
I know why you hesitate
but if you keep living this way

302
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:49,000
it's just a waste of time.

303
00:22:52,167 --> 00:22:55,200
Just think of it as for the Naka family, please.

304
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,133
Just have babies for the Naka family.

305
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,333
Enough.

306
00:23:00,433 --> 00:23:02,233
This is not her problem.

307
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:04,667
So is it you who have problems?

308
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:11,767
I thought...

309
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,233
I could tell you
when everything is settled down.

310
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:25,000
What do you want to say?

311
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,400
Just say it.

312
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,967
You've been acting like this. Being so timid.

313
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:34,200
You are not manly at all.

314
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,533
I…

315
00:23:36,767 --> 00:23:39,533
I… I'm gay.

316
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,100
You…

317
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,333
What did you just say?

318
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,433
Don't make fun of this

319
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,067
I'm not joking around.

320
00:23:52,167 --> 00:23:53,733
(This is a work of fiction)

321
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,167
Misaki.

322
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,433
(The Final Episode)
He's been oppressing himself.

323
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:07,567
Am I not allowed to like
two people at the same time?

324
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:08,933
May I kiss you?

325
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:11,533
Just end the embarrassing relationship
between you and Mr. Yuuki.

326
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:15,100
We... are fine now
