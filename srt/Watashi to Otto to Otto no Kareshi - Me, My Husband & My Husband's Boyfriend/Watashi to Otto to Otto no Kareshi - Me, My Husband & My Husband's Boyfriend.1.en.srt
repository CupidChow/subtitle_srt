1
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:27,367
"With love, one can live
even without happiness,"

2
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,474
as once Dostoyevsky said.

3
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:39,467
He also said
"Even in sorrow, life is sweet".

4
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,033
Just with love...

5
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,533
You are back.

6
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,833
I'm home.

7
00:00:56,267 --> 00:00:58,933
- Here you are.
- Why?

8
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,933
I suddenly found these flowers very
beautiful as I passed by the flower shop.

9
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:05,167
They somehow remind of you.

10
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:07,433
Thank you, I am so happy.

11
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:14,833
"Me, My Husband and My Husband's Boyfriend"
(Episode 1)

12
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,667
Welcome.

13
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:24,733
Are you alone?

14
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:27,467
- No, I have company.
- Is it those over there?

15
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,600
Misaki.

16
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,700
Long time no see!

17
00:02:33,059 --> 00:02:35,425
You're more beautiful
after getting married.

18
00:02:35,533 --> 00:02:38,767
- Am I?
- Women loved by men are just so different.

19
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:41,067
I heard Chinatyu and
Ryuu broke up, didn't they?

20
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:43,333
It happened a while ago, that's old news!

21
00:02:43,433 --> 00:02:45,133
- They broke up for a long time.
- Honestly.

22
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:47,567
Well, there are only four of us today?

23
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,433
Misaki, haven't you contacted Maki?

24
00:02:49,524 --> 00:02:51,824
No. She has a different number.

25
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,100
I did contact her.

26
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,433
She said she will come
late so we can start anytime.

27
00:02:56,633 --> 00:02:58,933
You haven't met with
Maki in a while, have you?

28
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:02,133
- Hhm.
- She has no choice.

29
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:04,567
You chose to marry an excellent guy after all.

30
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,733
- That's right.
- I want to know how your husband looks like.

31
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:09,433
-Me, too. Do you have his photos?

32
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,233
- Photos?
- Show me.

33
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:13,067
Here you are…

34
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,000
See! So handsome.

35
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,733
- So handsome.
- He looks pretty cute.

36
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:23,367
Hold on, please don't look at your
own husband like you're so smitten.

37
00:03:23,467 --> 00:03:24,767
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:27,467
Anyway, my heart still
beats like crazy now.

39
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:30,125
- What?
- I feel sorry to hear you say that.

40
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,367
Maki.

41
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,867
Long time no see...

42
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:44,800
Somehow... I think it's better for you
not to be with Yuuki.

43
00:03:50,359 --> 00:03:52,925
Sorry, I'm late.

44
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,533
- Just sit here.
- It's been a long time.

45
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,233
- You are right.
- Exactly.

46
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,733
Would you want some wine?

47
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,133
Thanks.

48
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:01,467
- Just a little for me.
- Just a little?

49
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,933
Here you are.

50
00:04:03,033 --> 00:04:04,567
- Is this alright?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:05,700
Please.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,667
- Here.
- Alright.

53
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,233
- It's really been a long time.
- True.

54
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,333
- Long time no see.
- Come on.

55
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,767
- Grab your glass.
- Okay.

56
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:15,467
- Hold it up.
- Yeah.

57
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,100
To the reunion of Mitani Group.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,400
Cheers!

59
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,300
- It's great.
- How long haven't we met?

60
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,900
- It's really been a long time.
- How long?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,667
- Like, after we graduated from college?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:35,167
- Wait a second, how many years?
- It's terrifying.

63
00:04:35,267 --> 00:04:36,700
- It's pretty long.
- For three years I suppose.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Are we in the same
graduating year?

65
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,733
- Yeah.
- It's so funny.

66
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,100
What are you talking about?

67
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,333
In fact, you live pretty close to me.

68
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,633
Yeah. I am lucky to find a nice place.

69
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,133
Oh really?

70
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,800
You changed your number?

71
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,433
Mhm.

72
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,333
Why didn't you tell me?

73
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,400
Do you have something to tell me?

74
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,467
Of course I do.

75
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,433
Then go ahead.

76
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:21,300
Er...

77
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,433
What's it?

78
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:30,067
Sorry, I haven't contacted you for a while.

79
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:31,433
It's alright.

80
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,300
After all, you chose Yuuki
rather than me, didn't you?

81
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,133
- It's not like that...
- Say no more.

82
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,133
You are happy, aren't you?

83
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:45,767
Mhm.

84
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,117
I am very happy.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,100
Misaki.

86
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,967
You are really happy. Right?

87
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,567
You're actually not
pleased with this, right?

88
00:06:02,584 --> 00:06:04,417
About me marrying Yuuki...

89
00:06:06,467 --> 00:06:07,400
Mhm.

90
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:14,833
Why?

91
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:20,167
Why don't you want me to be with Yuuki？

92
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,400
Why did you say that?

93
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:26,200
Now you're asking me?

94
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,833
Well...

95
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:31,267
At that time... you were totally
head over heels, weren't you?

96
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:46,167
It's for you.

97
00:06:47,167 --> 00:06:50,167
Yuuki... proposed to me.

98
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:53,333
- Eh?
- Wait, I will tell you about it bit by bit.

99
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,867
At first, it was I who proposed to him.

100
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,133
Then Yuuki said:

101
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,633
"Just give me some time to think about it
We'll just go for a trip first."

102
00:07:01,867 --> 00:07:02,867
Then?

103
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:04,700
Then we went to Odaiba.

104
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
What? Going to Odaiba doesn't count as a trip.

105
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,567
Mhm.

106
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:12,300
Welcome.

107
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,867
Misaki, you prefer black tea, right?

108
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:14,833
Mhm.

109
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,100
Black tea and coffee for each of us.

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,733
Alright.

111
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:21,933
It was so beautiful there.

112
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:26,800
We were in a room facing the sea
He proposed in the sunshine.

113
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,533
This makes me feel like Yuuki
truly behaved as a man should.

114
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,733
I often say there's no difference concerning
who proposes first.

115
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:39,233
But surely it should be for men
to do things like this.

116
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:43,600
So you have done it with Yuuki, haven't you?

117
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,733
What do you mean?

118
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,867
Having sex.

119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,433
- It's a normal thing to do.
- No, it's not.

120
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,867
You've been dating for a year But
he's never had sex with you, right?

121
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:58,733
Doesn't it explain how much he treasures me?

122
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,367
Maki, don't you feel happy for me?

123
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:12,567
Somehow... I think it's better for you
not to be with Yuuki.

124
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,400
Mhm.

125
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,159
I was indeed head over heels

126
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,667
so I couldn't ask you any further then.

127
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,133
Is the situation different now?

128
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,200
Not at all. I am fine.

129
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,167
What on earth are you...

130
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:37,100
I'm so sorry to ask you such a weird question.

131
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,333
This is where I live right now.

132
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:02,167
Thank you.

133
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:08,233
So, would it be alright for us to meet
like we used to do.

134
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:14,633
You can come to me anytime you want.

135
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,200
Mhm.

136
00:09:18,867 --> 00:09:19,767
Mhm.

137
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,400
Just go home. It's getting colder.

138
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:27,767
Mhm.

139
00:09:29,433 --> 00:09:32,267
It's so great to see you today
Thank you.

140
00:09:34,133 --> 00:09:35,033
Mhm.

141
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:40,333
See you next time.

142
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:15,133
I'm home.

143
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,267
Are you asleep?

144
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,567
- I want to ask you something.
- Mhm?

145
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,933
What makes you like me?

146
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:34,933
Well, we have a lot
of things to talk about.

147
00:11:35,033 --> 00:11:37,967
And you think about things a lot...

148
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,533
I really like someone like you.

149
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,767
He likes someone like me.

150
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:57,433
He first likes me as a person
then he takes me as a woman.

151
00:11:57,533 --> 00:12:00,000
That's why I fell in love with him.

152
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,000
Ah...

153
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,167
You haven't eaten much, have you?

154
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,700
Don't you want to go with them
for another round?

155
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,233
No.

156
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:38,700
To be honest, I don't like singles mixers.

157
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:42,433
So I just run away with
any old excuse.

158
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,400
Same here.

159
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,600
A singles expo like this is so tiring.

160
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,300
A singles expo?

161
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,033
Eh... you mean a singles mixer?

162
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:57,400
It's for men and women to
evaluate each other, I don't like it.

163
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:01,633
It particularly focuses on the comments
of men & women on how they look...

164
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:06,933
It always makes me feel I'm a commodity
rather than a human being. It's so annoying.

165
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,567
That's right.

166
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:11,333
Eh.

167
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,492
You expressed it so well.

168
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,800
Just hearing you saying it properly like this
makes me feel relieved.

169
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:24,433
I think it's so cool.

170
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,267
He doesn't take me as a woman to like

171
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:33,133
but as a human being
which I appreciate a lot.

172
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:34,833
But now...

173
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:40,467
(How to improve life without having sex)

174
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,967
I do hope he would like me
as a woman.

175
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,033
Then... I hope one day...

176
00:13:51,767 --> 00:13:53,833
- Don't run.
- Sorry!

177
00:14:01,267 --> 00:14:02,367
Satou.

178
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,867
I'm pregnant.

179
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,200
What should I do?

180
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,633
Who's the guy?

181
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,033
It's my boyfriend.

182
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:32,900
Your boyfriend?

183
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,233
He's a college student
who's one year older than me.

184
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,900
Have you talked about it with him?

185
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,367
And your mother?

186
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:47,333
I can't let her know!

187
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:51,867
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:57,500
It's because I can't talk about it with
my mom that I came to talk to you.

189
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,167
What should I do?

190
00:15:04,633 --> 00:15:08,233
Anyway, let's go to the doctor first.

191
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:30,667
Here you are.

192
00:15:31,567 --> 00:15:32,767
Thanks.

193
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,367
- I got something to tell you.
- Mhm?

194
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:42,933
A girl from our class came to me today
saying she might be pregnant.

195
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,400
Mhm.

196
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm so shocked.

197
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:51,133
But after seeing the doctor
it turned out to be a false positive.

198
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,867
The doctor said it's highly
possible that she isn't pregnant.

199
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,300
So she isn't pregnant?

200
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,467
Mhm, she's not.

201
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,033
But I told her
to pay attention to contraception.

202
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:04,667
But she told me the guy
said "I love you" to her.

203
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,533
So I told her.

204
00:16:09,633 --> 00:16:14,067
"A boy would dare to say anything
just to get a girl laid."

205
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,967
But she told me that:

206
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,500
"It just shows that he wants
me no matter what happens."

207
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,933
It's so shocking to
hear she said that.

208
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:25,200
Her eyes were twinkling.

209
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,000
Even though it's obvious that
the guy just wants to get with her.

210
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,933
But she is so happy because
the one she likes wants her.

211
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,200
Were you listening to me?

212
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,233
Ah, right
I got something to show you.

213
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,767
What's it?

214
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:42,933
Just come here.

215
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:54,033
Let's have some plants by the balcony.

216
00:16:54,133 --> 00:16:55,367
It looks great.

217
00:16:55,467 --> 00:16:56,433
Right?

218
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,633
Just nail wooden boards on the wall.

219
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:01,267
Then nail the frame on it.

220
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,233
Then you can alter it the way you like.

221
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:05,467
It's so great.

222
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,033
May I check other pieces?

223
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,133
Of course.

224
00:17:22,933 --> 00:17:25,900
Is this self-portrait? It looks great.

225
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,467
I have to go to bed.

226
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:34,600
Mhm, good night.

227
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,900
Good night.

228
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:05,567
"You can start from social media,
then you'd know you are not alone."

229
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:58,767
I am sorry.

230
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:02,200
I am so tired today.

231
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:09,833
Yuki.

232
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,567
Today I really want to do it.

233
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,233
Please.

234
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:29,800
I am a woman.

235
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,300
Am I so unattractive to you?

236
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:36,133
No, that's not the case.

237
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:39,100
But you don't come to me at all.

238
00:19:40,033 --> 00:19:42,300
Even if I took the first step you
always refuse to go further.

239
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:49,500
If I don't take the initiative
we will never make love.

240
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:52,800
If we continue like this,
our relationship won't work.

241
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,433
It can't last anymore like this.

242
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,900
Misaki, is that how you think?

243
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:05,133
Don't you?

244
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:07,767
I…

245
00:20:08,967 --> 00:20:12,100
I don't think sex is equal to love.

246
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,500
Or how about that?

247
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,200
The day after tomorrow is our
wedding anniversary, right?

248
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,700
How about that day?

249
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,100
On our wedding anniversary?

250
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:31,633
Mhm.

251
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:33,500
Doing it on that day.

252
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,567
We can do it just like
a normal couple would.

253
00:20:39,633 --> 00:20:40,867
I got it.

254
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:04,300
"Sex isn't love" This is how
I believe in what Yuuki said.

255
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:10,433
I think this is the reason that
he doesn't have sex with me.

256
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,033
But, if the anniversary
could be an unforgettable night...

257
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:35,700
Well...

258
00:21:37,867 --> 00:21:38,767
Today...

259
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,267
It's our anniversary.

260
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:48,100
Would you come home earlier?

261
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,200
Mhm... I will do my best.

262
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:56,900
I will buy a new bouquet
of flowers after work.

263
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,933
Mhm, thank you.

264
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,967
As long as tonight is
an unforgettable night...

265
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,733
Even if it's not our anniversary.

266
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,100
Yuuki is supposed to...

267
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,300
He's coming home so late...

268
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:31,267
Eh.

269
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:37,733
It's a man...

270
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:46,133
That is... actually a man, right?

271
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,767
(This is a work of fiction)

272
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:06,100
(Next Episode) So you
haven't treated me as a woman?

273
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,833
I can't do it at all because
I see you as a woman.

274
00:24:08,933 --> 00:24:12,467
Only someone like this can
satisfy my sexual preference.

275
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,867
Want to make love?

276
00:24:15,533 --> 00:24:17,133
I don't want to get divorced
