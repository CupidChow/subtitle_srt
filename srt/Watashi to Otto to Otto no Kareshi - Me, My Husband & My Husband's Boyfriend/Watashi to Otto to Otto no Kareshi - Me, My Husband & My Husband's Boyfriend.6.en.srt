1
00:00:02,833 --> 00:00:03,833
I don't like being this way...

2
00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:06,533
living while hiding my own true feelings.

3
00:00:07,567 --> 00:00:08,433
Ma'am.

4
00:00:10,433 --> 00:00:11,633
I like you.

5
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:32,533
Alright.

6
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:37,600
Alright.

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,933
Shyuuhei, take it easy.

8
00:00:42,967 --> 00:00:44,500
Alright, it's done.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,900
Good morning. Just a minute.

10
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,800
Good morning. Thank you.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,933
Good morning.

12
00:00:51,633 --> 00:00:52,767
Ma'am, your hair...

13
00:00:53,167 --> 00:00:53,967
Eh?

14
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:58,433
Ah... the york is broken.

15
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,067
You can't fry it like this.

16
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,933
Poached eggs need no turn-over.

17
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,267
Gotta get used to it sooner.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,067
It looks yummy

19
00:01:15,167 --> 00:01:17,933
I could've done it better.

20
00:01:18,033 --> 00:01:21,133
Well... Yuuki
you learn it from ma'am, don't you?

21
00:01:21,233 --> 00:01:23,933
And you? Haven't you done it yourself?

22
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,667
The ones I've dated
usually are good at cooking.

23
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,433
But...

24
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:34,267
The ones I only like with my heart
are Yuuki and ma'am.

25
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:41,333
So, you are very special to me.

26
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,967
"Me, My Husband & My Husband's Boyfriend"
(Episode 6)

27
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:46,000
Eh?

28
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,900
Weird, isn't it here?

29
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,133
Excuse me.

30
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,467
Coming.

31
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:13,133
Eh?

32
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:15,600
No way...

33
00:03:16,767 --> 00:03:18,767
Mio, long time no see.

34
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,733
Wow...

35
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,767
It's "Girls Who Pretend To Be Drunk"
(Girls Who Pretend To Be Drunk).

36
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,067
Amazing...

37
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,967
Ah, here you are

38
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,733
I remember you are called...

39
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:51,167
Ina Shyuuhei.

40
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:57,333
Ah...

41
00:03:57,967 --> 00:03:59,667
He's sort of my acquaintance.

42
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,600
I see.

43
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,767
Yes

44
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:06,567
I'm Naka Satori
You may call me ma'am Naka.

45
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:11,167
These two are my assistants
Kaneko Akiri and Kuroze Ryouko.

46
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,367
Nice to meet you.

47
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:16,567
- Hello.
- Alright.

48
00:04:17,067 --> 00:04:19,067
Let's have an interview.

49
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,633
- Come here, this way.
- Alright.

50
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,467
He's so pretty.

51
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:26,133
Does he have a girlfriend?

52
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:29,100
You'd better keep away from him.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,233
Why?

54
00:04:30,933 --> 00:04:32,033
I don't know, either.

55
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:40,267
Eh?

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,733
You live with Yuuki?

57
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:46,600
Ah... yes.

58
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,567
Mhm...

59
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,533
Eventually you'd like to tell me
what's on your mind, wouldn't you?

60
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:03,867
When did you find out the things about Yuuki?

61
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:10,133
As you introduced him to me
I felt something weird's going on.

62
00:05:13,567 --> 00:05:14,567
I see.

63
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,700
That's why you were so against this,
weren't you?

64
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,500
Then?

65
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,267
Do you divorce him?

66
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:25,600
No.

67
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,867
Now I live with Yuuki
and his lover together.

68
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:35,267
Are you serious?

69
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,667
I think this is the only way
everyone would be happy with.

70
00:05:39,767 --> 00:05:42,567
The relationship like this can't last long.

71
00:05:43,533 --> 00:05:45,833
This is not a share house case

72
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:48,200
- I know...
- You know nothing about it.

73
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:52,667
How do you do with sleeping?

74
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,900
Yuuki and I sleep in the bedroom.

75
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:01,133
The other one sleeps
on the sofa in the living room.

76
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:11,067
See, it's not an equilateral triangle.

77
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,867
The relationship like this is not even.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,067
You just want to oversee them, don't you?

79
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:23,433
Here.

80
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,700
Thanks.

81
00:06:29,633 --> 00:06:32,033
From now on, I'd sit here.

82
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,367
And... from today on
Shyuuhei also goes to sleep in the bedroom.

83
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,400
Eh, what's going on?

84
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:46,633
Yuuki only sleeps with me
Isn't it unfair?

85
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,200
Eh... is it so?

86
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,767
It is so. Just be this way.

87
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,200
Alright, I'm gonna dig in.

88
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,767
I'm gonna dig in.

89
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,767
- Ma'am.
- Mhm?

90
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,900
The light bulb by the sink isn't working.

91
00:07:18,433 --> 00:07:20,600
Spare ones might be in the closet in the room.

92
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,067
Alright. I go take it.

93
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:26,233
No.

94
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:31,367
I... let me do it.

95
00:07:57,533 --> 00:07:58,767
It's working.

96
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,600
Ma'am.

97
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,333
I'd better sleep on the sofa today, alright?

98
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,867
Do you force yourself to do so?

99
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:26,833
I think this is the best way.

100
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:30,767
But... you still can't accept it
from your heart, can you?

101
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,633
- Just like earlier...
- Sorry...

102
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:40,533
It suddenly hits me that I don't want
Shyuuhei to come into our bedroom.

103
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,867
So I was...

104
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,033
An equilateral triangle.

105
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:55,100
Just clean up the next room
and I will sleep there.

106
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,800
Let's do it, shall we?

107
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:02,533
Alright... it must be working.

108
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:06,033
Ma'am Naka.

109
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:08,500
Good morning.

110
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,767
Good morning, what happened to you?

111
00:09:10,867 --> 00:09:13,967
Nothing. I just feel the weather is nice.

112
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,967
Mhm.

113
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,467
One wave is not over yet,
another wave rises though.

114
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:47,967
It makes me disturbed. I'm so scared.

115
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,633
Did I offend someone?

116
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,633
Do you want to call the police?

117
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:00,967
I don't want to make a fuss.

118
00:10:01,933 --> 00:10:04,633
It's not easy to get balanced like right now.

119
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,333
If it would affect the balance of our lives
I wouldn't want to call the police.

120
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:13,400
You want to protect your
marriage regardless of this?

121
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,333
I'm home.

122
00:10:18,067 --> 00:10:19,567
Eh, we got guests?

123
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:23,267
He always comes home
as I got serious with something.

124
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,667
You are home now.

125
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:25,767
Misaki.

126
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:28,267
- Excuse me…
- Do you like coriander?

127
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:30,333
- Yes…
- Wonderful

128
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:32,733
I bring some coriander after photographing.

129
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's have tomato coriander hot pot, shall we?

130
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,167
I'm not making fun with it.

131
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:39,833
It's really a hot pot with coriander.

132
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:47,833
- All in.
- Wow, so much.

133
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:50,367
- You do bring a lot home.
- That's right.

134
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,767
It tastes really great.

135
00:10:51,867 --> 00:10:53,033
It's no bragging.

136
00:10:55,367 --> 00:10:57,200
How long does it take?

137
00:10:57,433 --> 00:10:58,300
Just a second.

138
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,667
- Just a second.
- Mhm.

139
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:18,600
What is ma'am doing?

140
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,767
She's figuring out how to
draw the leading role's expression.

141
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,333
Eh…

142
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,100
No way, I can't do it.

143
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
Alright. I go make some tea.

144
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,700
Let me do it.

145
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,567
No. Whoever gets the idea goes it here.

146
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:35,667
Alright, thanks.

147
00:11:36,267 --> 00:11:38,233
Perhaps I still need your help.

148
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,200
You come to prepare
some pastries for tea, alright?

149
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,667
- Certainly.
- Great.

150
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,467
Let's go…

151
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:48,267
Why on earth a handsome guy like him
would come here to work?

152
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,067
Excuse me, did you mean
"to work at a place like here"?

153
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,167
I'm sorry…

154
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:55,267
Shyuuhei, let's get some time to drink.

155
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:57,533
Only two of us can do.

156
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,467
- Alright.
- Are you sure?

157
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:03,333
Well…

158
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,600
You have to be careful.

159
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
He would like all the people at the same time.

160
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,067
-Eh？
-Is it so?

161
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:17,567
Mhm…

162
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,500
Although not really everyone can do.

163
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,767
It's sort of my love tendency.

164
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,567
A handsome has such a love tendency.

165
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,700
So amazing.

166
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,267
Alright, enjoy.

167
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:31,833
- Alright.
- Have some.

168
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,567
- Here is tea.
- Just put here.

169
00:12:34,667 --> 00:12:36,200
- Alright.
- Come here.

170
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,833
- Just a second.
- Okay.

171
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,667
- Shyuuhei, come here.
- Alright.

172
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:40,867
- Come.
- Yes.

173
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:41,967
Alright.

174
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,100
Well... Mio.

175
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,667
- Okay.
- Here you are.

176
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,067
- Alright.
- Mio, come to have some.

177
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,833
What's the matter? You look so serious
Come here.

178
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,600
These are from the new open store.

179
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,033
- Alright.
- Ryouko is so great.

180
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,333
Isn't she?

181
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:59,567
- It looks so yummy.
- That's right.

182
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,033
It feels better than the previous store.

183
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,567
Is it so?

184
00:13:05,667 --> 00:13:07,233
It definitely goes

185
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,367
35 degrees would so. Just try it.

186
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,533
Thank you, everyone
You take care of the rest.

187
00:13:11,633 --> 00:13:13,567
Not yet, give me a second.

188
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,000
- Not yet.
- Come on.

189
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,933
Sorry, I got things to do tonight.

190
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,267
Me, too.

191
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,400
Are you sure you got everything?

192
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,433
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

193
00:13:34,233 --> 00:13:36,933
I thought we wouldn't have done it all.

194
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,633
The collaboration is so powerful.

195
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:45,500
I want to know

196
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:49,033
if we are going to celebrate later?

197
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,300
Yeah.

198
00:13:52,733 --> 00:13:54,500
Can I go to your place?

199
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:56,600
No.

200
00:13:57,133 --> 00:13:59,033
I share the flat with others.

201
00:14:00,133 --> 00:14:01,167
With your girlfriend?

202
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,333
No. I live with a woman
and a man.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,233
They are friends?

204
00:14:10,033 --> 00:14:13,667
These two are the ones I take seriously with.

205
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,600
I see.

206
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:24,133
You are still doing the same thing.

207
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,767
Just like two people at the same time

208
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,867
which is not real love.

209
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,833
I think...

210
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,300
love is not necessarily
limited to be one on one.

211
00:14:56,267 --> 00:14:59,267
Even though you say so, I still can't get it.

212
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,867
Mio, you do like children, don't you?

213
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,433
You once said you wanted to
have your own kids, didn't you?

214
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:14,400
Mhm.

215
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,833
You must treasure your kids very much, right?

216
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,700
Definitely.

217
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:25,967
So... if you have two kids

218
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:28,633
which one would you prefer?
Which one would you love more?

219
00:15:30,767 --> 00:15:34,700
As you saying which one...
I certainly love both of them

220
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,900
I would love them both no matter how.

221
00:15:40,467 --> 00:15:44,500
No matter how many children you have
your love to them wouldn't be different.

222
00:15:45,433 --> 00:15:46,900
This is called "being normal", isn't it?

223
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:52,000
But...

224
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,667
the so-called "normal" love

225
00:15:55,433 --> 00:15:58,233
is only allowed to
love one opposite sex, isn't it?

226
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,133
Yeah.

227
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:05,033
In my case.

228
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,167
I wouldn't understand such "normality".

229
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,767
Even though I fall in love with many people

230
00:16:14,633 --> 00:16:18,133
my sincerity to them is all the same.

231
00:16:19,467 --> 00:16:21,367
There's no difference.

232
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,633
Well... I know this is hard to understand.

233
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,333
But this is the way I am.

234
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:34,900
I can't help with it.

235
00:16:38,433 --> 00:16:40,167
Can you accept it?

236
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,733
This is not the same case as having children.

237
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:49,267
Living with two people you love
at the same time, the situation like this...

238
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:52,067
if I were you, I can't take it.

239
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:05,200
So yummy.

240
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,800
Yuuki hates coriander.

241
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:11,167
So we don't have this at home.

242
00:17:12,133 --> 00:17:14,100
I can make it for you any time you want.

243
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,933
Well... something sad happened to you?

244
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,367
Maki hasn't told you about it?

245
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:38,200
Well... she's tight-lipped.

246
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:40,567
I see.

247
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,533
You can come by any time.

248
00:17:54,767 --> 00:17:57,133
Just having something great
would cheer you up, wouldn't it?

249
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,333
Thank you.

250
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,833
Are you sure?

251
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:08,933
Is it really so?

252
00:18:09,033 --> 00:18:11,633
Certainly. No bragging.

253
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,333
- Thank you.
- Mhm.

254
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:16,267
Say hello to Maki.

255
00:18:16,367 --> 00:18:18,067
Alright, come by any time.

256
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:20,033
Mhm. Good night.

257
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,133
- Good night.
- See you.

258
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,200
Mhm.

259
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,267
You are home.

260
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:56,033
I'm home. You are still up?

261
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,033
Mhm.

262
00:18:57,567 --> 00:18:59,700
How's it? Going to Maki's.

263
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,633
So much fun. We had some wine as well.

264
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:05,533
Want some water?

265
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,433
Mhm, thank you.

266
00:19:17,733 --> 00:19:18,967
Here you are.

267
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:28,967
The guy was…

268
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:30,467
Eh？.

269
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:35,800
Sorry, I looked down as I heard your voice.

270
00:19:37,633 --> 00:19:40,567
He's Maki's roommate
He's Takigawa Daiichi.

271
00:19:41,233 --> 00:19:43,133
He accompanies me home for being so late.

272
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,800
- I see.
- He's a very interesting person.

273
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,300
He's a photographer who loves cooking.

274
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,467
We had a lot of coriander today.

275
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,667
Fortunately, I was not there.

276
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,300
Then... I'd go to bed now.

277
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:12,567
Good night.

278
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,533
This is not the same case as having children.

279
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,733
Living with two people
you love at the same time

280
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,167
the situation like this...

281
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:06,133
If I were you, I can't take it.

282
00:21:52,133 --> 00:21:53,333
Yuuki…

283
00:23:09,967 --> 00:23:11,200
Thanks…

284
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:44,900
Let me sleep more

285
00:23:57,933 --> 00:24:01,967
(This is a work of fiction)

286
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:05,700
(NEXT EPISODE)
Come on, back to normal as soon as possible.

287
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,533
Just let her go, can't you?

288
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:08,600
Do you fall in love with me?

289
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:13,267
Why can't I control my feelings?

290
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:16,333
We can make it... definitely...
