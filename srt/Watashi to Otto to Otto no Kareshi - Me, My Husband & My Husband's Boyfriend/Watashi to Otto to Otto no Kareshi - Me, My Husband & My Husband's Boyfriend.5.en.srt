1
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,967
(One year ago)

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,433
The first person I liked was a boy.

3
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:37,983
But the first one I dated was a girl.

4
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,267
As long as I like someone

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,533
to me, there is no difference

6
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:46,467
whether they're a boy or a girl.

7
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,533
To me, this idea...

8
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:52,933
- Hello.
- Is "normal".

9
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:57,467
Rikako.

10
00:00:59,133 --> 00:01:00,467
Slow down.

11
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,733
Got it. I'll be there soon.

12
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,100
Honestly, I can't take it.

13
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:21,233
- Excuse me, Rikako wants me...
- I don't want this.

14
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:22,833
Don't go.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,467
I want you to just look at me.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,533
When you confessed your feelings to me.

17
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:36,533
I already told you all this.

18
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,300
Did't you accept it
and then we started to be together?

19
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:49,933
Accept?

20
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,433
Do I accept that you have
someone else in your heart?

21
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:56,867
Do I accept you are with me
but you'd like someone else as well?

22
00:01:57,533 --> 00:02:00,067
Do I accept that you wouldn't
just have me as your partner?

23
00:02:01,033 --> 00:02:03,200
How would I accept something like this?

24
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,567
So... you've been lying to me?

25
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:11,067
It's all because I like you!

26
00:02:12,267 --> 00:02:16,467
I hope you'd like only me
after we were started to date.

27
00:02:17,733 --> 00:02:19,567
That's why I told you
all that beforehand...

28
00:02:19,667 --> 00:02:21,533
What's going on with this woman?

29
00:02:23,091 --> 00:02:24,591
She understands me.

30
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:27,500
Even if she does...

31
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,333
The fact is she can't accept it,
so she calls you, doesn't she?

32
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:34,333
Well...

33
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:39,867
Shyuuhei, you might not understand it.

34
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:44,559
When someone likes someone else,
they want to keep them for themselves.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,733
Normally speaking, a person would
want their beloved to only be with them.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,333
Then that means...

37
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,767
I'm not normal?

38
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,467
It's alright if you'd like
someone else as well.

39
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,300
But does it mean.

40
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:15,967
I can see someone else?

41
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:21,907
No... I don't mean cheating.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,233
Well... it must be someone
you also take seriously.

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,933
It's not alright like this I suppose.

44
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:32,300
You'll catch a cold like this.

45
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:39,800
Don't you have a place to stay?

46
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:47,400
I do like... your smile.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,367
Eh?

48
00:03:52,562 --> 00:03:56,467
Someone I know smiles the same way you do.

49
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:10,467
"Me, My Husband and My Husband's Boyfriend"
(Episode 5)

50
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,967
No matter how hard I try
I just can't figure it out.

51
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,500
What's it all about?

52
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:27,167
You are allowed to like only one person.

53
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,633
Then you may not like someone else
There's a rule like this.

54
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,667
Also

55
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,533
you are not allowed to like
many people at the same time.

56
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:42,933
When you like someone

57
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:46,467
it would be seen as cheating
if you like someone else.

58
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:52,700
Since it is a rule,
it means it is a normal situation.

59
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,400
This is the rule to sustain the normality.

60
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,700
It's the rule to make normal people

61
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,200
enjoy their normal happiness.

62
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,800
Yes, it sounds a bit weird.

63
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,833
Really? You really think so?

64
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:24,133
It seems like it's something that
you have to regulate with rules

65
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:26,552
for it to be regarded as
being normal, doesn't it?

66
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,667
Yes, exactly.

67
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:35,867
But...

68
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,367
everyone dislikes this unnormal me.

69
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,767
They want to keep me away.

70
00:06:53,767 --> 00:06:55,100
This is true.

71
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,133
Eh?

72
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:03,333
I said something like
that when I was little.

73
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:07,400
I told this to my imaginary friends.

74
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,967
I said something weird, didn't I?
Sorry about that.

75
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:20,333
I got it.

76
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,933
I've always want to have a friend like this.

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,533
But...

78
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:42,833
I am really warm, am I not?

79
00:07:42,933 --> 00:07:44,467
I mean my body.

80
00:07:50,533 --> 00:07:52,200
At that time, I didn't know

81
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,274
this guy is Mrs. Misaki's husband.

82
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,800
I didn't expect things
would turn out like this...

83
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:07,467
Yuuki?

84
00:08:08,167 --> 00:08:09,233
Yuuki.

85
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,575
No way. You can't die like this.

86
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:20,467
Do I... really want to die？.

87
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,967
I just...

88
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,467
want to disappear.

89
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,567
It's alright. Dying is alright.

90
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,467
How about... we three just die together?

91
00:08:42,533 --> 00:08:43,367
Eh?

92
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,133
Let's go.

93
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:53,333
Hold on. Where are we heading to?

94
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,767
Didn't I just say it? Let's die somewhere.

95
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:20,967
Alright, just die here.

96
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,000
Eh?

97
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,567
Alright, here we go.

98
00:09:31,467 --> 00:09:32,600
Do what I do.

99
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,667
Just lie down.

100
00:09:47,467 --> 00:09:48,633
Do it.

101
00:09:58,433 --> 00:10:01,833
Well, it's better to lie down slowly
if you do it for the first time.

102
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,700
Look.

103
00:10:21,733 --> 00:10:24,133
We are three dead bodies right now.

104
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,467
Dead bodies don't think

105
00:10:27,567 --> 00:10:28,933
and feel nothing, either.

106
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:33,233
Just lie down here quietly.

107
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:53,933
I'm sorry.

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,333
I haven't had anything since last night.

109
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,533
It's so cold.

110
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,867
It'd be freezing to death just lying here.

111
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,800
Come on.

112
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:09,933
Thank you.

113
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:14,733
- Here you are.
- It looks bad.

114
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,367
Alright.

115
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,300
Would you want to eat something at home?

116
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,900
Go buy an extra bowl, shall we?

117
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,433
I just want to ask you something.

118
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,567
How about we three start living together?

119
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:21,400
We were dead over there, weren't we?

120
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,733
Then we were alive again.

121
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,333
I know Yuuki would never cheat.

122
00:12:30,633 --> 00:12:32,567
It's not his nature.

123
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,367
So are you serious with him?

124
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:41,000
You do really... like Shyuuhei, don't you?

125
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,900
I don't want to force you
to make up your mind.

126
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,200
Although I'm not content with it.

127
00:12:51,133 --> 00:12:54,067
I do think the one Yuuki
really needs now is Shyuuhie.

128
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,933
Just me isn't enough.

129
00:12:58,267 --> 00:12:59,433
Ma'am...

130
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:01,367
Don't misunderstand me

131
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:04,133
I still like Yuuki right now

132
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:06,433
I also want to be him forever.

133
00:13:08,733 --> 00:13:10,167
So

134
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,967
I want to find a way for us three
to get along well.

135
00:13:17,367 --> 00:13:18,833
Are the udon noodles done?

136
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:29,000
Done.

137
00:13:30,533 --> 00:13:31,867
Better with an egg.

138
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,233
Let me do it.

139
00:13:48,533 --> 00:13:51,733
By the way, it's a rare opportunity
Let's drink something.

140
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:53,100
Eh?

141
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,733
Bottom up.

142
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,133
So great.

143
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:08,367
Ma'am, are you really okay with it?

144
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:10,200
About the three of us living together.

145
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,167
Misaki, you're doing too much.

146
00:14:17,233 --> 00:14:19,833
How could I be okay with it?

147
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:24,700
But it's far better than
me lying to myself.

148
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,033
Misaki.

149
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:44,033
- Let me ask you something.
- Mhm?

150
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,467
Did you notice the missus' hands?

151
00:14:49,467 --> 00:14:50,600
Her hands were shivering.

152
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,933
I saw this happen before.

153
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,533
When I discussed my future with a teacher

154
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:01,567
who kept asking me to go
to excellent colleges.

155
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,033
At that time
Mrs. Misaki stood up for me.

156
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,700
Her hands were shivering then.

157
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:13,167
She must've taken so much
courage to do so.

158
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,467
I am such an idiot.

159
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,167
If I knew it'd be like this...

160
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,100
If I had talked about this with her first...

161
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,133
she'd have definitely accepted me.

162
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,733
Just as I've alreays thought.

163
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,267
Misaki is really great.

164
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,300
Alright.

165
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:39,967
It's not locked.

166
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:45,133
Excuse me.

167
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:48,667
Welcome.

168
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,633
So, we have to set rules to live together.

169
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:08,167
First, we would pay the rent.

170
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,300
Eh, I don't need to pay my share?

171
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,767
It's me who invited
you to do so, after all.

172
00:17:13,367 --> 00:17:15,733
Well, thank you so much.

173
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,733
But you have to help with chores as well.

174
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:22,800
Well... I'm not sure if I can do it well.

175
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,133
Just do as much as you can

176
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,433
I got it.

177
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:29,100
But I'd pay for materials for meals.

178
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,267
Is it alright with your work?

179
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,467
Mhm... well

180
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,190
what's going on with this interview?

181
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,467
Do you work hard towards your dream?

182
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,433
Eh?

183
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:44,133
I've checked the occupation
of illustrator as you mentioned.

184
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,033
You can't make a living
by that so far, can you?

185
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,833
Well... that's right.

186
00:17:50,933 --> 00:17:54,067
So, I talked about this with Yuuki.

187
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,467
Would you want to work
as an assistant for a manga artist?

188
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,167
For a manga artist?

189
00:17:58,267 --> 00:18:00,467
Yuuki's sister is a manga artist.

190
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:01,700
Alright.

191
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,567
Naka Satori, do you know her?

192
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,233
I do. His sister is Naka Satori?

193
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,667
Wow, she's great!

194
00:18:06,821 --> 00:18:09,221
I know you haven't thought
of being a manga artist.

195
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:11,867
But if you'd give it a try,
Yuuki said he could ask her for you.

196
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:13,667
Really?

197
00:18:15,433 --> 00:18:16,367
Yes.

198
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,233
That's it.

199
00:18:19,733 --> 00:18:21,700
I'm going out for some shopping.

200
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,500
Take care.

201
00:18:32,467 --> 00:18:35,167
Just put these together.

202
00:18:40,951 --> 00:18:43,017
Excuse me.

203
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,500
I didn't know there would be flowers
blossoming in the winter.

204
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:19,440
Actually they do.

205
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,233
There are flowers that can bear coldness.

206
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:26,967
Hey...

207
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,267
You're not actually
happy about this, are you?

208
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,233
About introducing me
to work for your sister.

209
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,300
No, that's not it.

210
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,207
But you haven't brought this up
to your family, have you?

211
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,300
About yourself...

212
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,733
I think...

213
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,267
I might be gay.

214
00:19:46,467 --> 00:19:49,467
You said it as if it were
the end of the world.

215
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm not sure about it myself

216
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,458
I am also afraid to tell my wife.

217
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:58,933
So I just keep running away from her love.

218
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:03,067
I know it will hurt her feelings.

219
00:20:04,633 --> 00:20:07,733
But I'm just so scared to make it public.

220
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,667
Why are you scared?

221
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,900
Why do you ask me why?

222
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,400
It's nothing bad to figure out,

223
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:22,167
you have specific sexual preferrence.

224
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,833
It's nothing weird, is it?

225
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:32,467
But you're scared to
figure out your true self.

226
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,467
It is just weird, isn't it?

227
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,367
I'm sorry

228
00:20:44,133 --> 00:20:46,033
my mindset is not that strong.

229
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,233
Although I don't like to lie

230
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:56,567
I am sure I won't say
something unnecessary.

231
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,033
I think my sister...
wouldn't mind this...

232
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,800
She wouldn't?

233
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,967
Hello, sister.

234
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:22,833
I want to know

235
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,367
what that blue building is.

236
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:26,633
Which blue one?

237
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:28,733
You see, the one with smoke coming out.

238
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:30,167
Oh yeah?

239
00:21:30,267 --> 00:21:32,533
Yes, it's over there.

240
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,333
You mean that one.

241
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,833
- What's that?
- The small one?

242
00:21:37,933 --> 00:21:39,533
It's the big one.

243
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,100
- Where are you looking at?
- Oh yeah?

244
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,467
It's over there.

245
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,033
-Ah... that one
What's that?

246
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,233
The two of us....

247
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,000
like the same person, right?

248
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:14,867
Ma'am.

249
00:22:17,433 --> 00:22:20,800
I won't sleep with Yuuki.

250
00:22:21,867 --> 00:22:22,700
Eh?

251
00:22:25,167 --> 00:22:28,100
I don't want to do anything
that hurts your feelings.

252
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,733
Because...

253
00:22:35,467 --> 00:22:37,433
I do like you with my heart.

254
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:48,367
I like you, Yuuki.

255
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,067
Eh?

256
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,400
Do you want to be with me?

257
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:02,833
The worst thing is...

258
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:09,233
that this world doesn't let
peoeple face their true selves.

259
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:16,033
I don't want to hide my own feelings.

260
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,367
I really don't like being this way.

261
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,133
Just existing while hiding their true feelings.

262
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:52,533
Ma'am.

263
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,167
I like you.

264
00:23:58,733 --> 00:24:02,767
(This is a work of fiction)

265
00:24:03,533 --> 00:24:05,300
(NEXT EPISODE)
You haven't pulled yourself together, have you?

266
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,033
Ah, it's broken.

267
00:24:07,133 --> 00:24:10,033
Yuuki sleeps with me all the time
It's not fair, isn't it?

268
00:24:10,133 --> 00:24:11,133
Long time no see.

269
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:12,000
Are you kidding?

270
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,833
Misaki, is it possible that
you just want to keep watching them?

271
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,567
You may come to my house any time.

272
00:24:16,667 --> 00:24:17,633
No way!
