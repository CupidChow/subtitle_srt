1
00:00:09,567 --> 00:00:10,500
Don't go back.

2
00:00:12,367 --> 00:00:17,067
As for Misaki, I appreciate her
and love her very much.

3
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:18,567
But…

4
00:00:19,133 --> 00:00:20,733
I still want to touch you.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,567
I can't help it.

6
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:29,300
The one I think of is you, not Misaki.

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:39,000
My own feelings...
Why can't I control my feelings?

8
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,900
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:56,733 --> 00:00:58,733
I think I fall in love with you.

10
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:02,367
I like you.

11
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:08,700
I think…

12
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:11,833
I can make you happy.

13
00:01:11,933 --> 00:01:13,633
- So…
- I…

14
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm married.

15
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,767
So…

16
00:01:22,933 --> 00:01:24,667
I hope you leave your husband…

17
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,633
and be with me.

18
00:02:30,667 --> 00:02:35,133
(Me, My Husband, and His Boyfriend
Episode Eight)

19
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,133
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

20
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:51,533
Yesterday... you were coming home late.

21
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,367
Yeah. I drank a bit more at Maki's.

22
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,000
I see...

23
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:01,933
Was it fun?

24
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,367
Mhm.

25
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:07,833
By the way.

26
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,367
Let's have a Christmas tree this year,
shall we?

27
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,167
Eh？.

28
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,100
If so, let's have a Christmas party
besides a Christmas tree, shall we?

29
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,067
Yeah.

30
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:22,867
My husabnd…

31
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,600
Yuuki, he is someone irreplaceable to me.

32
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:31,933
If you insist that I should make the choice…

33
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,067
I will choose Yuuki.

34
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,100
Didn't you go there last time?

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,533
- You mean that exhibition?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:48,633 --> 00:03:50,567
- You want to go as well?
- Nope.

37
00:03:50,667 --> 00:03:53,467
- She must be fond of it.
- Definitely.

38
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,900
- You have to see it yourself.
- Eh？.

39
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,300
- It's very special.
- Is it still on?

40
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,700
- The booth you said, where is it?
- Probably at the right side.

41
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,233
At the right side?

42
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:01,533
I think so.

43
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:03,600
-Don't you have lunch? Take it
You‘ll definitely like it.

44
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,033
- Ah, thank you, ma'am.
- Just do it.

45
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,800
- I will have a meal after drawing some more.
- It's not bad.

46
00:04:09,867 --> 00:04:11,767
This character looks like Yuuki.

47
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:17,833
Does it?
Honestly, I don't draw someone specific.

48
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,233
So it's painting without realizing what it is...

49
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,967
No... I just draw everything that comes to my mind.

50
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:45,900
(Sister, Satori)
(Would you want to have a drink once a while?)

51
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,300
Ina Shyuuhei.

52
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,233
He's pretty apt. And gets along with
other colleagues well in a very short time.

53
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,700
He got into the swing of things.

54
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:06,033
So... it's great.

55
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:08,167
Where did you meet him?

56
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,933
Where is the place...

57
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:12,967
I don't remember, either.

58
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,767
I heard you all live together, right?

59
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,433
For some reasons, he stays with us.

60
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,567
Mhm.

61
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,933
How about Misaki, is she alright?

62
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:28,967
She's alright
He's also Misaki's then-student.

63
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,167
I see…

64
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:40,333
Many things happened, I suppose.

65
00:05:43,167 --> 00:05:45,033
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

66
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,000
- One more, please.
- Yes.

67
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:51,133
By the way, sis
Are you going home in January?

68
00:05:51,233 --> 00:05:52,633
Do you think I would go back there?

69
00:05:53,467 --> 00:05:54,467
I got it.

70
00:05:55,233 --> 00:05:59,867
"Unmarried person can't be counted as independent"
A home holds with such cliche...

71
00:05:59,967 --> 00:06:01,767
No one would want to be there.

72
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:11,533
You don't need to go back
just because you are the oldest son.

73
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:13,900
Mhm.

74
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,133
If you do so, you will get hurt.

75
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,867
Isn't it awful?

76
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,800
The most important thing
is to protect yourself.

77
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,133
Yeah.

78
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:31,633
You have to put the happiness of yours
and Misaki's at the first place.

79
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:37,133
The happiness of mine and Misaki's…

80
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:40,733
What's the matter？.

81
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:44,767
What if we both regard things for each other

82
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:48,100
and can't find the happiness?

83
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:51,033
How should we do?

84
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:58,467
It's alright. Ignore me.

85
00:06:58,567 --> 00:06:59,733
It's just alright.

86
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:06,233
Here comes again, You just take
everything on your shoulders.

87
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,033
You haven't changed even a bit at all.

88
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,133
It's not easy for a person
to change himself overnight.

89
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,233
Although this might not be the answer to it...

90
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,767
But you can't just think about things.

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,033
You have to find out the answer and put it
into action after thinking about it.

92
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
Ma'am.

93
00:07:42,133 --> 00:07:43,833
You scare me.

94
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:46,667
It's very dangerous
as you are absent-minded like this.

95
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:53,767
Ma'am.

96
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:56,867
You're dodging me, aren't you?

97
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,600
No, I'm not.

98
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,967
Or is it possible...

99
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,633
Because I kissed you?

100
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:11,767
Shyuuhei.

101
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,433
Were you dazed with sleep at that time?

102
00:08:17,533 --> 00:08:19,667
It was so in the beginning.

103
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,933
Then I was awake.

104
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:27,767
I found out it was you I was kissing
at the last two second.

105
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,233
But I didn't stop it.

106
00:08:32,633 --> 00:08:36,133
Then... just take it as a dream.

107
00:08:37,933 --> 00:08:39,167
But…

108
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:42,467
you accepted the kiss
at that time, didn't you?

109
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:50,567
I feel truly happy when I kissed you.

110
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,300
Don't say things like this

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,933
I'm just being honest…

112
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,467
Shyuuhei.

113
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:03,567
I only regard you as my student.

114
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:08,367
This hasn't changed a bit from then till now.

115
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,967
So, stop doing this.

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,133
Oh really…

117
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:26,267
I got it.

118
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,567
Alright.

119
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,433
Can you help me put these decorations on it?

120
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,433
Mhm.

121
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:53,033
At the Christmas party
let's exchange presents, shall we?

122
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,133
Okay

123
00:09:56,467 --> 00:10:00,500
I'll think of what to send to you.

124
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,200
You have to think about the presents, too.

125
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:15,333
Are you alright?？.

126
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:17,633
Why do you say so?

127
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,500
It's because you think about other things.

128
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm fine.

129
00:10:25,867 --> 00:10:29,333
Your "I'm fine" is worrying.

130
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,400
I hope you can realize yourself.

131
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,700
Although I'm not so dependable

132
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,400
you may come to me any time.

133
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,167
Don't hang in there alone.

134
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:56,567
Ma'am Naka, woudl you
send gifts to your husband?

135
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:58,667
Well... I will for sure.

136
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:00,167
So great…

137
00:11:00,267 --> 00:11:03,333
You may drink tasty wine
while exchanging gifts at the same time.

138
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:06,467
Such a lovely night.

139
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:10,933
Look, I was dumped yesterday.

140
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,967
Although we met via a dating app

141
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,233
she just ran away as soon as she saw me.

142
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:18,867
Would you have the meal together?

143
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:19,967
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

144
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:21,167
Shyuuhei would like to go together?

145
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:24,700
Ah... I will stay
to draw some more.

146
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,433
Is it so?

147
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,467
Then I stay by your side.

148
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:31,233
- You're so full of yourself.
- Am I?

149
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,067
Thank you…

150
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:35,067
-See you tomorrow/-Thank you.

151
00:11:38,433 --> 00:11:40,267
Well…

152
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,233
I think it's time for you
to set Misaki free, isn't it?

153
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:11,267
Coming.

154
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,233
Hello.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,367
I'm Nakamishi Misaki's husband.

156
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:31,167
Nice to meet you.

157
00:12:39,767 --> 00:12:41,567
If it's alright to you, enjoy it.

158
00:12:44,167 --> 00:12:47,667
Maki... she was just being here.

159
00:12:48,633 --> 00:12:49,467
No.

160
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,900
Today... I come here for you.

161
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,433
Yeah... is it so?

162
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:03,867
Recently... my wife comes here very often
I'm sorry about it.

163
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,800
It's alright.

164
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:09,433
I feel quite happy to talk to her.

165
00:13:14,567 --> 00:13:15,633
By the way

166
00:13:19,367 --> 00:13:21,167
hand this to her for me, please.

167
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:23,900
I forgot to give it to her last time.

168
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,767
Excuse me…

169
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:48,200
Excuse me, do you like Misaki?

170
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,133
Yes, I do.

171
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,467
Are you serious about it?

172
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,800
I am.

173
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,967
And you?

174
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:10,800
I do like her

175
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,433
but she only wants you.

176
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,900
But... you know things about me
via Misaki and Maki, don't you?

177
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Maki？.

178
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,100
I don't know what she talks to you.

179
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:26,333
But she didn't tell me anything about it.

180
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,300
Well…
It's better for you to hand it to her.

181
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,433
Just as I said.

182
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,167
I like Misaki.

183
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,467
Even it is so
you still want me to take it to her?

184
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:51,733
To me…

185
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,233
It's alright.

186
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,433
You were here？.

187
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,733
Mhm.

188
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,333
Then why didn't you come out?

189
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:22,667
I got a feeling that if I am not here
and you would talk about your true feelings.

190
00:15:27,367 --> 00:15:31,667
Even though two people love each other
their happiness is not always guaranted…

191
00:15:32,267 --> 00:15:34,567
Whom are you guys talking about?

192
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,367
It's alright. Instead of
pursuing one's happiness

193
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:41,100
they would rather hope
the other one is happy.

194
00:15:54,667 --> 00:15:58,133
(Misaki)
(I'm coming home soon)

195
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,467
You scare me.

196
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:12,967
Here you are.

197
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,067
Mhm？.

198
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:19,767
Eh... what's the matter with you?

199
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,333
Hold on…

200
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,767
Hold on, Yuuki
What's going on with you?

201
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,833
Hold on…

202
00:16:28,367 --> 00:16:30,433
Don't you know me?

203
00:16:33,267 --> 00:16:35,433
Wait... wait a second.

204
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:52,033
I'm home.

205
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:21,367
Yuuki…

206
00:17:41,133 --> 00:17:42,733
Yuuki.

207
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,533
This is not you.

208
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,900
I am doing as you said.

209
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:03,633
Eh…

210
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:06,833
If I can realize myself

211
00:18:07,767 --> 00:18:09,933
can I depend on you?

212
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:19,467
This is the real me.

213
00:18:34,633 --> 00:18:36,233
It's alright…

214
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,867
It's alright…

215
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,967
With love is enough...

216
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,933
About tonight's Christmas party
I look forward to it very much.

217
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,367
I will prepare a great meal
Don't sneak to eat outside.

218
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:44,767
Okay.

219
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:57,500
Okay... it's done.

220
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,367
Come on, please.

221
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:01,467
So fast.

222
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,833
Ms. Akari, are there more?

223
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:03,867
Eh？.

224
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:07,133
Your high efficiency is amazing

225
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:11,167
I would feel much relieved
if every time can be so high efficiency.

226
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,667
It's done.

227
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:55,967
So…

228
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,733
Cheers…

229
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,833
The wine tastes so great.

230
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,667
- Is it a good wine?
- It's the most expensive one.

231
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:10,200
The most expensive?

232
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,333
Misaki, you are so great
You are doing so well.

233
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:15,100
It took a lot of time today.

234
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,933
They look so great
I'm gonna eat it.

235
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,433
By the way, as I am remembering it now.

236
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,967
Here you are. It's for you two.

237
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:29,567
Don't you like it?

238
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:36,333
I think this is very wonderful.

239
00:22:36,433 --> 00:22:37,633
Mhm.

240
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,367
Eh... but you don't look
very happy about it.

241
00:22:44,933 --> 00:22:46,067
Thank you.

242
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:47,933
Mhm.

243
00:22:50,633 --> 00:22:54,400
I also prepare a gift for you.

244
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,633
Me, too.

245
00:23:07,033 --> 00:23:08,833
Wow…

246
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,033
Just open it.

247
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,200
(Divorce Application)

248
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:52,067
(Divorce Application)

249
00:23:58,033 --> 00:24:02,033
(This is a work of fiction)

250
00:24:02,633 --> 00:24:03,867
(Next Episode)
Why would you divorce?

251
00:24:03,967 --> 00:24:05,933
I couldn't withhold myself at that time

252
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,700
I want to be loved as a woman.

253
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,833
So... you may understand my feelings
more or less, right?

254
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:16,600
I make my wife burdened
with my happiness
