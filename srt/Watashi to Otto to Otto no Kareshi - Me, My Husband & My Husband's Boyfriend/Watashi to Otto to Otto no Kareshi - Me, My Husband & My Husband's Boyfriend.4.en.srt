1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,833
I am sorry.

2
00:00:04,933 --> 00:00:06,667
Why are you saying sorry?

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,467
Because...

4
00:00:09,116 --> 00:00:13,383
Even though the situation
ended up like this... I still like you.

5
00:00:15,033 --> 00:00:16,533
I still want to be with you.

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:22,000
This time.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,233
I want to devote my life to you.

8
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:30,500
Yuuki.

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,200
Just come with me.

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,833
Eh... hold on...

11
00:00:46,133 --> 00:00:50,300
I don't want to... cheat on Misaki.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,767
So... we won't each other anymore.

13
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,533
Is this what you want?

14
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,833
I've already made up my mind,
I won't make Misaki sad again

15
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm asking you,
Is this want you want?

16
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,867
I can't be like you,
liking lots of people at the same time.

17
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:14,933
I can't reciprocate your love.

18
00:01:20,567 --> 00:01:21,567
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:26,533
Oh yeah?

20
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:40,033
Then from now on,
you'll make love with her.

21
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:45,333
Such a liar.

22
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,833
(A good person)

23
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:09,000
"Me, My Husband and My Husband's Boyfriend"
(Episode 4)

24
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,467
Good evening.

25
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,233
We're sorry to bother so late.

26
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,667
(Aomori Apple)

27
00:04:17,767 --> 00:04:19,033
May we come in?

28
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:20,167
Eh?

29
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,633
Alright.

30
00:04:24,033 --> 00:04:26,167
Excuse me.

31
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,367
Excuse me.

32
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,033
My family grows apples.

33
00:04:43,874 --> 00:04:47,840
They sent a lot of them to me,
and I want you to have a taste.

34
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:49,333
There are so many.

35
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,133
Daichi, thank you.

36
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:04,000
It smells nice.

37
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:11,333
Well...

38
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,867
May I take photos?

39
00:05:14,733 --> 00:05:15,600
Take photos?

40
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,367
Don't you specialize in landscape photos?

41
00:05:21,867 --> 00:05:23,833
Daichi is a photographer

42
00:05:23,933 --> 00:05:25,267
I see.

43
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:28,700
I also take photos of people
as long as they are beautiful.

44
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,433
You have a lot of gall! She's married.

45
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,300
Why do you sweet-talk a married lady?

46
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,700
What a shame.

47
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,567
So the problem is solved?

48
00:05:44,133 --> 00:05:45,033
Eh?

49
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,500
Because you haven't told me
what's going on back then.

50
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,367
Ah... sorry. You were also very concerned.

51
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,567
It's alright. Everything's great.

52
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:58,967
Where is Yuuki?

53
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,867
Eh?

54
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:02,633
I haven't seen him for a long time.

55
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,267
Excuse me, I am going out soon.

56
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,367
Soon?

57
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,633
Are you having a date with your husband?

58
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,900
I'm sorry about it...

59
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,659
Let's take it slowly next time.

60
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,833
It's rare for you to come around.
I am so sorry.

61
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,633
Alright, Daichi, let's go.

62
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:26,033
- Mhm.
- Alright.

63
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,567
So, see you next time.

64
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:40,967
Misaki is so good-looking.

65
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,467
Don't pretend you're
best buds with her.

66
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:44,533
No, I didn't.

67
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,733
Oh yeah?

68
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,833
- Eh, is it really so?
- Mhm.

69
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,967
Besides, you gave her too
many apples, didn't you?

70
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,767
- Did I?
- Mhm.

71
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,000
Do you know him?

72
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,800
He's Misaki's husband.

73
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:04,867
Eh...

74
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,500
Wasn't he waiting for Misaki out there?

75
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,467
Maki, Misaki doesn't like to see you.

76
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,567
What?

77
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:19,367
Didn't Misaki insist to ask you to
leave, even going so far as to lie?

78
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,467
Only if only were as
simple as you say it is.

79
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,433
- I'm home.
- Here you are.

80
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:50,600
You worked overtime today?

81
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,900
- I'm gonna wash my hands.
- Alright.

82
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:07,967
Yuuki, want something to eat?

83
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:10,891
It's alright.

84
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:15,925
Did you have dinner with
someone else out there?

85
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,567
I was alone.

86
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,433
See.

87
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:20,200
This is a pair that I
share with my boyfriend.

88
00:09:20,674 --> 00:09:22,312
Is this the same as we
saw it in the magazine?

89
00:09:22,336 --> 00:09:22,874
Exactly.

90
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,133
Did your boyfriend buy this for you?

91
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,533
Such a lovely couple.

92
00:09:29,633 --> 00:09:30,867
- Right?
- You're so in love.

93
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,133
- Yeah.
- We love each other so much.

94
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:39,567
Ma'am.

95
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,867
Why are you so absent-minded?

96
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,367
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:47,133 --> 00:09:49,067
I came to school as I promised
Say something nice to me.

98
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:52,092
You are doing great.

99
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:56,500
Let's take photos for memory's sake.

100
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,300
Ma'am, smile.

101
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,167
Don't run.

102
00:10:02,267 --> 00:10:03,733
So cute.

103
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,900
- Got it?
- You took too many of them.

104
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,833
- Let's have some more.
- It's alright.

105
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,067
Alright, I gotta go.

106
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,367
Thank you.

107
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,400
(You have an unread message)

108
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,200
Mrs. Misaki.

109
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:52,967
Yes.

110
00:10:53,067 --> 00:10:54,133
Are you alright?

111
00:10:54,967 --> 00:10:56,167
Yes.

112
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,200
Do you have something on your mind?

113
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,067
No... I don't.

114
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:07,333
Can't you tell me about it?

115
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,833
I feel like you're a stranger to me.

116
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:15,300
I appreciate your caring for me.

117
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,933
But I'm really doing alright.

118
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:18,867
I see.

119
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:26,733
Ma'am.

120
00:12:28,867 --> 00:12:30,433
What are you doing here?

121
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,333
Shyuuhei...

122
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:39,200
Could it be... you're coming for me?

123
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:44,167
Please

124
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:47,533
never see Yuuki again.

125
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,567
Even if...

126
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,367
Yuuki wants to see me?

127
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:58,633
Ma'am.

128
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:01,067
If I wasn't here...

129
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:05,133
would you and Yuuki have a happy life?

130
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:08,133
Eh?

131
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:10,167
If I wasn't here...

132
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,933
would you have a happy life?

133
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:17,633
Isn't it obvious?

134
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:23,833
If you would have a happy life as you claim,

135
00:13:24,867 --> 00:13:26,833
then it's alright for me not to see him again.

136
00:13:28,742 --> 00:13:30,200
So, just tell me.

137
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:33,167
Ma'am

138
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,267
are you really happy?

139
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,867
I...

140
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,333
I've always been very happy.

141
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,100
I don't believe you.

142
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:03,100
Just look at yourself now.
How could it be a happy expression?

143
00:14:05,033 --> 00:14:07,233
Shyuuhei, you know nothing about me.

144
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,600
You just try so hard to
deceive yourself, don't you?

145
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,567
This how I really see you in my mind.

146
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,767
Ma'am

147
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,267
you just make yourself blind.

148
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,967
Don't you think it's just like being dead?

149
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,533
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- It's alright.

150
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,433
Hello, are you Mr. Nakamishi?

151
00:14:47,533 --> 00:14:48,733
- Yes.
- Hi

152
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:54,600
I'm a colleague of Mrs. Misaki
I am Misumi.

153
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,833
Thank you for taking care of my wife.

154
00:14:56,933 --> 00:14:58,267
Same here.

155
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:02,467
Mrs. Misaki showed
your photos to me before.

156
00:15:03,267 --> 00:15:04,667
I see.

157
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:10,167
And... I saw you a couple of days ago.

158
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:11,767
Eh...

159
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:18,133
You were with a man walking
on the hotel street, weren't you?

160
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:27,100
May we go somewhere else to talk?

161
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,033
Shall we?

162
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:06,600
(I'm coming home)
(Want to eat something?)

163
00:16:11,867 --> 00:16:12,933
Ma'am.

164
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,267
You just make yourself blind.

165
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,933
Don't you think it's just like being dead?

166
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,200
(Gay Husband)

167
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,400
(The Wife's Confession)
(My Husband is Gay)

168
00:17:03,197 --> 00:17:06,897
In my case, it wasn't
my husband who told me.

169
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,167
It's called being kicked
out of the closet, isn't it?

170
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:11,867
It was my husband's friend who told me.

171
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:15,733
Is it possible that the guy
is the other man?

172
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:16,600
No, he's not

173
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:22,033
I think he told me this
simply out of concern.

174
00:17:23,767 --> 00:17:26,749
From all the interviews I've
done, there are few people...

175
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:29,533
who would come out
and tell their story like you.

176
00:17:30,167 --> 00:17:32,233
Then what happened?

177
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,633
I went to ask my husband.

178
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,967
I am a regular customer here.

179
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,309
In fact, I invited Mrs. Misaki on that night.

180
00:17:44,433 --> 00:17:46,633
Just for a couple of drinks.

181
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,767
It was great she didn't come with me.

182
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:54,267
Because...

183
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,067
if she were here

184
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:59,767
she would've seen what happened.

185
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,033
It was you...

186
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,467
and Ina Shyuuhei.

187
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:10,900
Ina...

188
00:18:12,433 --> 00:18:15,367
was a student at our school.

189
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,433
Yes...

190
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,800
You did this with him because you knew it?

191
00:18:27,133 --> 00:18:28,300
Yes...

192
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,967
Mrs. Misaki must be very shocked.

193
00:18:38,067 --> 00:18:40,133
I already broke up with him.

194
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,167
Misaki and I did talk about this.

195
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,467
I want to have a clean
slate with her again.

196
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,233
My husband and I talked for a long time.

197
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:55,967
We were very good partners

198
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,600
and we wanted to keep it as usual.

199
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:02,200
- So you didn't consider divorcing.
- No, I didn't.

200
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,100
It wouldn't be like a normal case

201
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,967
but this was what we hoped for.

202
00:19:09,367 --> 00:19:10,833
Have a clean slate again?

203
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,533
Right after what had happened?

204
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:16,133
This is the conclusion we reached.

205
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,933
I'm sorry to keep you concerned.

206
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:26,133
I see

207
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,767
I gotta go.

208
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:31,300
Well, you are a man after all.

209
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:34,274
It's just a one-time fling, isn't it?

210
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,533
It's great you can keep going on.

211
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,200
Mrs. Misaki is really having a hard time
but she forces herself to look fine.

212
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,167
I can't bear seeing her like this.

213
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,367
Please don't break her heart ever again.

214
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,367
She's your beloved wife, after all.

215
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,833
One day, he told me:

216
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:06,067
"We can't live like this anymore."

217
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:14,408
But I encouraged him instead, saying
"It's alright. We can make it".

218
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,500
He seemed to accept it, too.

219
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:24,067
But the next day, he took his own life.

220
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:15,267
- Ma'am?
- Where's Yuuki?

221
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,307
I said I won't see him again.

222
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,133
I really mean it.

223
00:21:23,733 --> 00:21:25,067
I won't see him again.

224
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,367
I should let him continue seeing you.

225
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,333
What do you mean?

226
00:21:33,633 --> 00:21:35,233
He's not home yet.

227
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,900
I can't reach him, either.

228
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,867
Eh?

229
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,233
I'll go look for him as well.

230
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,167
Thank you, but it's alright.

231
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:49,567
Don't cheat yourself like this.

232
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,433
Well... I'm sorry.

233
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:04,967
It was me who lied to
you in the first place.

234
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,433
Me, too.

235
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:13,167
Eh?

236
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,200
I might make Yuuki lie.

237
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:23,067
Perhaps it's me that makes him...

238
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,667
lie to me...

239
00:22:32,567 --> 00:22:36,233
Honestly... you don't
look alright at all.

240
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,700
You... and Yuuki...

241
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:46,533
and I...

242
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,133
we are obviously not alright.

243
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,633
Yuuki...

244
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:15,400
Yuuki.

245
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:22,133
No way. You can't
die like this.

246
00:23:33,367 --> 00:23:36,367
Do I... really want to die?

247
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,367
I just... want to disappear.

248
00:23:49,967 --> 00:23:52,167
That's alright. Dying is alright.

249
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,667
Or... the three of us can die together.

250
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:02,833
(This is a work of fiction)

251
00:24:03,867 --> 00:24:06,133
(Next Episode)
Right here, just die right here.

252
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:08,767
Yuuki just needs Shyuuhei at the moment

253
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:10,867
I'm such a jerk

254
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:12,533
I'm the worst...

255
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:16,733
This is a world where one
can't face their own true self
