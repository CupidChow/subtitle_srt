1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,161
I'm at the age
where I should be getting married.

2
00:00:19,162 --> 00:00:20,464
I want to get married now.

3
00:00:20,664 --> 00:00:23,633
Once I made up my mind to get married,
it became even harder to find someone.

4
00:00:25,202 --> 00:00:26,736
(Korea's first)

5
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:28,238
(With mothers)

6
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:30,640
(A mother-son and mother-daughter
group dating retreat)

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,641
My ideal type list is...

8
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:33,110
A small face and fair skin.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,277
I need to be able to kiss him.

10
00:00:34,277 --> 00:00:36,379
Well, you can just turn off the lights
and do it.

11
00:00:36,813 --> 00:00:38,949
Do you miss me all the time?
Is that why you keep calling?

12
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:40,250
Of course, I miss you.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:42,719
I like things just the way
they are right now, so stay with me.

14
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,654
(But marriage is reality.)

15
00:00:44,654 --> 00:00:46,923
Age-related fertility issues.

16
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:49,593
If you graduate from SNU,
you'll at least be able to make a living.

17
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,294
He comes from a family of educators,

18
00:00:51,294 --> 00:00:52,529
so meet him one more time.

19
00:00:52,529 --> 00:00:54,531
I'll take responsibility for that.

20
00:00:54,531 --> 00:00:56,099
I want to make the call myself.

21
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,035
If they ask me to choose again,
can I choose someone else?

22
00:00:59,035 --> 00:01:02,572
You don't need permission for that.
It's not something anyone has to grant.

23
00:01:02,773 --> 00:01:06,042
(Emotions growing increasingly intense.)

24
00:01:06,042 --> 00:01:07,577
How are you planning to handle childcare?

25
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,446
Things like annual income.

26
00:01:09,446 --> 00:01:12,082
Assets or debt.

27
00:01:12,082 --> 00:01:14,417
I expect her to take good care of my son.

28
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,553
So you want me to support him?

29
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:20,323
New Year's Day 2026.

30
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:23,360
An ambitious project prepared by SBS,

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,862
the show...

32
00:01:25,862 --> 00:01:29,299
Match to Marry: With Mothers
has finally been revealed.

33
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,468
We've seen plenty of dating shows,

34
00:01:31,468 --> 00:01:33,870
but a show where mothers
appear together...

35
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:36,373
and live together while finding a match...

36
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,575
- is a first, right?
- Yes, we're the first.

37
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:40,377
Actually,

38
00:01:40,377 --> 00:01:42,679
I'm a bit of a dating show expert.

39
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:44,581
- Yes, exactly.
- Really?

40
00:01:44,581 --> 00:01:49,419
I've been on a show called "Love Nagging"
for a full seven years.

41
00:01:49,419 --> 00:01:51,755
I've watched
a lot of dating shows as well.

42
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:53,023
Don't you even deal with divorce?

43
00:01:53,023 --> 00:01:53,890
Well, yes.

44
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,792
In all kinds of ways, across many areas.

45
00:01:55,792 --> 00:02:01,498
I cover every worry and concern out there.

46
00:02:01,498 --> 00:02:04,100
Now that I think about it,
I'm also kind of a mom expert.

47
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,570
- Right, you're an expert in everything.
- Right.

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,072
I've become an expert
in mothers' feelings...

49
00:02:09,072 --> 00:02:10,807
through "My Little Old Boy."

50
00:02:10,807 --> 00:02:13,844
If you were actually given an opportunity
like this, how would you feel, Yo Han?

51
00:02:13,844 --> 00:02:15,879
I've only seen the highlight clip so far,

52
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,547
but I don't think I could do it.

53
00:02:17,547 --> 00:02:18,748
For me...

54
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:19,950
Because...

55
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,185
- there's just too much to think about.
- Right.

56
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,488
I'd have to think about the woman I like,

57
00:02:24,488 --> 00:02:25,722
my own mother,

58
00:02:25,722 --> 00:02:29,426
and even that woman's mother.

59
00:02:29,426 --> 00:02:31,928
So honestly,
I don't think it would be easy.

60
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,463
But for me,

61
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:34,664
I think it would be fun.

62
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:36,967
I actually talk about things like that...

63
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:38,735
very openly with my eldest daughter.

64
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:41,004
- She's 22 now, right?
- Yes.

65
00:02:41,004 --> 00:02:43,774
So we talk about boyfriends, too,

66
00:02:43,774 --> 00:02:46,309
and how the kind of man you want to date
and the kind of man you want to marry...

67
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:48,745
are, realistically, a bit different.

68
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:51,581
We talk openly about things like that,

69
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:52,716
so I think it'd be really interesting.

70
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:53,984
You really talk about things like that?

71
00:02:53,984 --> 00:02:57,320
There are a lot of hurdles to overcome.

72
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,890
Like we briefly saw earlier,

73
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:01,658
the mothers are not
just going to sit back quietly.

74
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:03,727
Then, shall we take a look now?

75
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:04,661
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

76
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:12,235
(Perfect fall
with the whole world dyed in color)

77
00:03:14,838 --> 00:03:15,839
What a sight.

78
00:03:17,107 --> 00:03:19,810
Looks like they went
during a beautiful fall season.

79
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:23,380
(Where deep fall foliage
and a serene hanok stand together)

80
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,284
They filmed it at a very serene hanok.

81
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:29,152
(A group dating retreat where mothers
and their children find matches together)

82
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:31,721
- From the very first meeting,
- Right.

83
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:34,458
being together
with the mothers isn't easy.

84
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:36,560
It's really not easy.

85
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:43,467
(The matchmaking table where mother-son
and mother-daughter pairs will first meet)

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,807
First up.

87
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,447
The mother and...

88
00:03:57,447 --> 00:03:58,615
Tae In.

89
00:03:58,615 --> 00:04:00,951
- Daughter and mother.
- The daughter is so pretty.

90
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:02,018
The weather's nice, isn't it?

91
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,762
(The first mother-daughter pair,
Kim Young Ja and Kim Tae In)

92
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:14,030
- They look alike.
- Yes.

93
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:20,971
She seems like the type
who'd be very popular.

94
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,272
- Yes.
- That's right.

95
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,541
Let's sit here, Mom.

96
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:26,476
Sit here.

97
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,347
This is nice and warm.

98
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:41,291
Tae In, why do you want to get married?

99
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,559
Me?

100
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,294
Well,

101
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:49,332
I feel like I've reached my limit
living alone.

102
00:04:49,332 --> 00:04:53,503
When you have a husband and come home,

103
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,971
the atmosphere feels different, right?

104
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:57,774
I've lived on my own for over ten years,

105
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:01,244
so I think I've developed
a bit of a romantic ideal about marriage.

106
00:05:02,646 --> 00:05:05,715
Among appearance, personality,
and financial stability,

107
00:05:05,715 --> 00:05:07,384
how would you rank your priorities
in a spouse?

108
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:10,353
First, I'd like him to have
a monkey-like face.

109
00:05:10,353 --> 00:05:12,689
Second would be personality.

110
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,258
I think looks come later.

111
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:17,127
For men...

112
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:18,295
Financial stability?

113
00:05:18,295 --> 00:05:19,429
He needs to be able to make a living.

114
00:05:19,429 --> 00:05:22,299
Right, you need that to get married.

115
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:24,901
You two are completely opposite.

116
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:25,869
That's what I think.

117
00:05:25,869 --> 00:05:27,404
The person the mother likes...

118
00:05:27,404 --> 00:05:29,439
and the person Tae In likes
could be different, then.

119
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,408
I think so. I felt that just now.

120
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:32,509
I have to brainwash her.

121
00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:33,977
- Pardon?
- I have to brainwash her.

122
00:05:33,977 --> 00:05:35,178
You have to brainwash her?

123
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:36,913
(A pre-retreat plan to brainwash
the future son-in-law candidate)

124
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,382
You seem to match the playful type.

125
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,853
Hey, Number Five seemed great.

126
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:45,622
She keeps saying that.

127
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:48,925
It feels like that could strain
the mother-daughter relationship.

128
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:50,694
- It seems like it could.
- He has a licensed profession too.

129
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:52,929
"A licensed profession."

130
00:05:53,263 --> 00:05:55,232
- Mr. OO.
- Yes?

131
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,366
With Tae In,

132
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:57,934
you should grab a drink or have a meal.

133
00:05:57,934 --> 00:05:58,668
Yes, ma'am.

134
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:04,641
I feel like she's keeping me
in a very small world.

135
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:05,942
Whether she actually likes him,

136
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:08,745
or whether she thinks he's right for me.

137
00:06:08,745 --> 00:06:11,381
I think Mom is a bit confused
between those two.

138
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:12,949
If you do that kind of brainwashing...

139
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,518
when your daughter is
already of marriageable age...

140
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:17,654
when she wants to get married,
it's too late.

141
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:18,488
Right.

142
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:19,823
It should be when she's young.

143
00:06:20,624 --> 00:06:24,327
You need to start even earlier.

144
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:25,462
That's a bit late.

145
00:06:26,396 --> 00:06:27,631
(Can the mother and daughter
reach a smooth agreement?)

146
00:06:27,631 --> 00:06:28,799
You're curious, right?

147
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,371
It's awkward.

148
00:06:37,307 --> 00:06:39,643
So this is how it goes.

149
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,113
Everyone's really beautiful.

150
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:47,451
(The second mother-daughter pair,
Kim Deok Hee and Kim Myo Jin)

151
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:49,619
Kim Myo Jin.

152
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,188
Hello.

153
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:54,090
Hello, nice to meet you.

154
00:06:58,261 --> 00:06:59,162
Should I sit here?

155
00:06:59,162 --> 00:07:00,931
Yes, you can sit there.

156
00:07:00,931 --> 00:07:02,265
Thanks.

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,503
She seems very close with her mother.

158
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,471
Like friends.

159
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,741
Let's secure a good match as your husband.

160
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:13,243
Let's snatch him up and take him.

161
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:18,248
(Q. What kind of person
do you want to marry?)

162
00:07:18,248 --> 00:07:20,984
My ideal type list has always been...

163
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:25,522
Takeshi Kaneshiro and Keanu Reeves.

164
00:07:25,522 --> 00:07:27,491
The strong testosterone-driven type.

165
00:07:27,491 --> 00:07:29,559
But the way he acts should be...

166
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:31,928
kind of soft, gentle, and caring.

167
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:33,797
That's what I really want.

168
00:07:33,797 --> 00:07:35,298
There's no one like that.

169
00:07:36,299 --> 00:07:39,703
What kind of person
would you like Myo Jin to marry, Ms. Kim?

170
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:40,737
Financially stable.

171
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:44,307
Housing prices are so high these days.

172
00:07:44,307 --> 00:07:48,445
If they were to get married,

173
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:52,516
could they even afford to buy a house?

174
00:07:52,516 --> 00:07:55,652
Someone with a promising future
would be nice.

175
00:07:55,652 --> 00:07:58,522
Mothers can't really help it.

176
00:07:58,522 --> 00:07:59,122
Right.

177
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:02,659
They have no choice but to prioritize
resilience and financial stability.

178
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:06,429
Are there any jobs
you particularly dislike?

179
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:09,299
As for business owners...

180
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:13,203
People who dabble
in lots of different businesses.

181
00:08:13,203 --> 00:08:15,439
I didn't really prefer them.

182
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:17,340
They're unstable,

183
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,277
and from what I've seen around me,
their income goes up and down.

184
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,112
She says that,

185
00:08:22,112 --> 00:08:25,215
but if a businessman
looks like Takeshi Kaneshiro...

186
00:08:25,982 --> 00:08:27,918
Right, she'd be swayed.

187
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:29,519
"Even if he's a businessman,"

188
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:30,854
That's possible.

189
00:08:30,854 --> 00:08:33,657
"I can support him."
She'd probably say this.

190
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:37,394
How charming.

191
00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:39,763
Is she the mother?

192
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,498
She looks more like an older sister.

193
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:42,365
I know, right?

194
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:44,234
Nice.

195
00:08:45,101 --> 00:08:46,770
Third from the right.

196
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,406
Careful.

197
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,875
That's it.

198
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,977
Good job.

199
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:56,746
"That's it."

200
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:01,751
Isn't that something you say
to kids under five? "That's it."

201
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,186
(The third mother-daughter pair,
Seol Choo Hee and Cho Eun Na Rae)

202
00:09:03,186 --> 00:09:04,087
No way.

203
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,724
They look so glamorous.

204
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:09,493
So glamorous.

205
00:09:13,597 --> 00:09:15,365
Looks like the mother
really went all out today.

206
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:21,404
I'm betting the mother took longer...

207
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:24,241
at the salon.

208
00:09:24,674 --> 00:09:25,842
- Hello.
- Hello.

209
00:09:25,842 --> 00:09:27,878
Nice to meet you. You're so pretty.

210
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:29,880
Thank you.

211
00:09:31,515 --> 00:09:34,284
She doesn't look like her mom.
She looks like her sister.

212
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:36,019
- Nice and warm today, isn't it?
- Yes.

213
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:38,355
- Nice and warm today, isn't it?
- Yes.

214
00:09:38,355 --> 00:09:40,791
The sun's right overhead.

215
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:43,026
But yesterday, it was really windy.

216
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:43,994
It was.

217
00:09:43,994 --> 00:09:46,496
But today,
the weather's really helping us out.

218
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:47,664
I love it.

219
00:09:47,664 --> 00:09:48,665
She's so bright.

220
00:09:48,665 --> 00:09:51,234
She seems really approachable and social.

221
00:09:51,234 --> 00:09:52,836
Hello.

222
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:54,037
Are you nervous, Ms. Seol?

223
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:56,473
You're so beautiful.

224
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,974
Thank you.

225
00:09:57,974 --> 00:09:59,309
You're going to be blessed.

226
00:10:01,411 --> 00:10:03,113
You have such an outgoing personality.

227
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:04,481
- I do.
- That's right.

228
00:10:04,481 --> 00:10:06,082
What kind of daughter is Eun Na Rae?

229
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:09,486
My daughter is, how should I put it?

230
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,321
She's definitely getting up there...

231
00:10:11,321 --> 00:10:12,756
in age.

232
00:10:13,723 --> 00:10:15,125
She's very genuine.

233
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:15,992
First of all.

234
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,495
To put it nicely, she's very pure.

235
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,997
It feels like her soul is really clear.

236
00:10:20,997 --> 00:10:22,966
That's the good part.

237
00:10:22,966 --> 00:10:24,701
- I should talk about the bad parts too.
- What? What bad parts?

238
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:25,702
Don't say "what."

239
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,272
Financially, she's still not...

240
00:10:30,073 --> 00:10:32,709
I wish she'd be
a little more money-minded.

241
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:35,045
That's kind of a drawback.

242
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:36,746
She's just happy all the time.

243
00:10:36,746 --> 00:10:39,082
It drives me insane.

244
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:40,750
She's just happy, nonstop.

245
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,687
So when I think about a man,

246
00:10:43,687 --> 00:10:48,925
I want her husband to be stable,
because if he's too weak financially,

247
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:50,627
wouldn't that be hard?

248
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:52,395
That's what I worry about.

249
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:55,532
What do you think is your biggest charm?

250
00:10:55,532 --> 00:10:59,536
I think I'm pretty confident in myself.

251
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,138
I'm actually pretty.

252
00:11:03,106 --> 00:11:04,875
And my figure's not bad either.

253
00:11:05,642 --> 00:11:07,244
- Well...
- She's saying that about herself?

254
00:11:07,244 --> 00:11:09,946
- She has every reason to be confident.
- Right.

255
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:13,917
(She used to be this confident, but...)

256
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,620
After coming here,

257
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,290
she started thinking
that in the marriage market,

258
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,659
her daughter is at a disadvantage...

259
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:25,295
and got even more worried.

260
00:11:25,662 --> 00:11:27,430
- Why is she crying?
- Why is she suddenly crying?

261
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,699
- Why is she crying all of a sudden?
- Why, all of a sudden?

262
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:31,635
What happened? What's going on?

263
00:11:31,635 --> 00:11:33,236
If my daughter would just get married,

264
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,538
what couldn't I do?

265
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:37,040
If they gave me a poisoned drink,
I'd drink it.

266
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,842
I'm that eager.

267
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,812
What happened?

268
00:11:42,245 --> 00:11:43,713
Someone's coming again.

269
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:47,050
Follow the arrow.

270
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:47,918
Here.

271
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,153
It's really windy.

272
00:11:50,153 --> 00:11:53,323
(The fourth mother-daughter pair,
Kim Young Sook and Kim Jin Joo)

273
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:55,158
Who's the mom and who's the daughter?

274
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:55,959
I'm not sure.

275
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:58,094
I was confused for a second.

276
00:11:58,094 --> 00:12:00,997
Her mother looks so young.

277
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:03,033
Hello.

278
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:04,601
Hello.

279
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,903
The mother is beautiful.

280
00:12:06,903 --> 00:12:08,205
She looks so young.

281
00:12:09,106 --> 00:12:10,307
I'll take the sunlight.

282
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:14,111
Is it better if I'm in the sun, or not?

283
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,245
I don't know.

284
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,913
Do I look okay in natural light?

285
00:12:16,913 --> 00:12:18,949
If you don't,
what are you going to do about it now?

286
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:20,150
Be honest.

287
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,752
- Are my bangs okay right now?
- Yeah.

288
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,387
My lips are so dry. Can you tell?

289
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:25,822
They're shiny.

290
00:12:26,223 --> 00:12:27,190
They're not shiny?

291
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,125
They are shiny.

292
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,861
Is there another daughter
who checks her looks like I do?

293
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:32,529
Like, every second.

294
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:34,898
What kind of daughter is Jin Joo?

295
00:12:34,898 --> 00:12:38,168
A daughter who calls
three to four times a day.

296
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,402
Seriously.

297
00:12:39,402 --> 00:12:41,505
Sometimes as many as seven.

298
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:43,406
Since I don't have a boyfriend,

299
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:44,941
I have no one else to call.

300
00:12:44,941 --> 00:12:47,410
All these symptoms are due to...

301
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,645
No dating.

302
00:12:48,645 --> 00:12:49,980
If I date, it'll get better.

303
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,249
So the number of calls she makes to me...

304
00:12:52,616 --> 00:12:54,050
will go down.

305
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,820
- It seems you're exhausted, Ms. Kim.
- She must be worn out.

306
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,856
If you had to describe yourself, Jin Joo,
what kind of person are you?

307
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:03,560
I'm fun, confident,
and I can hang out with guys easily.

308
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,062
But when we fight, or things go bad,

309
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:07,497
I fight like I'll never see them again.

310
00:13:08,431 --> 00:13:09,699
Should I say she's a pain in the butt?

311
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:11,134
"Pain in the butt."

312
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:12,536
A filial maniac.

313
00:13:12,536 --> 00:13:13,670
A filial maniac?

314
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,872
You're a filial daughter,

315
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:17,607
but you're also a maniac,

316
00:13:17,607 --> 00:13:19,976
so a filial maniac.

317
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:21,845
I take my mom out to eat every weekend.

318
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,814
- That's when she's filial.
- I'm really good to her.

319
00:13:23,814 --> 00:13:25,449
But when I get mad, I really get mad.

320
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:26,950
When she's mad,
she makes me apologize too.

321
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,118
She won't let it go until I apologize.

322
00:13:28,118 --> 00:13:30,520
Even if I shut myself in my room,
she comes in and says,

323
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,956
"Mom, apologize to me."

324
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:34,925
And once I say sorry, it's over.

325
00:13:34,925 --> 00:13:36,426
Does she really need to hear the words,
"I'm sorry?"

326
00:13:37,594 --> 00:13:39,663
She makes people tired.

327
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,865
(Q. Your ideal type?)

328
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:43,366
- Men in great shape.
- She likes men in great shape.

329
00:13:43,366 --> 00:13:45,268
Honestly,
she cares about appearance a lot.

330
00:13:45,268 --> 00:13:46,369
But it's not just looks.

331
00:13:46,369 --> 00:13:48,238
You know that first-impression vibe
in three seconds, right?

332
00:13:48,238 --> 00:13:49,072
Yes.

333
00:13:49,673 --> 00:13:51,241
(Cannot understand)

334
00:13:51,241 --> 00:13:53,777
First impressions are pointless.

335
00:13:54,778 --> 00:13:56,079
But you have to be able to kiss the man.

336
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,114
I always say that.

337
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:58,815
I have to be able to kiss him.

338
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:01,184
Well, you can just turn off the lights
and do it.

339
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,556
But that's not totally wrong.

340
00:14:06,556 --> 00:14:10,594
Usually, you can tell a lot
from the first impression.

341
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,596
Right. You have to be able
to kiss the person to date them.

342
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,064
If you can't kiss them, then...

343
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:16,032
For me, first impressions...

344
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,767
don't matter that much.

345
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,069
For me...

346
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:20,237
Now, what's the point of saying that?

347
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:21,705
You're actually right.

348
00:14:21,705 --> 00:14:23,507
- You're already married.
- I can still talk about it.

349
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:26,243
You got married a long time ago.

350
00:14:26,243 --> 00:14:26,877
Right.

351
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:28,311
Here she comes.

352
00:14:28,311 --> 00:14:30,113
She's seriously gorgeous.

353
00:14:30,947 --> 00:14:32,649
We should go that way.

354
00:14:32,649 --> 00:14:33,683
She's graceful.

355
00:14:36,186 --> 00:14:37,487
She might be the tallest.

356
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,157
Her mother is tall too.

357
00:14:41,024 --> 00:14:42,459
Ms. Kim Hyun Jin.

358
00:14:42,459 --> 00:14:46,797
(The fifth mother-daughter pair,
Park Mi Ae and Kim Hyun Jin)

359
00:14:47,898 --> 00:14:48,732
They're beautiful.

360
00:14:48,732 --> 00:14:51,134
How did they only cast beautiful people?

361
00:14:51,701 --> 00:14:52,936
She's really tall.

362
00:14:52,936 --> 00:14:54,571
All five of them...

363
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,940
They're so charming.

364
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:01,344
The men must be thrilled.

365
00:15:01,344 --> 00:15:02,679
Their eyes are going to be
all over the place.

366
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,580
Exactly.

367
00:15:04,147 --> 00:15:07,584
Take a good look around, Mom.

368
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,718
That's enough.

369
00:15:08,718 --> 00:15:09,653
I've seen them.

370
00:15:09,653 --> 00:15:10,620
They're all pretty.

371
00:15:11,555 --> 00:15:13,623
- Mom is so cool.
- Scan complete.

372
00:15:14,257 --> 00:15:16,126
The women got here first.

373
00:15:17,227 --> 00:15:19,162
The men should've come early
and waited out in the cold.

374
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:20,096
Right.

375
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:25,001
What kind of person is your daughter,
in your eyes, Ms. Park?

376
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:28,238
Hyun Jin is very strong-willed.

377
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:31,508
A modern woman, you could say.

378
00:15:31,508 --> 00:15:33,677
She's very social,

379
00:15:33,677 --> 00:15:35,812
and extremely ambitious about her work.

380
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:37,080
She's proactive.

381
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,914
That's right.

382
00:15:37,914 --> 00:15:40,050
What kind of man do you want to marry?

383
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,785
- Take your time.
- Yes.

384
00:15:42,052 --> 00:15:45,956
I care about financial stability a lot.
Competence.

385
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:47,524
She's the first one
to bring up competence.

386
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:49,259
Because I'm truly serious about marriage,

387
00:15:49,259 --> 00:15:53,063
I want someone who can provide for me.

388
00:15:53,063 --> 00:15:56,032
I want to have kids as well,

389
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:58,935
so I want the man to be able
to let our kids do what they want.

390
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:01,571
If they want to study arts or sports,

391
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:03,440
someone who can support that...

392
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,243
without worrying about money.

393
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:09,613
The mother looks very pleased.

394
00:16:09,613 --> 00:16:13,550
That's a very realistic ideal type.

395
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,951
Do you care about education too?

396
00:16:14,951 --> 00:16:16,419
Yes, I do.

397
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:21,291
In Korea, education still affects...

398
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:25,996
your connections
and a lot of other things.

399
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:28,498
- So a good educational background.
- To be able to make a living too.

400
00:16:28,498 --> 00:16:30,834
- It's just our hope.
- Right.

401
00:16:31,701 --> 00:16:33,603
Where did your son go to college?

402
00:16:33,603 --> 00:16:35,906
- In Seoul?
- Yes.

403
00:16:35,906 --> 00:16:37,507
He didn't say which college earlier,
that's why.

404
00:16:37,674 --> 00:16:38,775
Meet OO one more time.

405
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:41,244
I think that's not a bad idea either.

406
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:43,447
- I like his education too.
- She really cares about that.

407
00:16:43,447 --> 00:16:46,283
If you graduate from SNU,
you can make a living, at least.

408
00:16:46,283 --> 00:16:48,785
I hope this isn't rude,

409
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,520
but things like annual income...

410
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,455
Annual income.

411
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,989
Looking back,

412
00:16:52,989 --> 00:16:55,559
you really can't ignore
financial stability...

413
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,927
if you want to have children.

414
00:16:56,927 --> 00:16:57,994
Like you said earlier, Yo Won,

415
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:02,165
it feels like Hyun Jin's been brainwashed
at a young age.

416
00:17:02,165 --> 00:17:03,834
Their values are the same.

417
00:17:03,834 --> 00:17:05,068
Right.

418
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:06,837
We need people like them too.

419
00:17:06,837 --> 00:17:10,807
If everyone married based only on looks,

420
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:12,476
then only you would get married, Yo Han.

421
00:17:13,877 --> 00:17:14,611
That's not true.

422
00:17:14,611 --> 00:17:15,479
(I want to survive too.)

423
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:19,816
(All the mothers and daughters gather
around the matchmaking table.)

424
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:21,952
Now, the men are finally
making their entrance.

425
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,453
- I'm curious.
- I'm really excited.

426
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,791
- All the women are so pretty.
- Seriously.

427
00:17:28,258 --> 00:17:30,026
I'm curious about the men too.

428
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:30,760
Same.

429
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,096
Let's see who's the best one.

430
00:17:34,898 --> 00:17:39,136
(The first man to appear
amid everyone's anticipation?)

431
00:17:39,136 --> 00:17:40,070
Here he comes.

432
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:43,173
I'm nervous.

433
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,311
They're already here.

434
00:17:48,578 --> 00:17:49,980
They came early.

435
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:01,057
The son seems very gentle.

436
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:02,058
He's so sweet.

437
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:03,860
They're holding hands.

438
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:07,831
He walked in holding hands
with his mother.

439
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:08,832
They must be really close.

440
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:10,500
Hyun Jun.

441
00:18:12,369 --> 00:18:14,538
- Very on-trend.
- He's really handsome.

442
00:18:14,538 --> 00:18:15,972
Very trendy.

443
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:18,041
(The first mother-son pair,
Choi Ja Young and Kim Hyun Jun)

444
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,810
He's extremely handsome.

445
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:21,344
Hyun Jun must be very popular.

446
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:24,014
He has a very clean-cut look.

447
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,585
The mother looks so youthful,
like his girlfriend.

448
00:18:29,352 --> 00:18:31,888
I don't really like those sneakers
with that outfit.

449
00:18:32,255 --> 00:18:34,558
She doesn't like his sneakers? Why not?

450
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:36,493
What kind of sneakers is he wearing?

451
00:18:36,726 --> 00:18:40,997
These days, people don't really wear
dress shoes with outfits like that.

452
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:42,432
Right, it's more casual now.

453
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:44,034
I guess that's one way to see it.

454
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,268
(Hyun Jun dressed in a trendy style.)

455
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:01,751
Everyone's so quiet.

456
00:19:01,751 --> 00:19:03,587
Is everyone supposed to be quiet?

457
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,288
Everyone seems a bit awkward.

458
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:07,023
There's not much conversation.

459
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,126
No, we were making some small talk.

460
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:13,396
He seems very easygoing.

461
00:19:14,231 --> 00:19:16,800
Shall we talk about your ideal type?

462
00:19:17,234 --> 00:19:20,604
Someone with a small face and fair skin.

463
00:19:20,604 --> 00:19:22,939
And personality-wise,

464
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:25,175
I don't like people
who are like malicious complainants.

465
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:28,078
That probably comes from my job.

466
00:19:28,078 --> 00:19:30,547
I deal with
a lot of malicious complainants,

467
00:19:30,547 --> 00:19:34,885
- so I tend to be wary of that type.
- Is he a civil servant?

468
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:38,021
How would you feel if a woman said
she didn't like your son?

469
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:41,858
But your son likes her.

470
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:43,126
If the woman doesn't?

471
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:45,562
If it were just me being rejected,
I'd be fine.

472
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:46,429
But your mother is also involved.

473
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:47,597
I think my mom would cry.

474
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:48,899
Right...

475
00:19:49,866 --> 00:19:51,802
Are you already tearing up? Your eyes...

476
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:53,270
(Already sad just imagining it)

477
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,871
That hasn't even happened yet.

478
00:19:54,871 --> 00:19:56,006
Why are you reacting like this?

479
00:19:56,006 --> 00:19:57,474
She's already getting emotional.

480
00:19:57,474 --> 00:19:58,742
It's just that...

481
00:19:58,742 --> 00:20:01,378
whether you're a son's mom
or a daughter's mom,

482
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,547
if someone says
they don't like your child,

483
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:05,615
it probably hurts more...

484
00:20:05,615 --> 00:20:09,052
than if they said they didn't like you.

485
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,053
I think that's how it is.

486
00:20:10,053 --> 00:20:11,721
Or this could happen too.

487
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:13,490
You like the man,

488
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,725
but you feel like you wouldn't
get along with his mother.

489
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,461
- That could happen too.
- It could.

490
00:20:17,461 --> 00:20:18,662
- Then...
- Right.

491
00:20:18,662 --> 00:20:20,897
- This is such a cruel show.
- I keep saying, it's brutal.

492
00:20:22,866 --> 00:20:24,801
They're too far away.

493
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:25,836
They're really far away.

494
00:20:29,306 --> 00:20:31,241
(She greets first.)

495
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:36,646
(Glance)

496
00:20:38,582 --> 00:20:39,649
Someone else is coming.

497
00:20:41,251 --> 00:20:43,153
The mountain lines look gentle,
don't they?

498
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:44,020
Exactly.

499
00:20:44,821 --> 00:20:46,189
The second team.

500
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:47,691
I'm getting strong "macho" vibes.

501
00:20:47,691 --> 00:20:49,392
He's handsome.

502
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:51,962
Are there any important qualities
you look for in a spouse?

503
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:52,929
Qualities?

504
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:56,666
I think it'd be nice
if she had a nine-to-six job.

505
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:01,938
Basically, I'd like them both
to be financially active.

506
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:06,977
You need your own job
to understand each other.

507
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,146
That really does seem
to be the trend these days.

508
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:10,480
- Dual income.
- Yes.

509
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:12,983
My mom is kind of...

510
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:15,152
the type who taps a stepping stone
10,000 times before crossing.

511
00:21:15,152 --> 00:21:17,053
(His mother is
a better-safe-than-sorry type.)

512
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:20,056
May I ask what your father does
for a living?

513
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:22,926
I'm curious.
How do you plan to handle childcare?

514
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:25,862
Assets or debt.

515
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:28,632
Min Cheol's mom has
a very strong personality.

516
00:21:28,632 --> 00:21:30,500
My biggest concern is his mother.

517
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,403
See?
Situations like this really do come up.

518
00:21:33,403 --> 00:21:34,638
(The mother and son remain cautious
to the very end.)

519
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:36,440
Hello.

520
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:39,276
Hello.

521
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:43,013
(The third mother-son pair enters next.)

522
00:21:43,013 --> 00:21:44,114
Are we walking a bit far apart?

523
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:47,617
(The third mother-son pair
Kwon Min Seon and Seo Han Gyeol)

524
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:49,553
I thought I wouldn't even be able
to find this place.

525
00:21:51,288 --> 00:21:54,291
He looks like the studious type.

526
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:55,992
She's...

527
00:21:55,992 --> 00:21:58,995
She said "the studious type" right away.

528
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:02,466
He looks like someone who studied
really hard.

529
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:04,734
Yeah.

530
00:22:04,734 --> 00:22:06,002
I'm kind of okay with...

531
00:22:06,903 --> 00:22:07,904
I'm kind of okay with him.

532
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:11,575
The mother is very energetic.
Her walk is so graceful.

533
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:12,242
Right.

534
00:22:18,949 --> 00:22:20,584
Sit down. Let's sit here.

535
00:22:21,585 --> 00:22:22,586
Cute.

536
00:22:23,854 --> 00:22:24,721
Cute.

537
00:22:25,755 --> 00:22:31,461
(Eun Na Rae and her mom's
instant top pick)

538
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:32,996
He's very polite.

539
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,066
His name's a Korean name too. Han Gyeol.

540
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:39,903
The mothers and daughters all look alike.

541
00:22:40,137 --> 00:22:42,172
They all seem to look alike.

542
00:22:42,939 --> 00:22:44,708
We might look the most alike.

543
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:47,811
You two really look alike.

544
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:48,979
- Really?
- Yes.

545
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:49,946
We do look alike.

546
00:22:49,946 --> 00:22:51,314
People say our whole family looks alike.

547
00:22:51,314 --> 00:22:52,482
Really? Even your husband?

548
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,651
- Yes.
- I see.

549
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:55,986
What kind of son is Han Gyeol?

550
00:22:58,088 --> 00:22:59,489
A son you'd hate to give away.

551
00:23:00,624 --> 00:23:01,758
But still,

552
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:05,095
as a husband,

553
00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:07,697
I don't think he'd be lacking at all.

554
00:23:07,697 --> 00:23:10,534
He's grown up well.

555
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:16,072
Any mom with a daughter
might wish for him.

556
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:17,174
I'm supposed to brag here, right?

557
00:23:17,174 --> 00:23:18,308
Of course.

558
00:23:18,308 --> 00:23:21,478
When my eldest got married too,

559
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:24,581
I simply trusted my son.

560
00:23:24,781 --> 00:23:26,983
No matter who he brought home
to introduce me,

561
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:29,119
I believed he made a good choice,

562
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,022
and I supported him wholeheartedly.

563
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:34,291
I worry that giving advice
might influence his decision.

564
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,026
That's what I'm concerned about.

565
00:23:36,026 --> 00:23:38,395
Whatever I say...

566
00:23:38,395 --> 00:23:40,730
I don't really listen anyway.

567
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,099
You don't listen? You seem like you would.

568
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:46,236
I tend to acknowledge everything.

569
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:48,472
(Can the trust
between mother and son hold?)

570
00:23:49,072 --> 00:23:51,374
I'm conflicted.

571
00:23:51,374 --> 00:23:52,809
Work-wise too.

572
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,611
I'm conflicted.

573
00:23:54,611 --> 00:23:56,780
Do you want me to say no, Mom?

574
00:23:57,447 --> 00:23:59,149
My feelings have gotten complicated.

575
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:03,153
Unlike what I told my son at first,

576
00:24:03,153 --> 00:24:06,189
I keep finding myself
evaluating their background.

577
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:09,092
That part,
I want to take responsibility for,

578
00:24:09,092 --> 00:24:11,995
and I don't want to be the one
to decide it.

579
00:24:11,995 --> 00:24:16,166
Honestly,
you can't really influence it, Mom.

580
00:24:16,399 --> 00:24:18,034
But you should give me a chance too.

581
00:24:18,034 --> 00:24:21,071
You should give me
a chance to speak as well.

582
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:23,440
I know, and I'm conflicted too.

583
00:24:24,307 --> 00:24:26,243
So should I just not say anything then?

584
00:24:26,243 --> 00:24:27,711
Yeah.

585
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:28,645
Should I really not say anything?

586
00:24:28,645 --> 00:24:29,479
Yes.

587
00:24:30,213 --> 00:24:31,314
Is that really necessary?

588
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:35,852
I don't like that.

589
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,655
If you tell your mother not to speak,

590
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:40,757
she'd think there was no point
in coming together at all.

591
00:24:40,757 --> 00:24:41,858
Ms. Kwon.

592
00:24:41,858 --> 00:24:43,593
- She trusted him too much.
- She's crying.

593
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:44,728
(What on earth happened
to Han Gyeol and his mother?)

594
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:46,496
(The fourth mother-son pair enters.)

595
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:47,631
Why are there so many people?

596
00:24:49,166 --> 00:24:50,267
I don't know.

597
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,636
Walking in without holding hands.

598
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:54,204
He's kind of a tough-guy style.

599
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:55,972
He seems pretty manly.

600
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:56,973
Hello.

601
00:24:56,973 --> 00:24:58,542
(The fourth mother-son pair,
Yoon Jeong Mi and Lee Seung Hak)

602
00:24:58,542 --> 00:25:00,310
He gives off an athlete vibe.

603
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:02,646
He's young.

604
00:25:02,646 --> 00:25:04,414
He looks young.

605
00:25:07,117 --> 00:25:08,952
All the ladies are your type.

606
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:10,954
Right.

607
00:25:10,954 --> 00:25:13,023
His mom knows everything about him.

608
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:14,024
"Right."

609
00:25:14,424 --> 00:25:15,992
Everyone's faces are so small.

610
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,394
This is hilarious.

611
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:19,429
I feel like you're definitely
going to get married here.

612
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:20,897
I don't know.

613
00:25:22,399 --> 00:25:25,335
Ma'am, have you seen
many of Seung Hak's girlfriends?

614
00:25:25,335 --> 00:25:26,470
Yes.

615
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:27,938
I didn't personally like them,

616
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:29,106
but they were all pretty.

617
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:30,407
So he really focuses on looks.

618
00:25:30,407 --> 00:25:31,441
(A hopelessly looks-obsessed son)

619
00:25:31,441 --> 00:25:32,409
"Looks-obsessed?"

620
00:25:33,243 --> 00:25:35,312
Being pretty doesn't feed you.

621
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,380
It doesn't cook meals for you.

622
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:41,551
If you're hungry,
you should cook for yourself.

623
00:25:43,286 --> 00:25:47,524
Do you usually decide
the moment you see someone's face?

624
00:25:47,858 --> 00:25:51,094
I think the first impression
tends to stick.

625
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:53,029
(Conditions you consider important?)

626
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,532
If their family is fairly prepared
for retirement...

627
00:25:55,532 --> 00:25:58,101
The two of us can support ourselves,

628
00:25:58,101 --> 00:26:02,339
but supporting parents as well
might get tough once we're married.

629
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:03,507
That would be difficult.

630
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:05,308
It sounds like he's fairly
well-prepared himself.

631
00:26:06,076 --> 00:26:07,244
From the way he's talking.

632
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:09,746
Is he the last one? He's tall.

633
00:26:12,582 --> 00:26:13,717
So that's what it looks like.

634
00:26:15,619 --> 00:26:17,020
Is he a celebrity?

635
00:26:17,854 --> 00:26:19,823
He kind of looks like one.

636
00:26:19,823 --> 00:26:21,124
At this point,
he might as well be a celebrity.

637
00:26:21,992 --> 00:26:23,226
(The fifth mother-son pair,
Kim Kyung Hee and Moon Se Hoon)

638
00:26:23,226 --> 00:26:27,364
I thought he used to be
in some idol group.

639
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,800
- My gosh.
- Look.

640
00:26:32,736 --> 00:26:37,808
(All eyes on him)

641
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:39,810
Hello.

642
00:26:41,011 --> 00:26:42,045
Hello.

643
00:26:42,646 --> 00:26:44,314
Yes, hello.

644
00:26:44,881 --> 00:26:45,882
Hello.

645
00:26:45,882 --> 00:26:47,050
He's handsome.

646
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:48,351
Exactly.

647
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:49,352
He's good-looking.

648
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,122
I feel like he'll be the most popular.

649
00:26:54,357 --> 00:26:56,026
The last person...

650
00:26:56,026 --> 00:26:57,727
I think he's the best.

651
00:26:57,727 --> 00:26:59,763
It feels like they cast
the last person for his looks.

652
00:27:00,964 --> 00:27:02,966
Saying the last person was cast
for their looks...

653
00:27:02,966 --> 00:27:04,568
means she's confident
about her looks herself.

654
00:27:06,937 --> 00:27:08,605
But overall, looks aren't really...

655
00:27:09,973 --> 00:27:10,974
What do you think?

656
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:15,112
(Q. Why do you want to get married?)

657
00:27:15,512 --> 00:27:16,746
Stability.

658
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:18,482
Stability, really.

659
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:20,951
Working, meeting people,

660
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:24,921
and just living your life
already feels like a battlefield...

661
00:27:24,921 --> 00:27:27,524
like you're fighting nonstop.

662
00:27:27,524 --> 00:27:29,326
Rather than the passionate
"I love you" and all that,

663
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:31,862
I want us to stand firm
and stay by each other's side.

664
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:35,132
He's always saying, "I'm getting married."

665
00:27:35,132 --> 00:27:37,868
"I'll get married within three years."

666
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:40,570
Even when we go to hotels,
he says, "I'll get married here."

667
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:43,840
He already has
his entire wedding schedule planned out.

668
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,076
Shall we hear the schedule?
Tell us about the schedule.

669
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,444
Something about inviting 2,000 people...

670
00:27:47,444 --> 00:27:49,312
- No.
- 2,000 people?

671
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:51,548
With 2,000 people, you'd need a gymnasium.

672
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:55,318
At least on the wedding day,

673
00:27:55,318 --> 00:27:57,654
I'd really appreciate it
if they could give in to me a little.

674
00:27:57,654 --> 00:27:58,688
Shall we hear the plan?

675
00:27:58,688 --> 00:28:00,791
There's a place I absolutely love.

676
00:28:01,792 --> 00:28:04,728
I really love the Grand Hyatt Seoul,

677
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:08,098
so I want to get married
in the Grand Ballroom there.

678
00:28:08,098 --> 00:28:11,768
And the highlight of any wedding
are the flowers, right?

679
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:12,569
Right.

680
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:14,671
I want to match my wife's dress color...

681
00:28:14,671 --> 00:28:16,807
- He's really thought this through.
- with the flowers...

682
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:18,308
The congratulatory song.

683
00:28:18,308 --> 00:28:20,577
- He's already planned that too?
- I do have someone in mind.

684
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:22,312
I don't think I've ever seen a man...

685
00:28:22,312 --> 00:28:25,382
with such a strong wedding fantasy.

686
00:28:25,382 --> 00:28:28,018
These days, if you don't make an effort,
it feels like you can't even date.

687
00:28:28,018 --> 00:28:28,919
That's true.

688
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:30,253
I haven't really dated since then.

689
00:28:30,253 --> 00:28:31,188
Really?

690
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:32,656
I don't think I've dated much since then.

691
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:33,824
Since "Single's Inferno."

692
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,527
He was on "Single's Inferno."

693
00:28:37,527 --> 00:28:40,096
A dating show cast member.

694
00:28:40,096 --> 00:28:43,400
Even when I go on blind dates,
there's a label.

695
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,269
People know me as Moon Se Hoon
from "Single's Inferno."

696
00:28:46,269 --> 00:28:49,005
So in a way,
it became even harder to date.

697
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:50,540
That makes sense.

698
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,476
That's why I decided...

699
00:28:52,476 --> 00:28:55,178
it might be okay to come on this show.

700
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:57,714
Will there be someone this time?

701
00:28:57,714 --> 00:28:59,316
Will there be?

702
00:28:59,316 --> 00:29:00,050
Will there be?

703
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,552
(Moon Se Hoon and his mother
are the final mother-son pair.)

704
00:29:03,353 --> 00:29:06,523
(All participants have arrived.)

705
00:29:06,523 --> 00:29:09,126
So many attractive men and women are here.

706
00:29:09,126 --> 00:29:11,027
Who do you think will be the most popular?

707
00:29:11,027 --> 00:29:13,063
I think Kim Tae In.

708
00:29:13,063 --> 00:29:14,698
Either Tae In,

709
00:29:14,698 --> 00:29:15,932
or Jin Joo.

710
00:29:15,932 --> 00:29:18,034
She has a puppy-like look.

711
00:29:18,034 --> 00:29:21,838
Among the men,
who do you think will be the most popular?

712
00:29:21,838 --> 00:29:22,973
I think Hyun Jun.

713
00:29:24,007 --> 00:29:25,242
I think he's great.

714
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:28,278
Just based on first impressions,
I also think it'll be Hyun Jun.

715
00:29:28,278 --> 00:29:30,547
Well, you never know,

716
00:29:30,547 --> 00:29:32,949
because once age, job, and education...

717
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:34,251
are revealed,

718
00:29:35,085 --> 00:29:37,087
the feeling can completely change.

719
00:29:37,087 --> 00:29:38,255
- It changes.
- Right.

720
00:29:38,255 --> 00:29:42,392
Normally, it's kind of an unspoken rule...

721
00:29:42,392 --> 00:29:44,561
not to reveal jobs or ages
on the first day.

722
00:29:44,561 --> 00:29:45,762
That's the rule, yes.

723
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:50,167
So today, everything will proceed
without knowing each other's jobs or ages.

724
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,569
I'm really curious how this will turn out.

725
00:29:52,569 --> 00:29:53,503
I can't wait to see.

726
00:29:55,105 --> 00:29:58,141
(They joined the group dating retreat
for their own reasons.)

727
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:03,647
(5 mother-son teams
and 5 mother-daughter teams)

728
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:06,216
Everyone looks so nice.

729
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:07,551
Exactly.

730
00:30:07,551 --> 00:30:09,519
Everyone's so beautiful.

731
00:30:11,655 --> 00:30:12,856
They're all gorgeous.

732
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,257
He says they're all gorgeous.

733
00:30:14,257 --> 00:30:18,395
The men are absolutely beaming right now.

734
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:19,729
- They're all beautiful.
- They're loving it.

735
00:30:21,298 --> 00:30:26,603
(Mothers carefully scan
potential daughters-in-law.)

736
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:30,607
There are so many young moms.

737
00:30:30,607 --> 00:30:32,008
A lot of really young moms.

738
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:34,611
(Scanning potential sons-in-law,
as expected)

739
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:38,081
Mom, look closely. Who's your number one?

740
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:41,685
Number One seems like he'd be caring.

741
00:30:42,752 --> 00:30:44,020
He seems caring.

742
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,558
I think I'd like to talk to Number One.

743
00:30:48,558 --> 00:30:50,360
Right, Hyun Jun is really popular.

744
00:30:51,294 --> 00:30:52,262
What about Number Five?

745
00:30:52,496 --> 00:30:53,697
- What
- Number Five.

746
00:30:54,131 --> 00:30:55,866
Number Five has a bit...

747
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:58,068
of a player vibe.

748
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,471
For me,

749
00:31:01,471 --> 00:31:02,606
Numbers Three and Four.

750
00:31:02,606 --> 00:31:03,640
Yeah, me too.

751
00:31:04,107 --> 00:31:05,242
Really?

752
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:09,045
(The women make their minds quickly.)

753
00:31:09,346 --> 00:31:12,482
We'll now begin
the men's first-impression choices.

754
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,318
- First impression, already?
- Right away?

755
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:16,486
(This fast?)

756
00:31:16,486 --> 00:31:18,355
How do you decide right away?

757
00:31:19,156 --> 00:31:21,191
What now?

758
00:31:22,292 --> 00:31:24,995
This is already hard
even when you're alone,

759
00:31:24,995 --> 00:31:26,163
so with your mother...

760
00:31:26,163 --> 00:31:28,732
I feel like the mothers might get hurt...

761
00:31:28,732 --> 00:31:29,733
if their children don't get chosen.

762
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:31,768
What?

763
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:34,237
What do we do?

764
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:36,640
(The men are just as surprised.)

765
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,208
What? Right away?

766
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:40,143
Right now?

767
00:31:40,911 --> 00:31:43,547
The men will discuss with their mothers...

768
00:31:43,547 --> 00:31:46,383
and choose the woman
they're most drawn to,

769
00:31:46,383 --> 00:31:49,619
then pick up the teacup from your table
and move there.

770
00:31:50,554 --> 00:31:52,088
No.

771
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:55,725
So they decide their first impression
after consulting with their mothers?

772
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,294
The men are busy now.

773
00:31:57,794 --> 00:31:58,995
Because they need to talk it over.

774
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,033
Do you see the one in black over there?

775
00:32:04,668 --> 00:32:05,669
(Kim Hyun Jun's mother
chooses Kim Jin Joo.)

776
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:07,270
- Where?
- At the far end.

777
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:11,308
But the one in white...
You really like fair-skinned people.

778
00:32:11,308 --> 00:32:12,542
Isn't that what you like?

779
00:32:13,977 --> 00:32:15,979
Mom, you choose.

780
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:16,980
Right in front of us.

781
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,148
Who?

782
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:19,082
Jin Joo.

783
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:21,485
See? My prediction was right.

784
00:32:21,485 --> 00:32:23,053
Yeah.

785
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,555
- Jin Joo's mom seems nice too.
- Okay.

786
00:32:26,756 --> 00:32:27,791
I'll go with Hyun Jin.

787
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,093
He doesn't listen at all.

788
00:32:30,093 --> 00:32:32,129
What?
He suddenly told Mom to choose, but...

789
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:34,531
Hyun Jin? Myo Jin?

790
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:37,834
Myo Jin's mom also seems nice.

791
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:42,005
(His mother only talks about the in-law,
not the daughter-in-law.)

792
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:44,007
Hyun Jin seems too aloof.

793
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:46,610
I don't think so.

794
00:32:46,610 --> 00:32:47,878
He doesn't think so.

795
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:51,081
He seems like the type
who wouldn't listen.

796
00:32:52,916 --> 00:32:56,153
I choose Myo Jin.

797
00:32:57,154 --> 00:32:59,723
(Seo Han Gyeol's mother
chooses Kim Myo Jin.)

798
00:33:00,257 --> 00:33:04,795
Mom, between Kim Myo Jin and Kim Jin Joo,
who do you prefer?

799
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:08,098
The one you mentioned first.

800
00:33:09,699 --> 00:33:10,867
(Joint first place
for mothers-in-law's favorite type)

801
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,536
We've barely had time to look.

802
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:15,705
This is too early.

803
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,310
We'll now begin
the men's first-impression selections.

804
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,145
Starting with Kim Hyun Jun,

805
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:25,482
please move to the table
of the woman you're interested in.

806
00:33:25,482 --> 00:33:26,349
Does the mother go too?

807
00:33:26,349 --> 00:33:27,317
Looks like they go together.

808
00:33:27,317 --> 00:33:29,753
It seems the four of them
have tea together...

809
00:33:29,753 --> 00:33:30,754
if it works out.

810
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:32,389
I'm so nervous.

811
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:33,523
(Who is the mother-daughter pair
to have tea with Hyun Jun and his mom?)

812
00:33:35,358 --> 00:33:38,295
(His mother's choice, Kim Jin Joo?)

813
00:33:39,396 --> 00:33:41,798
No. They're lucky.

814
00:33:45,802 --> 00:33:46,937
Hello.

815
00:33:46,937 --> 00:33:47,737
(Kim Hyun Jun chooses Kim Tae In.)

816
00:33:47,737 --> 00:33:48,605
He goes right away.

817
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:49,773
I knew it.

818
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:52,242
It's fate
that they were seated at the next table.

819
00:33:52,609 --> 00:33:53,877
I didn't go far.

820
00:33:55,612 --> 00:33:56,580
- I don't think so.
- Hello.

821
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,815
Pour some tea for his mother first.

822
00:33:58,815 --> 00:33:59,749
You pour it.

823
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:02,185
- Yes, I'll do it first.
- No, you pour it.

824
00:34:02,185 --> 00:34:03,987
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

825
00:34:05,989 --> 00:34:10,794
He couldn't take his eyes off her
from the moment he walked in.

826
00:34:10,794 --> 00:34:12,195
That guy?

827
00:34:14,698 --> 00:34:19,302
(Glancing only at Tae In
as soon as he sits)

828
00:34:20,237 --> 00:34:21,571
(Staring intently...)

829
00:34:21,571 --> 00:34:23,306
He keeps looking at her.

830
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:27,878
She's close to my ideal type.

831
00:34:28,078 --> 00:34:29,513
She looks cute.

832
00:34:29,513 --> 00:34:32,215
I like cute women.

833
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:34,518
Since this is just a first impression,

834
00:34:34,518 --> 00:34:36,920
I followed my son's choice.

835
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,922
Honestly, I wanted to go to Number Four.

836
00:34:39,756 --> 00:34:40,824
I was curious.

837
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:44,094
But I feel like
I've seen you somewhere before.

838
00:34:44,828 --> 00:34:45,862
Do you feel that comfortable?

839
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,464
No, I feel uncomfortable.

840
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:51,334
That's hilarious.

841
00:34:51,902 --> 00:34:54,070
Saying "I feel uncomfortable" is so funny.

842
00:34:54,604 --> 00:34:56,006
Mom kept complimenting you.

843
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,340
We couldn't really see your face,

844
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,443
but didn't you walk in
holding your mother's hand?

845
00:34:59,443 --> 00:35:00,377
I did.

846
00:35:00,377 --> 00:35:01,845
I felt like I needed
to hold onto something.

847
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:06,016
He's so funny.

848
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:06,883
My goodness.

849
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,618
- Game over.
- Game over.

850
00:35:08,618 --> 00:35:09,319
Hey, it's over.

851
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:10,687
This is over. "He's so funny."

852
00:35:10,687 --> 00:35:12,823
I'm sorry, but that wasn't that funny.

853
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:13,857
It's over. Look at that.

854
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:18,395
Saying "He's so funny"
after hearing that is a bit much.

855
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:20,931
Jang Min Cheol, please head out.

856
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:21,765
Yes.

857
00:35:21,765 --> 00:35:24,234
(Second to choose, Jang Min Cheol)

858
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,836
- We take this with us, right?
- Yeah, take it.

859
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,674
Follow me.

860
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,079
(His mother's pick, Kim Myo Jin?)

861
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,882
(Another contender, Kim Jin Joo?)

862
00:35:40,784 --> 00:35:41,885
Where is he going?

863
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:43,954
Hello.

864
00:35:43,954 --> 00:35:45,789
(Passing by his mother's choice)

865
00:35:46,323 --> 00:35:47,157
(Jang Min Cheol chooses Kim Jin Joo.)

866
00:35:47,157 --> 00:35:48,358
In the end...

867
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:49,759
He went to Jin Joo.

868
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:50,660
Hello.

869
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,628
Hello.

870
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:54,097
Hello.

871
00:35:54,097 --> 00:35:54,898
Hello.

872
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:56,566
(Jealous)

873
00:35:56,566 --> 00:35:57,667
I just sit down here, right?

874
00:35:58,435 --> 00:36:00,070
Starting off this brutally...

875
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,804
Right.

876
00:36:00,804 --> 00:36:02,005
I was so nervous.

877
00:36:02,405 --> 00:36:04,474
I was nervous. We were going to drink,
just the two of us.

878
00:36:05,041 --> 00:36:07,077
She couldn't turn her head
because of the sun.

879
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:09,379
So it just made me even more curious.

880
00:36:09,846 --> 00:36:11,581
"What does she look like from the front?"

881
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,152
You two look so much alike.

882
00:36:15,152 --> 00:36:15,752
Really?

883
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,554
That's such a compliment to me.

884
00:36:17,554 --> 00:36:19,356
That's high praise to me.

885
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:23,160
Seo Han Gyeol, please head out.

886
00:36:23,326 --> 00:36:25,328
Seo Han Gyeol, please head out.

887
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:26,530
- Shall we go together?
- Yes.

888
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,199
(Third to choose, Seo Han Gyeol)

889
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:34,104
(Han Gyeol's mother chose Kim Myo Jin.)

890
00:36:34,871 --> 00:36:40,277
(Eun Na Rae and her mom
had liked Han Gyeol.)

891
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:43,814
(Where are Han Gyeol and his mom headed?)

892
00:36:43,814 --> 00:36:44,881
Where are they going?

893
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:47,851
Hello.

894
00:36:48,785 --> 00:36:49,719
Where did he go?

895
00:36:51,254 --> 00:36:54,958
(Passing by Eun Na Rae and her mom)

896
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:55,792
No.

897
00:36:55,792 --> 00:36:58,228
You really can't hide it on your face.

898
00:36:58,228 --> 00:36:59,930
(Moving to the table next to them)

899
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,364
- Hello, excuse us.
- Hello.

900
00:37:01,364 --> 00:37:04,000
So everyone's crowding around Jin Joo.

901
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,335
He went there too?

902
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:06,536
Are they joining them?

903
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,907
Switch seats with her.

904
00:37:10,907 --> 00:37:14,444
The sun seems
to be hitting you pretty hard.

905
00:37:14,444 --> 00:37:18,715
Would it be okay if we swapped seats?

906
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:19,749
Shall we?

907
00:37:19,749 --> 00:37:20,851
Yes, that sounds good.

908
00:37:21,718 --> 00:37:23,453
Nice move.

909
00:37:25,122 --> 00:37:26,590
(Fidgeting)

910
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,258
I think this might be better.

911
00:37:28,258 --> 00:37:28,925
Thank you.

912
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:31,361
- I didn't think of that.
- Right.

913
00:37:31,361 --> 00:37:34,231
The sun's really strong over here.

914
00:37:34,231 --> 00:37:35,632
How thoughtful.

915
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:37,434
Next time, I'll do it for you.

916
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,202
We weren't sure if that was allowed.

917
00:37:40,637 --> 00:37:42,339
It really is much hotter over here.

918
00:37:42,973 --> 00:37:44,407
You kept your face turned like this.

919
00:37:44,407 --> 00:37:45,776
That must've been tough.

920
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:47,177
The sun helped us out.

921
00:37:48,345 --> 00:37:49,379
The sun's playing matchmaker.

922
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:50,614
That's right.

923
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:53,950
Why do you think
you got chosen by two people?

924
00:37:56,052 --> 00:37:56,987
Because I'm pretty.

925
00:37:58,789 --> 00:37:59,890
This is killing me.

926
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:06,029
Who's your top pick right now?

927
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:08,965
I can't pick anyone yet.

928
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,635
Why?
Are you not feeling the people who came?

929
00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:15,338
I want to talk more
with people I haven't talked to yet.

930
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,378
(While Jin Joo is casually
flexing her luck)

931
00:38:22,312 --> 00:38:26,216
(Just jealous)

932
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:30,387
It's so lively over there.

933
00:38:32,656 --> 00:38:33,924
There are two men's teams left,

934
00:38:33,924 --> 00:38:37,060
which means at least one team
could get zero votes.

935
00:38:37,561 --> 00:38:38,995
That could be us.

936
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:41,231
No.

937
00:38:41,231 --> 00:38:42,399
This is tough.

938
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:45,569
We're staring over there
with jealous eyes.

939
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:46,870
This is bad.

940
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,071
- What do we do?
- What do we do?

941
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:49,272
At least one team...

942
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,343
- Her mouth gets so dry.
- It's not like it's the end of the world.

943
00:38:54,177 --> 00:38:56,480
I just imagined it.

944
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,949
If my daughter and I were sitting there
and no one came,

945
00:38:58,949 --> 00:38:59,950
That would hurt.

946
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:02,819
I don't think
I could keep a straight face.

947
00:39:02,819 --> 00:39:04,621
- That would really hurt.
- What do we do?

948
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:07,491
It's not like it's the end of the world.

949
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:12,929
<i>Where should I go?</i>

950
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:16,933
His mother is really cheerful.

951
00:39:16,933 --> 00:39:18,235
So bright.

952
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:20,737
Because his son won't listen
to her anyway.

953
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,039
Lee Seung Hak, please head out.

954
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:23,940
Yes.

955
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:26,209
(Fourth to choose, Lee Seung Hak)

956
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:29,713
(The one the son first mentioned,
Kim Hyun Jin)

957
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:32,883
(The one both son and mom agreed on,
Kim Myo Jin)

958
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,952
(Eun Na Rae,
who is interested in Seung Hak)

959
00:39:37,154 --> 00:39:38,622
I feel like he'll go to Hyun Jin.

960
00:39:41,391 --> 00:39:42,325
Hello.

961
00:39:42,759 --> 00:39:43,660
Hello.

962
00:39:48,031 --> 00:39:50,634
- Hello.
- Hello, nice to meet you.

963
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:52,235
(Lee Seung Hak chooses Kim Myo Jin.)

964
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:53,937
Nice to meet you.

965
00:39:53,937 --> 00:39:54,805
(Big smile)

966
00:39:54,805 --> 00:39:56,606
Thank you.

967
00:39:56,606 --> 00:39:57,774
Aren't they a little too grateful?

968
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:00,310
Right. Anyone showing up
is something to be grateful for.

969
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,446
They stood up so fast.

970
00:40:02,446 --> 00:40:04,381
Seriously.

971
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:05,582
Thank you.

972
00:40:05,582 --> 00:40:06,516
(Jumps up to show gratitude)

973
00:40:06,516 --> 00:40:07,517
- Mom, sit here.
- Okay.

974
00:40:08,552 --> 00:40:10,020
(Bittersweet)

975
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,788
I can't watch this.

976
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:12,923
Same.

977
00:40:12,923 --> 00:40:14,224
What now?

978
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,760
My head hurts.

979
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:20,697
I'm really going to get zero votes.

980
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:22,833
It's okay.

981
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:25,902
The more I watch,

982
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,437
there isn't even anyone
I want to go to either.

983
00:40:28,772 --> 00:40:31,475
Don't say that.

984
00:40:32,576 --> 00:40:34,244
That's what you say when you're sulking.

985
00:40:34,244 --> 00:40:35,212
The mother is a little sulky right now.

986
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:37,380
She is. If it were me, I'd sulk too.

987
00:40:37,948 --> 00:40:38,949
Nice to meet you.

988
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:41,017
Thank you for choosing us.

989
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:43,987
I was so jealous
of the people on both sides.

990
00:40:43,987 --> 00:40:45,188
She's pretty.

991
00:40:45,188 --> 00:40:46,423
Thank you.

992
00:40:47,457 --> 00:40:48,558
You're pretty.

993
00:40:49,726 --> 00:40:51,661
His mother is so bright and cheerful.

994
00:40:51,661 --> 00:40:53,396
She's so sunny.

995
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:58,001
For now,
all we can really see is appearance.

996
00:40:58,535 --> 00:41:01,371
I usually like fox-type faces,

997
00:41:02,172 --> 00:41:04,875
and I felt like she was close to that.

998
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,409
So that's why I chose her.

999
00:41:06,409 --> 00:41:08,712
It's not beer, but cheers.

1000
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:10,113
The vibe is so good.

1001
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:13,450
(Amid the cheerful mood,
two mother-daughter pairs remain unchosen)

1002
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,185
- I can't watch.
- Seriously.

1003
00:41:17,087 --> 00:41:19,222
Now, there's only one team left.

1004
00:41:19,222 --> 00:41:22,192
(And the last mother-son pair
still waiting)

1005
00:41:22,726 --> 00:41:23,960
No.

1006
00:41:28,598 --> 00:41:31,334
My head's getting complicated
all of a sudden.

1007
00:41:33,637 --> 00:41:36,406
If I really get zero votes,
I'm going home.

1008
00:41:37,674 --> 00:41:41,778
If you're too pretty,
guys might avoid you.

1009
00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:46,516
Just based on vibes,
the ones I feel I'd match with are...

1010
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:50,487
either Kim Tae In or Kim Myo Jin.

1011
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:54,291
- This is bad.
- This can't happen.

1012
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,193
You should go somewhere with no other men.

1013
00:42:01,932 --> 00:42:03,400
Moon Se Hoon, please head out.

1014
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,502
(Last to choose, Moon Se Hoon)

1015
00:42:06,536 --> 00:42:07,471
(To Tae In or Myo Jin, like he said?)

1016
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:08,472
My goodness.

1017
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,575
Will he go where he wants?

1018
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:13,977
I think he'll listen to his mom for now.

1019
00:42:13,977 --> 00:42:16,413
Will he listen to his mom
or go where he wants?

1020
00:42:19,549 --> 00:42:21,084
He's going that way. No.

1021
00:42:21,885 --> 00:42:23,653
He's going that way. No.

1022
00:42:23,653 --> 00:42:24,354
(Keeping a smile)

1023
00:42:31,628 --> 00:42:32,696
Hello.

1024
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,866
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Thank you so much.

1025
00:42:35,866 --> 00:42:38,368
(Moon Se Hoon chooses Kim Hyun Jin.)

1026
00:42:38,368 --> 00:42:40,036
No, don't say that.

1027
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,973
Where are you going, Moon Se Hoon?
Come here.

1028
00:42:42,973 --> 00:42:44,174
No.

1029
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:46,576
No.

1030
00:42:46,576 --> 00:42:47,711
(Cho Eun Na Rae gets zero votes.)

1031
00:42:47,711 --> 00:42:49,412
But, well, it's only the beginning.

1032
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:53,016
Right.
First impressions don't mean anything.

1033
00:42:53,016 --> 00:42:53,950
Of course.

1034
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:55,318
Thank you.

1035
00:42:55,318 --> 00:42:57,954
I told my daughter
his voice was so nice, actually.

1036
00:42:57,954 --> 00:42:59,156
Did you?

1037
00:42:59,156 --> 00:43:00,357
Thank you.

1038
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:01,925
Did she?

1039
00:43:02,592 --> 00:43:05,362
- You look great too.
- Yes, when you walked in...

1040
00:43:05,362 --> 00:43:06,429
Really?

1041
00:43:06,897 --> 00:43:10,300
Doesn't she look a lot like her mother
with the bold features and all?

1042
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,668
- Yes.
- Right?

1043
00:43:12,068 --> 00:43:16,373
I thought her distinctive eyes, nose,
and mouth...

1044
00:43:16,373 --> 00:43:18,875
seemed similar.

1045
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:21,945
More than the features,
it's the overall vibe.

1046
00:43:21,945 --> 00:43:22,946
You looked very stylish.

1047
00:43:22,946 --> 00:43:25,549
With the moms here,

1048
00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:27,050
the conversation never dies.

1049
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,119
Right, it flows so naturally.

1050
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,987
It just keeps going.

1051
00:43:30,987 --> 00:43:32,756
They keep asking questions.

1052
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,992
Our choice,

1053
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:38,795
Kim Hyun Jin's mother made
a great first impression on me.

1054
00:43:38,795 --> 00:43:42,132
For me, it was simply first impression.

1055
00:43:42,132 --> 00:43:46,703
Mom kept bringing up Kim Hyun Jin.

1056
00:43:47,904 --> 00:43:50,040
Kim Hyun Jin seems neat and proper.

1057
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,541
Why don't you go to Kim Hyun Jin?

1058
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:54,811
His mom kept saying that. I see.

1059
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:58,281
After thinking it over, I went there.

1060
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:00,117
(The only son
who followed his mother's opinion.)

1061
00:44:01,118 --> 00:44:03,787
(After all the choices,
amid the cheerful atmosphere)

1062
00:44:04,721 --> 00:44:06,523
(The bitter zero-vote
mother-daughter pair)

1063
00:44:06,523 --> 00:44:07,457
I can't watch this.

1064
00:44:07,457 --> 00:44:09,593
I want to go sit over there.

1065
00:44:09,593 --> 00:44:10,927
Yeah. Look at them.

1066
00:44:10,927 --> 00:44:12,229
I'll pour some tea for you.

1067
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:15,332
(Even if it's just the two of them,
sharing a warm cup of tea)

1068
00:44:15,332 --> 00:44:16,399
My gosh.

1069
00:44:16,633 --> 00:44:17,968
Seriously.

1070
00:44:17,968 --> 00:44:21,371
Imagining myself sitting there,
it feels unbearable.

1071
00:44:21,371 --> 00:44:23,206
I think I'd want to go home.

1072
00:44:23,206 --> 00:44:24,574
But there's one upside.

1073
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:26,376
Having the mother next to her, at least...

1074
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:27,477
True.

1075
00:44:27,477 --> 00:44:29,713
If she were sitting there alone...

1076
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:33,016
Yes, it's better than being alone.

1077
00:44:33,016 --> 00:44:36,887
- Okay. Let's comfort ourselves.
- Thanks.

1078
00:44:37,387 --> 00:44:38,555
You want to clink glasses and drink?

1079
00:44:38,555 --> 00:44:40,624
Yeah, let's cheers. We should celebrate.

1080
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:41,825
Celebrate what?

1081
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:43,026
Not getting chosen.

1082
00:44:43,026 --> 00:44:44,995
Say what's on your mind.

1083
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:49,533
Should I have worn something else?

1084
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:51,234
Maybe?

1085
00:44:52,035 --> 00:44:54,037
Should I have worn my hair down?

1086
00:44:54,037 --> 00:44:54,971
Yes, you're right.

1087
00:44:56,573 --> 00:44:57,941
Earlier, I noticed her hair.

1088
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:00,944
It looked much better down.

1089
00:45:02,446 --> 00:45:06,249
(Going over the reasons
behind the zero votes)

1090
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,151
Do you know how awkward that is?

1091
00:45:08,151 --> 00:45:10,487
You end up blurting out nonsense
for no reason.

1092
00:45:10,487 --> 00:45:11,822
But it could be because of you, Mom.

1093
00:45:11,822 --> 00:45:13,290
Goodness, now she's blaming Mom?

1094
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:17,160
You give off this untouchable vibe.

1095
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,996
Your presence is so intense,

1096
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:23,099
so they might think,
"That family seems kind of scary."

1097
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:25,769
A million different reasons
started running through my head.

1098
00:45:27,204 --> 00:45:29,306
(After the chaotic
first-impression picking ends)

1099
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:31,842
It looks like a hanok village.

1100
00:45:31,842 --> 00:45:33,143
Nice.

1101
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:34,377
(They pass the first meeting spot
and arrive at the lodging.)

1102
00:45:34,778 --> 00:45:36,313
How beautiful.

1103
00:45:36,313 --> 00:45:38,315
(Where the mother-son and
mother-daughter pairs will live together)

1104
00:45:38,915 --> 00:45:43,353
(Mother-son lodging, mother-daughter,
mother-son, mother-son)

1105
00:45:44,121 --> 00:45:45,789
I think this is it.

1106
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:47,891
Let's go.

1107
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,727
It's so pretty.

1108
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:55,232
(Suitcases pouring in one after another)

1109
00:45:55,232 --> 00:45:57,000
Since it's five nights and six days.

1110
00:45:57,934 --> 00:46:00,070
The suitcases.

1111
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,705
- I wish someone would carry them.
- This is heavy.

1112
00:46:01,705 --> 00:46:03,440
"This is heavy." Someone help her.

1113
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,307
It's too heavy.

1114
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,309
There?

1115
00:46:06,309 --> 00:46:08,111
- I'll do it, Mom.
- No, it's fine.

1116
00:46:08,111 --> 00:46:08,945
Would you like some help?

1117
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:10,514
Goodness, who's helping right now?

1118
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:12,516
- Look, it's Hyun Jun, right?
- Could you help my mom, please?

1119
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:13,583
Thank you.

1120
00:46:14,151 --> 00:46:15,986
(Hyun Jun rushes over to Tae In's mom.)

1121
00:46:15,986 --> 00:46:16,920
He ran over.

1122
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,888
I'll take that too.

1123
00:46:19,055 --> 00:46:20,223
Thank you so much.

1124
00:46:20,223 --> 00:46:21,925
- Thank you.
- Of course.

1125
00:46:22,726 --> 00:46:24,060
Mom, you can go.

1126
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,495
For now, hold this.

1127
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:26,429
Let go.

1128
00:46:26,429 --> 00:46:27,798
Your shoes are uncomfortable, aren't they?

1129
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:28,865
Yes, they are.

1130
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:32,169
Then...

1131
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:34,204
you can put that up here.

1132
00:46:34,204 --> 00:46:36,206
Han Gyeol is really sweet.

1133
00:46:36,206 --> 00:46:38,442
(Han Gyeol carries Eun Na Rae's luggage.)

1134
00:46:38,942 --> 00:46:39,676
My goodness.

1135
00:46:39,676 --> 00:46:40,944
She's totally flustered.

1136
00:46:40,944 --> 00:46:41,878
It's her shoes.

1137
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:43,246
The wheels won't roll well.

1138
00:46:43,246 --> 00:46:44,981
Leave it there,
and Han Gyeol can just go back once more.

1139
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:46,316
Okay.

1140
00:46:46,316 --> 00:46:47,250
I'll be right back.

1141
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,154
What a reliable son.

1142
00:46:51,154 --> 00:46:52,322
I'll help you.

1143
00:46:52,322 --> 00:46:53,156
Thank you.

1144
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:54,157
Great.

1145
00:46:54,157 --> 00:46:56,226
Han Gyeol really looks like you, ma'am.

1146
00:46:56,226 --> 00:46:57,828
- He does?
- Yes, a lot.

1147
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:00,630
Mom, are you okay?

1148
00:47:02,098 --> 00:47:04,534
If it weren't for Han Gyeol,
we wouldn't have made it here.

1149
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:06,570
He's not even carrying
his own mom's stuff,

1150
00:47:08,638 --> 00:47:12,676
but only carrying that woman's luggage.

1151
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:14,911
They say raising a son is pointless.

1152
00:47:14,911 --> 00:47:17,514
The old saying wasn't wrong.

1153
00:47:18,915 --> 00:47:21,118
(Moving into the lodging is complete.)

1154
00:47:22,385 --> 00:47:24,354
Hyun Jun was so thoughtful,

1155
00:47:25,255 --> 00:47:27,224
even moving the suitcases.

1156
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:30,560
- They're...
- You already fell for him, Mom.

1157
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:32,963
- Tae In's mom is totally smitten.
- He only does cute, sweet things.

1158
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:34,531
The other guys didn't do that.

1159
00:47:34,531 --> 00:47:38,702
He completely charmed my mom.

1160
00:47:38,702 --> 00:47:39,736
He got me.

1161
00:47:41,671 --> 00:47:42,639
Tae In.

1162
00:47:43,607 --> 00:47:45,776
Hyun Jun carried only our luggage.

1163
00:47:45,776 --> 00:47:47,711
Only ours, and nobody else's.

1164
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,712
Really?

1165
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,347
Only ours, and nobody else's.

1166
00:47:50,347 --> 00:47:51,381
Really?

1167
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:52,816
That's why I'm praising him so much.

1168
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:55,952
She's totally fallen for him.

1169
00:47:56,253 --> 00:47:59,656
I didn't say it
in front of everyone on purpose.

1170
00:48:00,791 --> 00:48:02,726
Feels like you and him
would have good chemistry.

1171
00:48:02,726 --> 00:48:03,994
I think you'd match well.

1172
00:48:05,395 --> 00:48:07,330
You seem to match him.

1173
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:09,566
(Brainwashing her daughter with Hyun Jun)

1174
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,770
(As the day winds down with
the first impressions still lingering)

1175
00:48:15,772 --> 00:48:18,775
They're not going to play games
with the moms, are they?

1176
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:21,845
Like tug-of-war or something?

1177
00:48:21,845 --> 00:48:23,513
No way.

1178
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:26,983
I wonder
what they're going to ask us this time.

1179
00:48:26,983 --> 00:48:27,851
I don't know.

1180
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:34,024
For tonight's dinner,

1181
00:48:34,024 --> 00:48:37,060
the men will cook.

1182
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:41,465
You're confident, right?

1183
00:48:43,333 --> 00:48:46,770
(The mother-daughter pairs clap
in delight.)

1184
00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:48,438
I never thought I'd be cooking in my life,
but here I am.

1185
00:48:49,706 --> 00:48:51,641
If you want to get married,
you have to do that too.

1186
00:48:54,244 --> 00:48:55,178
Right?

1187
00:48:55,178 --> 00:48:56,012
Yes.

1188
00:48:56,012 --> 00:48:57,247
You chose the menu earlier,

1189
00:48:57,247 --> 00:49:00,083
so please come out
and introduce what you'll be cooking.

1190
00:49:00,083 --> 00:49:02,786
Then, the women will discuss
with their mothers...

1191
00:49:02,786 --> 00:49:04,688
and stand next to the man they choose.

1192
00:49:05,522 --> 00:49:06,356
(This time,
the women's first-impression choice)

1193
00:49:06,356 --> 00:49:08,425
- Really?
- So this is how it goes.

1194
00:49:08,425 --> 00:49:11,628
The men did it earlier,
and now it's our turn.

1195
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:13,964
It's the women's first-impression choice.

1196
00:49:14,731 --> 00:49:16,399
Cooking was just an excuse.

1197
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:19,636
If nobody comes, we just eat by ourselves.

1198
00:49:19,636 --> 00:49:21,238
- Is that how it works?
- It's the same as earlier.

1199
00:49:21,805 --> 00:49:23,774
Then I might end up eating alone.

1200
00:49:24,741 --> 00:49:25,776
It's just first impressions.

1201
00:49:28,745 --> 00:49:30,580
Seung Hak seems kind of okay too.

1202
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,282
That's what I'm thinking too.

1203
00:49:32,282 --> 00:49:33,784
So...

1204
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:37,621
Kim Hyun Jun, please come out
to the center first.

1205
00:49:38,121 --> 00:49:41,358
For this matching, will it be one-to-one,

1206
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:43,026
or will there be multiple matches?

1207
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:46,596
I'm going to make...

1208
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,566
kimchi fried rice.

1209
00:49:51,234 --> 00:49:53,270
I can't guarantee it'll taste good.

1210
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:55,272
I'm not confident.

1211
00:49:57,374 --> 00:49:58,608
And?

1212
00:49:58,608 --> 00:49:59,609
That's it.

1213
00:49:59,943 --> 00:50:01,478
Please choose him.

1214
00:50:02,312 --> 00:50:03,313
Don't say that.

1215
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:05,315
Please.

1216
00:50:10,253 --> 00:50:12,055
What is this?
Are they playing mind games right now?

1217
00:50:12,055 --> 00:50:13,056
Right.

1218
00:50:20,063 --> 00:50:21,031
What now? Should we go?

1219
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:21,965
Go.

1220
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:24,668
Tae In went.

1221
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:28,572
(Kim Tae In chooses Kim Hyun Jun.)

1222
00:50:29,539 --> 00:50:31,608
Looks like someone else went too.

1223
00:50:33,214 --> 00:50:34,249
- No way.
- What?

1224
00:50:34,249 --> 00:50:35,150
What is it?

1225
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:36,284
No.

1226
00:50:36,284 --> 00:50:37,218
Look at that.

1227
00:50:38,386 --> 00:50:39,354
Go.

1228
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,990
(All at once)

1229
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:42,891
What is this?

1230
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:45,660
What is happening right now?

1231
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,495
What am I watching right now?

1232
00:50:47,729 --> 00:50:48,530
(Hyun Jun's fan is excited.)

1233
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,798
I told you.

1234
00:50:50,932 --> 00:50:52,100
What?

1235
00:50:53,968 --> 00:50:56,905
(Kim Hyun Jin chooses Kim Hyun Jun.)

1236
00:50:57,572 --> 00:51:02,143
(Kim Jin Joo chooses Kim Hyun Jun.)

1237
00:51:06,448 --> 00:51:07,315
Welcome.

1238
00:51:07,315 --> 00:51:09,284
Three teams went?

1239
00:51:09,284 --> 00:51:10,285
Yes.

1240
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:14,089
- This can't be happening.
- It's a first-impression landslide.

1241
00:51:14,522 --> 00:51:15,557
The best.

1242
00:51:15,557 --> 00:51:16,858
This is the best.

1243
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:20,228
He'll need to make
a lot of kimchi fried rice.

1244
00:51:21,729 --> 00:51:23,965
(Hyun Jun gets picked by three women.)

1245
00:51:23,965 --> 00:51:25,934
I was honestly shocked.

1246
00:51:25,934 --> 00:51:26,968
I mean,

1247
00:51:26,968 --> 00:51:28,903
I could die happy today.

1248
00:51:28,903 --> 00:51:31,840
At first, I was really thrown off.

1249
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,209
Then I was like, "What?"

1250
00:51:34,209 --> 00:51:36,177
I even thought, "Is this a prank?"

1251
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,512
On the other hand,

1252
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:40,849
I knew it was as fleeting
as a soap bubble.

1253
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,017
So I thought,
"This is going to disappear any second."

1254
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,152
I was so happy.

1255
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:46,287
Unbelievable.

1256
00:51:47,822 --> 00:51:49,858
I was honestly flustered at first.

1257
00:51:49,858 --> 00:51:54,229
I thought,
"People's taste really is similar."

1258
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:58,066
More women came up than I expected,

1259
00:51:58,066 --> 00:52:00,368
so I felt like everyone saw
his first impression positively.

1260
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:03,438
I kept thinking,
"They must've felt the same way I did."

1261
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,609
(Hyun Jun leaves,
receiving congratulations.)

1262
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:08,910
Let's go.

1263
00:52:08,910 --> 00:52:10,145
Yes.

1264
00:52:10,145 --> 00:52:11,513
(Crowded)

1265
00:52:11,513 --> 00:52:13,381
- This is so...
- I can't believe this.

1266
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,883
Look at that.

1267
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:16,818
Is everyone going together? All together?

1268
00:52:16,818 --> 00:52:18,386
Everyone's going together.

1269
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:19,754
All eight are going together?

1270
00:52:19,754 --> 00:52:21,089
Because we haven't eaten yet.

1271
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:24,793
(Empty)

1272
00:52:24,793 --> 00:52:25,693
It flipped.

1273
00:52:25,693 --> 00:52:27,128
Now, the men are getting anxious.

1274
00:52:27,128 --> 00:52:28,163
Right.

1275
00:52:28,163 --> 00:52:31,866
(4 mother-son teams are left waiting)

1276
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,469
Out of the four of us,

1277
00:52:34,469 --> 00:52:36,538
two might not get picked.

1278
00:52:40,742 --> 00:52:44,679
(Second to go, Jang Min Cheol)

1279
00:52:48,883 --> 00:52:50,351
The dishes I thought of are...

1280
00:52:50,885 --> 00:52:53,822
the pork kimchi stew I often eat at home,

1281
00:52:54,355 --> 00:52:56,724
and stir-fried fish cakes
with shiitake mushrooms.

1282
00:52:59,828 --> 00:53:03,264
Part of me thought,

1283
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:05,266
"Maybe I'll end up eating with my mom,
just the two of us."

1284
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:06,901
Poor him.

1285
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:11,272
He doesn't cook often,

1286
00:53:11,272 --> 00:53:13,508
but he has a good touch.

1287
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:16,111
He's watched me cook many times
and learned,

1288
00:53:16,578 --> 00:53:19,681
so I guarantee it'll taste good.

1289
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:23,251
You won't be disappointed.

1290
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:24,953
She's trying to win them with the dish.

1291
00:53:24,953 --> 00:53:26,588
Taste isn't the point, ma'am.

1292
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:28,957
Everyone went for the kimchi fried rice.

1293
00:53:32,761 --> 00:53:33,728
My goodness.

1294
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,466
You end up lowering your head like that.

1295
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,768
You just feel sorry for no reason.

1296
00:53:39,768 --> 00:53:41,469
It feels like you did something wrong
for no reason.

1297
00:53:48,209 --> 00:53:50,912
Jang Min Cheol, please move by yourself.

1298
00:53:50,912 --> 00:53:52,714
(Jang Min Cheol gets 0 votes.)

1299
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:54,082
My gut feeling was right.

1300
00:53:56,551 --> 00:54:00,021
Earlier, I actually warned my mom.

1301
00:54:00,021 --> 00:54:02,056
"Maybe no one will come."

1302
00:54:03,158 --> 00:54:05,894
And she was like, "Yeah, okay."

1303
00:54:05,894 --> 00:54:07,362
But...

1304
00:54:07,362 --> 00:54:09,631
I was thinking,
"Still, I hope at least one person comes."

1305
00:54:11,666 --> 00:54:13,034
I came here to find a match,

1306
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:15,937
but I'm off to make kimchi stew,
with my mom.

1307
00:54:15,937 --> 00:54:18,039
They can just eat together.

1308
00:54:19,808 --> 00:54:21,543
Hello. Today,

1309
00:54:21,543 --> 00:54:24,312
I'm going to make spicy braised chicken.

1310
00:54:24,312 --> 00:54:26,014
I'll make it good.

1311
00:54:26,915 --> 00:54:30,051
You can just come and relax.

1312
00:54:30,051 --> 00:54:32,087
I'll take care of everything.

1313
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,556
It's been a long time since he moved out,

1314
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:37,225
so he cooks single-serving meals
pretty often.

1315
00:54:37,826 --> 00:54:41,096
I can't guarantee the taste,
but he's enjoying the process.

1316
00:54:53,975 --> 00:54:54,943
Let's go.

1317
00:54:56,478 --> 00:54:57,545
Let's go.

1318
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:58,680
Yes.

1319
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:59,681
(Cho Eun Na Rae chooses Seo Han Gyeol.)

1320
00:54:59,681 --> 00:55:01,216
- Ms. Cho Eun Na Rae.
- Thank you.

1321
00:55:01,216 --> 00:55:02,150
Hello.

1322
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,752
- Thank you.
- I'm looking forward to the food.

1323
00:55:03,752 --> 00:55:05,487
Just enjoy it.

1324
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,357
I felt good.

1325
00:55:09,991 --> 00:55:12,293
It was a bit unexpected too.

1326
00:55:12,293 --> 00:55:14,963
Han Gyeol didn't choose me,

1327
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:19,434
but it's just first impressions.

1328
00:55:20,368 --> 00:55:22,370
He carried their luggage earlier.

1329
00:55:23,238 --> 00:55:24,939
You can't ignore that help.

1330
00:55:26,174 --> 00:55:29,277
(As Han Gyeol and Eun Na Rae leave
in a cheerful mood)

1331
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:33,314
(The two remaining mother-son teams)

1332
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,417
Now...

1333
00:55:35,417 --> 00:55:36,217
The last one.

1334
00:55:36,217 --> 00:55:40,155
(The last ones to go,
Kim Myo Jin and her mother)

1335
00:55:40,388 --> 00:55:44,058
I'm going to make soybean paste stew
with sliced beef brisket.

1336
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:46,628
I've actually never cooked before.

1337
00:55:46,628 --> 00:55:48,763
I've actually never cooked before.

1338
00:55:48,763 --> 00:55:51,065
So I'm not sure how it'll turn out.

1339
00:55:51,633 --> 00:55:52,834
Help me.

1340
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:55,703
I'll support him closely from the side.

1341
00:55:57,071 --> 00:55:58,807
Today, what I'll be making is...

1342
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,209
chopped steak,

1343
00:56:01,209 --> 00:56:05,146
and a few other meat-based dishes.

1344
00:56:05,146 --> 00:56:07,615
My son's cooking...

1345
00:56:07,615 --> 00:56:10,418
I can vouch for it. I'm confident.

1346
00:56:13,321 --> 00:56:14,489
Please choose him.

1347
00:56:17,225 --> 00:56:20,495
When the men first walked in,

1348
00:56:20,495 --> 00:56:25,400
based on first impressions,
I liked Moon Se Hoon the most.

1349
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,735
And after that, Seung Hak came...

1350
00:56:27,735 --> 00:56:31,906
to our table and poured us tea.

1351
00:56:31,906 --> 00:56:34,142
So I got more interested in him.

1352
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:35,577
Seeing him up close,

1353
00:56:35,577 --> 00:56:39,881
he felt more like my type.

1354
00:56:40,315 --> 00:56:43,818
Right, like some twist of fate,

1355
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,553
out of all people, those two were there.

1356
00:56:46,521 --> 00:56:49,991
So I kept wondering,
"Who should I choose?"

1357
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,628
She may be grateful he chose her,
but that's that.

1358
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:57,065
What matters is figuring out
who you really click with.

1359
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:02,570
(Kim Myo Jin chooses Moon Se Hoon.)

1360
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:03,304
Yeah.

1361
00:57:03,304 --> 00:57:04,305
Hello.

1362
00:57:04,906 --> 00:57:06,307
Hello, ma'am.

1363
00:57:08,343 --> 00:57:10,745
It's good to meet
lots of different people.

1364
00:57:10,745 --> 00:57:12,113
- Of course.
- Of course.

1365
00:57:12,113 --> 00:57:16,384
Before I chose Hyun Jin
for my first-impression pick,

1366
00:57:16,384 --> 00:57:18,920
Myo Jin was one of the people
I was considering.

1367
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:23,625
Vibe-wise, I feel like I'd match well...

1368
00:57:23,625 --> 00:57:26,528
with either Kim Tae In or Kim Myo Jin.

1369
00:57:27,996 --> 00:57:29,264
So I was a bit excited.

1370
00:57:29,697 --> 00:57:33,601
"I'll get to talk to this person now,"
that kind of excitement.

1371
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,838
Nice to meet you.

1372
00:57:36,838 --> 00:57:38,840
Nice to meet you.

1373
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,141
Please make it delicious for her.

1374
00:57:40,141 --> 00:57:41,476
Yes, I'll do my best and make it tasty.

1375
00:57:41,476 --> 00:57:43,044
You should've practiced cooking.

1376
00:57:43,978 --> 00:57:47,215
(Pouts)

1377
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:50,585
I got zero votes,
with my mom right next to me.

1378
00:57:51,419 --> 00:57:54,122
She'd never seen me like that,

1379
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:59,928
so I think she must've felt bad too.

1380
00:58:00,595 --> 00:58:04,866
For me, it was a bit disappointing.
It was a kind of letdown.

1381
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:08,336
Who's going to come
when you say it's your first time cooking?

1382
00:58:10,772 --> 00:58:12,607
Why are they just making us stand here?

1383
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,276
It's embarrassing to have no partner.

1384
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:17,245
Come on, so what?

1385
00:58:17,245 --> 00:58:18,747
You're right.

1386
00:58:18,747 --> 00:58:20,248
Yeah. So what?

1387
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:21,750
It's okay.

1388
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:23,985
It got dark so fast.

1389
00:58:23,985 --> 00:58:25,253
Yes.

1390
00:58:25,253 --> 00:58:26,554
Because we're up in the mountains.

1391
00:58:27,388 --> 00:58:30,625
(This area is open for filming with
permission from authorized personnel.)

1392
00:58:30,959 --> 00:58:34,062
He's cooking with three women right now?

1393
00:58:34,062 --> 00:58:35,430
- Is it one-to-three?
- That sounds tough.

1394
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:36,698
One-to-three?

1395
00:58:36,698 --> 00:58:38,399
Chef, what should we do?

1396
00:58:39,234 --> 00:58:41,236
Give each of us a task.

1397
00:58:41,236 --> 00:58:42,437
Okay.

1398
00:58:42,437 --> 00:58:44,672
Do you normally stir-fry pork without oil?

1399
00:58:44,672 --> 00:58:46,775
It's pretty fatty, so no need for that.

1400
00:58:46,775 --> 00:58:48,743
And season with salt later.

1401
00:58:48,743 --> 00:58:49,544
Season with salt?

1402
00:58:49,544 --> 00:58:52,547
Yes. It'll be bland
if you just leave it like that.

1403
00:58:53,148 --> 00:58:55,683
It's better to season it and then adjust.

1404
00:58:56,618 --> 00:58:59,687
Kimchi is a bit tricky,
so let's add it at the end.

1405
00:59:00,188 --> 00:59:01,356
I should wash the lettuce.

1406
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,659
But salads like this are kind of...

1407
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:05,827
For later?

1408
00:59:05,827 --> 00:59:08,696
Compared to Hyun Jin, the other two...

1409
00:59:09,631 --> 00:59:11,733
don't seem very comfortable cooking.

1410
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:13,334
What should I do?

1411
00:59:14,302 --> 00:59:15,904
Cheerleading, please.

1412
00:59:19,174 --> 00:59:20,075
Do you want to try it?

1413
00:59:20,075 --> 00:59:23,311
(Do you want to try some Shine Muscat?)

1414
00:59:24,946 --> 00:59:25,914
To his mouth.

1415
00:59:26,448 --> 00:59:28,016
Wait, he took it with his mouth.

1416
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:34,823
I'll try it, ma'am.

1417
00:59:35,457 --> 00:59:37,058
Wait, you might not be older than me.

1418
00:59:37,058 --> 00:59:40,028
(My bad, "ma'am" may sound too much.)

1419
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:41,696
"Ma'am?" She needled her.

1420
00:59:41,696 --> 00:59:42,897
Kind of.

1421
00:59:42,897 --> 00:59:44,332
What do you think about that?

1422
00:59:44,332 --> 00:59:46,401
Look at the power play. My goodness.

1423
00:59:47,135 --> 00:59:48,336
What am I supposed to call her?

1424
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:49,471
Well, princesses all...

1425
00:59:49,471 --> 00:59:50,905
- Jin Joo.
- Jin Joo.

1426
00:59:50,905 --> 00:59:52,540
Don't princesses all call
each other "ma'am?"

1427
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:55,343
(Well...)

1428
00:59:55,343 --> 00:59:56,578
It tastes bad.

1429
00:59:56,578 --> 00:59:57,879
Here it is.

1430
00:59:57,879 --> 00:59:59,447
There was sesame oil too?

1431
00:59:59,447 --> 01:00:01,216
Of course. Everything's there.

1432
01:00:01,216 --> 01:00:02,217
There's Korean dipping sauce
for wraps too.

1433
01:00:02,217 --> 01:00:03,918
Yeah, they're all there.

1434
01:00:05,019 --> 01:00:06,654
Did we suddenly start speaking casually?

1435
01:00:07,655 --> 01:00:09,891
- They suddenly went casual?
- They went casual all of a sudden?

1436
01:00:09,891 --> 01:00:11,126
It's fine, right?
It doesn't matter, does it?

1437
01:00:11,126 --> 01:00:12,560
Speaking casually? Yeah.

1438
01:00:13,895 --> 01:00:15,563
What if they find out later...

1439
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:17,565
that she's ten years older or something?

1440
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:20,568
Like a chef.

1441
01:00:20,568 --> 01:00:22,070
(Han Gyeol gives Eun Na Rae an apron.)

1442
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,738
Thanks.

1443
01:00:26,341 --> 01:00:28,676
While you're at it,
you should tie this too.

1444
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:30,145
That...

1445
01:00:30,145 --> 01:00:31,146
Is this too much?

1446
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:32,580
No, not too much.

1447
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,116
You suddenly got playful.

1448
01:00:37,018 --> 01:00:38,019
(Cutting green onion?)

1449
01:00:38,019 --> 01:00:39,020
- Me?
- Yeah.

1450
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:40,488
Hold it.

1451
01:00:42,257 --> 01:00:44,659
From here, cut it.

1452
01:00:44,659 --> 01:00:46,327
A little closer.

1453
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:48,163
(Gently)

1454
01:00:48,496 --> 01:00:50,799
This much? Is that too small?

1455
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,834
A bit thicker? A little thicker?

1456
01:00:52,834 --> 01:00:54,502
- This is okay.
- Like this?

1457
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:56,337
You can add a lot.

1458
01:00:57,639 --> 01:00:58,807
Done.

1459
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:01,109
Why? Are you having fun?

1460
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:02,911
This is "green onion flirting."

1461
01:01:02,911 --> 01:01:04,379
Green onion flirting.

1462
01:01:04,379 --> 01:01:05,346
Green onion flirting.

1463
01:01:06,347 --> 01:01:07,949
He's so cute.

1464
01:01:07,949 --> 01:01:08,883
- Green onion flirting was nice.
- My goodness.

1465
01:01:08,883 --> 01:01:10,151
He's so cute.

1466
01:01:10,785 --> 01:01:11,920
So cute.

1467
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:13,688
I felt a little flutter then.

1468
01:01:14,155 --> 01:01:17,559
But about Eun Na Rae,

1469
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:20,662
maybe because she was so lonely earlier,

1470
01:01:21,296 --> 01:01:23,665
she's suddenly excited about everything.

1471
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,835
Do I get fluttery over random things?

1472
01:01:26,835 --> 01:01:30,171
But I figured it still counts
as a kind of physical affection.

1473
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:33,241
You can add a lot.

1474
01:01:33,241 --> 01:01:35,577
(As Eun Na Rae and Han Gyeol slice
one green onion together...)

1475
01:01:35,577 --> 01:01:36,911
Do we not need to wash this?

1476
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:38,646
We should rinse it once.

1477
01:01:39,948 --> 01:01:40,882
Do you wash green onions?

1478
01:01:41,649 --> 01:01:43,651
Of course, you wash green onions.

1479
01:01:44,786 --> 01:01:46,755
Do we wash fish cakes too?

1480
01:01:46,755 --> 01:01:48,590
No, I don't think you wash fish cakes.

1481
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:52,427
Do I cut it like...

1482
01:01:52,427 --> 01:01:53,528
How should I cut it?

1483
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:57,298
My mom usually chops it like this.

1484
01:01:57,832 --> 01:01:59,667
You're pretty good at this.

1485
01:01:59,667 --> 01:02:00,635
Am I?

1486
01:02:01,569 --> 01:02:03,438
Are we just leveling up
our cooking skills here?

1487
01:02:03,438 --> 01:02:04,372
I know, right?

1488
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:08,410
Is this blood?

1489
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:09,444
Sorry.

1490
01:02:09,978 --> 01:02:11,646
Wait, what? Seriously?

1491
01:02:11,646 --> 01:02:13,248
What? Are you bleeding?

1492
01:02:13,248 --> 01:02:14,382
- Hyun Jun?
- Seriously?

1493
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:15,251
No.

1494
01:02:15,251 --> 01:02:16,486
No, right?

1495
01:02:16,486 --> 01:02:17,387
It looks real.

1496
01:02:17,387 --> 01:02:18,621
It's ketchup.

1497
01:02:18,621 --> 01:02:20,023
No, that's actually blood.

1498
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:20,957
This is blood.

1499
01:02:22,692 --> 01:02:25,395
(A moment ago,
Hyun Jun was doing the dishes.)

1500
01:02:28,231 --> 01:02:30,233
- What did he cut it on?
- I think it was a knife.

1501
01:02:30,233 --> 01:02:31,534
The edge of the scissors. I see.

1502
01:02:31,868 --> 01:02:33,069
Be careful. Those can cut you.

1503
01:02:33,069 --> 01:02:34,604
(He cut his finger on the scissors
while washing dishes.)

1504
01:02:35,572 --> 01:02:36,472
I'm okay.

1505
01:02:36,472 --> 01:02:38,341
(Hyun Jun had been hiding it,
not wanting to make a fuss.)

1506
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:40,343
You're the type of guy
who needs a lot of looking after.

1507
01:02:41,077 --> 01:02:42,845
Yeah, so please give me lots of attention.

1508
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,318
Where is Tae In going?

1509
01:02:49,886 --> 01:02:51,221
Where did I put the bandage?

1510
01:02:52,388 --> 01:02:54,490
Where did I put it?

1511
01:02:54,490 --> 01:02:55,658
Bandage flirting.

1512
01:02:56,526 --> 01:02:58,027
(Tae In grabs a bandage for Hyun Jun.)

1513
01:02:58,027 --> 01:02:59,028
Bringing a bandage is a strong move.

1514
01:02:59,028 --> 01:03:01,197
You can't ignore
that kind of thoughtfulness, right?

1515
01:03:01,197 --> 01:03:02,098
It's a strong one.

1516
01:03:04,234 --> 01:03:05,335
Why are you out here?

1517
01:03:06,035 --> 01:03:08,338
A bandage? Great.

1518
01:03:08,338 --> 01:03:10,506
They ran into each other out there?
Are they meant to be?

1519
01:03:10,506 --> 01:03:13,409
- Was he waiting? How did that happen?
- How did they meet right there?

1520
01:03:13,409 --> 01:03:14,310
Why?

1521
01:03:15,211 --> 01:03:16,045
Why?

1522
01:03:16,045 --> 01:03:17,013
(Tae In applies the ointment
she had brought.)

1523
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:18,882
- That's too severe.
- It's okay.

1524
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,783
This one's waterproof.

1525
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:24,053
It's waterproof. I'll apply this first.

1526
01:03:25,121 --> 01:03:26,089
It's fine, really.

1527
01:03:26,856 --> 01:03:28,524
This is worse than I thought.

1528
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:30,927
That's it. The Shine Muscat is forgotten.

1529
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:32,428
He's staring.

1530
01:03:32,428 --> 01:03:34,831
At this rate, they're going to kiss.

1531
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:38,234
(K.O. from bandage flirting)

1532
01:03:38,234 --> 01:03:39,235
Yeah, that's how it was.

1533
01:03:39,235 --> 01:03:40,603
I was really grateful.

1534
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:42,572
Of course, my heart fluttered.

1535
01:03:42,572 --> 01:03:45,808
Right now, Tae In is the one
I feel the most drawn to.

1536
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,678
Why am I the one turning red?

1537
01:03:49,812 --> 01:03:51,381
Nice. This is impressive.

1538
01:03:51,381 --> 01:03:52,782
(The first dinner, all together)

1539
01:03:52,782 --> 01:03:54,217
This is so nice.

1540
01:03:54,851 --> 01:03:57,086
I want to take it all in visually.

1541
01:03:57,086 --> 01:03:58,655
I want to eat with my eyes first.

1542
01:03:58,655 --> 01:04:00,256
Goodness. What's this?

1543
01:04:00,256 --> 01:04:02,492
(Even Han Gyeol's team's
spicy braised chicken)

1544
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:05,061
Seeing you up close like this,
you're really handsome.

1545
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:06,095
No, not at all.

1546
01:04:06,863 --> 01:04:08,131
I've only seen you from far away.

1547
01:04:08,131 --> 01:04:09,732
I have presbyopia,
so I can't see very well.

1548
01:04:09,732 --> 01:04:10,867
Then I'll do this.

1549
01:04:12,569 --> 01:04:15,438
(Shows off his looks from very close)

1550
01:04:15,438 --> 01:04:17,106
How is it? Is it okay?

1551
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,509
You should be looking that way, son.

1552
01:04:21,411 --> 01:04:23,947
You're handsome.

1553
01:04:24,714 --> 01:04:26,349
Then look up close, like this.

1554
01:04:26,349 --> 01:04:27,450
Handsome.

1555
01:04:27,450 --> 01:04:28,518
Thank you.

1556
01:04:28,518 --> 01:04:32,455
(A zero-vote man's strategy
for winning over a future mother-in-law)

1557
01:04:32,455 --> 01:04:33,289
That was hilarious.

1558
01:04:34,057 --> 01:04:35,925
Enjoy the food. Great job, everyone.

1559
01:04:36,326 --> 01:04:37,393
Great job.

1560
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:39,762
You liked it, right?

1561
01:04:39,762 --> 01:04:42,765
With three women coming over.

1562
01:04:42,765 --> 01:04:44,400
Honestly,

1563
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,935
I could die happy today.

1564
01:04:46,936 --> 01:04:48,071
I figured you'd feel that way.

1565
01:04:49,105 --> 01:04:51,307
But since this is all
just first impressions,

1566
01:04:51,307 --> 01:04:54,177
it doesn't really mean that much.

1567
01:04:54,177 --> 01:04:56,045
Why wouldn't it? It means a lot.

1568
01:04:56,045 --> 01:04:58,214
Your mother would be hurt.

1569
01:04:58,214 --> 01:05:00,516
If you say it means nothing
after she was so happy.

1570
01:05:01,818 --> 01:05:03,519
I actually liked it the most.

1571
01:05:09,025 --> 01:05:10,260
(A wine party opens
at Se Hoon and Myo Jin's table)

1572
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,829
We get along so well,

1573
01:05:12,829 --> 01:05:14,998
so the wine is going down fast.

1574
01:05:14,998 --> 01:05:17,300
I've never seen you drink this much, Mom.

1575
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,201
I know.

1576
01:05:18,201 --> 01:05:19,535
I really like drinking.

1577
01:05:19,535 --> 01:05:20,503
Really?

1578
01:05:20,503 --> 01:05:22,505
In my family, I'm the only one like that.

1579
01:05:22,505 --> 01:05:26,109
You know my wish
about my son-in-law, right?

1580
01:05:26,109 --> 01:05:29,479
You know my wish
about my son-in-law, right?

1581
01:05:29,479 --> 01:05:32,081
- Someone who can drink.
- Really?

1582
01:05:32,815 --> 01:05:34,183
Really?

1583
01:05:34,183 --> 01:05:36,286
Because in my family,

1584
01:05:36,286 --> 01:05:38,187
I'm the only one who can drink.

1585
01:05:39,656 --> 01:05:41,024
No one else can.

1586
01:05:41,024 --> 01:05:42,825
So my one wish is...

1587
01:05:42,825 --> 01:05:45,328
for someone who can drink a bit
to become my son-in-law.

1588
01:05:46,362 --> 01:05:48,631
What's your limit, then?

1589
01:05:48,631 --> 01:05:49,499
Me?

1590
01:05:50,366 --> 01:05:51,935
With soju,

1591
01:05:51,935 --> 01:05:53,570
maybe...

1592
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:55,838
about two and a half to three bottles.

1593
01:05:55,838 --> 01:05:57,006
Yes, two and a half to three.

1594
01:05:57,006 --> 01:06:00,176
Once you start, two bottles go by fast.

1595
01:06:01,077 --> 01:06:03,146
Do you like games?

1596
01:06:03,146 --> 01:06:05,515
No, I've never really played games.

1597
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:06,916
I see.

1598
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:08,585
Mom's bonus points
are stacking up right now.

1599
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:12,155
(Se Hoon slowly winning over
Myo Jin's mother)

1600
01:06:12,388 --> 01:06:14,557
I asked him a lot of things while we ate,

1601
01:06:14,557 --> 01:06:16,559
and honestly, I found myself wanting him.

1602
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:18,628
My heart fluttered.

1603
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:20,697
There was something about him.

1604
01:06:21,564 --> 01:06:25,235
For some reason,
I don't think I was wildly fluttery.

1605
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:27,704
It's just the mom who's fluttering.

1606
01:06:27,704 --> 01:06:29,472
I couldn't tell
if he was really interested in me,

1607
01:06:29,472 --> 01:06:30,807
or...

1608
01:06:30,807 --> 01:06:33,876
just being nice to me...

1609
01:06:33,876 --> 01:06:37,547
because I chose him.

1610
01:06:37,547 --> 01:06:40,016
That part felt a bit unclear.

1611
01:06:40,516 --> 01:06:43,553
Actually, Seung Hak...

1612
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:45,755
- has been on my mind a bit.
- She should've gone there.

1613
01:06:45,755 --> 01:06:50,660
Seeing him up close in casual clothes,

1614
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,462
he was kind of cute.

1615
01:06:53,062 --> 01:06:54,063
So...

1616
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:57,500
I thought, "I want to try talking to him."

1617
01:06:58,668 --> 01:07:00,136
Are you two having soju?

1618
01:07:00,136 --> 01:07:01,738
We're going with soju and beer.

1619
01:07:02,972 --> 01:07:05,041
Coming to Gimcheon
for the first time in my life,

1620
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:06,776
I went grocery shopping
with a man I just met.

1621
01:07:07,610 --> 01:07:10,113
Min Cheol, what are your hobbies?

1622
01:07:10,113 --> 01:07:12,348
I've got one clear hobby.

1623
01:07:12,348 --> 01:07:13,182
Weight training.

1624
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:15,552
That's his hobby.

1625
01:07:15,552 --> 01:07:18,621
Work, diet, weight training.

1626
01:07:18,621 --> 01:07:20,156
That's similar to me.

1627
01:07:20,156 --> 01:07:21,090
You have no idea.

1628
01:07:21,858 --> 01:07:24,360
(Showing off muscles)

1629
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,395
He keeps doing that.

1630
01:07:27,564 --> 01:07:32,035
Min Cheol said he does weight training,

1631
01:07:32,035 --> 01:07:35,672
and that's basically my routine too.
Work, exercise, diet.

1632
01:07:35,672 --> 01:07:38,207
So I became more interested in Min Cheol.

1633
01:07:40,376 --> 01:07:43,112
(Cho Eun Na Rae returns to the lodging.)

1634
01:07:43,846 --> 01:07:45,748
Wasn't there some kind of map?

1635
01:07:45,748 --> 01:07:47,884
A map? What are you trying to find?

1636
01:07:48,818 --> 01:07:52,088
(Eun Na Rae can't take her eyes off
the lodging map.)

1637
01:07:52,088 --> 01:07:53,456
What do I do?

1638
01:07:56,292 --> 01:07:57,193
Why?

1639
01:08:00,863 --> 01:08:01,764
Why?

1640
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,400
Seung Hak.

1641
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,768
Should I ask him to talk?

1642
01:08:06,502 --> 01:08:09,739
Maybe just ask for a quick chat?

1643
01:08:09,739 --> 01:08:11,007
Yeah, go for it.

1644
01:08:11,007 --> 01:08:14,477
But I don't know where he's staying.

1645
01:08:14,978 --> 01:08:19,482
The people I felt drawn to
at first sight were...

1646
01:08:19,482 --> 01:08:21,651
- For me, Number Three and Number Four.
- Same.

1647
01:08:22,585 --> 01:08:23,686
Really?

1648
01:08:23,686 --> 01:08:25,221
(Number 3 Seo Han Gyeol,
Number 4 Lee Seung Hak)

1649
01:08:25,488 --> 01:08:27,857
Between those two,

1650
01:08:27,857 --> 01:08:29,626
especially Seung Hak.

1651
01:08:29,626 --> 01:08:32,362
He just keeps sticking in my mind.

1652
01:08:35,265 --> 01:08:36,966
I should just go now.

1653
01:08:36,966 --> 01:08:38,001
Yeah, go.

1654
01:08:42,705 --> 01:08:47,176
(Eun Na Rae moves right away
after deciding.)

1655
01:08:47,410 --> 01:08:48,678
Looks like she's going to look for him.

1656
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,148
What do I do?

1657
01:08:52,882 --> 01:08:54,984
The women are really proactive.

1658
01:08:54,984 --> 01:08:56,619
They're moving decisively.

1659
01:08:59,322 --> 01:09:00,757
(And another person heads
toward the men's lodging.)

1660
01:09:00,757 --> 01:09:01,858
Is it there?

1661
01:09:01,858 --> 01:09:02,759
Who is it?

1662
01:09:02,759 --> 01:09:03,693
Who else is going there?

1663
01:09:04,827 --> 01:09:06,029
Tae In.

1664
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:09,332
Did she go to Hyun Jun again?
Who knows?

1665
01:09:13,803 --> 01:09:15,238
Is Se Hoon here?

1666
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:17,340
What?

1667
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:18,708
She went to Se Hoon.

1668
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:20,109
All of a sudden?

1669
01:09:21,477 --> 01:09:22,712
Did you shower?

1670
01:09:22,712 --> 01:09:23,746
Really?

1671
01:09:24,314 --> 01:09:27,150
Can I come in? Can we talk here?

1672
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:28,751
You can come in.

1673
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:29,419
(Next episode)

1674
01:09:29,419 --> 01:09:30,753
It looks dewy.

1675
01:09:30,753 --> 01:09:33,022
Don't people tell you you're cute?

1676
01:09:33,022 --> 01:09:34,357
My goodness.

1677
01:09:34,357 --> 01:09:35,925
I like sexy people.

1678
01:09:35,925 --> 01:09:37,894
I want to have kids.

1679
01:09:37,894 --> 01:09:40,430
The women are really proactive.

1680
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:42,031
Right, introducing themselves.

1681
01:09:42,031 --> 01:09:43,466
My son is...

1682
01:09:43,466 --> 01:09:44,968
(Age revealed)

1683
01:09:44,968 --> 01:09:46,202
This is driving me crazy.

1684
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:47,804
As for his job...

1685
01:09:47,804 --> 01:09:49,806
He runs a small company.

1686
01:09:51,908 --> 01:09:53,743
I told you he was something else.

1687
01:09:53,743 --> 01:09:55,345
Mom, this is getting weird.

1688
01:09:55,345 --> 01:09:56,246
(Breaking down in tears
at the thought of sending her son off)

1689
01:09:56,246 --> 01:09:57,814
Would you be okay
with him getting married?

1690
01:09:58,615 --> 01:10:00,516
Now, the mothers are choosing.

1691
01:10:00,516 --> 01:10:02,151
This is so fun.

1692
01:10:02,151 --> 01:10:03,553
I do like
licensed professional occupations.

1693
01:10:03,553 --> 01:10:05,688
You really can't ignore someone's job.

1694
01:10:06,022 --> 01:10:07,423
(Who will the mothers choose?)

1695
01:10:07,423 --> 01:10:10,226
My gosh. I told you.

1696
01:10:11,142 --> 01:10:13,142
Dramaday.me
