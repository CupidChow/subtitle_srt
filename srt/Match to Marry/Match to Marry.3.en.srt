1
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,137
(Morning of Day 3)

2
00:00:55,872 --> 00:00:58,675
(A blaring alarm)

3
00:00:58,675 --> 00:00:59,609
(Seung Hak is dead asleep.)

4
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,278
(Only his mother wakes up.)

5
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:03,980
Mothers always...

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,116
wake up early.

7
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,587
(Eun Na Rae is dead asleep.
Working out)

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,356
(Meanwhile, Hyun Jun and his mother
head to the lounge.)

9
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:14,124
The lounge.

10
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,393
There.

11
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:18,995
This is it.

12
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,397
- Look.
- You can ride this in the lounge?

13
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,833
(What's that stored in a tight space?)

14
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,903
(Ta-da)

15
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:30,273
This is nice and convenient.

16
00:01:30,273 --> 00:01:31,574
I'm already sweating.

17
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,377
- Right? This is better.
- Yeah.

18
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,180
That's good.

19
00:01:38,148 --> 00:01:39,649
Fasted cardio is good.

20
00:01:40,383 --> 00:01:43,420
(Everyone starts the day their own way
at the camp.)

21
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,689
Today's the day we get to choose, right?

22
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,891
(Today is the day
of the women's self-introduction.)

23
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:48,892
I can't decide.

24
00:01:49,826 --> 00:01:53,663
Today's finally the day
of the women's self-introduction.

25
00:01:54,164 --> 00:01:56,966
I'm really curious what they do.

26
00:01:57,734 --> 00:02:00,270
You get to choose again today,
so you have no worries, don't you?

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,239
(Sulking)

28
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:05,475
- She's cute.
- Totally.

29
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,811
(Relaxed)

30
00:02:07,811 --> 00:02:09,546
Pick whoever you think is best, Mom.

31
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,215
Okay. Let's trust each other.

32
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:18,188
(Moms and daughters prepare their intros.
Drinking a calming pill)

33
00:02:18,188 --> 00:02:19,556
- I feel kind of weird today.
- What?

34
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,790
I had a strange dream.

35
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,126
That's not good.

36
00:02:23,927 --> 00:02:24,828
I'm nervous.

37
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:26,429
I added this line too.

38
00:02:26,429 --> 00:02:28,164
"A new jump
with the neighborhood aunties..."

39
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:30,633
No, take that out.
What are you talking about?

40
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:32,102
- It's funny.
- It's not funny.

41
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:35,071
Hello.

42
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:37,540
Good morning.

43
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,110
You're dressed cute and bright today.
You and your mother are matching outfits.

44
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,311
It's a "young-40s" style.

45
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:43,146
(Successfully made her laugh)

46
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:44,080
"Young-40s" style.

47
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:45,648
(Soon after, Se Hoon enters.)

48
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:46,649
Hello.

49
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,653
Hello.

50
00:02:50,653 --> 00:02:52,589
- Hi.
- Hello.

51
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:53,389
Hello.

52
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:56,426
Have you eaten?

53
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,293
Yes.

54
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,995
The lunchbox.

55
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:00,497
The lunchbox was good. Did you finish it?

56
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:01,731
No, maybe three bites?

57
00:03:01,731 --> 00:03:02,565
Really?

58
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:06,035
This is a lot of pressure.

59
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,173
The women will be introduced today.

60
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:13,510
We'll start with Kim Tae In.

61
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,611
Finally.

62
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,412
Tae In.

63
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:16,379
Starting with Tae In.

64
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:18,748
Okay.

65
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,054
Hello, I'm Tae In's mother, Kim Young Ja.

66
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:29,959
Tae In was born in 1993
and is 33 this year.

67
00:03:32,228 --> 00:03:33,196
And she is...

68
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,598
a hair designer.

69
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,135
A hair designer.

70
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,538
That explains it.

71
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,876
There's a salon called "C" in Gangnam.

72
00:03:47,377 --> 00:03:48,711
She works there as the deputy director.

73
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,748
Ever since Tae In was young,

74
00:03:51,748 --> 00:03:54,384
she loved dressing up
and showed interest in it,

75
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,419
so I recommended she go into beauty.

76
00:03:57,287 --> 00:04:00,423
She started early
and established herself quickly.

77
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:02,392
(Soccer player Lee Kang In)

78
00:04:02,392 --> 00:04:04,260
(Tae In has also worked
as a hair designer for celebrities.)

79
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,063
(Actress Han So Hee)

80
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:08,998
Tae In's number-one ideal type...

81
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,067
is someone with straight, even teeth.

82
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:14,337
She likes a "monkey-face" type
with a pretty smile.

83
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,607
In terms of ability,
she says she'd like someone who earns...

84
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:22,011
at least twice her salary.

85
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:23,279
Twice her salary.

86
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,248
What are you going to do?

87
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:26,883
Well,

88
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,218
I guess I'll have to buy a lottery ticket.

89
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,455
As a potential son-in-law,
even if he doesn't earn a lot,

90
00:04:32,455 --> 00:04:34,491
I'd prefer someone with a stable job,

91
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,993
like a civil servant or an office worker.

92
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,863
And as for what matters most in a partner,

93
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,665
I believe it's having a heart
that loves Tae In, cherishes her,

94
00:04:42,665 --> 00:04:44,834
and takes good care of her.

95
00:04:44,834 --> 00:04:46,569
Thank you for listening.

96
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:53,910
Please ask your questions.

97
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:57,881
Please ask your questions.

98
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,748
(Cut off)

99
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:00,350
She's telling them to hurry up and ask.

100
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,286
- She's not even looking at us.
- Look at that.

101
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,555
(Very clear what her goal is)

102
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,090
She's completely turned away.

103
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,858
We should be looking over there.

104
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,294
(Let's get the questions started.)

105
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:12,362
(Shoots hand up)

106
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,196
Yes?

107
00:05:13,797 --> 00:05:15,899
Do I look better with my hair down,

108
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,700
or hair up like this?

109
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,170
That really comes down
to personal preference.

110
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,771
Se Hoon, I think you look
a bit cooler with it up.

111
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:24,007
With it up?
Does my hair look okay right now, then?

112
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,408
You look so handsome, I love it.

113
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:27,777
What?

114
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,813
Seriously? What are they doing?

115
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:30,947
My goodness.

116
00:05:30,947 --> 00:05:32,649
(Shoots hand up)

117
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:35,919
When you say "twice your salary,"

118
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,787
we need to calculate.

119
00:05:37,787 --> 00:05:39,756
What should we base that on?

120
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:42,425
It's not just that I do hair.

121
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,828
I also do advertising for hair products,

122
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:46,529
and...

123
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,298
I do hands-on training on cuts and perms,

124
00:05:48,298 --> 00:05:50,467
so I travel to the provinces.

125
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,535
I stay pretty busy with work.

126
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:53,636
I see.

127
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,272
Sounds like her income
must be pretty high.

128
00:05:58,475 --> 00:06:02,212
Then it could be tough.

129
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,250
Do you often work weekends?

130
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,952
Yes, since I'm a hair designer,

131
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,454
I work almost every weekend.

132
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,590
So my days off are on weekdays.

133
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,625
Which days are your fixed days off?

134
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,496
- Monday and Tuesday.
- Monday and Tuesday.

135
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:23,733
Then on your days off,
how do you spend your free time?

136
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,035
I usually go out and eat something good.

137
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,171
You probably head in pretty early.

138
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,373
What time do you leave for work?

139
00:06:30,373 --> 00:06:32,575
The questions keep coming.

140
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:35,678
I usually head out around nine
to get ready.

141
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,047
Poor Hyun Jun.

142
00:06:38,047 --> 00:06:40,083
It feels like he's completely
shutting him out.

143
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:41,885
But he's sitting right next to her.

144
00:06:41,885 --> 00:06:44,621
He's totally losing in terms of momentum.

145
00:06:44,621 --> 00:06:47,190
It's like he's saying, "She's mine."

146
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:50,794
I'm curious.

147
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:53,463
You said you like a monkey-face type.

148
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:57,066
What exactly do you mean by "monkey-face?"

149
00:06:57,066 --> 00:06:58,635
What kind of monkey are you talking about?

150
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:01,104
Japan...

151
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,005
or Thailand?

152
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,807
- Don't ask that.
- Yeah.

153
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:07,911
If he's going to ask that,
it's better not to ask at all.

154
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:10,880
I think he wanted to ask something,

155
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,382
- but the others had already asked them.
- Yeah, she already answered everything.

156
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,217
- But he want to say something too.
- Right.

157
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:16,986
So "monkey-face"
just popped into his head.

158
00:07:16,986 --> 00:07:19,589
That's when you should probably hold back.

159
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:20,557
Poor him.

160
00:07:21,791 --> 00:07:23,059
(Second up is Kim Myo Jin and her mother.)

161
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:23,927
Myo Jin.

162
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,330
I'm Kim Myo Jin's mother.

163
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,568
We live in Gangdong-gu, Seoul.

164
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:37,674
Myo Jin was born in 1995,
the Year of the Pig,

165
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:38,975
so she's 31 now.

166
00:07:39,843 --> 00:07:40,910
Same age.

167
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:46,516
She majored in Chemical and Biological
Engineering at Sogang University,

168
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:49,252
and thankfully, before graduating,

169
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:53,990
she was accepted into the IR department
at pharmaceutical company "H,"

170
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:56,159
where she worked for about six years.

171
00:07:56,993 --> 00:08:00,830
Then last year,
she moved to a foreign company,

172
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:03,299
and she's working diligently there.

173
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:06,336
She must've been an excellent student.

174
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:09,272
As for her strengths,

175
00:08:09,272 --> 00:08:11,741
as you can see, doesn't she take after me?

176
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,675
She does.

177
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:16,179
She's very pretty.

178
00:08:17,847 --> 00:08:18,882
Thank you.

179
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:23,486
Looks, career, personality.
She's well-rounded in every way.

180
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:26,055
You could call her a well-rounded spouse.

181
00:08:26,055 --> 00:08:26,956
Well-rounded.

182
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:32,762
She seems to prefer
someone older rather than younger.

183
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,064
And as a partner,

184
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:38,401
she seems to like
a serious yet gentle vibe,

185
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:43,106
like Takeshi Kaneshiro or Keanu Reeves.

186
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,707
Sounds like she cares about looks.

187
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:46,443
I didn't think she did,

188
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,378
but hearing about the actors,
maybe she does.

189
00:08:49,012 --> 00:08:50,980
Which part of Gangdong-gu do you live in?

190
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,416
I live in Cheonho right now.

191
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:54,717
That's close.

192
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:56,119
Same.

193
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:57,320
Exactly.

194
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,588
It's day three now, right?

195
00:08:58,588 --> 00:09:00,957
Is there someone you're interested in?

196
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:02,258
There is.

197
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,693
How many?

198
00:09:03,693 --> 00:09:05,361
There's three.

199
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:06,162
You're keeping your options open.

200
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:08,031
Yes, I'm keeping an open mind.

201
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:08,998
So please come and talk to me.

202
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,267
Thank you.

203
00:09:13,736 --> 00:09:16,406
We live in the same neighborhood.

204
00:09:16,406 --> 00:09:18,074
"Same neighborhood."

205
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:20,410
Is this neighborhood flirting?

206
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,713
But, ma'am,
she says she doesn't like younger men.

207
00:09:23,713 --> 00:09:26,950
A two-year gap
doesn't really count as younger.

208
00:09:27,584 --> 00:09:28,818
Looks like it's Eun Na Rae's turn.

209
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,786
Yeah, next up.

210
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:30,687
She must be nervous.

211
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,756
Nice to meet you.

212
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,393
I'm so excited.

213
00:09:37,393 --> 00:09:39,629
My gosh.

214
00:09:41,264 --> 00:09:43,666
I'm Cho Eun Na Rae's mother.

215
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,534
Yes.

216
00:09:44,534 --> 00:09:47,904
To be honest,
I feel a little uncomfortable being here.

217
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,706
- Why?
- Why?

218
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,178
My daughter...

219
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,915
was born in 1988.

220
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:00,884
She's 38 years old.

221
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:02,986
She's 38 years old.

222
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,888
But she looks so young.

223
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,794
- I see.
- Born in 1988.

224
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:13,263
That's a seven-year difference
with Han Gyeol.

225
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:15,498
She's 38 years old.

226
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:16,933
(Eun Na Rae is 7 years older
than Han Gyeol.)

227
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,068
Because she's a bit older.

228
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:23,706
Honestly, we came here with hope at first,

229
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,542
but my daughter is a bit...

230
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,077
Everyone else here is so young.

231
00:10:27,977 --> 00:10:30,080
As you can see,

232
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,849
my daughter is very bright
and very straightforward.

233
00:10:33,249 --> 00:10:35,452
She has a good personality.

234
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,454
Not only does she have a good personality,

235
00:10:37,454 --> 00:10:39,189
but as you can see,

236
00:10:39,189 --> 00:10:42,058
she also has good looks.

237
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,394
She has a beautiful head shape.

238
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,596
She has a beautiful head shape.

239
00:10:48,331 --> 00:10:49,165
(Her mother's over-the-top bragging)

240
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:50,333
She's so...

241
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,568
cute.

242
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,637
Take a look at my head shape.

243
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:57,273
Show them. Tilt your head like this.

244
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,042
Head shape.

245
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:00,143
Head-shape flirting.

246
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:05,348
(Silly laugh)

247
00:11:05,348 --> 00:11:06,850
And her forehead too.

248
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:08,785
I have a nice forehead myself.

249
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:09,986
And she really takes after me
with that pretty forehead.

250
00:11:09,986 --> 00:11:12,188
Her mother is just so bright and cheerful.

251
00:11:12,188 --> 00:11:13,490
Exactly.

252
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,791
So cute.

253
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:17,193
She has the looks, of course,

254
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:20,497
and her body proportions are amazing too.

255
00:11:20,497 --> 00:11:22,632
Her body proportions are amazing too.

256
00:11:22,632 --> 00:11:23,767
(My goodness)

257
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,904
(Overwhelmed by the bold bragging)

258
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:31,074
As a woman myself,
I just think she's so beautiful.

259
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:33,343
She's pretty from this angle
and pretty from that angle too.

260
00:11:33,343 --> 00:11:35,612
(Bragging wrapped up)

261
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:39,916
(This is dizzying.)

262
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:43,686
She has the looks,

263
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,321
but what's even better...

264
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:47,524
is that she's a brainy beauty.

265
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:48,558
A brainy beauty.

266
00:11:48,558 --> 00:11:49,392
A brainy beauty.

267
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:52,295
A brainy beauty.

268
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,865
She went to Busan Foreign Language
High School,

269
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:57,600
then Sungkyunkwan University.

270
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,069
- She's your senior.
- Looks like it.

271
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,171
They're alumni, then.

272
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,907
Right, she and Han Gyeol are alumni.

273
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:08,478
Recently, it seems she felt like
she wanted to redesign her life.

274
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,713
She decided to study something new.

275
00:12:11,381 --> 00:12:12,449
And then,

276
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,451
she got accepted...

277
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:18,021
into Yonsei University's psychology
department, which only admits one student.

278
00:12:18,021 --> 00:12:19,889
I was honestly shocked.

279
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:21,791
I wasn't expecting it.

280
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:24,828
She completed her master's degree this year
in just four semesters.

281
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,596
She's really studied for a long time.

282
00:12:27,063 --> 00:12:28,631
Now you're curious about her job, right?

283
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,466
Yes.

284
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:31,701
My daughter's career began
when she was young,

285
00:12:32,235 --> 00:12:33,303
with LoL.

286
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:37,474
You know esports,
the big competitive gaming, right?

287
00:12:37,474 --> 00:12:39,275
She worked as an esports announcer,

288
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:42,445
and even ranked number one
in real-time searches.

289
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,714
So she was the announcer.

290
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:49,219
After that, she worked
as an announcer at Gwangju Broadcasting,

291
00:12:49,219 --> 00:12:52,789
and now she's freelancing,

292
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:54,924
working hard wherever opportunities come.

293
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:56,626
Commentary?

294
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:58,361
Yeah, she seems to be an announcer.

295
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,397
As for her spouse,

296
00:13:01,664 --> 00:13:04,367
I personally hope for someone...

297
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,170
with solid financial stability
and a steady life.

298
00:13:07,437 --> 00:13:10,874
As a parent,
I just wanted to share my honest wish.

299
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,977
If you are capable
and can take good care of my daughter,

300
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,112
we would be grateful if you chose her.

301
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,982
(Bow 1)

302
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:20,183
(Bow 2)

303
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:21,017
(Bow 3)

304
00:13:21,017 --> 00:13:22,519
We'll take questions now.

305
00:13:23,286 --> 00:13:27,157
This may be a slightly
uncomfortable question,

306
00:13:27,857 --> 00:13:31,795
but have there ever been times in the past
when you almost got married?

307
00:13:32,662 --> 00:13:34,330
No, there haven't.

308
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,399
- Not even once?
- No.

309
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,135
I've never introduced a boyfriend...

310
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:40,370
- Never.
- to my mother.

311
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,405
- Not even once?
- No, never.

312
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:45,675
When I was younger,
I didn't really think much about marriage.

313
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:47,477
I wasn't against it,

314
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:50,146
but my work always came first.

315
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:53,116
But now, I want to move forward sooner.

316
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:55,018
She wants to have two children.

317
00:13:55,018 --> 00:13:56,486
So in order to have children,

318
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:58,455
I think she decided on marriage.

319
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:01,124
That's why she mentioned early on...

320
00:14:01,124 --> 00:14:02,959
that she wanted to have kids sooner.

321
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:03,827
That's right.

322
00:14:03,827 --> 00:14:06,362
- Because of her age.
- Because of her age.

323
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:11,000
If you do have a baby,
how do you plan to handle things?

324
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:14,170
I don't want to focus solely on childcare.

325
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,004
You want to keep working?

326
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:15,839
Yes.

327
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:21,878
Do you have any other career goals
you want to pursue?

328
00:14:21,878 --> 00:14:24,080
Right now, while working in broadcasting,

329
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,951
I'm also doing counseling training
for college students.

330
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:33,556
Looking ten years ahead,
I imagine opening a center...

331
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:36,025
or something like that.

332
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:37,660
I'm picturing the distant future.

333
00:14:38,762 --> 00:14:39,729
Understood.

334
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:42,031
I think it's over.

335
00:14:42,031 --> 00:14:43,700
Thank you.

336
00:14:45,935 --> 00:14:49,372
(Squeezes her eyes shut)

337
00:14:50,206 --> 00:14:51,641
(Tap)

338
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,844
Hello, I'm Kim Jin Joo's mother.

339
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,548
I'm so nervous...

340
00:14:58,548 --> 00:15:01,017
that I don't think I can look this way
while speaking.

341
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:03,153
I'll look straight ahead as I talk.

342
00:15:04,187 --> 00:15:09,159
My daughter was born in 1997
and is 29 this year.

343
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,261
- She's young.
- 1997.

344
00:15:11,261 --> 00:15:14,664
My daughter currently lives in Pyeongtaek,
Gyeonggi Province,

345
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,734
and lives independently
near her workplace.

346
00:15:17,734 --> 00:15:21,337
She works in HR and general affairs
on a project management team.

347
00:15:22,238 --> 00:15:26,776
(She works in Project HR management
at a construction company.)

348
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:29,746
Last year, she even received
an excellence award at work...

349
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,448
for her dedication.

350
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:37,854
She saves 70 percent of her salary
to prepare for marriage.

351
00:15:39,489 --> 00:15:43,593
Jin Joo's strengths and weaknesses
are the same.

352
00:15:43,593 --> 00:15:48,098
She's very clear about what she likes and
dislikes, what's right and what's wrong.

353
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:51,301
This is something I often say to Jin Joo.

354
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:54,237
"Don't do that."
But she hates hearing this.

355
00:15:54,838 --> 00:15:56,439
My daughter's ideal type...

356
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,342
is someone who works hard at their job,

357
00:15:59,342 --> 00:16:01,177
takes good care of themselves,

358
00:16:01,177 --> 00:16:04,314
and is fit and dependable.

359
00:16:04,314 --> 00:16:08,585
She says she can recognize
the right person at first glance.

360
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:11,387
That's why I came here.

361
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:16,226
Not to judge by first impressions,
but because we get 5 days to see someone.

362
00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:19,195
The man my daughter recognizes
at first glance,

363
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,064
and the man I hope for her to meet.

364
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,301
I truly hope she can meet that person
and leave with him.

365
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,603
I'm embarrassed.

366
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,039
But she was doing great.

367
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,474
She did great.

368
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:34,444
She's cute.

369
00:16:35,145 --> 00:16:38,548
I support her in having
a beautiful relationship and marriage.

370
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:39,449
Are you crying?

371
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,817
No, I'm not crying. I'm just shaking.

372
00:16:40,817 --> 00:16:41,851
You did great.

373
00:16:41,851 --> 00:16:43,820
(Hug)

374
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,988
That must've been hard.

375
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:47,791
How do you feel
about long-distance relationships?

376
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:49,726
I actually prefer long distance.

377
00:16:49,726 --> 00:16:52,095
How many times a week do you like to meet?

378
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:56,132
On weekdays, work keeps me busy,

379
00:16:56,132 --> 00:16:58,134
and I also work out after work,

380
00:16:58,134 --> 00:16:59,869
so I prefer meeting only on weekends.

381
00:17:01,137 --> 00:17:03,273
If you suddenly miss
your boyfriend during the week,

382
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:05,842
would you meet spontaneously?

383
00:17:05,842 --> 00:17:07,644
If someone comes to see me like that,
I start liking him more.

384
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:10,847
Is that like saying,
"Come to meet me like that?"

385
00:17:10,847 --> 00:17:13,083
Yeah, that's what she's saying.

386
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:16,386
Jin Joo can drive to meet him.
She has a car.

387
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:17,487
What are you talking about, Mom?

388
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,624
What do you mean? He should come.

389
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:24,194
"He should come?"

390
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:28,098
If you do get married,

391
00:17:28,098 --> 00:17:30,033
where would you like to live?

392
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:31,267
I think I'd probably still want to live...

393
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:33,870
near my workplace,
and maybe meet only on weekends.

394
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:34,704
A weekend couple.

395
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,507
A weekend couple.

396
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:40,110
That probably made the men
less interested in her.

397
00:17:41,244 --> 00:17:43,213
Why? You should live together.

398
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:46,583
A weekend couple.

399
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,051
I think that might actually be better.

400
00:17:48,051 --> 00:17:49,819
- No.
- Meeting only on weekends.

401
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:51,387
No, I think once you're married,

402
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:53,723
you should live together full-time.

403
00:17:54,858 --> 00:17:56,993
Ma'am, you're very youthful and girlish,

404
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,663
but Jin Joo has so much drive and energy.

405
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:03,833
I'm curious where that gap comes from.

406
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,301
I'm curious.

407
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,403
One son, three daughters.

408
00:18:07,403 --> 00:18:08,371
I'm the eldest daughter.

409
00:18:08,371 --> 00:18:10,473
So my mother always told me,

410
00:18:10,473 --> 00:18:11,941
"Endure it. Don't do that."

411
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:15,011
"Wait. Give in."
I heard that a lot growing up.

412
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,414
So when I had a child
and started raising one,

413
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:19,549
I taught them, "If there was something
you couldn't say, go say it."

414
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:20,917
Yes, that's how I was taught.

415
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,086
- "Don't hold it in."
- "Don't hold it in."

416
00:18:23,086 --> 00:18:24,888
Because there was so much I wanted to say.

417
00:18:24,888 --> 00:18:27,891
I have three younger siblings,
and my parents both worked, that's why.

418
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:30,693
So I raised my two children
the opposite way.

419
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,095
But now, I regret it a little.

420
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:37,934
She tells me everything she wants to say.

421
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:40,570
All night long, right into my ear.

422
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,305
(All night long,
whispering into Mom's ear)

423
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:43,640
(Mom...)

424
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,842
(His ear is strangely ticklish.)

425
00:18:45,842 --> 00:18:47,544
Looks like we're the last ones.

426
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,681
Hello, I'm Kim Hyun Jin's mother.

427
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:56,753
Among the women here,

428
00:18:56,753 --> 00:18:58,555
Hyun Jin seems to be the youngest.

429
00:18:59,022 --> 00:19:00,690
- She's even younger?
- She was born in 1998.

430
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:04,194
She's currently 28 years old.

431
00:19:04,794 --> 00:19:08,064
She majored in vocal music
at Chung-Ang University.

432
00:19:10,433 --> 00:19:12,235
As for what she does now,

433
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:16,372
she teaches piano
and gives private vocal lessons.

434
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:19,342
She juggles quite a few different jobs.

435
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:27,150
(Hyun Jin pursued the path
of a vocalist since childhood.)

436
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,451
She really gives off that artsy vibe.

437
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,456
(Stepping down
from the spotlight on stage,)

438
00:19:33,656 --> 00:19:36,826
(Hyun Jin is now a music teacher.)

439
00:19:36,826 --> 00:19:40,330
Actually, Hyun Jin is the third daughter.

440
00:19:41,464 --> 00:19:43,933
You know how they say the third daughter
of a family with many daughters...

441
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,869
is married off without anyone
even seeing her face, right?

442
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:49,906
She has one sister seven years older
and another sister six years older.

443
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:53,810
The oldest sister majored in violin,

444
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,013
the second majored in fine arts,

445
00:19:57,013 --> 00:19:59,115
and Hyun Jin majored in vocal music.

446
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,784
Somehow, all of them ended up doing arts.

447
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,953
- An arts family.
- That's no joke.

448
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,655
It must have been so hard
to support them all.

449
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,056
It must have cost a lot.

450
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,128
As for the kind of partner
my daughter hopes to marry,

451
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,366
rather than looks or height,

452
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:18,001
since she's thinking seriously
about marriage,

453
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:21,604
she hopes the person has enough ability...

454
00:20:21,604 --> 00:20:24,207
to live without financial strain.

455
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:29,112
Hyun Jin wants to get married early.

456
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:31,881
If she does get married,

457
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:34,517
I'd like to help
take care of her children.

458
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:35,385
She says she'll help.

459
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:37,520
Her father is very caring...

460
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,056
and absolutely loves
looking after grandchildren.

461
00:20:40,056 --> 00:20:42,425
Hyun Jin wants to marry early,

462
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:46,196
and we also want to send her off
while she's still young and pretty,

463
00:20:46,196 --> 00:20:47,464
so that's why we came here.

464
00:20:48,631 --> 00:20:51,434
Could you tell us Hyun Jin's charms?

465
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:53,536
You should say
you're strong and confident.

466
00:20:53,536 --> 00:20:55,505
- That's hilarious.
- That's what she says.

467
00:20:55,505 --> 00:20:57,974
She's very strong-minded.

468
00:20:57,974 --> 00:21:00,643
For most things, she just, well...

469
00:21:00,643 --> 00:21:02,245
Yes.

470
00:21:02,245 --> 00:21:03,313
She doesn't back down.

471
00:21:03,713 --> 00:21:04,781
"She doesn't back down."

472
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:07,717
That's not quite the right way to put it.

473
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:08,952
She has a strong personality.

474
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:10,687
She can't really tolerate injustice.

475
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:12,388
Yes, that does sound like me.

476
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:16,126
What if your spouse sees injustice
and just puts up with it?

477
00:21:16,593 --> 00:21:19,062
I think I'd step in and speak up instead.

478
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:20,764
(Confirmed)

479
00:21:20,764 --> 00:21:21,698
Got it.

480
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:25,135
May I ask where you live in Gangdong-gu?

481
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:27,837
- We live in Godeok-dong, Gangdong-gu.
- Godeok-dong.

482
00:21:29,606 --> 00:21:32,909
Since you're teaching both vocal music
and piano,

483
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:34,544
are you working as a freelancer?

484
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,612
Yes, that's right.

485
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:39,048
Would it be okay
if your partner were also a freelancer?

486
00:21:39,516 --> 00:21:41,050
Min Cheol is asking a lot of questions.

487
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,552
He's asking quite a few questions.

488
00:21:42,852 --> 00:21:46,856
I don't think that would be a problem.

489
00:21:46,856 --> 00:21:49,426
I'm freelancing right now too,

490
00:21:49,426 --> 00:21:52,962
and I'm thinking
about opening an academy later on,

491
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:55,465
so that wouldn't be an issue for me.

492
00:21:56,266 --> 00:21:57,267
Thank you.

493
00:21:57,267 --> 00:21:58,368
Thank you.

494
00:21:58,368 --> 00:22:00,904
(Finally,
all the women's information is revealed.)

495
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:05,308
Now that their jobs and backgrounds
are out in the open,

496
00:22:05,308 --> 00:22:07,944
I feel conflicted. It's complicated.

497
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:10,380
See? Once everything's out there,

498
00:22:11,214 --> 00:22:12,348
it gets complicated.

499
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:15,218
As expected,

500
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:17,854
the women all have
such impressive credentials.

501
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:21,958
Today's date selections
will be made by the men's mothers.

502
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:24,828
The men's mothers are choosing this time.

503
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:29,499
Each mother should choose the woman
she wants her son to date...

504
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,135
and stand behind her.

505
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:35,905
(Standing behind a mother-daughter pair
completes the match.)

506
00:22:35,905 --> 00:22:36,806
The roles have reversed.

507
00:22:36,806 --> 00:22:38,108
The mothers' pick for her son.

508
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,509
The situation has flipped.

509
00:22:41,044 --> 00:22:43,413
What if no one chooses us?

510
00:22:44,314 --> 00:22:46,382
- No.
- Are you nervous?

511
00:22:46,382 --> 00:22:48,084
This is fun. My heart's racing.

512
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:49,486
This is exactly what I came here for.

513
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,455
We could end up with zero votes.

514
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,726
I'll just take charge myself, okay?

515
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:58,128
Yeah, I'll leave it up to you, Mom.

516
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,095
This is fun.

517
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,498
I'll keep it a secret from my son.

518
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,066
I trust you.

519
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:06,002
(Who will the men's mothers choose?)

520
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:07,771
It's time to decide.

521
00:23:10,406 --> 00:23:14,110
(First up, Hyun Jun's mother)

522
00:23:16,513 --> 00:23:20,383
After hearing all the introductions,
the woman I'm most drawn to...

523
00:23:20,383 --> 00:23:21,317
is Tae In.

524
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:23,753
I think...

525
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:25,522
maybe Jin Joo.

526
00:23:25,522 --> 00:23:26,389
His mother's pick?

527
00:23:26,389 --> 00:23:28,525
I think Mom just finds Jin Joo pretty.

528
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:30,894
Do you see the lady with the black outfit?

529
00:23:31,895 --> 00:23:32,996
(His mother chose Jin Joo
with the best first impression.)

530
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,597
- Who?
- At the very end.

531
00:23:35,732 --> 00:23:37,801
I think she'll prefer Jin Joo.

532
00:23:40,203 --> 00:23:43,440
But she also likes Tae In,
so I'm not sure.

533
00:23:45,742 --> 00:23:49,779
(Hyun Jun and his mother move.)

534
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:53,349
(They pass Hyun Jun's pick, Kim Tae In.)

535
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,651
Where are they going?

536
00:23:57,687 --> 00:23:59,189
They're moving so quietly.

537
00:24:00,156 --> 00:24:01,891
Trying not to make any noise from behind.

538
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,961
I hope I'm not the only one left.

539
00:24:04,961 --> 00:24:06,362
I think that'll be okay.

540
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,898
It'll be a chance
to really think about yourself.

541
00:24:08,898 --> 00:24:10,533
(Annoyed)

542
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:18,174
(Will Hyun Jun's mother
choose Jin Joo as expected?)

543
00:24:18,174 --> 00:24:19,075
(They passed Kim Jin Joo.)

544
00:24:19,075 --> 00:24:20,410
They passed her too?

545
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:21,745
Then...

546
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,982
(Hyun Jun's mother chooses Kim Hyun Jin.)

547
00:24:25,982 --> 00:24:28,818
She chose Hyun Jin.

548
00:24:29,152 --> 00:24:32,655
I'd like Hyun Jin and Hyun Jun
to get to know each other.

549
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,525
The fact that she's involved in music.

550
00:24:35,525 --> 00:24:36,993
That matches my personality.

551
00:24:37,894 --> 00:24:40,563
If it matches the mother's personality...

552
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,565
- But still, it's the mother's choice.
- It has to match the son's.

553
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,968
- It's the mother's choice.
- If it matches the mother's...

554
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:52,876
(Second up, Min Cheol's mother)

555
00:24:52,876 --> 00:24:56,579
After hearing the introduction,
I became even more curious,

556
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,081
and I grew more interested...

557
00:24:58,615 --> 00:24:59,482
in Kim Hyun Jin.

558
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:03,686
She's the youngest of three sisters.

559
00:25:03,686 --> 00:25:06,489
I thought she'd be more
like a classic eldest-daughter type.

560
00:25:06,489 --> 00:25:09,993
That made me even more curious
about her personality.

561
00:25:12,028 --> 00:25:17,233
(Will Min Cheol and his mother
be on the same page?)

562
00:25:18,835 --> 00:25:20,303
(Changes direction)

563
00:25:20,303 --> 00:25:23,773
It looks like she's heading
between Jin Joo and Hyun Jin.

564
00:25:23,773 --> 00:25:26,242
(Will she choose Jin Joo?)

565
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,478
We should go this way.

566
00:25:33,716 --> 00:25:34,584
That's unexpected.

567
00:25:40,323 --> 00:25:41,458
(Min Cheol's mother chooses Kim Hyun Jin.)

568
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:45,095
Min Cheol's mother also chose Hyun Jin.

569
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,566
As a marriage partner,
someone like Hyun Jin.

570
00:25:49,566 --> 00:25:51,134
Should I call it a kind of "mature charm?"

571
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:55,004
She's young, but she has deep thoughts.

572
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:58,508
And since she majored in vocal music,

573
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:00,243
she's someone connected to music.

574
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,679
That really appealed to me.

575
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:04,047
So she left a strong impression.

576
00:26:05,448 --> 00:26:08,985
(Kim Hyun Jin receives 2 votes in a row.)

577
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,653
This makes you silent.

578
00:26:12,522 --> 00:26:16,025
If someone chooses you,
I feel like I'd want to hug them...

579
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:20,930
for having that courage.

580
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:25,335
Still, I want to stick
with my original thoughts...

581
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,772
and go on one more date with Eun Na Rae.

582
00:26:28,772 --> 00:26:31,441
From what I can tell,

583
00:26:31,441 --> 00:26:33,209
she seems to have lived
a very admirable life,

584
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:34,511
and I find that incredibly charming.

585
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:37,614
After hearing the introduction,
I only grew more interested.

586
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:41,518
I'll be honest.
Her age does give me some pause,

587
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:46,222
because I was thinking more along
the lines of one to three years older.

588
00:26:46,222 --> 00:26:50,226
Can I get past that?

589
00:26:50,927 --> 00:26:54,397
I don't think it's a huge issue,
but it could be difficult for some people.

590
00:26:54,397 --> 00:26:59,669
I want to talk openly about that together
and see where it leads.

591
00:27:00,503 --> 00:27:02,105
With Eun Na Rae...

592
00:27:02,806 --> 00:27:06,209
She looked much younger than her age,

593
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,813
so I was surprised by the age gap.

594
00:27:09,813 --> 00:27:14,217
Should I, as the mother, bring this up?

595
00:27:14,217 --> 00:27:17,153
Or if my son says he's fine with it,
should I stay quiet?

596
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,788
Those are the kinds of worries I have.

597
00:27:18,788 --> 00:27:23,293
The mother and son's thoughts
clearly don't align.

598
00:27:23,293 --> 00:27:24,461
Exactly.

599
00:27:25,628 --> 00:27:27,497
A preview of mother-son conflict.

600
00:27:27,497 --> 00:27:28,565
That's true.

601
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:32,402
(Third up, Han Gyeol's mother)

602
00:27:32,836 --> 00:27:36,106
Who will Han Gyeol's mother choose?

603
00:27:38,541 --> 00:27:40,110
I had a brief moment of inner conflict.

604
00:27:42,145 --> 00:27:44,047
Han Gyeol is 31, right?

605
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:46,816
I don't know. I can't even remember.

606
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,954
I just hope
at least one person comes to you.

607
00:27:50,954 --> 00:27:51,788
Same.

608
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:55,692
It would be so embarrassing if no one did.

609
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:57,627
(Han Gyeol's mother chooses Kim Myo Jin.)

610
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:58,795
She chose Myo Jin.

611
00:27:58,795 --> 00:28:00,663
A stable office worker.

612
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:02,799
It's okay.

613
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,470
I'd like him to go on a date with Myo Jin.

614
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,807
I think they'd get along well.

615
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:14,043
And overall,
she seems like the best fit...

616
00:28:14,244 --> 00:28:18,214
for our family too.

617
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,786
- He's the same age as Myo Jin.
- Right.

618
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,189
(Glance)

619
00:28:28,691 --> 00:28:33,396
(Fourth up, Seung Hak's mother)

620
00:28:33,396 --> 00:28:35,732
My number-one choice is still...

621
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:36,666
Myo Jin.

622
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:40,470
I had a feeling
my mother would go with Myo Jin too.

623
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,704
Her place is close,

624
00:28:41,704 --> 00:28:45,208
and I figured she'd prefer
someone with a stable job.

625
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,844
Is it here?

626
00:28:50,346 --> 00:28:53,216
(Seung Hak's mother chooses Kim Hyun Jin.)

627
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,885
She chose Hyun Jin.

628
00:28:55,885 --> 00:28:59,055
Since my son works freelance,

629
00:28:59,055 --> 00:29:03,093
I thought it'd be fine
if his partner did too.

630
00:29:03,093 --> 00:29:05,128
And when Hyun Jin's mother said...

631
00:29:05,128 --> 00:29:09,899
she could help once they have a baby,
that really stood out to me.

632
00:29:10,567 --> 00:29:14,370
Myo Jin's profile just feels
a bit too strong.

633
00:29:14,737 --> 00:29:16,005
At least to me.

634
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:17,240
(Shy)

635
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:20,977
(The men's mothers' choices,
Hyun Jin receives 3 votes.)

636
00:29:20,977 --> 00:29:23,446
Hyun Jin is the most popular one so far.

637
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:26,249
She's already gotten three votes.

638
00:29:26,249 --> 00:29:27,016
Yes.

639
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:31,387
(Meanwhile, the women still at zero votes)

640
00:29:31,955 --> 00:29:35,692
(Last up, Se Hoon's mother)

641
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,193
As for my top pick,

642
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,131
they're still Tae In and Myo Jin.

643
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:44,400
I kept thinking...

644
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:47,237
who would actually match best
with my son, Se Hoon.

645
00:29:48,004 --> 00:29:53,243
Since Tae In works
in the service industry,

646
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:55,145
I thought she might click with him.

647
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,184
(Se Hoon and his mother move.)

648
00:30:01,684 --> 00:30:03,720
(Hurry)

649
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,489
Who did she choose?

650
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:16,733
(Who will Se Hoon's mother choose?)

651
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:26,843
Is it a dragonfly or a bee?

652
00:30:26,843 --> 00:30:27,710
A bee.

653
00:30:28,445 --> 00:30:29,479
Yes, it's a bee.

654
00:30:29,646 --> 00:30:31,714
That was unexpected.

655
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:33,783
She chose Eun Na Rae.

656
00:30:33,783 --> 00:30:36,286
She really must prefer older women.

657
00:30:36,286 --> 00:30:40,223
Looks like a big age gap
doesn't bother her much.

658
00:30:41,324 --> 00:30:44,194
Today, I'm choosing Eun Na Rae.

659
00:30:44,194 --> 00:30:46,296
She's bright, just like her mother,

660
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:49,199
and she has this energy
that lifts everyone around her.

661
00:30:49,199 --> 00:30:51,568
Once you meet and talk more,

662
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,871
you start to notice
new sides and new charms.

663
00:30:54,871 --> 00:30:57,774
That's why I chose Eun Na Rae.

664
00:30:59,576 --> 00:31:02,846
(The men's mothers
have made their choices.)

665
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:04,781
- We'll reveal the results now.
- I'm nervous.

666
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:07,550
Ladies and mothers,

667
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:11,187
on the count of three,
please turn around together.

668
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:12,822
Which way do we turn? Left?

669
00:31:12,822 --> 00:31:13,757
Left.

670
00:31:14,357 --> 00:31:16,593
One, two, three.

671
00:31:20,196 --> 00:31:20,964
Three.

672
00:31:22,665 --> 00:31:23,733
My goodness.

673
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:25,301
(Bow)

674
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,803
They're so happy.

675
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,071
Hello.

676
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:31,107
(3 mother-son pairs)

677
00:31:31,541 --> 00:31:33,076
It's still a competitive society.

678
00:31:34,377 --> 00:31:35,378
A competitive society.

679
00:31:35,378 --> 00:31:37,080
(We're here too.)

680
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,183
We could die today with no regrets.

681
00:31:40,183 --> 00:31:41,351
I could die today.

682
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:45,555
It felt good.

683
00:31:45,789 --> 00:31:47,891
Of course, it wasn't the men choosing,

684
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:50,560
it was the mothers,

685
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,362
but when three teams stood in front of me,

686
00:31:52,362 --> 00:31:54,230
it honestly felt really good.

687
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:57,700
And there was someone I wanted to talk to,

688
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,135
so I was happy.

689
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:01,671
- Of course, it feels good.
- Yeah, it does.

690
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:04,174
I'm truly grateful...

691
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:06,876
that the mothers saw her
in such a kind light.

692
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:10,580
Hyun Jun. I was happiest to see him.

693
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:12,649
Their names even match.
Hyun Jun and Hyun Jin.

694
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:15,385
Goodness.

695
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:17,287
Thank you.

696
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,189
Hello.

697
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:21,424
Hello.

698
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:24,160
- Thank you.
- Not at all.

699
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,762
Let's not turn yet. Let's turn later.

700
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:28,498
(Swish)

701
00:32:28,932 --> 00:32:30,133
- Really?
- Unbelievable.

702
00:32:31,801 --> 00:32:33,303
Hello.

703
00:32:33,303 --> 00:32:36,539
(Cho Eun Na Rae and Moon Se Hoon)

704
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:37,607
Thank you.

705
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:43,646
Thank you so much.

706
00:32:45,448 --> 00:32:46,716
Well...

707
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:51,321
(Kim Jin Joo got 0 votes.)

708
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:55,759
(Kim Tae In got 0 votes.)

709
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,460
- It happened exactly like we thought.
- Seriously.

710
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:01,231
Tae In and Jin Joo both got zero votes.

711
00:33:02,031 --> 00:33:04,501
For Jin Joo and Tae In,

712
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:07,537
the "double her salary"
and "weekend couple" thing...

713
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:11,341
seems to have really
turned the mothers off.

714
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:12,509
- Right.
- Yeah.

715
00:33:14,043 --> 00:33:15,779
Just like we thought.

716
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:17,881
My dream meant the right thing.

717
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:18,882
Your dream?

718
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,453
This is so brutal.

719
00:33:23,453 --> 00:33:24,287
It is.

720
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:27,924
I also wanted to get to know Hyun Jin,

721
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:28,858
but then,

722
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:31,161
it's funny how your feelings work.

723
00:33:31,161 --> 00:33:34,564
I caught myself wishing
at least one person would go to Tae In.

724
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:37,901
I mean, it just...

725
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:39,068
kept nagging at me.

726
00:33:41,171 --> 00:33:42,505
Thank you so much.

727
00:33:44,641 --> 00:33:46,810
I should've been watching Myo Jin,

728
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,946
but I kept getting distracted
by Eun Na Rae's expression.

729
00:33:51,214 --> 00:33:53,850
She looked so bright.

730
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:55,218
"What?"

731
00:33:55,218 --> 00:33:56,319
"She's that happy?"

732
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,689
That kept bothering me.

733
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,828
That kept bothering Han Gyeol. I see.

734
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:09,365
Is it weird
if I put on sunglasses right now?

735
00:34:09,365 --> 00:34:10,200
Yeah.

736
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:13,937
Jin Joo was on my mind.

737
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:17,340
She didn't show it,
but she looked a little hurt.

738
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:23,213
That wraps up the date matching
chosen by the men's mothers.

739
00:34:23,513 --> 00:34:24,681
- Unbelievable.
- Hey.

740
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:27,617
Thank you so much.

741
00:34:28,218 --> 00:34:29,185
Nice to meet you.

742
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:30,286
Just like she said, she hugged her.

743
00:34:31,254 --> 00:34:33,056
Thank you. Thank you so much.

744
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:34,891
Thank you for voting for my daughter.

745
00:34:34,891 --> 00:34:36,326
This is so brutal.

746
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,995
Thank you for voting for my daughter.

747
00:34:39,796 --> 00:34:40,663
Well...

748
00:34:41,731 --> 00:34:43,066
Marriage is reality, after all.

749
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:44,634
Yeah.

750
00:34:44,634 --> 00:34:46,269
I should've just complimented you.

751
00:34:46,269 --> 00:34:47,871
I kind of took a jab at you.

752
00:34:47,871 --> 00:34:51,107
But they have to like you anyway
for marriage to happen.

753
00:34:51,107 --> 00:34:52,575
- Right.
- Exactly.

754
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,311
Gosh.

755
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:56,112
Let's go.

756
00:34:56,112 --> 00:34:57,280
Shall we go first?

757
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,214
Let's go.

758
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:00,984
To keep a poker face,

759
00:35:00,984 --> 00:35:02,485
I think I need sunglasses.

760
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:04,888
I don't want my expression
to give me away.

761
00:35:08,658 --> 00:35:10,026
To hide my face,

762
00:35:10,026 --> 00:35:11,661
I'm glad I brought these.

763
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,030
I didn't let it show in my eyes.

764
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,233
- But I was sad.
- I wonder what my eyes looked like.

765
00:35:19,602 --> 00:35:20,937
Bye, everyone.

766
00:35:20,937 --> 00:35:22,138
So this can happen too.

767
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:23,506
It's fine.

768
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,809
(Laugh)

769
00:35:26,376 --> 00:35:27,877
They're so...

770
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:29,345
I couldn't see.

771
00:35:29,345 --> 00:35:31,314
Myo Jin, the lawyer came to you.

772
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:33,983
I kept...

773
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:36,519
My mom kept telling me not to expect
anything since I could get zero votes.

774
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:37,687
That's what we kept saying.

775
00:35:38,288 --> 00:35:41,424
I really thought Jin Joo
would get a lot of votes.

776
00:35:41,424 --> 00:35:43,059
- Why?
- No.

777
00:35:43,059 --> 00:35:46,429
It's not that I'm lacking.
Everyone else is just so impressive.

778
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:48,098
- No.
- No.

779
00:35:48,098 --> 00:35:49,666
I don't think that's it.

780
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:51,534
It really isn't.

781
00:35:51,534 --> 00:35:53,336
Hey, don't try to comfort us too much.

782
00:35:53,336 --> 00:35:55,138
We're not comforting you.

783
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:57,307
Really, this isn't comfort.

784
00:35:57,307 --> 00:36:00,376
That makes it feel even more like comfort.

785
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,145
I'm not going.

786
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:03,580
He's saying he's not going.

787
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:06,616
Hyun Jun was three-to-one
at the start too, right?

788
00:36:06,616 --> 00:36:08,084
It was three against one.

789
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,686
If it's three-to-one,
you can't say a word.

790
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:11,387
You can't say anything?

791
00:36:11,387 --> 00:36:13,790
Right.
You wouldn't be able to say anything.

792
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,760
If it's three of them, Seung Hak won't
be able to say a single word.

793
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:20,730
(Already clamming up)

794
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:22,599
When Hyun Jun stood there...

795
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:25,935
(Why again?)

796
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,470
Both of them?

797
00:36:28,304 --> 00:36:30,406
Hyun Jin said earlier
that she likes someone serious.

798
00:36:30,406 --> 00:36:33,042
- She said she likes someone calm, right?
- She did.

799
00:36:34,711 --> 00:36:36,146
(Meanwhile, silence fills
Tae In and her mother's room.)

800
00:36:36,146 --> 00:36:37,447
This is so upsetting.

801
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:41,484
They don't see you for who you are.

802
00:36:43,186 --> 00:36:44,587
The mothers just don't recognize me,
that's all.

803
00:36:44,587 --> 00:36:46,089
Yeah, they don't.

804
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:52,429
If I'm busy with work,

805
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:56,132
they might think I'd put my job
before their son.

806
00:36:56,132 --> 00:36:59,936
Maybe they worried I'd neglect the family.

807
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:02,806
I was honestly fine,

808
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,474
but my mom was really hurt.

809
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:08,545
When you actually get zero votes...

810
00:37:09,045 --> 00:37:10,380
Right, from a mother's perspective...

811
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:13,216
I had a dream.

812
00:37:13,216 --> 00:37:16,419
I think there were mandarin ducks
floating on the water.

813
00:37:16,419 --> 00:37:18,154
I had to catch it, so I tried,

814
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:19,889
but I missed it.

815
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:21,424
I told Tae In about that dream.

816
00:37:21,424 --> 00:37:25,228
I said, even if she doesn't get chosen,

817
00:37:25,228 --> 00:37:28,298
let's go to the kitchen
and grill some meat or something.

818
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,633
And Tae In agreed right away.

819
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:33,703
But when she actually got zero votes,

820
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:35,238
it did sting a little, honestly.

821
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,073
I was really down,

822
00:37:37,073 --> 00:37:39,375
and I tried not to look upset.

823
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,711
But you can't always control that.

824
00:37:42,712 --> 00:37:45,482
(She steps away, afraid her daughter
will notice her sadness.)

825
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:48,485
I can't stop thinking about the ones
who got zero votes.

826
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:50,286
(Hyun Jun can't stop thinking
about Tae In, who got 0 votes.)

827
00:37:50,286 --> 00:37:52,655
- But it's the mothers' choice anyway.
- I really can't watch this.

828
00:37:54,724 --> 00:37:56,292
The two men.

829
00:38:02,332 --> 00:38:03,399
(Se Hoon steps outside.)

830
00:38:03,399 --> 00:38:05,368
- Yes, he should go to her.
- Where's he going?

831
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:07,170
It looks like it's really weighing on him.

832
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,905
- I think I would've gone too.
- Right?

833
00:38:08,905 --> 00:38:10,473
Hyun Jun steps outside as well.

834
00:38:10,473 --> 00:38:11,741
Are they going together?

835
00:38:12,342 --> 00:38:13,443
Is she okay?

836
00:38:21,084 --> 00:38:22,285
What will they do?

837
00:38:22,285 --> 00:38:25,221
(Hyun Jun, Se Hoon)

838
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:30,660
(Knock, knock)

839
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,494
Yes?

840
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:36,966
(Se Hoon comes to Tae In.)

841
00:38:36,966 --> 00:38:38,101
It's Se Hoon.

842
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:39,102
Want to grab some coffee?

843
00:38:39,102 --> 00:38:40,336
- What?
- Do you want some coffee?

844
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:42,906
Should I make some and bring it to you?
I'll do it.

845
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:44,307
Does your mother drink coffee?

846
00:38:44,307 --> 00:38:46,576
She already had a cup.

847
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:47,510
Really?

848
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:48,745
Then, do you want some, Ms. Kim?

849
00:38:48,745 --> 00:38:49,579
"Ms. Kim?"

850
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:53,049
- She likes that.
- "Ms. Kim."

851
00:38:53,049 --> 00:38:54,651
Instant coffee or regular coffee?

852
00:38:54,651 --> 00:38:55,852
I'll have regular coffee.

853
00:38:55,852 --> 00:38:57,520
I'll make it and bring it. You can rest.

854
00:39:04,794 --> 00:39:06,062
I should check the mirror.

855
00:39:06,696 --> 00:39:08,131
She's bright again.

856
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,334
This is what you call fate.

857
00:39:11,334 --> 00:39:12,335
You think so?

858
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:13,470
The one who came first?

859
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:16,673
I mean,
both of them left at the same time,

860
00:39:16,673 --> 00:39:18,842
but Se Hoon got there first.

861
00:39:18,842 --> 00:39:19,709
Right.

862
00:39:19,709 --> 00:39:21,778
When you're at your lowest and saddest,

863
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,514
who reaches out first is the man.

864
00:39:24,514 --> 00:39:27,917
It's all about timing.
Love really is about timing.

865
00:39:28,618 --> 00:39:29,853
(The two men's crossed timing)

866
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:31,020
Look at that.

867
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,590
- This is so unfortunate.
- What do we do? This is really sad.

868
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,825
Poor him.

869
00:39:37,894 --> 00:39:42,732
(Tae In takes the coat she borrowed
from Se Hoon the previous day.)

870
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,467
It's a mess.

871
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:50,240
(Smile)

872
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:57,247
(Se Hoon makes coffee for Tae In.)

873
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,918
(He thoughtfully adds a little cold water
so it's not too hot.)

874
00:40:05,789 --> 00:40:08,458
(Barista Se Hoon comes back.)

875
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,729
(A smile sneaks out.)

876
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:14,297
Is this "The Fairy and the Woodcutter"
or something?

877
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:15,031
What?

878
00:40:15,031 --> 00:40:16,499
This feels like
"The Fairy and the Woodcutter."

879
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,734
This is your coat from yesterday.

880
00:40:17,734 --> 00:40:19,803
- It's okay.
- I brought it with me.

881
00:40:19,803 --> 00:40:21,004
Where's your mother?

882
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,605
I think she stepped out to talk.

883
00:40:22,605 --> 00:40:23,540
Really?

884
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:25,775
Thank you for this.

885
00:40:25,775 --> 00:40:26,976
Eat well.

886
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:28,978
Are you feeling okay?

887
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,515
Ms. Kim, get some rest.

888
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,750
Don't call me that.

889
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:35,685
You were born in 1993.

890
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:36,986
Yes, I was.

891
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:37,987
I'm older than you.

892
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:39,089
Get some rest.

893
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:40,190
Thanks. Enjoy your meal.

894
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:41,925
Yeah, I will.

895
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:52,202
(Tae In enters the living room
holding the coffee Se Hoon made.)

896
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:53,636
She's energized.

897
00:40:53,636 --> 00:40:56,106
Today's most popular star...

898
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:57,240
makes her entrance.

899
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,008
- She doesn't care.
- Of course, she's excited.

900
00:40:59,008 --> 00:41:02,178
"Whether you're a popular star or not,
I don't care at all."

901
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:04,547
- She was about to sleep 3 minutes ago.
- She feels relieved now.

902
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:07,817
Today's most popular star...

903
00:41:07,817 --> 00:41:08,918
makes her entrance.

904
00:41:08,918 --> 00:41:09,919
No.

905
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:11,488
It was the mothers' pick.

906
00:41:11,488 --> 00:41:13,156
Tae In's mother is shocked.

907
00:41:13,156 --> 00:41:14,224
(Grin)

908
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:17,827
(She takes a sip
of the coffee Se Hoon made.)

909
00:41:17,827 --> 00:41:18,728
Nice.

910
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,697
This coffee's good.

911
00:41:20,697 --> 00:41:21,865
She says it's good.

912
00:41:23,433 --> 00:41:26,035
When you think about it,
it's really touching.

913
00:41:26,035 --> 00:41:28,671
Before heading out on a date,

914
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:31,174
before meeting another woman,

915
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:33,209
the fact that he thought of me,

916
00:41:33,443 --> 00:41:38,782
and then acted on it.
That alone means a lot.

917
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,418
I think I felt something special.

918
00:41:41,418 --> 00:41:43,153
- That was such a good move.
- Totally.

919
00:41:43,153 --> 00:41:45,388
Right before going on a date,

920
00:41:45,388 --> 00:41:47,090
that gives you so much strength.

921
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,625
Exactly, it really does.

922
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,161
It says a lot,

923
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:53,329
because it basically says,
"This was my mom's choice."

924
00:41:53,329 --> 00:41:56,366
"But my heart is with you."

925
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:58,034
I think it conveyed that perfectly.

926
00:41:58,034 --> 00:42:01,137
From the woman's perspective,

927
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:03,506
doing something like this beforehand
takes away anxiety.

928
00:42:03,506 --> 00:42:07,043
"Nothing bad is going to happen
over this meal."

929
00:42:07,043 --> 00:42:10,113
It gives a sense of reassurance.

930
00:42:10,113 --> 00:42:11,915
That was a very thoughtful move.

931
00:42:13,349 --> 00:42:14,984
Hyun Jin must feel good.

932
00:42:14,984 --> 00:42:17,287
- What?
- Hyun Jin must feel really good.

933
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:19,355
Jin Joo got zero votes.

934
00:42:19,355 --> 00:42:22,025
The "weekend couple" caused all of this.

935
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,528
Hyun Jun's mother said I was her top pick,
but she changed her mind.

936
00:42:26,096 --> 00:42:27,297
- Who?
- Hyun Jun's mother.

937
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,165
She said I was her top pick,
but she switched.

938
00:42:29,165 --> 00:42:30,967
Hyun Jun's mother? You're right.

939
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:33,536
Did I mess up the introduction?

940
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,873
Mom, don't say that.
The explanation wasn't the problem.

941
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,708
You did great, Mom,
even though you were so nervous.

942
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:41,044
I thought I had to be honest about you...

943
00:42:41,044 --> 00:42:44,547
for the right person to like you
just the way you are.

944
00:42:44,914 --> 00:42:47,350
Well, everyone else
must've been honest too.

945
00:42:48,685 --> 00:42:50,186
Mom, are you embarrassed because of me?
I'm sorry.

946
00:42:50,186 --> 00:42:51,688
- No.
- Are you okay?

947
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:54,390
Just the fact that you had the courage
to come here...

948
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,526
Have you thought about this?

949
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:01,698
Maybe I showed my personality
too honestly.

950
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:03,700
"Should I just go home?"

951
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:05,568
"What..."

952
00:43:06,202 --> 00:43:07,737
"Where did it all start going wrong?"

953
00:43:08,404 --> 00:43:11,708
"Why didn't the mothers choose me?"

954
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,676
I started overthinking everything...

955
00:43:13,676 --> 00:43:15,378
being alone at the lodging today.

956
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:18,081
I feel kind of deflated.

957
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:21,084
I lost my confidence
because everyone is so impressive.

958
00:43:21,484 --> 00:43:22,852
I should've worked harder at life.

959
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,554
Honestly, everyone here
seems to have lived diligently.

960
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:26,489
You worked hard too.

961
00:43:26,489 --> 00:43:27,757
I mean, career-wise.

962
00:43:28,324 --> 00:43:30,960
I think at least one guy will come to me
today just because he felt sorry for me.

963
00:43:31,661 --> 00:43:34,264
When you say things like that,
it breaks Mom's heart.

964
00:43:34,264 --> 00:43:36,366
It really hurts.

965
00:43:42,138 --> 00:43:44,073
- Why are you about to cry?
- I'm not crying. What are you saying?

966
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:46,242
Mom, my makeup will smudge.
What are you saying? I'm not crying.

967
00:43:46,843 --> 00:43:48,578
- Don't come closer.
- I thought you were about to cry.

968
00:43:48,578 --> 00:43:49,446
You're too close.

969
00:43:50,513 --> 00:43:55,051
(The mother feels heartbroken
seeing her daughter so discouraged.)

970
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,587
She didn't get chosen today, and she said,

971
00:43:57,587 --> 00:44:01,658
"Mom, what do I do
about this personality of mine?"

972
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:03,860
But there is something I didn't mention.

973
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,596
Even when we clash, we make up quickly.

974
00:44:06,596 --> 00:44:07,630
And...

975
00:44:08,665 --> 00:44:10,700
once she decides,

976
00:44:11,801 --> 00:44:14,604
"This is my person," she never wavers.

977
00:44:14,604 --> 00:44:17,140
I think I wrote the description
too honestly and too bluntly.

978
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:19,776
Maybe...

979
00:44:21,911 --> 00:44:22,879
that was it.

980
00:44:24,114 --> 00:44:25,682
I should've written it better.

981
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:29,219
But right now, my heart feels lighter.

982
00:44:29,219 --> 00:44:31,588
After being this honest,

983
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:37,193
I believe there's someone
who'll accept cute Jin Joo just as she is,

984
00:44:37,193 --> 00:44:40,597
and I think Jin Joo will be just fine.

985
00:44:40,597 --> 00:44:42,365
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

986
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:44,701
I really shouldn't cry.

987
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:57,013
Se Hoon's here.

988
00:44:57,647 --> 00:44:58,782
Is Se Hoon here to pick someone up?

989
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:01,718
- You look great today too.
- Yeah.

990
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:04,187
I told him this morning again
that he's really handsome.

991
00:45:04,187 --> 00:45:05,155
Seriously.

992
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:07,023
Ms. Kim Tae In.

993
00:45:07,924 --> 00:45:08,925
Ms. Kim Tae In.

994
00:45:10,026 --> 00:45:10,894
Hyun Jin.

995
00:45:11,494 --> 00:45:13,163
Using honorifics feels so awkward.

996
00:45:13,163 --> 00:45:15,131
Why? You told me
to use honorifics yesterday.

997
00:45:15,131 --> 00:45:16,699
Did she say that yesterday?

998
00:45:17,434 --> 00:45:18,401
(The two of them grow shy.)

999
00:45:18,401 --> 00:45:20,437
I suddenly want to be the younger one.

1000
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:24,507
(Watching live is fun.)

1001
00:45:25,074 --> 00:45:26,242
(Eun Na Rae, Se Hoon's date, arrives.)

1002
00:45:26,242 --> 00:45:27,877
- She's here.
- She's here.

1003
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:30,747
Shall we go?

1004
00:45:31,815 --> 00:45:33,216
(Se Hoon leaves for his date.)

1005
00:45:33,216 --> 00:45:34,451
Everyone's watching.

1006
00:45:34,451 --> 00:45:35,819
Watching that live is the most fun.

1007
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,153
Can I speak casually?

1008
00:45:37,153 --> 00:45:38,121
Yeah.

1009
00:45:38,121 --> 00:45:39,889
(She takes a sip
of the coffee Se Hoon left behind.)

1010
00:45:39,889 --> 00:45:41,391
That's not just coffee.

1011
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:43,560
It's his heart.

1012
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:47,664
- She's drinking his heart.
- That's hilarious.

1013
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:49,599
"Don't forget me."

1014
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:51,468
A sip of his heart.

1015
00:45:51,468 --> 00:45:53,336
- "My heart is right here."
- Exactly.

1016
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:54,804
It's Hyun Jin.

1017
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:57,207
Are you here to pick up my son?

1018
00:45:57,207 --> 00:45:59,809
Yes, I'm here to pick up the sons.

1019
00:45:59,809 --> 00:46:01,010
Hello.

1020
00:46:01,544 --> 00:46:03,146
My knees hurt.

1021
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:04,214
My knee's not great.

1022
00:46:04,214 --> 00:46:05,381
(Grunting)

1023
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:07,817
My knee's really not great.

1024
00:46:07,817 --> 00:46:09,252
But I should go see them off.

1025
00:46:09,252 --> 00:46:10,920
We'll be back.

1026
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,589
Have fun.

1027
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:15,091
But it might be tough with three people.

1028
00:46:15,759 --> 00:46:17,293
I'll try anyway.

1029
00:46:17,293 --> 00:46:19,129
My son is calm, at least.

1030
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:19,863
Okay.

1031
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,598
Because she said earlier
that she liked calm people.

1032
00:46:21,598 --> 00:46:22,632
He doesn't talk much.

1033
00:46:23,933 --> 00:46:25,101
You're being too talkative.

1034
00:46:25,902 --> 00:46:27,103
"You're being too talkative."

1035
00:46:27,804 --> 00:46:29,172
We'll be back.

1036
00:46:29,172 --> 00:46:30,540
- Have a good time.
- Yes.

1037
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:32,976
Look how my son turned all red
because I said that.

1038
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:34,911
(Goodness)

1039
00:46:34,911 --> 00:46:35,745
Shall we go?

1040
00:46:36,446 --> 00:46:38,047
(Good luck, my son)

1041
00:46:38,648 --> 00:46:41,818
It's been a long time since I last rode
in a car driven by someone else.

1042
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:42,986
Really?

1043
00:46:43,219 --> 00:46:45,588
How does it feel,
having three people with you?

1044
00:46:46,256 --> 00:46:47,757
Could you share a quick thought?

1045
00:46:47,757 --> 00:46:49,859
Honestly, I'm just grateful.

1046
00:46:49,859 --> 00:46:51,060
- Just grateful.
- Seriously.

1047
00:46:52,095 --> 00:46:54,531
Out of the three,
is there anyone you're drawn to?

1048
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:55,398
I'm curious too.

1049
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:58,368
She's getting indigestion
before we even start eating.

1050
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:00,303
That's the goal.

1051
00:47:00,303 --> 00:47:03,072
Well, there is. That's why it feels good.

1052
00:47:04,441 --> 00:47:07,944
There's someone I wanted to talk to.

1053
00:47:13,416 --> 00:47:14,918
Let's go in now.

1054
00:47:15,385 --> 00:47:17,620
- Enjoy your meal.
- What should we do with this?

1055
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,855
Should I portion some out for you?

1056
00:47:18,855 --> 00:47:19,823
Put it here.

1057
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,060
But you shouldn't cut back
too much on carbs.

1058
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:25,228
On purpose...

1059
00:47:25,228 --> 00:47:26,863
Sorry.

1060
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:28,031
It's okay.

1061
00:47:28,398 --> 00:47:29,365
Hey, I'm not eating that.

1062
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:30,967
Don't lie.

1063
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:32,836
It's fine.

1064
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:34,204
I'm ambidextrous.

1065
00:47:34,838 --> 00:47:35,738
Right hand.

1066
00:47:35,738 --> 00:47:36,806
You are.

1067
00:47:36,806 --> 00:47:38,041
- You're good.
- You really use both hands.

1068
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:41,144
It's uncomfortable for me,
so please use your left.

1069
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:42,312
Why is it uncomfortable?

1070
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:43,379
Just eat however you like.

1071
00:47:48,218 --> 00:47:50,453
Is your injury healing well?

1072
00:47:51,221 --> 00:47:52,756
Well,

1073
00:47:52,756 --> 00:47:54,023
I think it's almost healed.

1074
00:47:54,023 --> 00:47:56,059
It's not bleeding,
and the skin's grown back.

1075
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:01,264
Min Cheol, you're barely eating.

1076
00:48:02,265 --> 00:48:04,033
- Different from yesterday, right?
- Yeah, totally.

1077
00:48:05,935 --> 00:48:07,837
I think you're more nervous than I am.

1078
00:48:08,238 --> 00:48:09,139
Was it that obvious?

1079
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:13,143
It feels like he's bothered.

1080
00:48:14,043 --> 00:48:15,678
I was bothered.

1081
00:48:15,678 --> 00:48:18,081
I wanted to talk about more things,

1082
00:48:18,081 --> 00:48:21,251
but since the three of us
had to share the conversation,

1083
00:48:22,218 --> 00:48:24,187
it didn't really feel satisfying.

1084
00:48:26,489 --> 00:48:28,391
You don't look
like you're in great shape today.

1085
00:48:28,391 --> 00:48:29,459
Really?

1086
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:30,794
Maybe because you didn't get much sleep.

1087
00:48:31,461 --> 00:48:33,396
Did I sleep badly?
Well, it was worse than yesterday.

1088
00:48:33,396 --> 00:48:34,164
Right.

1089
00:48:34,164 --> 00:48:36,466
Actually, my head kind of hurts today too.

1090
00:48:37,567 --> 00:48:40,069
I keep thinking about Tae In.

1091
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:44,174
I'm really worried about her
and want to go talk to her.

1092
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:45,608
That's how I feel.

1093
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:47,944
(A 3:1 date,
with everyone having different dreams)

1094
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:51,081
It's a three-to-one date
with everyone wanting something different.

1095
00:48:52,115 --> 00:48:54,217
Who thoughtfully ordered sushi like this?

1096
00:48:54,217 --> 00:48:56,820
- Thanks for the meal.
- Myo Jin and Han Gyeol.

1097
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,391
You eat it in this order or that order.

1098
00:49:01,391 --> 00:49:03,293
I'll just follow whatever you do, ma'am.

1099
00:49:05,361 --> 00:49:06,763
Myo Jin-sensei.

1100
00:49:07,297 --> 00:49:08,731
Myo Jin-sensei.

1101
00:49:09,265 --> 00:49:11,968
(Hesitates)

1102
00:49:11,968 --> 00:49:13,403
For a second...

1103
00:49:13,403 --> 00:49:17,440
I actually have a really close guy friend.

1104
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:19,809
And you really feel...

1105
00:49:19,809 --> 00:49:20,643
Like him?

1106
00:49:20,643 --> 00:49:25,315
- The vibe, even the face, is similar.
- A guy friend.

1107
00:49:25,615 --> 00:49:27,717
You just said "sensei," right?

1108
00:49:27,717 --> 00:49:29,052
Even the way you talk is similar.

1109
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:30,820
I got full-on goosebumps for a second.

1110
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:31,888
- Really?
- Yeah.

1111
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:34,390
Is that a good thing?
Or are you drawing a line?

1112
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:37,761
- That's not something you want to hear.
- She said "guy friend," right?

1113
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:39,095
Is it a good thing?
Or are you drawing a line?

1114
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:44,601
Are you saying,
"That's how I feel about you" or...

1115
00:49:47,036 --> 00:49:49,205
I'll think about it and tell you later.

1116
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:51,908
She's not saying it's not that.

1117
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:53,143
This is tricky.

1118
00:49:53,576 --> 00:49:56,513
They should just enjoy the meal
and head back soon.

1119
00:49:57,881 --> 00:50:02,085
He really resembles my best friend a lot.

1120
00:50:02,619 --> 00:50:04,988
We communicate really well,

1121
00:50:04,988 --> 00:50:09,259
but I found it hard
to feel romantic tension.

1122
00:50:09,759 --> 00:50:11,394
With Myo Jin,

1123
00:50:11,961 --> 00:50:14,497
I didn't really feel romantic attraction.

1124
00:50:14,497 --> 00:50:15,598
And since...

1125
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,537
I also kept thinking about Eun Na Rae,

1126
00:50:20,537 --> 00:50:22,405
- that could be why the conversation...
- I see.

1127
00:50:22,806 --> 00:50:26,142
felt less smooth.

1128
00:50:26,142 --> 00:50:27,610
Those two feel the same.

1129
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,147
It's pure, single-minded devotion.

1130
00:50:32,148 --> 00:50:33,917
Isn't sitting
and talking at the lodging...

1131
00:50:33,917 --> 00:50:37,654
totally different
from going out on a date?

1132
00:50:37,654 --> 00:50:39,622
Didn't you talk the most with Han Gyeol?

1133
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:40,623
Right.

1134
00:50:40,623 --> 00:50:42,358
- You spent the most time with him.
- Yeah.

1135
00:50:43,193 --> 00:50:44,461
How was Han Gyeol?

1136
00:50:44,861 --> 00:50:45,795
He's great.

1137
00:50:47,397 --> 00:50:49,732
I think Han Gyeol is a really good person.

1138
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,367
As a man too?

1139
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:54,838
Yeah, as a man as well.

1140
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:57,407
With Han Gyeol,

1141
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,576
conversation flows easily,

1142
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:04,748
and by my standards, we really click.

1143
00:51:04,748 --> 00:51:07,484
The topics we talk about and everything...

1144
00:51:08,918 --> 00:51:10,253
was nice.

1145
00:51:12,856 --> 00:51:14,858
Enjoy your meal.

1146
00:51:14,858 --> 00:51:16,392
- Enjoy your meal.
- You too.

1147
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:19,362
It feels comfortable.

1148
00:51:20,096 --> 00:51:21,531
But this "comfortable" feeling...

1149
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:24,667
"Comfortable" is basically the same
as saying, "I don't like you."

1150
00:51:24,667 --> 00:51:26,269
It's like saying,
"You feel like an older sister."

1151
00:51:26,269 --> 00:51:27,237
"With you, I just..."

1152
00:51:27,237 --> 00:51:29,072
- That might not be it.
- That's it.

1153
00:51:29,072 --> 00:51:32,409
You shouldn't say it feels comfortable
right from the start.

1154
00:51:32,409 --> 00:51:36,813
"Comfortable" is the same as saying,
"I don't see you in a romantic way."

1155
00:51:37,514 --> 00:51:38,948
It feels comfortable.

1156
00:51:38,948 --> 00:51:41,351
Really? In what way?

1157
00:51:41,351 --> 00:51:43,720
Just that...

1158
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:47,490
the conversation flows naturally
without feeling awkward.

1159
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:48,758
- You think so?
- Yeah.

1160
00:51:49,626 --> 00:51:52,595
But I think I come off too much
like an older sister.

1161
00:51:52,595 --> 00:51:53,696
Too much like an older sister.

1162
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:54,931
Don't say that, Eun Na Rae.

1163
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,303
Come on, that's nothing.

1164
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:02,572
What's the youngest you've ever dated?

1165
00:52:02,572 --> 00:52:03,506
One year younger.

1166
00:52:04,307 --> 00:52:06,543
One year younger. I see.

1167
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:08,645
Isn't Se Hoon the same age as Han Gyeol?

1168
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:09,512
That's right.

1169
00:52:09,512 --> 00:52:14,317
Then I must seem like a kid
you have to accommodate right now.

1170
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:17,487
Well...

1171
00:52:18,488 --> 00:52:19,622
Honestly.

1172
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:21,424
- Yes, honestly.
- Of course.

1173
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:22,959
Honestly...

1174
00:52:24,094 --> 00:52:27,263
One year younger
was the youngest you've dated?

1175
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Yeah.

1176
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,299
Then,

1177
00:52:29,299 --> 00:52:31,901
have you ever even gone on a blind date
with someone younger than that?

1178
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,070
No, I haven't.

1179
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:36,639
- Then everything here must be a first.
- Yeah.

1180
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:38,341
Han Gyeol was born in 1995 too, right?

1181
00:52:38,341 --> 00:52:39,409
Right.

1182
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:42,112
So she really hasn't dated
younger guys before.

1183
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:44,147
We must seem pretty cute to you, then.

1184
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:46,716
No, I don't really feel that way.

1185
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:47,650
Really?

1186
00:52:47,917 --> 00:52:48,752
But...

1187
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:52,422
Well...

1188
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:54,290
Right.

1189
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:56,126
She didn't say that to Han Gyeol, did she?

1190
00:52:57,494 --> 00:53:01,564
With Han Gyeol, we met
without knowing the age difference...

1191
00:53:01,564 --> 00:53:05,568
and built some attraction first.

1192
00:53:06,102 --> 00:53:11,107
But with Se Hoon,
I met him knowing the age gap,

1193
00:53:12,308 --> 00:53:14,844
so when it came to attraction,

1194
00:53:14,844 --> 00:53:17,180
he felt too young to me.

1195
00:53:19,182 --> 00:53:20,984
What's this?

1196
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:22,519
It's a game.

1197
00:53:22,519 --> 00:53:23,953
With just the mothers?

1198
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:26,122
Looks like they're doing some recreation.

1199
00:53:26,122 --> 00:53:27,757
What is it? Are we playing a game?

1200
00:53:27,757 --> 00:53:28,658
Is it a game?

1201
00:53:28,658 --> 00:53:29,759
What is this?

1202
00:53:30,894 --> 00:53:36,433
(The mothers gather
after changing into workout clothes.)

1203
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:38,635
If you want to go on a date today,

1204
00:53:38,635 --> 00:53:40,970
I have to give it everything,
whatever it is.

1205
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,005
What is it? There are shoes.

1206
00:53:42,005 --> 00:53:43,206
What? It's shoes.

1207
00:53:43,206 --> 00:53:45,175
- I think I know.
- Is it throwing shoes far?

1208
00:53:45,175 --> 00:53:47,143
- Are they doing shoe throwing?
- Shoe tossing.

1209
00:53:47,143 --> 00:53:48,178
That's right.

1210
00:53:48,178 --> 00:53:51,981
Now, we'll begin the mothers' game.

1211
00:53:52,715 --> 00:53:55,785
The mothers who place first and second
on the men's and women's side...

1212
00:53:55,785 --> 00:53:58,054
will receive a secret conversation pass.

1213
00:53:58,721 --> 00:54:01,191
Mothers who win
the secret conversation pass...

1214
00:54:01,191 --> 00:54:03,326
may choose one person...

1215
00:54:03,326 --> 00:54:05,995
and ask them anything they want to know.

1216
00:54:06,629 --> 00:54:09,466
- That's big.
- Nice.

1217
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:10,366
This is big.

1218
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,669
Today's game for the mothers...

1219
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,838
is rubber shoe distance throwing.

1220
00:54:14,838 --> 00:54:16,773
Rubber shoe throwing?

1221
00:54:16,773 --> 00:54:18,875
My knees aren't great,
so I won't be first.

1222
00:54:18,875 --> 00:54:20,176
We're throwing shoes.

1223
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:21,878
When they play this kind of game,

1224
00:54:21,878 --> 00:54:24,414
someone always suddenly shows
amazing athletic ability.

1225
00:54:24,414 --> 00:54:25,281
That's right.

1226
00:54:25,281 --> 00:54:27,150
- Even when they didn't know they had it.
- Right.

1227
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,618
Ma'am, you have to do well.

1228
00:54:28,618 --> 00:54:30,053
I know.

1229
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:31,955
You need to dig up all the information.

1230
00:54:33,256 --> 00:54:35,058
This might put me at a disadvantage.

1231
00:54:35,058 --> 00:54:36,826
Because I'm short.

1232
00:54:36,826 --> 00:54:39,863
Eun Na Rae's mother is extremely athletic.

1233
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,799
She does yoga, splits, and everything.

1234
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:43,900
(Splits wide)

1235
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,734
She's really good.

1236
00:54:45,902 --> 00:54:48,671
She's really good.

1237
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:50,006
I absolutely have to win.

1238
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,008
All right, let's do this.

1239
00:54:52,742 --> 00:54:54,277
It felt amazing.

1240
00:54:54,277 --> 00:54:55,578
I have to get first place no matter what.

1241
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,614
No practice round?

1242
00:54:57,614 --> 00:54:59,115
None.

1243
00:54:59,115 --> 00:55:00,884
Should we each try one practice throw?

1244
00:55:00,884 --> 00:55:02,552
- Yes.
- Shall we try a practice round?

1245
00:55:05,522 --> 00:55:06,556
(Flexible footwork technique)

1246
00:55:06,890 --> 00:55:08,024
(Totally thrown off)

1247
00:55:08,024 --> 00:55:10,360
Out.

1248
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,494
It's out.

1249
00:55:11,494 --> 00:55:12,395
You're out.

1250
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:17,434
(How skilled is Seung Hak's mother,
who raised a pro golfer son?)

1251
00:55:17,434 --> 00:55:18,568
That went nicely.

1252
00:55:18,568 --> 00:55:20,804
(Nice shot)

1253
00:55:20,804 --> 00:55:22,105
(Big laugh)

1254
00:55:22,105 --> 00:55:23,640
(Practice round winner,
Seung Hak's mother)

1255
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:24,574
As expected.

1256
00:55:25,842 --> 00:55:27,010
Like this?

1257
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:27,944
Push it forward.

1258
00:55:27,944 --> 00:55:31,281
(One-on-one coaching
from a top instructor)

1259
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:32,816
Teach me the technique.

1260
00:55:32,816 --> 00:55:33,716
Do you want to win?

1261
00:55:33,716 --> 00:55:35,151
Right, you're desperate.

1262
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:38,455
(Intensive crash course
in rubber shoe throwing)

1263
00:55:38,455 --> 00:55:41,724
When you push your foot, just push hard.

1264
00:55:41,724 --> 00:55:44,427
All right, we'll start
with the women's mothers' round.

1265
00:55:44,427 --> 00:55:45,328
You can do it.

1266
00:55:45,595 --> 00:55:46,863
Mom, good luck.

1267
00:55:48,064 --> 00:55:49,132
(First player, Kim Jin Joo's mother)

1268
00:55:49,132 --> 00:55:49,999
Careful with your hand.

1269
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:52,802
If I win this chance,

1270
00:55:52,802 --> 00:55:54,471
I wanted to ask Jin Joo...

1271
00:55:54,471 --> 00:55:56,206
who she'd like to talk to.

1272
00:55:56,206 --> 00:55:58,274
She seemed a bit down earlier, that's why.

1273
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,978
(You can do it.)

1274
00:56:02,579 --> 00:56:04,047
She's still young, after all.

1275
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:06,382
(A throw for Jin Joo)

1276
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:08,284
Mom.

1277
00:56:08,284 --> 00:56:09,185
You stepped on the line.

1278
00:56:09,686 --> 00:56:10,487
I stepped on the line?

1279
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:12,956
Honey, you stepped on it.
You're disqualified.

1280
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,557
- You did well, though.
- Disqualified.

1281
00:56:14,557 --> 00:56:15,291
It's okay.

1282
00:56:15,759 --> 00:56:17,894
Sorry, I stepped on the line.

1283
00:56:17,894 --> 00:56:19,229
But why didn't you run forward?

1284
00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:22,365
Does running even matter?

1285
00:56:22,365 --> 00:56:24,167
- Running matters.
- It does?

1286
00:56:24,167 --> 00:56:25,835
"Running matters."

1287
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:27,270
That posture.

1288
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,172
I thought I was looking
at my high school coach.

1289
00:56:29,906 --> 00:56:31,574
(The coach's stance)

1290
00:56:31,574 --> 00:56:32,609
I should look over here, right?

1291
00:56:32,609 --> 00:56:35,445
(Next player, Cho Eun Na Rae's mother)

1292
00:56:36,579 --> 00:56:38,415
(Kim Tae In's mother)

1293
00:56:38,415 --> 00:56:39,549
(Kim Myo Jin's mother)

1294
00:56:39,549 --> 00:56:40,316
My gosh.

1295
00:56:40,316 --> 00:56:43,420
(The coach's eyes searching for an ace)

1296
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:46,589
- Lower.
- That went far.

1297
00:56:46,589 --> 00:56:47,957
(Eun Na Rae's mother takes first place.)

1298
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:50,326
(Women's mothers' round,
Eun Na Rae's mother is currently in 1st.)

1299
00:56:50,326 --> 00:56:51,528
Yoga really pays off.

1300
00:56:53,463 --> 00:56:54,264
What?

1301
00:56:55,031 --> 00:56:55,932
Who is it?

1302
00:56:56,733 --> 00:57:00,003
(Last player, Kim Hyun Jin's mother)

1303
00:57:00,437 --> 00:57:01,571
Impressive.

1304
00:57:02,472 --> 00:57:04,040
First place.

1305
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,141
Impressive.

1306
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,711
- Amazing.
- She threw it really far.

1307
00:57:08,711 --> 00:57:10,380
First place goes to Kim Hyun Jin's mother.

1308
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,715
Thank you.

1309
00:57:12,715 --> 00:57:15,251
And second place goes to
Cho Eun Na Rae's mother.

1310
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:16,986
(Women's mothers' round,
2nd place, Cho Eun Na Rae's mother)

1311
00:57:16,986 --> 00:57:18,121
See?

1312
00:57:19,355 --> 00:57:20,023
You did great.

1313
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,024
I want to try again.

1314
00:57:23,259 --> 00:57:26,329
All right,
we'll start with Kim Hyun Jun's mother.

1315
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:27,330
Good luck.

1316
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:28,398
- Good luck.
- I'm nervous.

1317
00:57:30,133 --> 00:57:32,936
(A sudden change in her gaze)

1318
00:57:36,906 --> 00:57:38,108
It went really high.

1319
00:57:38,108 --> 00:57:39,275
That was good.

1320
00:57:40,477 --> 00:57:41,511
No.

1321
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:43,847
(The perfect trajectory
of the rubber shoe)

1322
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:48,918
(Bounce)

1323
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:50,353
(Kim Hyun Jun's mother is disqualified.)

1324
00:57:50,353 --> 00:57:51,921
- That's a shame.
- Out.

1325
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:53,690
She really threw it far, though.

1326
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:55,391
(Jang Min Cheol's mother)

1327
00:57:55,391 --> 00:57:57,694
(Seo Han Gyeol's mother)

1328
00:57:57,694 --> 00:58:00,196
(Moon Se Hoon's mother)

1329
00:58:00,196 --> 00:58:01,397
I should go back.

1330
00:58:01,397 --> 00:58:02,899
Tsn't that going way too far?

1331
00:58:02,899 --> 00:58:05,635
How far did she go?

1332
00:58:08,438 --> 00:58:12,075
(This is the coach's kick.)

1333
00:58:15,545 --> 00:58:18,415
It was too low.

1334
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,450
First place goes to
Jang Min Cheol's mother,

1335
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,585
and second place goes to
Moon Se Hoon's mother.

1336
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:24,354
Me?

1337
00:58:26,489 --> 00:58:29,459
The mothers who've won
the secret conversation pass...

1338
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:31,327
are Kim Hyun Jin's mother,

1339
00:58:31,327 --> 00:58:32,796
Cho Eun Na Rae's mother,

1340
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:34,397
Jang Min Cheol's mother,

1341
00:58:34,397 --> 00:58:35,865
and Moon Se Hoon's mother.

1342
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:37,934
Four people.

1343
00:58:38,735 --> 00:58:41,171
You're incredibly lucky.

1344
00:58:41,171 --> 00:58:42,839
(After the intense mothers' game ends)

1345
00:58:44,073 --> 00:58:45,341
(Se Hoon and Eun Na Rae
return from their date.)

1346
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:46,843
- I had fun talking.
- Same.

1347
00:58:47,877 --> 00:58:48,812
You're back.

1348
00:58:49,479 --> 00:58:51,347
Applause.

1349
00:58:51,347 --> 00:58:53,483
(Returning to mysterious applause)

1350
00:58:53,483 --> 00:58:54,284
I'm back.

1351
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:56,086
- Did you talk a lot?
- All the time.

1352
00:58:56,086 --> 00:58:57,520
I think it was
the most comfortable conversation.

1353
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,688
I see.

1354
00:58:58,688 --> 00:59:01,791
See, you really talk when it's one-on-one.

1355
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,160
I could just relax
and talk about anything.

1356
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,097
- Right, it has to be one-on-one.
- Glad you all had a good time.

1357
00:59:08,198 --> 00:59:09,299
How was it with Se Hoon?

1358
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,367
I had fun. I enjoyed it.

1359
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,602
Do you feel good about it?

1360
00:59:12,602 --> 00:59:15,905
Han Gyeol was talking
about you, Eun Na Rae.

1361
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:17,440
Really? What did he say?

1362
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,077
He said he was interested in you.

1363
00:59:21,077 --> 00:59:23,413
What? Really?

1364
00:59:23,413 --> 00:59:24,180
I didn't know.

1365
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,248
Really?

1366
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:28,485
- It was a nice date.
- Was it?

1367
00:59:28,485 --> 00:59:30,987
It didn't feel
like a particularly tempting opportunity.

1368
00:59:30,987 --> 00:59:31,788
What?

1369
00:59:31,788 --> 00:59:34,190
It was fine. It was fun.

1370
00:59:35,291 --> 00:59:39,662
It's hard to tell if it's "this person"
or "not this person" yet.

1371
00:59:39,662 --> 00:59:44,801
It seems like Se Hoon
and Eun Na Rae really clicked.

1372
00:59:44,801 --> 00:59:46,035
His mother...

1373
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,605
hopes things work out
between Se Hoon and Eun Na Rae.

1374
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:52,976
Earlier, when Se Hoon said
it felt comfortable and compatible,

1375
00:59:52,976 --> 00:59:57,881
- she really trusted the literal words.
- Yeah, I think so.

1376
00:59:57,881 --> 01:00:00,483
She's honestly hoping
it works out between them.

1377
01:00:00,483 --> 01:00:02,552
That's how the mother feels.

1378
01:00:03,486 --> 01:00:09,459
It seems like Se Hoon
and Eun Na Rae really clicked.

1379
01:00:09,459 --> 01:00:11,161
That makes sense.
I said that to Se Hoon too.

1380
01:00:11,161 --> 01:00:15,131
I said once he talks to her,
he'll like her more.

1381
01:00:15,131 --> 01:00:16,699
When he asked who my No.1 was,

1382
01:00:17,367 --> 01:00:19,769
I said it was Cho Eun Na Rae.

1383
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:20,603
I see.

1384
01:00:21,938 --> 01:00:23,506
- After it ended?
- Yeah.

1385
01:00:23,506 --> 01:00:24,774
After the mothers' introductions.

1386
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:27,944
Right after the introductions?

1387
01:00:27,944 --> 01:00:29,446
I see.

1388
01:00:29,446 --> 01:00:30,246
Yeah.

1389
01:00:30,246 --> 01:00:32,782
Even before going on this date?

1390
01:00:32,782 --> 01:00:34,517
And after coming back from the date?

1391
01:00:34,517 --> 01:00:37,320
I think that's how I feel now.

1392
01:00:40,023 --> 01:00:45,195
I was secretly hoping
he'd grow closer to Myo Jin,

1393
01:00:45,195 --> 01:00:48,298
but emotionally,

1394
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:51,334
he said he connected better
with Eun Na Rae.

1395
01:00:51,334 --> 01:00:57,407
After today's self-introductions,
something started bothering me,

1396
01:00:57,407 --> 01:00:58,908
so my feelings got complicated.

1397
01:01:02,398 --> 01:01:04,400
That thing bothering her is probably...

1398
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,603
Right, it's probably the age,
from a mother's perspective.

1399
01:01:07,603 --> 01:01:08,670
Anyone would feel that way.

1400
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:10,906
- That's unavoidable.
- Of course.

1401
01:01:18,881 --> 01:01:21,750
(Meanwhile)

1402
01:01:22,551 --> 01:01:24,787
(The mothers are quietly waiting
for their secret conversations.)

1403
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:27,356
They're waiting
for the secret conversations.

1404
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,393
(A chance to ask the contestants
anything they're curious about)

1405
01:01:31,393 --> 01:01:34,897
I'm really curious who they chose.

1406
01:01:34,897 --> 01:01:36,065
I'm nervous.

1407
01:01:37,232 --> 01:01:40,436
From a child's perspective,

1408
01:01:40,436 --> 01:01:43,005
I'm not sure
if this is good or bad either.

1409
01:01:43,005 --> 01:01:45,007
The mothers could go to someone
the contestants are not interested in...

1410
01:01:45,007 --> 01:01:47,076
and ask pointless questions.

1411
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:49,278
That is likely to happen.

1412
01:01:49,278 --> 01:01:50,646
It could cause misunderstandings.

1413
01:01:53,015 --> 01:01:54,717
My daughter I know...

1414
01:01:55,217 --> 01:01:57,119
is quite strong,

1415
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:59,755
so I was looking
for a gentle mother-in-law.

1416
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,726
That's really important too.

1417
01:02:03,726 --> 01:02:05,094
(Which son has a gentle mother-in-law?)

1418
01:02:05,094 --> 01:02:06,495
A gentle mother-in-law.

1419
01:02:08,497 --> 01:02:10,666
(Knock, knock)

1420
01:02:11,366 --> 01:02:13,335
Yes, come in.

1421
01:02:13,335 --> 01:02:16,672
(Secret conversation request,
Kim Hyun Jin's mother chooses Hyun Jun.)

1422
01:02:16,672 --> 01:02:18,907
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1423
01:02:19,508 --> 01:02:21,543
I was really surprised.

1424
01:02:21,543 --> 01:02:24,546
I'm so grateful and thankful
that she likes me,

1425
01:02:24,546 --> 01:02:26,582
but I was like,
"But Hyun Jin does not like me."

1426
01:02:26,582 --> 01:02:28,684
I kept thinking, "Is this really okay?"

1427
01:02:29,752 --> 01:02:32,888
Since we hadn't talked one-on-one yet.

1428
01:02:32,888 --> 01:02:34,723
I was genuinely surprised.

1429
01:02:35,357 --> 01:02:38,861
I even felt a bit resentful
and chose you today.

1430
01:02:38,861 --> 01:02:40,796
You know how I feel, right?

1431
01:02:40,796 --> 01:02:43,298
You'd gone all in on Tae In.

1432
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:46,568
I thought Hyun Jin wasn't
interested in me.

1433
01:02:46,568 --> 01:02:48,604
You hadn't talked yet.

1434
01:02:48,604 --> 01:02:49,505
Then why did you think that?

1435
01:02:49,505 --> 01:02:51,106
I mean, from the beginning,

1436
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:53,008
you should've talked evenly
with all five people.

1437
01:02:54,109 --> 01:02:56,879
Am I even in Hyun Jin's interest ranking?

1438
01:02:56,879 --> 01:02:58,347
Yes, you are.

1439
01:02:58,347 --> 01:03:00,149
I am? Even now?

1440
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:01,050
Yes.

1441
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:02,117
Really?

1442
01:03:02,117 --> 01:03:04,219
(He can't believe it.)

1443
01:03:05,087 --> 01:03:06,688
I thought I wasn't at all.

1444
01:03:06,688 --> 01:03:08,657
I really thought
she was not interested at all.

1445
01:03:08,657 --> 01:03:10,359
Not just a little, but not at all.

1446
01:03:10,359 --> 01:03:12,761
Now that I've been through this myself,

1447
01:03:12,761 --> 01:03:15,831
out of all the mothers here,
your mother is the one...

1448
01:03:15,831 --> 01:03:17,699
who touched me the most.

1449
01:03:17,699 --> 01:03:20,969
If the mother is this warm,

1450
01:03:20,969 --> 01:03:22,504
then you must be warm-hearted too.

1451
01:03:22,504 --> 01:03:24,540
Yes, that's right.
He seems like he would be.

1452
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:27,576
And I heard your father
is a school principal,

1453
01:03:27,576 --> 01:03:29,311
so you're a family of educators.

1454
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:34,450
And I thought, at least
on the education front, that's reassuring.

1455
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:36,285
A family of educators.

1456
01:03:36,285 --> 01:03:38,787
It's always been like this.

1457
01:03:38,787 --> 01:03:40,622
The principal's son...

1458
01:03:40,622 --> 01:03:41,957
A teacher.

1459
01:03:41,957 --> 01:03:45,761
tends to be really popular.
It's kind of a tradition.

1460
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:50,966
And if you were to marry into our family,

1461
01:03:50,966 --> 01:03:56,939
as the youngest son-in-law, I feel like
you'd really brighten the atmosphere.

1462
01:03:56,939 --> 01:03:58,273
That thought crossed my mind too,

1463
01:03:58,273 --> 01:04:01,243
so I wanted to talk to you.

1464
01:04:01,243 --> 01:04:02,044
You're grateful, right?

1465
01:04:02,044 --> 01:04:04,012
I'm truly grateful. This is an honor.

1466
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:08,150
This might be rude to ask,

1467
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:12,421
but your annual salary...

1468
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:14,456
Wait.

1469
01:04:15,257 --> 01:04:16,225
That's an important question.

1470
01:04:16,225 --> 01:04:18,060
Yes, there's no getting around it.

1471
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:21,864
If you could tell me even roughly...

1472
01:04:21,864 --> 01:04:22,998
Hyun Jin is just...

1473
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:26,935
It's not extremely high.

1474
01:04:26,935 --> 01:04:30,172
It's around the level of a major company.

1475
01:04:30,172 --> 01:04:32,408
In terms of annual salary,

1476
01:04:32,408 --> 01:04:34,977
it's currently
between 80,000 and 90,000 dollars.

1477
01:04:35,644 --> 01:04:38,647
There's room for it to keep going up.

1478
01:04:38,647 --> 01:04:40,749
Though it probably
won't jump dramatically,

1479
01:04:40,749 --> 01:04:43,685
it does go up little by little over time,

1480
01:04:43,685 --> 01:04:45,354
since I'm working at a company.

1481
01:04:45,354 --> 01:04:47,322
- Since it's a steady job.
- A salaried worker.

1482
01:04:47,322 --> 01:04:48,524
That's right.

1483
01:04:49,792 --> 01:04:53,762
I was pretty taken aback
when she asked about my salary.

1484
01:04:53,762 --> 01:04:58,667
Personally,
I'm satisfied with what I make,

1485
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,869
and I think it's fine.

1486
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:04,640
But I'm not sure whether Hyun Jin's mother
would feel the same.

1487
01:05:06,408 --> 01:05:07,309
(Sigh)

1488
01:05:08,977 --> 01:05:12,181
Who did she call over?

1489
01:05:12,614 --> 01:05:14,149
- Isn't she going to the lawyer?
- Han Gyeol?

1490
01:05:14,149 --> 01:05:16,585
Maybe Han Gyeol or maybe not.

1491
01:05:16,585 --> 01:05:17,820
Hello, ma'am.

1492
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,655
It's Han Gyeol.

1493
01:05:20,155 --> 01:05:21,223
You were surprised, right?

1494
01:05:21,223 --> 01:05:21,990
Yes.

1495
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:22,958
(A single-minded,
unwavering mother's pick)

1496
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:24,727
I really didn't know anything.

1497
01:05:25,394 --> 01:05:27,730
I honestly had no idea.

1498
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:30,299
I even wondered
if she'd lost interest in me.

1499
01:05:32,034 --> 01:05:34,903
Since I've been getting a lot of attention
from the mothers,

1500
01:05:34,903 --> 01:05:38,440
I honestly thought
maybe someone else's mother had called me.

1501
01:05:39,908 --> 01:05:42,077
We did the self-introductions
today, right?

1502
01:05:42,077 --> 01:05:42,911
Yes.

1503
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,246
After the introductions,

1504
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:48,016
was there a few unexpected things?

1505
01:05:49,084 --> 01:05:52,254
It'd be a lie
to say I saw everything coming.

1506
01:05:52,254 --> 01:05:53,055
Right?

1507
01:05:53,055 --> 01:05:54,757
There were definitely
things I didn't expect.

1508
01:05:54,757 --> 01:05:55,758
Right.

1509
01:05:55,758 --> 01:05:59,228
There's a bit of an age gap
between you and my daughter.

1510
01:05:59,228 --> 01:06:00,195
A little, yes.

1511
01:06:00,696 --> 01:06:02,798
(Eun Na Rae and Han Gyeol
have a 7-year age gap.)

1512
01:06:02,798 --> 01:06:05,100
Does that bother you a lot?

1513
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:05,868
The age?

1514
01:06:06,993 --> 01:06:08,661
Honestly, the age does bother me.

1515
01:06:08,661 --> 01:06:09,396
Right?

1516
01:06:09,396 --> 01:06:13,266
Because I've only dated
someone two years older,

1517
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:15,068
and never beyond that.

1518
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:18,104
So at this point,

1519
01:06:18,104 --> 01:06:23,009
to say,
"Age is absolutely no issue for me,"

1520
01:06:23,009 --> 01:06:26,312
I don't really have the experience
to back that up.

1521
01:06:26,312 --> 01:06:28,581
- I see.
- That's where I'm at.

1522
01:06:28,581 --> 01:06:31,518
(The age gap keeps nagging at him.)

1523
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:34,554
When he was in sixth grade,
she was a college freshman.

1524
01:06:34,554 --> 01:06:36,589
When you put it like that...

1525
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:38,892
Saying it that way feels kind of...

1526
01:06:38,892 --> 01:06:40,226
But that's the reality.

1527
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,698
But can I ask,

1528
01:06:44,698 --> 01:06:46,366
in terms of people you're interested in,

1529
01:06:46,366 --> 01:06:48,468
would my daughter be on your list?

1530
01:06:48,468 --> 01:06:49,969
On my list?

1531
01:06:49,969 --> 01:06:52,706
Of course, she's on the list.

1532
01:06:52,706 --> 01:06:55,375
Thank you. Just hearing that is enough.

1533
01:06:55,375 --> 01:06:56,876
Just that alone.

1534
01:06:56,876 --> 01:06:58,878
- Not at all.
- Just that alone.

1535
01:06:58,878 --> 01:06:59,913
(His feelings didn't change
despite the 7-year gap.)

1536
01:06:59,913 --> 01:07:04,417
I prefer someone who's professional
and committed to their work.

1537
01:07:04,417 --> 01:07:05,318
I see.

1538
01:07:05,318 --> 01:07:06,853
In that sense,

1539
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:09,289
she's become even more impressive to me,
and I like her even more.

1540
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:10,190
Really?

1541
01:07:10,857 --> 01:07:12,192
I grew more interested.

1542
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:14,094
But there is one thing.

1543
01:07:14,694 --> 01:07:15,995
- One thing.
- Yes, one thing.

1544
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:19,299
What I worried about more was this.

1545
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:21,868
She's a freelancer,

1546
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:26,373
but I've always valued
having some routine and structure.

1547
01:07:26,373 --> 01:07:29,175
That was actually my number one condition.

1548
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:32,512
It's one of the few conditions
I care about.

1549
01:07:34,147 --> 01:07:35,949
And also,

1550
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:38,218
I'm curious what you think.

1551
01:07:38,218 --> 01:07:40,620
As for my daughter,

1552
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,023
she's not very good with money.

1553
01:07:44,023 --> 01:07:45,558
- She isn't?
- She says it just never really developed.

1554
01:07:47,093 --> 01:07:48,728
And as of now,

1555
01:07:48,728 --> 01:07:51,865
she hasn't saved up much.

1556
01:07:52,766 --> 01:07:54,067
And also,

1557
01:07:54,067 --> 01:07:55,635
her income isn't that high.

1558
01:07:56,069 --> 01:07:59,172
(3 direct hits in a row)

1559
01:07:59,172 --> 01:08:01,141
Another concern is this.

1560
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:07,914
My daughter wants to have a baby soon.

1561
01:08:07,914 --> 01:08:11,284
One of the reasons
she suddenly decided she wants to marry...

1562
01:08:11,284 --> 01:08:15,989
is that she wants to have a child
before she turns 40.

1563
01:08:15,989 --> 01:08:17,190
Because having a child
is important to her.

1564
01:08:17,190 --> 01:08:18,058
Yes.

1565
01:08:18,058 --> 01:08:21,795
This is a "matchmaking" show, right?

1566
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:23,196
And "matchmaking" means...

1567
01:08:23,196 --> 01:08:25,999
you come on with marriage as the premise.

1568
01:08:25,999 --> 01:08:27,567
So you think it'd be best to move quickly.

1569
01:08:28,868 --> 01:08:30,737
Once the show is over,
to go straight to marrying.

1570
01:08:30,737 --> 01:08:32,372
"Let's do it next month."

1571
01:08:33,273 --> 01:08:37,544
But ma'am, that's not really possible.

1572
01:08:37,544 --> 01:08:41,047
Even if you book a venue right now,
it takes a year.

1573
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:42,215
Well...

1574
01:08:42,215 --> 01:08:43,817
Even if you date for a few months,

1575
01:08:43,817 --> 01:08:46,352
reserve the venue and wait until then,

1576
01:08:46,352 --> 01:08:47,887
it still becomes a year anyway.

1577
01:08:47,887 --> 01:08:50,690
- Right.
- That's still pretty soon.

1578
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:54,360
So realistically,
doing it in three or four months...

1579
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,462
is basically impossible.

1580
01:08:55,462 --> 01:08:56,796
Right, that's true.

1581
01:08:56,796 --> 01:09:02,102
But that's different from saying,
"I'm not even sure, so let's date a year,"

1582
01:09:02,102 --> 01:09:04,971
"and then decide
whether to marry afterward."

1583
01:09:04,971 --> 01:09:07,006
It feels like a different
kind of situation.

1584
01:09:07,006 --> 01:09:08,208
Yes, it's different.

1585
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,944
So that gives me a bit of hope.

1586
01:09:14,214 --> 01:09:16,015
Another hurdle has come up.

1587
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:20,120
She wants to get married quickly,

1588
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:23,123
and also have children quickly.

1589
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:26,426
If that's the plan,
she'd need to be very prepared already.

1590
01:09:26,426 --> 01:09:30,897
But even how much she earns right now
was left kind of vague,

1591
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:35,902
so for me, it feels difficult...

1592
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:39,472
objectively.

1593
01:09:41,074 --> 01:09:43,243
On our show,

1594
01:09:43,243 --> 01:09:46,546
we're waiting to hear from those...

1595
01:09:46,546 --> 01:09:48,181
who want to find a match
together with their mothers.

1596
01:09:48,181 --> 01:09:50,650
If you'd like to participate,
don't hesitate.

1597
01:09:50,650 --> 01:09:53,520
Please apply.

1598
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:55,789
He said you're on his list.

1599
01:09:55,789 --> 01:09:56,723
Even now.

1600
01:09:56,723 --> 01:09:57,757
He's charming.

1601
01:09:57,757 --> 01:09:58,591
Really?

1602
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:01,494
Seven years isn't a small gap.

1603
01:10:01,494 --> 01:10:03,630
Do you want to say it won't work, Mom?

1604
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:04,964
That's too big an age gap.

1605
01:10:04,964 --> 01:10:05,799
This is fun.

1606
01:10:05,799 --> 01:10:07,200
I never expected this at all.

1607
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,334
This is going to blow up.

1608
01:10:08,334 --> 01:10:09,869
I'm only looking forward
to what comes next.

1609
01:10:09,869 --> 01:10:12,105
Myo Jin, can we talk for a second?

1610
01:10:12,105 --> 01:10:13,973
(And the contestants' feelings
grow more complicated.)

1611
01:10:13,973 --> 01:10:15,275
This is pissing me off.

1612
01:10:15,275 --> 01:10:16,009
What's wrong?

1613
01:10:16,009 --> 01:10:17,477
Doing housework at home...

1614
01:10:17,477 --> 01:10:21,181
actually creates way more value, you know.

1615
01:10:21,181 --> 01:10:22,982
So you're saying
you want me be a full-time homemaker?

1616
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:25,018
(A barrage of shocking comments)

1617
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:27,053
I just grew even more interested.

1618
01:10:27,053 --> 01:10:28,288
My goodness.

1619
01:10:28,288 --> 01:10:30,356
Wait, what?

1620
01:10:30,356 --> 01:10:32,358
This is more shocking...

1621
01:10:34,027 --> 01:10:35,028
than "Divorce Camp."

1622
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:36,629
This scene right now.

1623
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:37,731
(A night without mothers
that shocked everyone)

1624
01:10:37,731 --> 01:10:38,831
