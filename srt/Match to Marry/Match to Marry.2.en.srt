1
00:00:58,661 --> 00:00:59,729
Is Se Hoon here?

2
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:01,898
I was surprised it was Se Hoon.

3
00:01:03,132 --> 00:01:04,167
You startled me.

4
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:05,368
- Did you shower?
- Yes.

5
00:01:05,368 --> 00:01:06,269
Really?

6
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,204
Can I...

7
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:10,006
come in? Can we talk here?

8
00:01:10,006 --> 00:01:11,608
You can come in. What a surprise.

9
00:01:11,608 --> 00:01:12,475
Really?

10
00:01:12,475 --> 00:01:13,943
I didn't know you were showering.

11
00:01:16,312 --> 00:01:17,380
I see.

12
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:21,351
You haven't showered yet?

13
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:24,520
I just wanted to talk to you
before taking a shower.

14
00:01:26,656 --> 00:01:28,558
- You look handsome even without makeup.
- Really?

15
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,530
The women are being very forward.

16
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:34,898
Thank you.

17
00:01:35,732 --> 00:01:36,799
Aren't you tired?

18
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,635
I am a bit tired.

19
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:42,105
We were pretty far apart today,
so we didn't really get to talk.

20
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,841
Everyone else is sleeping.

21
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:46,543
(Se Hoon suggests going outside.)

22
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:47,477
Won't it be cold for you?

23
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,216
You're cold, aren't you?

24
00:01:53,716 --> 00:01:55,451
Your hair might freeze.

25
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:57,120
There was a heated ondol room.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,988
Your hair's turned
into a total bird's nest right here.

27
00:01:58,988 --> 00:02:00,189
- My gosh.
- That touch.

28
00:02:00,657 --> 00:02:03,693
- A bird's nest.
- This is crazy.

29
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:08,097
(He adjusts the boiler temperature
so Tae In won't be cold.)

30
00:02:14,537 --> 00:02:15,605
How was today, overall?

31
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,141
Well, just...

32
00:02:18,141 --> 00:02:19,142
Tiring and hectic?

33
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:20,276
It was fun.

34
00:02:20,276 --> 00:02:22,412
- It was fun?
- Yeah, it was all fun.

35
00:02:22,412 --> 00:02:24,314
Was it nice going on a date with her?

36
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:26,316
With Myo Jin?

37
00:02:26,316 --> 00:02:28,551
I saw you two switched
to casual speech pretty quickly.

38
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:31,120
The date...

39
00:02:32,055 --> 00:02:33,022
Date...

40
00:02:33,022 --> 00:02:35,558
It was good.

41
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:36,626
He has to choose his words carefully.

42
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:38,494
- "So this is the person I'm with here."
- Right.

43
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:39,829
Yeah, he has to be careful.

44
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,866
"I'm in the same space
with someone like her."

45
00:02:44,133 --> 00:02:46,536
This is fun.

46
00:02:51,574 --> 00:02:53,409
What time do you head to work
in the morning?

47
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,346
I wake up sometime between eight and nine.

48
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:59,315
By then, I'm already at work.

49
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,350
Between eight and nine?

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,119
- You go in really early.
- I do.

51
00:03:03,353 --> 00:03:06,456
I'm curious. What kind of work do you do?

52
00:03:09,926 --> 00:03:10,994
It's a secret.

53
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:12,061
That way, you'll have to see me again.

54
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:16,866
(MC Seo Jang Hoon, Lee Yo Won, Kim Yo Han)

55
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:18,368
What is happening right now?

56
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:20,036
What about Hyun Jun?

57
00:03:20,036 --> 00:03:21,037
This is driving me crazy.

58
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,973
Hyun Jun,
this is not the time to be sleeping.

59
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:25,675
What is going on right now?

60
00:03:25,675 --> 00:03:26,609
Isn't that right?

61
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:27,944
Right.

62
00:03:27,944 --> 00:03:30,213
If I'm the only one
putting all my cards on the table,

63
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:33,016
you'll just end up being curious
about someone else.

64
00:03:36,586 --> 00:03:37,954
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

65
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:39,389
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

66
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:40,690
What about you?

67
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,025
I'm still deciding.

68
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,627
- Tell me, and I'll try to...
- Why? To match outfits?

69
00:03:44,627 --> 00:03:47,030
Weren't you cold today?
You looked a bit chilly.

70
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,199
I was cold.
I think my hands are all chapped now.

71
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,935
Your hands are moisturized.

72
00:03:52,268 --> 00:03:53,269
Are they?

73
00:03:54,204 --> 00:03:55,805
Don't do that.

74
00:03:55,805 --> 00:03:59,008
Isn't Tae In talking even more...

75
00:03:59,008 --> 00:04:00,777
- than usual right now?
- A natural charmer.

76
00:04:00,777 --> 00:04:02,845
Two natural charmers have met.

77
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,015
My hands look kind of ugly.

78
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:09,586
Hey, you said you'd pick out my outfit.

79
00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:12,355
- Is that the only one you have?
- That one,

80
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:14,057
and a white...

81
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,726
dress with jeans.

82
00:04:16,726 --> 00:04:19,262
A white dress with jeans.

83
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:21,097
I think that would suit you
better tomorrow.

84
00:04:21,097 --> 00:04:22,165
- Really?
- Yes.

85
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:23,766
Then I'll wear that tomorrow.

86
00:04:23,766 --> 00:04:24,767
What about me?

87
00:04:25,501 --> 00:04:26,536
No black.

88
00:04:27,136 --> 00:04:28,104
No black?

89
00:04:28,538 --> 00:04:30,273
I'll try white, then.

90
00:04:31,374 --> 00:04:33,776
White with your hair pushed back?

91
00:04:33,776 --> 00:04:35,345
Yes, white with my hair pushed back.

92
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:39,716
Se Hoon is very handsome,

93
00:04:39,716 --> 00:04:42,552
and he laughs so openly.

94
00:04:42,552 --> 00:04:43,553
Seeing that side of him,

95
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:46,956
I started wondering if my ideal type
might actually be Se Hoon.

96
00:04:46,956 --> 00:04:48,191
I was a bit...

97
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:51,427
confused.

98
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:56,833
I was really grateful for
the courage she showed to come to my room,

99
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,036
and I think that shook my heart
quite a bit.

100
00:05:00,436 --> 00:05:03,406
Curiosity about Tae In.

101
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:05,141
I think that curiosity grew stronger.

102
00:05:05,975 --> 00:05:08,211
Thank you for saying yes
and coming to see me.

103
00:05:08,211 --> 00:05:09,879
No, thank you for asking.

104
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:13,249
Eun Na Rae chose Han Gyeol
to have dinner together, right?

105
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,317
Right.

106
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:16,152
But now, it's Seung Hak.

107
00:05:16,553 --> 00:05:18,555
Do you have a type you like?

108
00:05:18,555 --> 00:05:21,357
I like cute types.

109
00:05:21,357 --> 00:05:22,625
Cute types?

110
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,693
In men?

111
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,061
Yes.

112
00:05:25,395 --> 00:05:28,731
Don't you get told you're cute a lot,

113
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:30,266
by your girlfriends?

114
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,203
I'm not sure.

115
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:35,038
I think you're cute.

116
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,608
I think I've heard that before.

117
00:05:39,642 --> 00:05:40,677
You...

118
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:42,312
Well...

119
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,081
You're...

120
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,284
Should I say top interests?

121
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:50,453
You really stood out to me.

122
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:53,223
That's a total rapid-fire confession.

123
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:57,994
Before today ended,

124
00:05:57,994 --> 00:06:00,930
I really wanted to talk with you
about anything at all.

125
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,932
That's what I was thinking.

126
00:06:04,133 --> 00:06:06,236
That's great.

127
00:06:06,236 --> 00:06:09,873
I don't know your age, but...

128
00:06:09,873 --> 00:06:11,507
Does age matter?

129
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:13,142
It does matter.

130
00:06:13,142 --> 00:06:14,510
- The age?
- Yes.

131
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,314
It's not that a big age gap
is a deal-breaker,

132
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:21,451
but I think I naturally end up
with preconceived ideas.

133
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:24,053
- "That could be too overwhelming."
- Right.

134
00:06:24,053 --> 00:06:25,688
I've only dated older women.

135
00:06:29,392 --> 00:06:30,760
Only older women.

136
00:06:31,294 --> 00:06:32,529
He says he's only dated older women.

137
00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:33,963
Maybe Seung Hak is a bit young.

138
00:06:33,963 --> 00:06:38,034
He's young, so he dates older women.

139
00:06:38,034 --> 00:06:39,802
Once someone reaches a certain age...

140
00:06:39,802 --> 00:06:41,004
They don't date older women.

141
00:06:41,004 --> 00:06:43,072
No, even if you want
to date older women, you can't.

142
00:06:43,072 --> 00:06:45,341
- Because they're all married.
- I see.

143
00:06:48,177 --> 00:06:50,947
(Morning of Day 2)

144
00:06:59,322 --> 00:07:01,157
Did you sleep well?

145
00:07:01,157 --> 00:07:05,028
Diligent Jin Joo woke up
at the crack of dawn.

146
00:07:05,028 --> 00:07:06,095
My daughter is the problem.

147
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:10,633
Are you going to wash up?

148
00:07:11,034 --> 00:07:12,235
"First-come-first-served date?"

149
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:13,736
What?

150
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,439
(First-come-first-served date)

151
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,108
Within a set time,

152
00:07:19,108 --> 00:07:21,811
the women go to the one man
they most want to date...

153
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,012
and give him a rose.

154
00:07:24,747 --> 00:07:27,217
I was the only one
who went to bed early yesterday.

155
00:07:27,217 --> 00:07:29,786
Everyone else was talking and drinking
with others.

156
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:31,154
So I was like, "This won't do."

157
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:33,623
"I should wake up early and do something."

158
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:36,226
So I quickly got ready and headed out.

159
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:37,493
I'm heading out.

160
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,097
Who did Jin Joo go to?

161
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:42,599
Yes, you have to move fast.

162
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:48,137
(Knock, knock)

163
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:55,345
(The lodging is completely silent.)

164
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:56,312
Hello.

165
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:57,814
Hello.

166
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:02,185
For today's first-come-first-served date,

167
00:08:02,185 --> 00:08:04,954
the person I chose was Jang Min Cheol.

168
00:08:05,588 --> 00:08:09,659
I don't think we got to have
a deep conversation yesterday,

169
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:11,394
so I wanted to talk again.

170
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:15,064
(First-come-first-served date,
Kim Jin Joo chooses Jang Min Cheol.)

171
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,466
Am I supposed to take this?

172
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,067
Did you get one already?

173
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:19,035
No.

174
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:22,739
Looks like I found the right place.

175
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,976
(Hyun Jun's mother is watching
from very close.)

176
00:08:26,976 --> 00:08:28,411
- How cute.
- She looks so happy.

177
00:08:28,411 --> 00:08:29,812
(Thumbs up)

178
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:32,348
Do I head out?

179
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:37,086
(Then, Jo Eun Na Rae also sets off.)

180
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:40,890
Are you there?

181
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,958
Yes.

182
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,962
Is this Han Gyeol's room?

183
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:47,363
Yes, that's right.

184
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:49,666
Eun Na Rae chose Han Gyeol.

185
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,201
Yes, thank you.

186
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:52,068
Han Gyeol.

187
00:08:53,436 --> 00:08:56,673
Hey, did you sleep well?

188
00:08:56,673 --> 00:09:02,011
They told me to give this to the person
I want to go on a date with today.

189
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:02,912
So,

190
00:09:02,912 --> 00:09:04,180
I wanted to give it to you.

191
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:06,549
Really?

192
00:09:07,016 --> 00:09:09,385
But I remember she had
a really deep conversation with Seung Hak.

193
00:09:09,385 --> 00:09:10,053
And...

194
00:09:10,053 --> 00:09:11,254
Was the green onion flirting stronger?

195
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:16,226
When I talked to Seung Hak last night,

196
00:09:16,226 --> 00:09:19,863
we ended up talking nonstop,

197
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:24,100
but so far,
I think I click best with Han Gyeol.

198
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,770
So that was my way of showing how I feel.

199
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,241
She's really playing the field.

200
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,679
Did you get to talk
to all four ladies yesterday?

201
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,650
I mostly talked to the people
who were nearby.

202
00:09:41,017 --> 00:09:43,019
You were basically the MC last night.

203
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,287
But I don't think that's a good thing.

204
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:45,388
- Why not?
- Just...

205
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:47,390
- I actually liked that about you.
- Really?

206
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,026
- Great.
- Last evening.

207
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:52,428
That's a relief.

208
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:55,598
You seem to like people
with a bit of energy.

209
00:09:55,598 --> 00:09:56,466
Actually,

210
00:09:56,466 --> 00:09:58,234
high energy is fine,
as long as you don't cross the line.

211
00:09:58,768 --> 00:10:00,370
You didn't seem
like someone who crosses the line.

212
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,538
I never cross the line.

213
00:10:01,838 --> 00:10:03,506
I don't even go near the center line.

214
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:06,142
He's surprisingly charming.

215
00:10:06,142 --> 00:10:08,111
He's really witty.

216
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:10,280
I haven't had anything sweet in forever.

217
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:13,216
So you're really strict with your diet?

218
00:10:13,216 --> 00:10:14,651
Sweets aren't good for you, right?

219
00:10:14,651 --> 00:10:15,552
They're really not.

220
00:10:15,552 --> 00:10:20,123
So I haven't tried the Dubai chocolate
donut, and it's driving me nuts.

221
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:21,758
I find that so attractive.

222
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:22,559
Why?

223
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,826
Because I'm the exact same way.

224
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:24,961
About controlling yourself?

225
00:10:24,961 --> 00:10:27,397
I try to hold back,
but on Instagram Explore,

226
00:10:27,397 --> 00:10:29,899
it's all Dubai chocolate,
Dubai towel chocolate cake...

227
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:30,967
And Dubai chewy pie.

228
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:31,868
Chewy pie.

229
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,504
You know that one's new, right?

230
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:36,573
- It's driving me crazy.
- It makes people lose their minds.

231
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,608
(The two are truly obsessed
with Dubai chocolate.)

232
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:40,610
Didn't we talk about this
when we were drinking too?

233
00:10:43,146 --> 00:10:44,881
- I'm curious about something.
- What?

234
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:46,916
Your preferred type of woman.

235
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:50,386
First impressions-wise,
I like people like you, Jin Joo.

236
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:51,154
What does that mean?

237
00:10:51,154 --> 00:10:53,590
Someone with a kind, gentle vibe.

238
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,557
That's hard to have.

239
00:10:54,557 --> 00:10:55,692
Is that what I have? I see.

240
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:56,693
And kind of cute...

241
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,695
You also have a cute side.

242
00:11:00,597 --> 00:11:01,531
What about you, Jin Joo?

243
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:03,499
I like someone more masculine.

244
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:04,734
I like a manly type.

245
00:11:04,734 --> 00:11:05,835
A manly type.

246
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:07,337
I like sexy people.

247
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:08,304
Really?

248
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:10,773
I like that.

249
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,142
What do you like so much about that?

250
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:15,778
Why do you like that so much?

251
00:11:16,346 --> 00:11:17,814
The manly vibe.

252
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,516
You came to the right place, then.

253
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:22,418
I don't know yet.

254
00:11:22,418 --> 00:11:23,453
True.

255
00:11:26,155 --> 00:11:27,490
Jin Joo seemed...

256
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,925
strong in one-on-one interactions.

257
00:11:29,392 --> 00:11:32,996
In one-on-one settings,
she seems more honest and expressive,

258
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:35,498
and really proactive
about showing how she feels.

259
00:11:36,266 --> 00:11:39,068
- They seem to have great chemistry.
- Yes.

260
00:11:39,068 --> 00:11:43,106
I'll ask you something
I'm really curious about, straight up.

261
00:11:43,106 --> 00:11:48,144
Why do you want to get married?

262
00:11:48,311 --> 00:11:49,946
When I'm in a relationship,

263
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:53,249
everything else in my life
tends to go better too.

264
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:54,250
Really?

265
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,520
If there's something to focus on
and someone to focus on,

266
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,722
I know what to put my energy into,

267
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:03,226
and I know exactly
what I need to do for that person,

268
00:12:03,226 --> 00:12:04,961
and everything else
kind of falls into place too.

269
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,631
Why do you want to get married?

270
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:09,832
I...

271
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:14,037
want to meet someone
I can love and cherish,

272
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,039
and spend my whole life...

273
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,143
being best friends with that person.

274
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,844
And...

275
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:24,013
I want to have a baby.

276
00:12:24,013 --> 00:12:28,017
I've always felt strongly
that I definitely want kids.

277
00:12:28,017 --> 00:12:29,018
I see.

278
00:12:29,319 --> 00:12:31,421
Honestly, this is how I feel.

279
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:36,059
I don't think I'd want to have
a baby right away...

280
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:38,127
if I get married,

281
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:41,531
because I'd want to really enjoy
the newlywed phase.

282
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:44,667
- Really?
- That's how I feel.

283
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:45,902
They're serious.

284
00:12:46,903 --> 00:12:48,671
Is it because they're talking
with marriage in mind?

285
00:12:48,671 --> 00:12:51,040
Still, even so,

286
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,045
I wonder if they should be talking about
that when it hasn't even been a full day.

287
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,549
I want to make memories with my wife...

288
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,852
without the pressure that comes
with having a child.

289
00:13:02,852 --> 00:13:05,188
I want to spend time with her alone.

290
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:06,489
That's how I feel.

291
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,457
Like, for about a year.

292
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:11,094
I'd like to spend about that long
as newlyweds.

293
00:13:12,028 --> 00:13:13,530
When we talked about kids,

294
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,268
I could really feel
how strongly she wanted to have a baby,

295
00:13:18,268 --> 00:13:21,838
and I could tell
there were still a few things...

296
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:23,806
she was unsure about.

297
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:28,111
But I thought we could talk
about those things through.

298
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,113
I grew more interested in her.

299
00:13:30,113 --> 00:13:32,448
Because I got to know her better.

300
00:13:32,916 --> 00:13:34,918
How was it with Eun Na Rae?

301
00:13:34,918 --> 00:13:36,219
I got to know her better today.

302
00:13:36,219 --> 00:13:38,788
You talked yesterday and again today,
so two days in a row.

303
00:13:38,788 --> 00:13:40,857
With the same person.

304
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:44,294
I think we talked a lot more deeply today.

305
00:13:44,294 --> 00:13:47,397
About marriage and having kids.

306
00:13:47,397 --> 00:13:48,298
Even about having kids?

307
00:13:48,298 --> 00:13:50,533
- That's really deep.
- I didn't bring it up first.

308
00:13:50,533 --> 00:13:52,235
Her mother said...

309
00:13:52,235 --> 00:13:55,138
she'd have her get married
as soon as tomorrow if it worked out.

310
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,639
Eun Na Rae's mom is like that.

311
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,507
Really?

312
00:13:57,507 --> 00:13:58,675
She said that yesterday.

313
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:00,443
- She was really proactive.
- Was she?

314
00:14:01,077 --> 00:14:03,813
If my daughter would just get married,
what couldn't I do?

315
00:14:03,813 --> 00:14:06,516
If they gave me a poisoned drink,
I'd even drink it.

316
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:08,484
I'm that eager.

317
00:14:08,484 --> 00:14:11,554
If they gave me a poisoned drink,
I'd drink it.

318
00:14:11,955 --> 00:14:16,726
She said she'd even drink a poisoned drink
if she had to.

319
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,361
She won't.

320
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,195
She'd even drink a poisoned drink.

321
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:21,164
What if his girlfriend said
they'd get married right away?

322
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:23,700
That depends on whether
Han Gyeol is ready.

323
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,235
What if Han Gyeol says he wants that too?

324
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,202
He wants that too?

325
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:29,005
My goodness.

326
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:31,808
But he should meet a few more...

327
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:32,876
You want me to meet other people too?

328
00:14:32,876 --> 00:14:35,011
It feels a bit much
to lock in after just two days.

329
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:36,412
- Exactly.
- That's how it feels.

330
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:37,647
So you didn't leave?

331
00:14:37,647 --> 00:14:39,549
Three came, and two...

332
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:41,985
Today is the self-introduction day.

333
00:14:42,285 --> 00:14:44,187
Right, introductions.

334
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:45,488
- Self-introductions.
- Self-introductions.

335
00:14:45,488 --> 00:14:47,223
- Finally.
- Introductions, finally.

336
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:48,491
They really need that.

337
00:14:48,491 --> 00:14:51,127
That changes everything.

338
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:52,395
I'm nervous.

339
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:56,566
Making me do this at this age...

340
00:14:57,934 --> 00:14:58,835
Goodness.

341
00:14:59,469 --> 00:15:04,340
I guess the moms
are introducing their sons and daughters.

342
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:07,210
- Mom.
- Yeah?

343
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,578
Take this.

344
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:10,079
Okay.

345
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,748
You have to take it 30 minutes before,
so take it now.

346
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:13,016
A calming pill.

347
00:15:13,016 --> 00:15:14,551
She must be really nervous.

348
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:17,086
The mothers must want to do so well.

349
00:15:17,086 --> 00:15:18,855
Because they're introducing
their own kids.

350
00:15:19,822 --> 00:15:23,493
(What changes
will the mothers' introductions bring?)

351
00:15:23,893 --> 00:15:25,895
(Ages and jobs are revealed now.)

352
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,030
What do we do now?

353
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,531
I'm nervous.

354
00:15:32,135 --> 00:15:35,071
Only the men will be introduced today.

355
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,707
(Only the men will introduce themselves.)

356
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:38,808
Only the men.

357
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:40,109
My goodness.

358
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:41,377
Only the men today?

359
00:15:41,377 --> 00:15:43,112
But I'm so curious.

360
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:45,949
- Why did you set it up like this?
- I'm curious.

361
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:47,016
You can't do this.

362
00:15:47,016 --> 00:15:48,518
Yeah.

363
00:15:48,518 --> 00:15:50,453
I really hate this kind of thing.

364
00:15:50,453 --> 00:15:52,155
I'm so curious.

365
00:15:52,622 --> 00:15:54,857
We'll go in order, starting with Hyun Jun.

366
00:15:54,857 --> 00:15:58,895
(The first is Kim Hyun Jun.)

367
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,099
Hyun Jun...

368
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,070
is a son who made
every day we spent together happy.

369
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,004
How sweet.

370
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:13,109
Even when he was in my womb, it felt like
prenatal bonding just happened naturally.

371
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:14,744
It was peaceful and joyful.

372
00:16:15,511 --> 00:16:16,446
Should I read it again?

373
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:17,680
Why are you crying?

374
00:16:22,552 --> 00:16:25,488
As he grew up,
he was pure joy the whole time to me.

375
00:16:27,423 --> 00:16:29,125
Please hand me some tissues.

376
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:31,461
Look at her.

377
00:16:31,461 --> 00:16:32,929
This is flustering.

378
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:36,432
(Emotions well up from the start.)

379
00:16:36,866 --> 00:16:38,501
Mom, this is getting weird.

380
00:16:40,069 --> 00:16:41,838
This is just so touching.

381
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:45,642
What's wrong?

382
00:16:46,576 --> 00:16:49,312
This feels like a dream.

383
00:16:49,312 --> 00:16:50,246
Why are you like this?

384
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:52,482
Hold on a moment.

385
00:16:52,482 --> 00:16:54,017
For her,

386
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,885
it may feel...

387
00:16:55,885 --> 00:16:58,388
like sending her son off.
That could be why.

388
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:00,156
That's probably why.

389
00:17:00,156 --> 00:17:01,157
Poor her.

390
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:06,029
(Composing herself,
the introductions resume.)

391
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:09,966
Hyun Jun was born in 1991
and is 35 years old this year.

392
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:14,070
He works on the Management Support Team
at Company "D."

393
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,972
It's his ninth year now.

394
00:17:17,173 --> 00:17:19,275
An insurance adjuster.

395
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,645
(Hyun Jun works as an insurance adjuster,
and is now in his 9th year.)

396
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:24,581
To brag a little,

397
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:27,183
the apartment he currently lives in
in Guro-gu...

398
00:17:27,183 --> 00:17:28,918
is his own.

399
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:31,754
A homeowner.

400
00:17:31,754 --> 00:17:33,489
It's a small apartment,

401
00:17:33,489 --> 00:17:36,025
but he's managed to have
both his own home and his own car,

402
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,795
so he's financially very stable.

403
00:17:38,795 --> 00:17:42,298
Hyun Jun likes women who are fair-skinned,
cute, and humorous,

404
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:46,169
as well as independent
and dedicated to her work.

405
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,573
I hope he meets a wonderful person...

406
00:17:50,573 --> 00:17:52,442
with whom he can build a happy future.

407
00:17:52,942 --> 00:17:53,910
Thank you.

408
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,879
That's really touching.

409
00:17:56,946 --> 00:17:59,649
May I ask when you bought the house?

410
00:17:59,649 --> 00:18:00,683
I'm curious too.

411
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,685
- It's natural to be curious.
- Five years ago.

412
00:18:02,886 --> 00:18:04,988
That's impressive.

413
00:18:04,988 --> 00:18:06,222
So admirable.

414
00:18:06,222 --> 00:18:07,257
That's amazing.

415
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:10,793
Your mother is crying even as she speaks.

416
00:18:10,793 --> 00:18:12,562
Will it be okay to get married?

417
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,732
So I'm kind of regretting.

418
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,170
She looks like she's about to cry again.

419
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:23,606
She looks like she's about to cry again.

420
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:24,841
Why don't you turn around and head out?

421
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:28,511
This is driving me crazy.

422
00:18:29,245 --> 00:18:30,413
Why are you crying?

423
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:32,582
This is my biggest flaw.

424
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:35,518
That was witty.

425
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:42,592
(Hyun Jun's mother's eyes well up again.)

426
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:44,861
When I was ill,

427
00:18:48,064 --> 00:18:49,432
Hyun Jun took care of me.

428
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,368
I was diagnosed with stage-four cancer.

429
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:56,606
I was close to dying.

430
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:01,277
He came and took care of everything,
even my basic needs.

431
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:05,348
He always supported me,

432
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:06,716
and kept making me laugh.

433
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,919
I can live a healthy life like this now,

434
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,590
all thanks to Hyun Jun.

435
00:19:14,057 --> 00:19:17,160
I always keep that in my heart.

436
00:19:18,328 --> 00:19:19,696
(A son so precious
that just being together brings tears)

437
00:19:19,696 --> 00:19:21,097
That's truly a relief.

438
00:19:21,097 --> 00:19:22,332
There was a reason she was like that.

439
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,601
Mom, why are you crying?

440
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:25,835
I'm just so happy.

441
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:29,973
But you'll still happily let him
get married, right?

442
00:19:29,973 --> 00:19:30,907
Of course.

443
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:33,877
You have to.

444
00:19:34,978 --> 00:19:36,512
I should send him off soon.

445
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:39,449
In my heart, I've already sent him off.

446
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,650
It doesn't look like she can let him go.

447
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:46,723
(Next up is Jang Min Cheol.)

448
00:19:46,723 --> 00:19:49,058
Hello, I'm Jang Min Cheol's mother.

449
00:19:51,327 --> 00:19:55,865
My son Min Cheol was born in 1991
and is 35 years old this year.

450
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:58,067
- Born in 1991?
- Yes.

451
00:19:58,067 --> 00:20:00,236
He works as a show host.

452
00:20:00,236 --> 00:20:01,671
A show host.

453
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:05,542
A show host?

454
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:06,409
Yeah.

455
00:20:06,776 --> 00:20:07,744
That's unexpected.

456
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:12,081
(A capable freelance show host...)

457
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:16,853
(with both wit and charm)

458
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:19,222
I don't mean to brag,

459
00:20:19,222 --> 00:20:22,191
but throughout elementary, middle,
and high school, he studied diligently,

460
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:25,595
and never missed first place
in the whole school.

461
00:20:25,595 --> 00:20:27,297
As a result of that effort,
he graduated...

462
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:30,266
- from SNU with a degree in Economics.
- Seoul National University.

463
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:32,835
(Graduated from
the Department of Economics at SNU)

464
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:34,571
I see.

465
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,510
Not only academically,
but also in conversation,

466
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,745
he has a remarkable charm.

467
00:20:42,745 --> 00:20:45,415
With just an offhand remark,

468
00:20:45,415 --> 00:20:46,683
even when you're sitting quietly,

469
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:49,852
he can make you chuckle.
He has a great sense of humor.

470
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:51,354
Did you feel that way?

471
00:20:51,354 --> 00:20:52,422
Yes.

472
00:20:53,923 --> 00:20:54,958
She's an MC.

473
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:57,794
But when he actually tries to be funny,
it doesn't always land.

474
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:58,728
What?

475
00:20:58,728 --> 00:21:00,597
It's hard.

476
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:04,367
If he gets married,
I'll be the mother-in-law,

477
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:06,369
but I will never insist
that they come over for holidays.

478
00:21:06,369 --> 00:21:08,371
That somehow sounds scarier.

479
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:10,240
That's bold.

480
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,108
This is actually a huge plus.

481
00:21:13,142 --> 00:21:14,244
She's such a fun mother.

482
00:21:17,113 --> 00:21:19,048
You majored in economics.

483
00:21:19,048 --> 00:21:22,585
So how did you end up
becoming a show host?

484
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:25,622
You know how you sometimes get a feeling
on the first day, first class, right?

485
00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:27,457
"I should take a different path."

486
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:31,628
From then on, I joined
a broadcasting club, worked as a reporter,

487
00:21:31,995 --> 00:21:35,131
and after trying different things,
I became a show host.

488
00:21:35,498 --> 00:21:38,868
When you get paid,
do you give money to your parents?

489
00:21:39,435 --> 00:21:40,570
For now,

490
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:43,740
with global asset markets
and crypto and all that,

491
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:48,411
I need to grow my assets first.

492
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:51,180
So after I build them up a bit more...

493
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,815
I don't need any of that.

494
00:21:52,815 --> 00:21:55,552
Just a small allowance is fine.

495
00:21:55,552 --> 00:21:56,619
I don't expect anything.

496
00:21:56,619 --> 00:21:57,554
Even the allowance,

497
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:00,723
once a year on my birthday is enough.

498
00:22:00,723 --> 00:22:03,726
If he earns it,
he should spend it on himself.

499
00:22:03,726 --> 00:22:04,994
Sounds like his mother is well off.

500
00:22:07,197 --> 00:22:10,600
May I ask how long...

501
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,868
your longest relationship lasted?

502
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:12,902
About three years.

503
00:22:12,902 --> 00:22:13,836
Three years.

504
00:22:13,836 --> 00:22:15,672
But they didn't see each other very often.

505
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:17,907
But they didn't see each other very often.

506
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:24,814
She knows everything.

507
00:22:25,615 --> 00:22:27,217
- I mean...
- Mom?

508
00:22:27,217 --> 00:22:29,852
- To add a bit of context,
- I didn't?

509
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:31,554
As you know, with his kind of job,

510
00:22:31,955 --> 00:22:34,090
there are times he broadcasts until dawn.

511
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:36,359
The schedule is irregular,

512
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,461
so there are even days
I don't get home until 3 a.m.

513
00:22:38,461 --> 00:22:41,431
With things being that irregular...

514
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,665
Is it over?

515
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:45,268
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

516
00:22:47,203 --> 00:22:48,071
Hello.

517
00:22:49,105 --> 00:22:51,074
I'm Seo Han Gyeol's mother.

518
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:54,577
- I'm really curious what he does.
- I'm so curious about Han Gyeol.

519
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,251
He was born in 1995 and is 31 years old.

520
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:03,987
Born in 1995 and is 31 years old.

521
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:06,489
He's a lawyer.

522
00:23:06,489 --> 00:23:10,026
(He is a lawyer.)

523
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:12,161
- See? I knew it.
- Right, I figured.

524
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,263
- A licensed professional.
- Exactly.

525
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,067
He works at a law firm in Gangnam,

526
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:20,370
on the Real Estate Finance Team,

527
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,140
mainly handling civil and criminal cases
for corporate clients.

528
00:23:26,476 --> 00:23:27,310
Nice.

529
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:30,046
His salary is quite high,

530
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:33,383
and he manages his assets well,

531
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:35,118
so he says he's been steadily
preparing funds...

532
00:23:35,652 --> 00:23:38,221
for marriage.

533
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:41,224
Let me brag a little.

534
00:23:41,224 --> 00:23:42,659
At Sungkyunkwan University,

535
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,796
he graduated top of his class,

536
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:49,499
receiving scholarships all four years.

537
00:23:50,099 --> 00:23:52,669
He's a devoted son
who eased his parents' burden.

538
00:23:54,637 --> 00:23:57,307
But Han Gyeol's true charm...

539
00:23:57,307 --> 00:23:58,341
is his warmth.

540
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:01,644
He often writes letters to me.

541
00:24:05,181 --> 00:24:10,053
People rarely write handwritten letters
that long to their mothers.

542
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,221
(The handwritten letters Han Gyeol wrote
to his mother)

543
00:24:11,221 --> 00:24:13,790
To love one person deeply is...

544
00:24:14,757 --> 00:24:18,194
in a way,
to finally embrace the whole world.

545
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:20,230
This line comes to mind.

546
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,368
I hope this camp...

547
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:27,770
becomes a precious time
to gain such a meaningful connection.

548
00:24:30,273 --> 00:24:31,407
That was beautiful.

549
00:24:32,675 --> 00:24:37,447
If you only focused on studying,
did you have any dating experience?

550
00:24:37,447 --> 00:24:39,749
He didn't only study.

551
00:24:42,085 --> 00:24:43,086
That was a misunderstanding.

552
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,191
I think dating
actually helped me study better.

553
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:52,195
If two people are compatible,

554
00:24:52,195 --> 00:24:55,498
I believe even dating for about a year
can be enough to get married.

555
00:24:57,133 --> 00:25:02,338
Does your partner need
a certain level of financial stability?

556
00:25:02,338 --> 00:25:04,941
The mothers' questions are pouring in.

557
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:06,676
Rather than income or assets,

558
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:09,712
I think personality and tendency
matter more.

559
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:10,680
But...

560
00:25:10,914 --> 00:25:16,486
I do prefer someone
with a regular work schedule.

561
00:25:16,486 --> 00:25:17,954
A regular routine.

562
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:25,328
How much of an age gap
do you think is ideally appropriate?

563
00:25:25,328 --> 00:25:26,829
About five years.

564
00:25:27,564 --> 00:25:28,765
Five years?

565
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:29,799
Around that.

566
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,701
Why? Is that too much?

567
00:25:33,036 --> 00:25:34,804
About five years, I think.

568
00:25:34,804 --> 00:25:38,441
I'm not sure, but within that range...

569
00:25:38,441 --> 00:25:40,843
About five years younger
or five years older.

570
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:44,480
If I like the person,

571
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,649
I don't think age matters that much.

572
00:25:46,916 --> 00:25:48,418
His mother might disagree.

573
00:25:49,953 --> 00:25:50,887
Thank you.

574
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,658
- Now, Seung Hak.
- I was curious about him too.

575
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:57,994
What does he do?

576
00:25:57,994 --> 00:26:00,063
He feels like an athlete.

577
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:01,898
I'm nervous.

578
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:04,534
She's cute.

579
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:08,271
I'll introduce my son.

580
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,406
He was born in 1993...

581
00:26:10,406 --> 00:26:12,075
No, 1997.

582
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,109
He's 29 years old.

583
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,911
He's young.

584
00:26:14,911 --> 00:26:16,212
He's the youngest.

585
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:19,916
Twenty-nine. This is driving me crazy.

586
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:20,950
So young.

587
00:26:21,985 --> 00:26:24,287
It looks like the women might be older.

588
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:28,124
- Those expressions don't look great.
- Dear.

589
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:30,793
How old is Eun Na Rae?

590
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:33,563
- Why does she look so unhappy?
- Exactly.

591
00:26:33,563 --> 00:26:35,665
But she looks young.

592
00:26:35,965 --> 00:26:39,435
He loved sports so much
from a young age...

593
00:26:39,435 --> 00:26:41,804
that he ended up
choosing golf as his career.

594
00:26:41,804 --> 00:26:43,006
- A golfer.
- I knew it.

595
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:45,608
- Really?
- Goodness.

596
00:26:45,875 --> 00:26:49,412
He's a KPGA professional golfer,

597
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:52,615
and he also teaches golf lessons.

598
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:55,852
It seems he's confidently walking
his own path.

599
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:58,555
You want to feel
like you're really committing to the left.

600
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:00,089
That's impressive.

601
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,525
The kind of partner my son wants is...

602
00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:04,160
Well...

603
00:27:05,361 --> 00:27:07,864
It seems he puts
a lot of importance on looks.

604
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:08,698
Pardon?

605
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:13,203
- Because he's still young.
- Yes.

606
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:17,840
A small face, big eyes, and a slim build.

607
00:27:21,377 --> 00:27:22,312
That's very specific.

608
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:23,913
- What?
- Very specific.

609
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:26,583
(There's more.)

610
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:27,517
And...

611
00:27:28,117 --> 00:27:32,021
someone calm and financially sensible.

612
00:27:32,655 --> 00:27:34,357
That kind of woman would be good.

613
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:38,127
The kind of person I want
as his partner...

614
00:27:38,127 --> 00:27:40,196
is someone who takes
good care of him by his side...

615
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,999
and shares the same hobbies.

616
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:46,669
A partner who can work things out
through sports together.

617
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:48,304
So she'd have to play golf.

618
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:52,041
Because he wants to become a young dad,

619
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:58,414
he came here hoping to form
a connection with a good person here.

620
00:28:01,084 --> 00:28:04,220
You're a KPGA professional golfer.

621
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:07,557
So you must spend a lot of days as well.

622
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:09,192
How often are you away?

623
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,694
I've stopped competing as a player now...

624
00:28:12,028 --> 00:28:13,763
after earning my pro license.

625
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:16,199
I've been focusing on giving lessons.

626
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,001
Does your mother hope...

627
00:28:18,902 --> 00:28:22,839
your partner would focus on supporting you
rather than pursuing her own work?

628
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,507
I think...

629
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,911
I'd tell my partner to do
whatever she wants.

630
00:28:28,478 --> 00:28:30,680
But after coming here
and hearing my mother,

631
00:28:31,247 --> 00:28:35,084
it seems she hopes my partner...

632
00:28:35,084 --> 00:28:38,187
would support me behind the scenes.

633
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:40,557
That she'd take on
more of a supporting role.

634
00:28:40,557 --> 00:28:41,724
So you two haven't
really agreed on that yet.

635
00:28:42,225 --> 00:28:44,093
Supporting from behind? That's not easy.

636
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:49,299
Personally, I'd be fine
whether we work together...

637
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,868
or she supports me, either way.

638
00:28:56,506 --> 00:28:57,473
It's a bit unclear.

639
00:28:57,473 --> 00:28:58,608
It's unclear.

640
00:28:58,608 --> 00:29:01,444
I think that could feel like a burden
to some of the women.

641
00:29:01,444 --> 00:29:03,813
It could be taken somewhat negatively.

642
00:29:04,214 --> 00:29:05,148
Yes.

643
00:29:05,682 --> 00:29:07,150
It feels like
there should be more questions.

644
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,153
Feels like there should be,
but there aren't.

645
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,821
No.

646
00:29:13,623 --> 00:29:15,391
Just slowly read what's there.

647
00:29:15,391 --> 00:29:17,660
(The last one up is Moon Se Hoon.)

648
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:21,531
Hello, I'm Moon Se Hoon's mother.

649
00:29:21,531 --> 00:29:26,069
Se Hoon was born in 1995
and is 31 years old.

650
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:30,240
Everyone is so young. This is a problem.

651
00:29:30,473 --> 00:29:32,008
What now?

652
00:29:32,008 --> 00:29:35,845
How old is Cho Eun Na Rae?

653
00:29:35,845 --> 00:29:37,614
- I'm curious.
- How old is she?

654
00:29:37,614 --> 00:29:40,950
There are two who are 35,
two who are 31, and one who is 29.

655
00:29:41,751 --> 00:29:43,953
If she says everyone's too young...

656
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:44,888
Is she in her mid-30s?

657
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,055
Late 30s, maybe.

658
00:29:46,055 --> 00:29:49,893
But she doesn't really look that old.

659
00:29:50,426 --> 00:29:52,328
My son isn't someone...

660
00:29:52,328 --> 00:29:54,564
who graduated
from a universally famous university...

661
00:29:54,564 --> 00:29:56,165
or works steadily...

662
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:58,501
at a large corporation.

663
00:30:00,637 --> 00:30:04,207
Instead, he currently runs...

664
00:30:04,207 --> 00:30:06,609
a small company
in the food service industry.

665
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:07,544
He's the CEO of a food service company.

666
00:30:07,544 --> 00:30:08,611
He's a CEO.

667
00:30:08,611 --> 00:30:09,479
I see.

668
00:30:10,313 --> 00:30:11,281
A CEO.

669
00:30:11,948 --> 00:30:15,985
He started from a small street food stall
in a back alley in Sinsa-dong,

670
00:30:15,985 --> 00:30:17,887
and now runs restaurants
in Apgujeong, Cheongdam,

671
00:30:17,887 --> 00:30:21,724
Seongsu, and Byeollae.

672
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:24,427
No wonder he seemed extraordinary.

673
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:25,595
That explains it.

674
00:30:26,529 --> 00:30:30,466
Recently, he even opened
a barbecue restaurant in Taiwan,

675
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,202
and centered around his restaurants,
he's also involved...

676
00:30:32,202 --> 00:30:36,739
in a flower shop, traditional liquor,
and kimchi-related distribution business.

677
00:30:36,739 --> 00:30:38,474
He must be very smart.

678
00:30:38,474 --> 00:30:39,709
He's a businessman.

679
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:40,877
He really makes moves.

680
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,979
The mothers are viewing him
very favorably.

681
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:45,915
The type of partner my son wants is this.

682
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:49,352
Since he operates multiple locations,

683
00:30:49,352 --> 00:30:51,955
he travels overseas fairly often.

684
00:30:52,889 --> 00:30:57,660
So he thinks it would be easier
to coordinate schedules...

685
00:30:57,961 --> 00:31:01,798
if his partner has
a regular daily routine.

686
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:06,769
As much as my son wants to get married,

687
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:09,639
I sincerely hope he meets
a precious connection...

688
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:14,777
with whom he can share his life
and build a happy relationship.

689
00:31:14,777 --> 00:31:15,712
Thank you.

690
00:31:18,047 --> 00:31:22,719
It seems you're continuing
to expand your business aggressively.

691
00:31:22,719 --> 00:31:28,057
Is it moving
in a consistently profitable direction?

692
00:31:28,057 --> 00:31:31,661
It's not an extremely steep upward curve
at the moment,

693
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:34,597
but it does seem to be trending upward.

694
00:31:35,665 --> 00:31:38,401
Among people my age in this industry,

695
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,904
I don't think I've seen anyone
doing better than me.

696
00:31:40,904 --> 00:31:42,205
Right, at 31 years old.

697
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:43,439
Exactly. That's impressive.

698
00:31:43,439 --> 00:31:44,974
He's confident.

699
00:31:45,742 --> 00:31:46,843
Impressive.

700
00:31:47,176 --> 00:31:48,111
Impressive.

701
00:31:49,145 --> 00:31:50,513
What about the age gap?

702
00:31:50,513 --> 00:31:53,316
Eun Na Rae's mother keeps asking
about age gaps.

703
00:31:53,316 --> 00:31:56,819
For me, maybe ten years.

704
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,222
Older is fine, but not younger.

705
00:31:59,722 --> 00:32:01,658
Older is fine, but not younger.

706
00:32:02,158 --> 00:32:03,526
I tend to prefer someone older
rather than younger.

707
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:04,928
Really?

708
00:32:05,361 --> 00:32:06,663
She's relieved.

709
00:32:07,096 --> 00:32:09,065
I also prefer someone older.

710
00:32:11,568 --> 00:32:14,671
I hope it's someone who can give my son...

711
00:32:14,671 --> 00:32:17,473
warmth and comfort.

712
00:32:18,041 --> 00:32:21,144
That's why I always talk
about someone older.

713
00:32:21,844 --> 00:32:24,080
Then, in your actual dating experience,

714
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,650
have you mostly dated older women?

715
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,953
I think I've dated older women more often.

716
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:33,356
You say you've dated
older women a lot, so...

717
00:32:33,356 --> 00:32:35,692
It wasn't actually that many.

718
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:38,027
Not that many, no.

719
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:41,631
Then among the charms of a younger man,
what would be your charm?

720
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:43,633
Of course, I do have a cute side.

721
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:44,634
But naturally,

722
00:32:44,634 --> 00:32:48,371
I think I connected better
with older women.

723
00:32:50,273 --> 00:32:52,175
But there's something important here.

724
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,176
Definitely,

725
00:32:53,409 --> 00:32:54,811
popular guys tend to get...

726
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:56,679
- a lot of questions.
- Right.

727
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:58,781
I told you. There are a lot of questions.

728
00:32:58,781 --> 00:33:00,950
He's extremely popular right now.

729
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:03,920
And earlier,
the mothers asked the most questions...

730
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,188
to Han Gyeol.

731
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:07,891
Being a lawyer, after all...

732
00:33:07,891 --> 00:33:10,326
It's a stable profession.

733
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:17,567
(Right after the introductions of the men,
the date selection begins.)

734
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:21,170
For today's date selection,
the women's mothers will decide.

735
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,171
The mothers?

736
00:33:22,739 --> 00:33:24,607
The mothers are choosing.

737
00:33:24,607 --> 00:33:25,708
This is so fun.

738
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:27,911
- This is really fun.
- Yes.

739
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:31,981
What do I do?

740
00:33:35,552 --> 00:33:37,320
Why is marrying you off so hard?

741
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,588
No one else looks stressed.
Why are you the only one?

742
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:40,123
I'm stressed.

743
00:33:41,024 --> 00:33:43,993
For this date,
regardless of the daughters' wishes,

744
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:47,730
the choice will be made
entirely by the mothers.

745
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,765
You can't even discuss it?

746
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:50,300
Mothers and daughters...

747
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,569
are not allowed to consult each other.

748
00:33:53,536 --> 00:33:55,438
Honestly,

749
00:33:55,438 --> 00:33:57,607
parents get very involved in marriage.

750
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:58,741
Right, because it's marriage.

751
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:00,610
- No matter how times change.
- Right.

752
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,312
First, they're told
who their mothers chose,

753
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:06,049
and they get to know
the person more afterward.

754
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:07,383
It's a new concept.

755
00:34:07,383 --> 00:34:09,452
This really feels like the fun element.

756
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:14,390
(When a woman's mother chooses
a man she likes,)

757
00:34:14,691 --> 00:34:17,560
(and places her daughter next to him,
the choice is complete.)

758
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,028
Really? Goodness.

759
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:21,631
So the ladies will come
regardless of their wishes.

760
00:34:21,631 --> 00:34:22,632
Yeah.

761
00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:25,101
What if she says, "Mom, I don't like him?"

762
00:34:25,101 --> 00:34:26,803
The atmosphere has completely changed now.

763
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:29,572
Before and after knowing
what kind of work they do,

764
00:34:29,572 --> 00:34:32,108
- it's completely different.
- Totally different.

765
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:34,477
I don't think my son will be chosen.

766
00:34:34,477 --> 00:34:35,879
Don't say that.

767
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:37,513
I think Se Hoon will be chosen.

768
00:34:37,881 --> 00:34:39,182
Why do you say that?

769
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:40,116
He's capable.

770
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:46,890
(First, Kim Tae In and her mother)

771
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:48,291
Who will she make Tae In go to?

772
00:34:50,894 --> 00:34:54,430
(The date is decided
solely by the mother's choice.)

773
00:34:54,964 --> 00:34:58,935
(Who will be the man
to go on a date with Tae In?)

774
00:34:58,935 --> 00:35:01,371
Honestly, none of the men fall short.

775
00:35:01,371 --> 00:35:04,340
That's true.
They all have their own appeal.

776
00:35:05,375 --> 00:35:09,178
I've been watching Hyun Jun closely,

777
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:11,281
but Tae In...

778
00:35:11,281 --> 00:35:15,785
really likes Moon Se Hoon.

779
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:20,023
Se Hoon seems good.
When I talked to him yesterday,

780
00:35:20,023 --> 00:35:21,991
- he seemed really decent.
- I see.

781
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:28,331
(Mother and daughter want
different dates.)

782
00:35:28,331 --> 00:35:32,202
(Mother's pick, Kim Hyun Jun,
Daughter's pick, Moon Se Hoon)

783
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:36,039
Will the mother choose her own pick,

784
00:35:36,372 --> 00:35:38,508
- or her daughter's pick?
- I'm curious.

785
00:35:38,508 --> 00:35:41,177
(Who will Tae In's mother pick?)

786
00:35:44,881 --> 00:35:45,848
She stopped.

787
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:47,116
She stopped.

788
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:48,551
Yes, the mother's pick.

789
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,220
(Kim Tae In's mother
chooses Kim Hyun Jun.)

790
00:35:52,255 --> 00:35:53,656
I thought I was done for.

791
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:56,960
That was almost a disaster.

792
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,095
Because my mom started crying.

793
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,904
It feels like Se Hoon and Tae In
keep missing each other.

794
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:11,107
A stable office worker.

795
00:36:11,107 --> 00:36:12,408
A stable office worker.

796
00:36:12,408 --> 00:36:15,245
Right, the mothers could think that way.

797
00:36:15,645 --> 00:36:17,747
Someone with a steady job...

798
00:36:17,747 --> 00:36:20,583
- See? That's it.
- might be better.

799
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,151
My heart keeps...

800
00:36:23,086 --> 00:36:24,587
leaning in that direction.

801
00:36:28,691 --> 00:36:30,526
She's beautiful.

802
00:36:30,526 --> 00:36:31,661
Right?

803
00:36:31,661 --> 00:36:33,796
She's been pretty since she was young.

804
00:36:33,796 --> 00:36:34,764
She takes after her mom.

805
00:36:34,764 --> 00:36:35,732
(So sweet)

806
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:42,305
(Second, Kim Myo Jin's mother)

807
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:47,210
Seung Hak was
one or two years younger than me.

808
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,481
Since I tend to prefer someone older,
that felt like a drawback.

809
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:54,784
So I found myself thinking
about Se Hoon again.

810
00:36:54,784 --> 00:37:00,089
I thought he might be closer
to my preferred type.

811
00:37:00,657 --> 00:37:03,660
I have two first choices. Is that okay?

812
00:37:03,927 --> 00:37:07,597
Han Gyeol is a licensed professional,

813
00:37:07,597 --> 00:37:09,999
so I thought it'd be good for her
to meet him.

814
00:37:10,533 --> 00:37:12,001
And the other person would be...

815
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:13,203
probably Se Hoon.

816
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:15,872
He's quite handsome,

817
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:21,544
and it seems like he lives his life
in a really admirable way.

818
00:37:22,645 --> 00:37:25,848
So now it comes down
to Han Gyeol or Se Hoon.

819
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:35,592
(Who will Myo Jin's mother choose?)

820
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:49,606
(Kim Myo Jin's mother
chooses Seo Han Gyeol.)

821
00:37:49,606 --> 00:37:50,874
- As expected.
- The lawyer.

822
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:52,575
He got the most questions.

823
00:37:54,043 --> 00:37:54,978
I'll take good care of her.

824
00:37:56,546 --> 00:37:58,147
- Hello.
- Hello.

825
00:38:03,419 --> 00:38:04,921
Thank you for coming.

826
00:38:05,455 --> 00:38:06,522
I was nervous.

827
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,860
As expected, since he's a lawyer.

828
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,265
You can't ignore the profession.
That's what I thought.

829
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:16,566
It can't be helped.

830
00:38:16,566 --> 00:38:17,433
Right.

831
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:19,068
Mothers are...

832
00:38:19,068 --> 00:38:19,969
like that. I see.

833
00:38:21,204 --> 00:38:22,872
I guess...

834
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,608
you're my mom's...

835
00:38:25,608 --> 00:38:28,611
- preferred ideal type, Han Gyeol.
- Really? Thank you.

836
00:38:28,611 --> 00:38:30,747
That must be why she brought me here.

837
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:33,049
It's an honor.

838
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,052
(Se Hoon loses out again to
Myo Jin's mother, after Tae In's mother.)

839
00:38:36,052 --> 00:38:37,987
He's losing to the mothers.

840
00:38:38,621 --> 00:38:40,223
He wins with the actual daughters,

841
00:38:40,223 --> 00:38:42,725
but he loses with the mothers.

842
00:38:45,228 --> 00:38:46,162
Who is it?

843
00:38:46,596 --> 00:38:48,498
- Eun Na Rae.
- It's Eun Na Rae.

844
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:52,802
(Third, Cho Eun Na Rae's mother)

845
00:38:54,771 --> 00:38:56,472
After hearing the introductions today,

846
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:59,042
I think I've grown more interested
in Min Cheol.

847
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:00,276
She got interested in Min Cheol.

848
00:39:00,276 --> 00:39:02,178
I mean, he's that handsome,

849
00:39:02,178 --> 00:39:03,413
and he graduated
from Seoul National University?

850
00:39:04,347 --> 00:39:07,517
I started wondering,
"What kind of life has he lived?"

851
00:39:08,618 --> 00:39:12,055
(Who will Eun Na Rae's mother choose?)

852
00:39:12,288 --> 00:39:15,391
(Will she read her daughter's heart
and go to Jang Min Cheol?)

853
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:19,796
(Or Seo Han Gyeol,
her top pick from the start?)

854
00:39:20,196 --> 00:39:21,931
All right, let's go.

855
00:39:22,131 --> 00:39:24,334
(Pulling)

856
00:39:27,203 --> 00:39:29,939
(She passes Eun Na Rae's pick, Min Cheol.)

857
00:39:29,939 --> 00:39:31,841
- That's too bad.
- She passed him.

858
00:39:33,776 --> 00:39:37,447
(She's getting closer to the end.)

859
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,616
Is she going to Se Hoon?

860
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,091
(She placed her daughter.)

861
00:39:48,091 --> 00:39:49,058
Thank you.

862
00:39:49,058 --> 00:39:50,093
(Cho Eun Na Rae's mother
chooses Seo Han Gyeol.)

863
00:39:50,093 --> 00:39:51,127
What?

864
00:39:51,628 --> 00:39:52,829
What?

865
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:54,964
My goodness.

866
00:39:54,964 --> 00:39:56,332
She went to the lawyer.

867
00:39:56,332 --> 00:39:59,435
She went to Attorney Seo Han Gyeol?

868
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:01,070
As expected.

869
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,038
(The lawyer...)

870
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:04,107
Thank you, ma'am.

871
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:07,210
(After giving a firm push, she exits.)

872
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,411
Well,

873
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:10,580
- we meet again.
- Thank you for coming.

874
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:16,185
It's completely about the job.

875
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:17,487
Attorney Seo.

876
00:40:19,656 --> 00:40:21,157
Nice to meet you. Thank you for coming.

877
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:22,125
So,

878
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:25,328
you created a rivalry.

879
00:40:25,962 --> 00:40:27,931
"You created a rivalry."

880
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:32,035
Of course,
mothers love licensed professions.

881
00:40:32,035 --> 00:40:34,070
But it's not just about the job.

882
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:36,206
He doesn't seem
like someone who's sweet to everyone,

883
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,842
but someone who's kind
only to his own people.

884
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:43,413
(Three men left standing alone)

885
00:40:43,413 --> 00:40:45,114
(Jang Min Cheol has 0 votes.)

886
00:40:45,114 --> 00:40:46,082
(Lee Seung Hak has 0 votes.)

887
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:47,217
No.

888
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:48,184
(Moon Se Hoon has 0 votes.)

889
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:49,419
This is so...

890
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,424
(The mothers grow anxious too.)

891
00:40:56,459 --> 00:40:57,894
(Fourth, Kim Jin Joo's mother)

892
00:40:57,894 --> 00:41:00,864
She's popular too.

893
00:41:00,864 --> 00:41:04,267
The popular girl, Jin Joo.

894
00:41:04,267 --> 00:41:07,804
Jin Joo got along well
with Min Cheol, right?

895
00:41:07,804 --> 00:41:10,907
The person I'd like to choose
for my date is...

896
00:41:10,907 --> 00:41:12,275
Jang Min Cheol.

897
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:16,012
His looks are my type.

898
00:41:16,012 --> 00:41:18,047
So I don't think my top pick has changed.

899
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:21,217
I'll choose someone...

900
00:41:21,217 --> 00:41:22,886
among the people
she hasn't really talked to yet.

901
00:41:23,286 --> 00:41:24,821
- No.
- Again.

902
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:26,689
So Number 5 Se Hoon,

903
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:28,992
Number Three Han Gyeol,

904
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:30,793
and Number Four Seung Hak.

905
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,395
Among them.

906
00:41:33,196 --> 00:41:37,100
I guess her mother is thinking,

907
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,601
"She should talk
to someone different too."

908
00:41:38,601 --> 00:41:41,704
(Who will Kim Jin Joo's mother choose?)

909
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:46,543
She passed him.

910
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,144
She passed Min Cheol.

911
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:49,746
What now?

912
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:54,817
If she goes to the lawyer,
this is crazy.

913
00:41:56,386 --> 00:41:58,888
(Moving farther and farther
toward the end)

914
00:41:59,923 --> 00:42:04,060
(She passes Attorney Seo Han Gyeol.)

915
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:05,762
(Turn)

916
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:10,900
(Kim Jin Joo's mother
chooses Seo Han Gyeol.)

917
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:11,834
Hello.

918
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,369
My gosh.

919
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:14,637
I told you.

920
00:42:14,637 --> 00:42:16,172
This is literally the same situation...

921
00:42:17,307 --> 00:42:21,678
as the first-impression round.

922
00:42:21,678 --> 00:42:24,747
- Mothers, what are you doing?
- My gosh.

923
00:42:24,747 --> 00:42:27,383
The moment "lawyer" was revealed
as his job,

924
00:42:27,383 --> 00:42:30,386
the mothers all lined
their daughters up over there.

925
00:42:31,354 --> 00:42:32,555
This is insane.

926
00:42:33,356 --> 00:42:34,557
Really.

927
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:36,459
Hello.

928
00:42:36,459 --> 00:42:37,727
(Women's mothers' picks,
Seo Han Gyeol with 3 votes)

929
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:39,762
- What is happening?
- Thank you, ma'am.

930
00:42:42,465 --> 00:42:45,935
I was honestly surprised
there was a lawyer here.

931
00:42:45,935 --> 00:42:49,305
Someone with a stable job
and strong capability.

932
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:51,140
My heart naturally leans that way.

933
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:56,279
(A full three mothers' picks)

934
00:42:57,647 --> 00:42:58,781
My goodness.

935
00:42:58,781 --> 00:43:00,416
Did I introduce him too well?

936
00:43:00,416 --> 00:43:03,019
- I guess so.
- Did I do too well?

937
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:05,955
I truly never expected that.
I was shocked.

938
00:43:05,955 --> 00:43:07,090
It's more than I deserve.

939
00:43:08,124 --> 00:43:10,460
My number-one interest
was actually Myo Jin.

940
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:14,497
And then,
I mentioned Eun Na Rae and Jin Joo.

941
00:43:14,497 --> 00:43:16,533
And all of them were here.

942
00:43:17,467 --> 00:43:18,401
Must be nice.

943
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:20,570
I'm really jealous.

944
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:23,540
It would've been even better
if these were the daughters' picks.

945
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:25,508
So...

946
00:43:25,508 --> 00:43:27,710
more than winning the daughters' hearts,

947
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,646
- You won the mothers' hearts.
- The mothers' hearts.

948
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:32,982
(A man mothers find attractive,
Seo Han Gyeol)

949
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:34,984
This show is cruel.

950
00:43:34,984 --> 00:43:36,753
It really is.

951
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:38,821
This hurts.

952
00:43:40,924 --> 00:43:42,692
Now, it's the last one.

953
00:43:43,593 --> 00:43:48,264
(Will we get a new one-on-one date?)

954
00:43:48,765 --> 00:43:51,968
(Or will it be Seo Han Gyeol again?)

955
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:56,606
(Last, Kim Hyun Jin's mother)

956
00:43:57,941 --> 00:44:00,143
That spot has surprisingly many people.

957
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,678
That's unexpected.

958
00:44:03,012 --> 00:44:04,647
Three women have gathered there?

959
00:44:05,381 --> 00:44:08,885
I think Hyun Jin's mother
might go to the lawyer too.

960
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:09,886
No way.

961
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:11,955
No way.

962
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:13,356
That meaningful smile.

963
00:44:14,424 --> 00:44:18,861
Se Hoon seems calm,

964
00:44:18,861 --> 00:44:21,965
and he seems to have depth.

965
00:44:21,965 --> 00:44:24,267
He also seems very responsible.

966
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:27,103
I'd also like my daughter
to date Min Cheol.

967
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,706
He speaks well
and has a good sense of humor.

968
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,544
(Jang Min Cheol? Moon Se Hoon?)

969
00:44:34,777 --> 00:44:35,645
Who will it be?

970
00:44:35,912 --> 00:44:42,085
(Who will Kim Hyun Jin's mother choose?)

971
00:44:43,052 --> 00:44:45,622
What does that smile mean?

972
00:44:49,259 --> 00:44:50,226
Me?

973
00:44:51,461 --> 00:44:52,295
Welcome.

974
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:53,396
(Kim Hyun Jin's mother
chooses Jang Min Cheol.)

975
00:44:53,396 --> 00:44:55,965
- Thank goodness.
- She went to Min Cheol.

976
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:57,166
Thank goodness.

977
00:44:57,934 --> 00:45:02,138
Those two haven't talked much
to each other so far.

978
00:45:02,872 --> 00:45:04,974
He's not eliminated.

979
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:06,910
Come this way, please.

980
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:07,877
Right.

981
00:45:09,412 --> 00:45:10,280
I'm sorry.

982
00:45:12,582 --> 00:45:14,450
Thank you.

983
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,251
I mean,

984
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:18,688
I wanted her to talk
with different people.

985
00:45:18,688 --> 00:45:20,023
Yes, that's right.

986
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:23,560
I liked it.

987
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,097
The fact that he graduated
from SNU was so unexpected.

988
00:45:28,097 --> 00:45:33,937
That became a key point for me
because I thought,

989
00:45:33,937 --> 00:45:35,271
"He must've lived his school years
very diligently."

990
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:39,142
(The women's mothers' selections
are complete.)

991
00:45:39,576 --> 00:45:40,743
(The two men who weren't chosen)

992
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:43,346
Those two got zero votes.

993
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:50,753
Looks like Seung Hak and Se Hoon
will be making dinner today.

994
00:45:52,121 --> 00:45:54,757
The mothers must be so upset.

995
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:57,994
Seeing him standing there alone
was heartbreaking.

996
00:45:58,661 --> 00:45:59,729
My Seung Hak.

997
00:46:00,897 --> 00:46:03,199
His expression didn't look great,

998
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:05,435
but he was trying not to show it.

999
00:46:06,336 --> 00:46:07,871
I wasn't feeling good.

1000
00:46:08,771 --> 00:46:12,475
It seems they leaned toward men...

1001
00:46:13,409 --> 00:46:15,845
with more stable jobs
rather than sports-related careers.

1002
00:46:16,746 --> 00:46:20,650
But seeing Mom look disappointed...

1003
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,185
and visibly upset...

1004
00:46:22,185 --> 00:46:23,119
That's what bothers the son the most.

1005
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,888
I wondered if I'd made a mistake
bringing her here.

1006
00:46:26,723 --> 00:46:30,526
Of course, it hurts.
You can't help but feel disappointed.

1007
00:46:31,427 --> 00:46:33,863
Did I introduce him...

1008
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:36,733
- too poorly?
- See, that's exactly what happens.

1009
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,703
If I put myself in their position,

1010
00:46:40,703 --> 00:46:42,705
if I'd come as a daughter's mom,

1011
00:46:43,506 --> 00:46:47,944
I think I might've chosen
someone with a stable job too.

1012
00:46:49,379 --> 00:46:52,482
"I knew this would happen."

1013
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:56,119
One thing I consider my Achilles' heel...

1014
00:46:56,686 --> 00:46:58,621
is that I didn't get to study more.

1015
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:02,825
I couldn't go on to college,
and my education ended after high school.

1016
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:04,527
Deep down,
I think it would've been nice...

1017
00:47:04,527 --> 00:47:08,698
if I'd graduated from a good university
and had a professional career.

1018
00:47:08,698 --> 00:47:09,832
And...

1019
00:47:09,832 --> 00:47:14,137
I wonder whether my job
and my current situation...

1020
00:47:14,137 --> 00:47:15,605
might not seem good enough...

1021
00:47:15,605 --> 00:47:18,208
as a potential husband.

1022
00:47:19,108 --> 00:47:20,143
That's not true.

1023
00:47:20,143 --> 00:47:23,246
You're working hard right now.

1024
00:47:23,246 --> 00:47:24,414
How sad.

1025
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:29,252
I feel like I caused a big problem.

1026
00:47:30,486 --> 00:47:31,621
Mom, come here for a second.

1027
00:47:31,621 --> 00:47:32,555
Okay.

1028
00:47:32,555 --> 00:47:34,958
"Mom, come here for a second"
sounds scary.

1029
00:47:35,858 --> 00:47:36,926
Things are going to get serious.

1030
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:39,095
Why do you need me?

1031
00:47:39,896 --> 00:47:41,231
Hey, Mom.

1032
00:47:41,231 --> 00:47:42,732
What?

1033
00:47:42,732 --> 00:47:44,300
There was someone else you liked, right?

1034
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,369
Actually, this is fine,

1035
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:48,271
but you have to spend time
with other people too.

1036
00:47:48,271 --> 00:47:50,773
I kept being with Han Gyeol
since yesterday.

1037
00:47:50,773 --> 00:47:52,976
I honestly thought about it a lot.

1038
00:47:52,976 --> 00:47:55,044
But I never imagined
three people would gather there.

1039
00:47:55,044 --> 00:47:56,279
- Same.
- Seriously.

1040
00:47:56,279 --> 00:47:59,249
And someone said,
"Lawyers really have it all."

1041
00:47:59,249 --> 00:48:00,416
Who said that? His mother said that?

1042
00:48:00,416 --> 00:48:02,418
Someone.

1043
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:05,288
Honestly, Seung Hak was fine too,

1044
00:48:05,288 --> 00:48:06,556
but he's just too young.

1045
00:48:07,457 --> 00:48:09,626
Right. Born in 1997.

1046
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,294
Too young.

1047
00:48:11,294 --> 00:48:12,161
A baby.

1048
00:48:12,896 --> 00:48:14,764
Like a baby.

1049
00:48:15,932 --> 00:48:17,066
Is he that young?

1050
00:48:17,066 --> 00:48:19,068
Still, being young isn't a bad thing.
The younger, the better.

1051
00:48:19,702 --> 00:48:22,605
No one went to Se Hoon today.

1052
00:48:22,605 --> 00:48:24,040
Should I have gone to Se Hoon instead?

1053
00:48:24,774 --> 00:48:26,776
Would I have won his heart that way?

1054
00:48:27,477 --> 00:48:28,645
But as a mom,

1055
00:48:29,045 --> 00:48:31,748
I thought you should date
someone you haven't talked to.

1056
00:48:32,215 --> 00:48:34,784
Seo Han Gyeol, impressive.

1057
00:48:35,318 --> 00:48:36,352
Good job today, Se Hoon.

1058
00:48:37,086 --> 00:48:38,354
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1059
00:48:38,354 --> 00:48:40,356
Does it really matter if mothers like you
but the daughters don't?

1060
00:48:40,356 --> 00:48:43,326
- Ma'am, that's...
- No.

1061
00:48:43,326 --> 00:48:44,727
I'm worried it won't really lead anywhere.

1062
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:46,629
That's actually the real deal, ma'am.

1063
00:48:46,629 --> 00:48:48,698
- No, the daughters have to like him.
- No.

1064
00:48:48,698 --> 00:48:50,099
If it had been the daughters' picks,

1065
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:52,402
- you would've won three, and I, zero.
- Seriously.

1066
00:48:52,402 --> 00:48:55,338
Still, it worked out.
You got a chance to talk to everyone.

1067
00:48:55,338 --> 00:48:58,474
But isn't it hard talking to three people
at the same time?

1068
00:48:58,474 --> 00:48:59,576
That doesn't sound easy.

1069
00:48:59,576 --> 00:49:02,011
But maybe it's good
to get to know them all at once.

1070
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:05,381
You saved me, Mom.

1071
00:49:05,381 --> 00:49:07,650
What are you talking about?

1072
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,352
You studied hard and became a lawyer,
and that saved you.

1073
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:11,087
Anyway.

1074
00:49:11,087 --> 00:49:13,022
- Anyway, I came to help.
- She's very logical.

1075
00:49:13,022 --> 00:49:15,191
If I help at all, I'm happy.

1076
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:19,028
It's all thanks to you, Mom.
I can't believe this.

1077
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:19,929
(While Han Gyeol is soaking
in the joy of 3 votes...)

1078
00:49:20,163 --> 00:49:21,030
But...

1079
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:25,902
you can buy a house too.

1080
00:49:26,736 --> 00:49:27,971
A house.

1081
00:49:29,272 --> 00:49:31,107
I should've told them
not to worry about that.

1082
00:49:31,107 --> 00:49:32,442
It's fine.

1083
00:49:32,909 --> 00:49:34,344
Is that really what matters?

1084
00:49:34,344 --> 00:49:36,779
We're not the type to go around
talking about things like that anyway.

1085
00:49:36,779 --> 00:49:37,981
Yeah, that's true.

1086
00:49:38,915 --> 00:49:40,950
We're just not very good...

1087
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:41,784
- at bragging.
- At bragging.

1088
00:49:41,784 --> 00:49:42,819
Yeah, not very good.

1089
00:49:44,487 --> 00:49:45,355
(Feeling down)

1090
00:49:45,355 --> 00:49:46,756
Still, it stings.

1091
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:49,325
Should we play a round of Go-Stop?

1092
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:50,226
Shall we?

1093
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:52,395
Let's play Go-Stop and lift the mood.

1094
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:54,264
Let's go.

1095
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:58,701
She must really like playing Go-Stop.

1096
00:49:58,701 --> 00:49:59,836
Looks like it.

1097
00:49:59,836 --> 00:50:01,271
Hey, I'm glad I brought this.

1098
00:50:02,605 --> 00:50:04,207
We need something to blow off steam.

1099
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:08,177
(The zero-vote son
even unbuttons his shirt.)

1100
00:50:08,545 --> 00:50:09,679
The colors are pretty.

1101
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:11,748
Two, four, five.

1102
00:50:13,583 --> 00:50:14,751
My gosh.

1103
00:50:17,186 --> 00:50:19,088
You have to throw it like this, right?

1104
00:50:19,088 --> 00:50:21,558
(While Seung Hak and his mother
get caught up in the thrill)

1105
00:50:22,926 --> 00:50:25,395
Mom, why Hyun Jun?

1106
00:50:25,395 --> 00:50:26,296
Well,

1107
00:50:27,096 --> 00:50:30,967
a lawyer feels
a bit overwhelming, honestly.

1108
00:50:30,967 --> 00:50:32,602
The athlete didn't
quite feel right either.

1109
00:50:32,602 --> 00:50:34,037
Number Five felt overwhelming too.

1110
00:50:34,037 --> 00:50:35,672
And Hyun Jun doesn't feel
overwhelming to you?

1111
00:50:35,672 --> 00:50:37,941
No, he doesn't feel overwhelming.

1112
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:40,777
His mother told me,
"He has a licensed profession too."

1113
00:50:42,212 --> 00:50:43,746
Hyun Jun's mother is so cute.

1114
00:50:45,215 --> 00:50:46,182
So cute.

1115
00:50:46,182 --> 00:50:48,318
I really thought it over.

1116
00:50:49,018 --> 00:50:50,453
But Mom,

1117
00:50:50,453 --> 00:50:51,654
think about it.

1118
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:55,091
If you keep choosing
just one person like this,

1119
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:57,627
I don't get a chance to meet anyone else.

1120
00:50:57,627 --> 00:50:59,429
But that's...

1121
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,263
That's how you feel?

1122
00:51:00,263 --> 00:51:01,631
Yeah.

1123
00:51:01,631 --> 00:51:05,201
The others feel too overwhelming.

1124
00:51:05,201 --> 00:51:07,437
But that's how you feel, not me.

1125
00:51:07,437 --> 00:51:08,371
Right.

1126
00:51:08,738 --> 00:51:10,840
I should be thinking about you first.

1127
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,577
Tomorrow, like you said,

1128
00:51:14,577 --> 00:51:15,812
let's think it over again.

1129
00:51:15,812 --> 00:51:17,380
(Watching her reaction)

1130
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:20,917
He does seem like a good person.

1131
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:22,852
Yeah, he seems solid.

1132
00:51:22,852 --> 00:51:25,188
- I like his academic background too.
- Me too.

1133
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:27,957
That part appealed to me as well,

1134
00:51:27,957 --> 00:51:29,292
so I wanted you to meet
Number Two (Min Cheol) again.

1135
00:51:29,292 --> 00:51:31,928
I wanted to meet someone new.

1136
00:51:31,928 --> 00:51:34,497
I thought you would choose him, Mom.

1137
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:35,632
Yeah, you're right.

1138
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:37,600
Education mattered there too.

1139
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:41,504
The reason he got one vote...

1140
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:44,541
was because her mother cared
about academic background.

1141
00:51:45,074 --> 00:51:47,076
If there's another chance later,

1142
00:51:47,677 --> 00:51:48,912
try meeting Hyun Jun again too.

1143
00:51:48,912 --> 00:51:51,714
I also think that's a good idea.

1144
00:51:51,714 --> 00:51:53,583
He's a really good person.

1145
00:51:53,583 --> 00:51:55,552
He comes from a family of educators.

1146
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:57,954
His father is currently
a school principal.

1147
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:00,657
And Hyun Jun's mother...

1148
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:02,425
She seemed to like you.

1149
00:52:02,425 --> 00:52:03,893
Yeah, she really did.

1150
00:52:03,893 --> 00:52:05,929
But he's already fallen for someone else.

1151
00:52:07,297 --> 00:52:09,098
It's nice. It really feels like a date.

1152
00:52:09,999 --> 00:52:11,334
It is a date.

1153
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:14,204
(Tae In and Hyun Jun are the first
to go on a date.)

1154
00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:15,238
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

1155
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:18,208
I'm starting to feel better.

1156
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:19,075
Really?

1157
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:23,846
Does eating something good help
when you're feeling down?

1158
00:52:23,846 --> 00:52:25,081
Yeah.

1159
00:52:25,081 --> 00:52:26,249
It helps right away.

1160
00:52:26,249 --> 00:52:27,450
Right away?

1161
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:28,851
Okay, then...

1162
00:52:28,851 --> 00:52:30,887
if I really upset you
and then took you somewhere good to eat,

1163
00:52:32,055 --> 00:52:33,556
would you feel better instantly?

1164
00:52:33,556 --> 00:52:36,025
I was just giving an example.
I'm not saying I'd actually do that.

1165
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,530
That was unnecessary.

1166
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:41,965
His remarks.

1167
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:43,666
Is there anything you're curious about?

1168
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:44,701
- Anything I'm curious about?
- Yeah.

1169
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:47,503
How big of an age gap is okay for you?

1170
00:52:47,503 --> 00:52:48,805
For older, not really.

1171
00:52:49,439 --> 00:52:51,441
Since I'm already old.

1172
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:52,709
So I don't prefer older women.

1173
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:55,345
For younger,

1174
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:56,546
eight years.

1175
00:52:57,313 --> 00:52:58,681
So a ten-year gap is a no?

1176
00:52:58,681 --> 00:53:00,083
Yeah, that would be hard.

1177
00:53:00,083 --> 00:53:01,517
But that's not you.

1178
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:05,088
I mean, you definitely look young,

1179
00:53:05,088 --> 00:53:06,155
but not ten years young.

1180
00:53:06,155 --> 00:53:08,791
He makes inappropriate remarks nonstop.

1181
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:11,294
Wait. Was that a compliment or what?

1182
00:53:11,294 --> 00:53:12,729
He makes inappropriate remarks nonstop.

1183
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:16,799
He keeps saying things
he doesn't need to say.

1184
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:19,736
This is really delicious.

1185
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:21,838
This is the gik.

1186
00:53:22,505 --> 00:53:23,439
Gik?

1187
00:53:24,073 --> 00:53:25,208
What's a gik?

1188
00:53:25,408 --> 00:53:27,410
- You know it's "kick."
- She meant "kick."

1189
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,914
Does that mean "good?"

1190
00:53:30,914 --> 00:53:32,882
Wait, this is the kick. Try this.

1191
00:53:33,316 --> 00:53:35,318
The powder sprinkled on the rice.
That's the kick.

1192
00:53:36,653 --> 00:53:38,154
I used the word right away.

1193
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:39,222
Jalapeño, the kick.

1194
00:53:42,992 --> 00:53:43,726
Look at him.

1195
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:46,029
Pineapple with pork cutlet.
That's the real kick.

1196
00:53:46,629 --> 00:53:48,565
- Stop, that's enough.
- My ears hurt.

1197
00:53:48,565 --> 00:53:49,465
Seriously.

1198
00:53:50,233 --> 00:53:51,334
Isn't this how you use the word?

1199
00:53:51,334 --> 00:53:52,802
I just want to eat.

1200
00:53:54,437 --> 00:53:57,674
It felt like light joking,
just talking about the food.

1201
00:53:57,674 --> 00:54:01,377
We met as people looking further
into the future,

1202
00:54:01,377 --> 00:54:05,381
not just casually dating,

1203
00:54:05,381 --> 00:54:08,251
but the conversation kept focusing
on what was right in front of us.

1204
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:10,019
So my interest level went down a bit.

1205
00:54:10,787 --> 00:54:14,090
- There were too many "kicks."
- Too much kick-talk, right?

1206
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:15,692
He should've toned it down.

1207
00:54:16,726 --> 00:54:17,860
Did you get a chance to rest?

1208
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,196
Just a bit. I dozed off for ten minutes.

1209
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:23,333
I'd been wanting to talk with you,

1210
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:25,034
and I'm glad we got the chance today.

1211
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:28,371
I think the timing's pretty good.

1212
00:54:28,371 --> 00:54:29,372
Yes.

1213
00:54:29,372 --> 00:54:32,041
Since it's only been two days now.

1214
00:54:32,041 --> 00:54:33,076
Right.

1215
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:34,477
You helped with the dishes.

1216
00:54:34,477 --> 00:54:36,212
- Yesterday?
- Seeing you pitch in together...

1217
00:54:36,212 --> 00:54:38,481
really stuck with me.

1218
00:54:39,249 --> 00:54:40,116
(Last night)

1219
00:54:40,116 --> 00:54:42,886
If one of you washes, should I rinse?

1220
00:54:42,886 --> 00:54:44,554
That'd be better, right?
Like a two-person team.

1221
00:54:44,554 --> 00:54:46,522
Sounds good. I'll pour it for you.

1222
00:54:46,522 --> 00:54:47,490
Okay.

1223
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:50,093
(Before heading out on the date)

1224
00:54:50,093 --> 00:54:51,928
The more I talk to Hyun Jin,

1225
00:54:51,928 --> 00:54:53,296
the more she show things
through her actions.

1226
00:54:54,197 --> 00:54:56,966
Even when we were doing the dishes,
I said I'd take over,

1227
00:54:56,966 --> 00:54:58,701
but she suggested we split it.

1228
00:55:00,303 --> 00:55:01,871
I think Hyun Jin seems
like a really good person.

1229
00:55:02,805 --> 00:55:04,541
I'm curious about having
those kinds of talks with your mother.

1230
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:07,110
- Hyun Jin.
- Yes?

1231
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,780
What kind of man do you like?
What do you look for?

1232
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:14,050
I focus a lot on character.

1233
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,054
I'd like someone warm and kind.

1234
00:55:18,821 --> 00:55:20,924
And...

1235
00:55:20,924 --> 00:55:23,760
it matters even more
that he doesn't do the things I hate.

1236
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,828
I really get that.

1237
00:55:25,828 --> 00:55:27,964
More than doing 100 things well,

1238
00:55:27,964 --> 00:55:31,968
I think it's better to just not do
what the other person dislikes.

1239
00:55:31,968 --> 00:55:33,870
I've been thinking that a lot lately.

1240
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:34,771
Right.

1241
00:55:35,772 --> 00:55:36,606
It's really...

1242
00:55:37,307 --> 00:55:40,643
Hearing you say that, Hyun Jin,

1243
00:55:43,479 --> 00:55:45,248
that feels like one of your charms.

1244
00:55:45,248 --> 00:55:46,149
Thank you.

1245
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,785
You're not getting indigestion, are you?

1246
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:49,586
Why would I?

1247
00:55:49,586 --> 00:55:50,687
You're not getting indigestion, right?

1248
00:55:50,687 --> 00:55:52,755
- This is good, so no way.
- Is that so?

1249
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:56,726
Sometimes, I say kind of cringey things.

1250
00:55:56,726 --> 00:55:58,261
That doesn't matter.

1251
00:55:58,261 --> 00:55:59,429
- Are you okay with that?
- Yes.

1252
00:55:59,996 --> 00:56:00,797
"Are you okay?"

1253
00:56:01,564 --> 00:56:02,665
"That must've started you."

1254
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,634
I was thinking about that line too.

1255
00:56:04,634 --> 00:56:05,902
They click.

1256
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:10,173
I'm so curious what your job is.

1257
00:56:10,173 --> 00:56:11,007
Right?

1258
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:13,610
What could it be? I don't know either.

1259
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,911
Whatever you do, you seem really...

1260
00:56:15,678 --> 00:56:17,447
People tell you you're witty a lot, right?

1261
00:56:17,447 --> 00:56:18,815
I think they do.

1262
00:56:19,282 --> 00:56:21,618
I don't really get told I'm boring.

1263
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,622
Hyun Jin has a bit of a twist.

1264
00:56:25,622 --> 00:56:27,423
She's kind of eager to drop little lines.

1265
00:56:28,191 --> 00:56:29,792
And that's funny in a subtle way.

1266
00:56:31,194 --> 00:56:35,131
And I thought, "Is this what it means
when people say our humor clicks?"

1267
00:56:35,131 --> 00:56:36,599
Guess it clicks.

1268
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:38,167
But in the morning,

1269
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:39,903
he said he clicked with Jin Joo.

1270
00:56:39,903 --> 00:56:41,838
It's like he clicks with everyone.

1271
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:43,706
Maybe he's the "fits-anywhere" type.

1272
00:56:43,706 --> 00:56:44,841
He's good at adapting.

1273
00:56:45,508 --> 00:56:46,876
Hello.

1274
00:56:46,876 --> 00:56:48,278
(Meanwhile, Han Gyeol and the 3 women)

1275
00:56:48,278 --> 00:56:52,015
After yesterday's schedule ended,
did you talk to anyone separately?

1276
00:56:52,015 --> 00:56:53,016
I just slept.

1277
00:56:53,016 --> 00:56:54,183
Right away?

1278
00:56:54,183 --> 00:56:55,485
Right away.

1279
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:58,154
- You too, Myo Jin?
- Yeah.

1280
00:56:58,154 --> 00:57:00,456
Everyone just went to bed.

1281
00:57:00,456 --> 00:57:03,393
I felt a little anxious too,

1282
00:57:03,593 --> 00:57:07,764
so I thought about going to someone
I wanted to talk to again,

1283
00:57:08,765 --> 00:57:10,867
but I didn't have the confidence.

1284
00:57:11,668 --> 00:57:14,604
Actually, last night before bed,

1285
00:57:14,604 --> 00:57:16,839
I asked to talk with someone
I wanted to get to know a bit more,

1286
00:57:17,373 --> 00:57:20,109
and we talked.

1287
00:57:20,877 --> 00:57:22,712
That was really brave.

1288
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:27,116
You have to talk first to know the person,
but since we didn't...

1289
00:57:27,116 --> 00:57:30,253
If they'd told the three of you
to choose directly,

1290
00:57:30,253 --> 00:57:32,822
would I have even been a candidate?

1291
00:57:32,822 --> 00:57:34,524
- Yes.
- Yes?

1292
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,192
What about you, Myo Jin?

1293
00:57:36,192 --> 00:57:38,861
- Honestly, I don't think so.
- No?

1294
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:40,196
That's honest.

1295
00:57:40,196 --> 00:57:41,698
Was I too honest?

1296
00:57:41,698 --> 00:57:43,600
I'd have chosen you too.

1297
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,702
Really? I see.

1298
00:57:46,436 --> 00:57:50,173
Did your mother choose
someone among us three?

1299
00:57:50,173 --> 00:57:51,107
Yes.

1300
00:57:54,544 --> 00:57:55,979
The one my mother chose is here,

1301
00:57:55,979 --> 00:57:57,380
and the one I chose as well.

1302
00:58:02,518 --> 00:58:04,120
But you didn't choose just one person.

1303
00:58:04,454 --> 00:58:06,322
Are both of them here?

1304
00:58:07,624 --> 00:58:08,625
Both are here.

1305
00:58:11,494 --> 00:58:12,629
No way.

1306
00:58:12,629 --> 00:58:15,431
It's the best day ever for you,
Seo Han Gyeol.

1307
00:58:16,032 --> 00:58:19,569
He said two people he's interested in...

1308
00:58:19,569 --> 00:58:21,538
were there.

1309
00:58:21,538 --> 00:58:23,506
And one of them is me.

1310
00:58:24,207 --> 00:58:28,444
So I think I got jealous.
Could I call that jealousy?

1311
00:58:28,444 --> 00:58:30,513
The person I'm most interested in is...

1312
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:33,550
first, Cho Eun Na Rae.

1313
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,752
Second, Myo Jin.

1314
00:58:35,985 --> 00:58:37,153
That's how it is.

1315
00:58:38,187 --> 00:58:39,522
This is great.

1316
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,926
Han Gyeol's mother looks so bright.

1317
00:58:43,126 --> 00:58:44,994
(Big laugh)

1318
00:58:44,994 --> 00:58:47,163
You're the brightest today.

1319
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,200
You caught me.

1320
00:58:51,034 --> 00:58:53,169
We kept our introductions really short,

1321
00:58:53,169 --> 00:58:55,805
but you were different,
as expected of a lawyer's mother.

1322
00:58:55,805 --> 00:58:57,674
- "Lawyer's mother."
- You were so eloquent.

1323
00:58:57,674 --> 00:58:59,976
Ms. Kim, tomorrow,

1324
00:58:59,976 --> 00:59:01,911
we'll be worrying again.

1325
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:04,147
I think the men will choose tomorrow.

1326
00:59:04,147 --> 00:59:07,183
My son is ready.

1327
00:59:07,183 --> 00:59:08,518
Ready.

1328
00:59:08,518 --> 00:59:09,886
Everything's ready.

1329
00:59:09,886 --> 00:59:12,155
I had kept things open and was interested,

1330
00:59:12,155 --> 00:59:14,791
but because you stressed
"older women" too much...

1331
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:16,092
That's how you felt?

1332
00:59:16,092 --> 00:59:17,927
You should've said,
"A few years younger, a few years older,"

1333
00:59:17,927 --> 00:59:21,231
like, "I'm open within this range,"

1334
00:59:21,231 --> 00:59:23,299
but you cut off younger completely.

1335
00:59:23,299 --> 00:59:26,769
So the options got narrower.

1336
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:29,606
I guess I pushed "older" too hard earlier.

1337
00:59:29,606 --> 00:59:31,608
- "Older" over and over.
- This is crazy.

1338
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:34,277
I misspoke.

1339
00:59:34,911 --> 00:59:38,348
I meant someone
who could understand my son.

1340
00:59:38,348 --> 00:59:40,016
That was the point.

1341
00:59:40,450 --> 00:59:42,919
Younger is fine too.

1342
00:59:42,919 --> 00:59:43,920
Let me say this...

1343
00:59:44,821 --> 00:59:47,690
once again.

1344
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:51,094
Welcome.

1345
00:59:51,094 --> 00:59:52,228
Hello.

1346
00:59:52,929 --> 00:59:56,299
Since Hyun Jun and Tae In
have met so often,

1347
00:59:56,299 --> 00:59:59,202
we said there might not be
much left to learn.

1348
00:59:59,202 --> 01:00:01,571
we said there might not be
much left to learn.

1349
01:00:02,438 --> 01:00:05,408
Okay, then if they told me to choose,

1350
01:00:05,408 --> 01:00:06,876
it's okay if I choose someone else, right?

1351
01:00:07,347 --> 01:00:09,349
Of course.

1352
01:00:10,116 --> 01:00:11,517
With permission.

1353
01:00:11,517 --> 01:00:15,288
There's no permission to give or get.

1354
01:00:15,288 --> 01:00:19,992
But Hyun Jun is completely fixated
on one person.

1355
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,161
I didn't know, but she told me.

1356
01:00:22,161 --> 01:00:22,862
Are you upset?

1357
01:00:22,862 --> 01:00:23,896
I was hurt.

1358
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,202
So I kept watching.

1359
01:00:29,202 --> 01:00:30,803
Hyun Jun said Hyun Jin was really pretty.

1360
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:33,172
But...

1361
01:00:33,172 --> 01:00:34,741
he's already drawn to someone else.

1362
01:00:36,676 --> 01:00:39,278
The women's mothers...

1363
01:00:39,278 --> 01:00:41,080
kept talking as if Hyun Jun and Tae In...

1364
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,616
were obviously going to be the pair.

1365
01:00:43,616 --> 01:00:47,353
So if Tae In talks to someone else,

1366
01:00:47,353 --> 01:00:53,960
they might think, "What's she doing?"

1367
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:56,696
From Tae In's mother's standpoint,

1368
01:00:56,696 --> 01:00:59,632
if it looks like it's already decided,

1369
01:00:59,632 --> 01:01:02,335
she'd start thinking, "That's not it."

1370
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,671
It feels like a fixed assumption formed.

1371
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:08,441
Han Gyeol's team is back.

1372
01:01:08,441 --> 01:01:09,709
Back into the lodging.

1373
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:12,578
Did you have a good time?

1374
01:01:12,578 --> 01:01:14,147
You even brought something delicious.

1375
01:01:14,147 --> 01:01:16,315
We thought it'd be nice to eat together,

1376
01:01:16,315 --> 01:01:18,918
so we all agreed and brought it.

1377
01:01:18,918 --> 01:01:20,253
Come in.

1378
01:01:20,253 --> 01:01:21,320
First of all...

1379
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:22,622
Son-in-law, come on in.

1380
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,191
Son-in-law, come on in.

1381
01:01:25,191 --> 01:01:26,993
My goodness.

1382
01:01:26,993 --> 01:01:29,228
Thank you, ma'am.

1383
01:01:29,228 --> 01:01:31,664
I'll check if my mother
is here too, and...

1384
01:01:31,664 --> 01:01:33,266
Tell her to come.

1385
01:01:34,233 --> 01:01:35,501
How was the date?

1386
01:01:35,501 --> 01:01:37,303
He's a lawyer, so he talks well, right?

1387
01:01:37,303 --> 01:01:38,104
How was it?

1388
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:41,441
He's really kind, warm, and nice.

1389
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,543
But...

1390
01:01:43,543 --> 01:01:45,278
I don't feel romantic attraction.

1391
01:01:45,278 --> 01:01:46,279
None?

1392
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,381
He's just like an older brother?

1393
01:01:49,649 --> 01:01:54,354
If he were actually older,
maybe he'd have more of that "older" vibe.

1394
01:01:54,354 --> 01:01:56,222
- That older-man charm.
- I guess he's not older.

1395
01:01:56,222 --> 01:01:57,423
Maybe he's younger.

1396
01:01:57,890 --> 01:01:58,858
Was it fun?

1397
01:01:59,826 --> 01:02:00,893
It wasn't bad.

1398
01:02:02,028 --> 01:02:04,364
But for me, I'm still more drawn
to Min Cheol than Han Gyeol.

1399
01:02:07,333 --> 01:02:10,570
Hyun Jun graduated from Gachon University,
Department of Healthcare Management.

1400
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:12,171
Really?

1401
01:02:12,171 --> 01:02:13,239
They say he's smart.

1402
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:14,774
Really? Hyun Jun too?

1403
01:02:15,341 --> 01:02:19,912
Where did Hyun Jun go to university?

1404
01:02:19,912 --> 01:02:22,248
- In Seoul?
- Yes.

1405
01:02:22,248 --> 01:02:23,916
You didn't mention his school earlier.

1406
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:28,254
Gachon University,
Department of Healthcare Management.

1407
01:02:30,156 --> 01:02:36,029
In terms of family background and
career stability, Hyun Jun seems stronger.

1408
01:02:36,029 --> 01:02:37,230
Min Cheol...

1409
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:41,968
seems like someone who'll do well
earning a living with his job.

1410
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:44,270
Someone who'll manage his life
steadily going forward.

1411
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:45,805
He feels very responsible.

1412
01:02:47,206 --> 01:02:48,675
(Meanwhile,
Hyun Jun is lost in thought in his room.)

1413
01:02:48,675 --> 01:02:49,909
Where should I go?

1414
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:54,313
It feels like there aren't
many options left anymore.

1415
01:02:57,016 --> 01:02:59,218
What is Hyun Jun worried about?

1416
01:03:00,687 --> 01:03:04,924
Honestly, I've only been on dates...

1417
01:03:04,924 --> 01:03:06,793
- with you, Hyun Jun.
- Right.

1418
01:03:06,793 --> 01:03:08,828
- And you've only gone out with me too.
- That's true.

1419
01:03:09,295 --> 01:03:12,598
(From the men's first-impression pick
on Day 1,)

1420
01:03:13,132 --> 01:03:15,301
(the two have been
on every date together so far.)

1421
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:18,571
So this is their fourth date together.

1422
01:03:19,372 --> 01:03:21,307
We haven't really talked to anyone else.

1423
01:03:21,307 --> 01:03:22,508
- That's true.
- Yeah, that's true.

1424
01:03:22,508 --> 01:03:24,310
I haven't talked to anyone else either.

1425
01:03:24,977 --> 01:03:26,079
Are we getting isolated?

1426
01:03:26,546 --> 01:03:28,014
She's saying they should split up now.

1427
01:03:28,014 --> 01:03:28,881
I don't think so.

1428
01:03:29,916 --> 01:03:33,986
I think talking to other people too...

1429
01:03:33,986 --> 01:03:36,522
- is a necessary part of the process.
- It is.

1430
01:03:38,591 --> 01:03:39,525
Right.

1431
01:03:40,093 --> 01:03:43,629
Right now, the person I'm most drawn to...

1432
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:45,365
is Kim Tae In.

1433
01:03:45,365 --> 01:03:48,034
I've talked with her the most,
gone on dates with her,

1434
01:03:48,034 --> 01:03:52,071
and after seeing different sides of her,
she's still the one I'm most drawn to.

1435
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:55,241
The person I'm most drawn to
right now is...

1436
01:03:55,508 --> 01:03:57,176
It's just a 49-51 split.

1437
01:03:57,744 --> 01:04:00,613
The person who likes me
100 percent is Hyun Jun,

1438
01:04:00,613 --> 01:04:03,649
but the person I feel
some attraction toward is Se Hoon.

1439
01:04:03,649 --> 01:04:06,719
But because Hyun Jun likes me so much,
I feel complicated.

1440
01:04:08,087 --> 01:04:08,988
(Putting on perfume)

1441
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:10,456
I need to wear perfume.

1442
01:04:10,456 --> 01:04:13,393
(Tae In starts getting ready to go out.)

1443
01:04:14,761 --> 01:04:16,162
Mom, open the door,

1444
01:04:16,162 --> 01:04:17,764
- and grab Se Hoon for me.
- What?

1445
01:04:17,764 --> 01:04:19,265
Grab Se Hoon for me.

1446
01:04:19,265 --> 01:04:20,867
- Se Hoon?
- Yeah, when he comes out,

1447
01:04:22,301 --> 01:04:24,537
say, "Se Hoon, come eat with Tae In."

1448
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:27,073
I can't believe
she's telling her mother to do that.

1449
01:04:29,108 --> 01:04:30,843
(Just then, Se Hoon comes outside.)

1450
01:04:30,843 --> 01:04:32,545
(Open)

1451
01:04:32,545 --> 01:04:33,713
Hello, ma'am.

1452
01:04:34,647 --> 01:04:36,015
- Se Hoon.
- Yes?

1453
01:04:36,482 --> 01:04:37,984
With Tae In,

1454
01:04:37,984 --> 01:04:40,219
- maybe grab a drink or have a meal.
- Yes.

1455
01:04:40,219 --> 01:04:42,488
- Maybe grab a drink or have a meal.
- Yes.

1456
01:04:43,089 --> 01:04:44,023
That was the plan.

1457
01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:47,727
It's great to have a mother
at times like that.

1458
01:04:48,428 --> 01:04:49,929
Are you going out without a jacket?

1459
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:50,997
Yeah.

1460
01:04:50,997 --> 01:04:53,499
But Se Hoon's wearing a coat.

1461
01:04:53,499 --> 01:04:54,701
I'm going to ask him for his coat.

1462
01:04:55,635 --> 01:04:56,736
I'm going to ask him to put it on me.

1463
01:04:57,637 --> 01:05:00,139
She says she'll go like that
and ask for his coat.

1464
01:05:00,873 --> 01:05:01,674
Aren't you cold?

1465
01:05:01,674 --> 01:05:03,509
I'm totally fine.
I've got three layers on.

1466
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:09,015
(Meanwhile,
Hyun Jun and Seung Hak are out walking.)

1467
01:05:09,015 --> 01:05:10,249
What's for late-night food?

1468
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:12,218
Chicken, spicy rice cakes,
and fried stuff.

1469
01:05:12,218 --> 01:05:13,653
There's a lot.

1470
01:05:13,653 --> 01:05:15,054
- Can I take a look too?
- There's a lot?

1471
01:05:15,054 --> 01:05:16,956
Yeah, there are lots of options.

1472
01:05:16,956 --> 01:05:18,324
(Tae In walks past Hyun Jun.)

1473
01:05:18,324 --> 01:05:19,192
You look tired.

1474
01:05:19,192 --> 01:05:20,026
Where are you going?

1475
01:05:20,026 --> 01:05:22,662
I'm just going to check something.

1476
01:05:22,662 --> 01:05:24,163
Why is he stuttering?

1477
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:25,531
I'm going to talk
with Seung Hak for a bit.

1478
01:05:26,466 --> 01:05:27,700
Why is he suddenly going to talk
to Seung Hak?

1479
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:29,002
He's stepping aside.

1480
01:05:29,002 --> 01:05:30,970
Why suddenly talk to Seung Hak?

1481
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:32,538
(Frustrated)

1482
01:05:32,538 --> 01:05:33,606
Seriously.

1483
01:05:33,606 --> 01:05:35,775
Did they leave together already?

1484
01:05:35,775 --> 01:05:37,143
Looks like they went together.

1485
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:38,745
They went together.

1486
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,500
Thank you.

1487
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:42,435
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1488
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:49,108
(Refreshing)

1489
01:05:49,108 --> 01:05:51,444
It tastes kind of like a highball,
and it's really good.

1490
01:05:52,932 --> 01:05:55,368
I honestly thought
my mom would choose you, Se Hoon.

1491
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:56,136
Really?

1492
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:57,671
Yeah.

1493
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,206
Because during the introductions,

1494
01:06:01,206 --> 01:06:02,407
my mom leaned over and said,

1495
01:06:03,809 --> 01:06:04,877
"He's charming."

1496
01:06:06,311 --> 01:06:08,947
Then why did he make you eat
with someone else?

1497
01:06:08,947 --> 01:06:12,050
- I know, right?
- She placed you next to another guy.

1498
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,685
Was it a strategy?

1499
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:14,553
A strategy to trick me?

1500
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:19,625
The enemy was close. It was my own mom.

1501
01:06:20,225 --> 01:06:22,828
Let's talk casually.

1502
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,096
Okay.

1503
01:06:26,365 --> 01:06:29,635
My mother talked about me earlier, right?

1504
01:06:30,335 --> 01:06:34,006
Was there anything that surprised you,

1505
01:06:34,006 --> 01:06:36,642
or something that made you think,
"I knew it?"

1506
01:06:37,409 --> 01:06:39,478
Hearing about how you've lived
such a full, intense life,

1507
01:06:39,478 --> 01:06:42,948
I thought,
"Maybe there were times you felt lonely,"

1508
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:47,786
but also,
"He really lived those ten years fully."

1509
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:49,288
Fully. Yeah.

1510
01:06:49,288 --> 01:06:50,622
Really.

1511
01:06:50,622 --> 01:06:52,558
You seem like someone who's read
a lot of books,

1512
01:06:52,558 --> 01:06:55,093
because you seem to always be looking
for a breakthrough.

1513
01:06:55,093 --> 01:06:57,629
"If this doesn't work,
then I'll try something else."

1514
01:06:57,629 --> 01:07:00,098
That's probably why
you cook so many different things,

1515
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:01,767
and why you've tried
so many different fields.

1516
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,302
You think a lot,

1517
01:07:03,302 --> 01:07:05,571
so I can see
why you enjoy drinking alone too.

1518
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:08,273
You're really good
at understanding people.

1519
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:10,008
It's not so much understanding.

1520
01:07:10,008 --> 01:07:12,444
Don't you naturally pay attention
to someone you like?

1521
01:07:14,379 --> 01:07:17,649
Doesn't the vibe feel completely different
from earlier? Because earlier...

1522
01:07:17,649 --> 01:07:19,585
Earlier, they just talked about "kicks."

1523
01:07:19,585 --> 01:07:22,087
But she's talking so much now.

1524
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:25,057
It's impressive that you were thinking
like that from such a young age.

1525
01:07:25,057 --> 01:07:29,962
That means you were thinking
that way at 25 or 26.

1526
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,730
That's incredibly quick.

1527
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,166
I think I was lucky.

1528
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:35,534
You created that luck.

1529
01:07:35,534 --> 01:07:37,269
Honestly, I think I was lucky.

1530
01:07:37,936 --> 01:07:39,238
Look at them.

1531
01:07:39,872 --> 01:07:41,173
(Shy)

1532
01:07:41,173 --> 01:07:42,774
Why are you shy?

1533
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:44,443
This really feels like a dating show.

1534
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:50,048
I believe we create our own destiny.

1535
01:07:50,783 --> 01:07:53,719
I created my own destiny.

1536
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:56,922
If I'd just stayed put,
I'd still be talking to Hyun Jun,

1537
01:07:57,222 --> 01:07:59,391
but I found a breakthrough. You.

1538
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:02,361
"I found a breakthrough. You."

1539
01:08:02,361 --> 01:08:04,129
- I thought that was song lyrics.
- She shot straight.

1540
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:06,832
I found a breakthrough. You.

1541
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:09,334
Was Hyun Jun not good?

1542
01:08:09,334 --> 01:08:11,670
- No, he was good.
- So he wasn't bad.

1543
01:08:13,105 --> 01:08:14,439
But you kept catching my eye.

1544
01:08:14,439 --> 01:08:16,074
But...

1545
01:08:16,074 --> 01:08:18,210
even if you keep catching my eye,

1546
01:08:18,210 --> 01:08:19,778
whether I stay still or take action
is my choice to make.

1547
01:08:19,778 --> 01:08:21,447
Right, it's your choice.

1548
01:08:21,447 --> 01:08:22,281
And...

1549
01:08:23,215 --> 01:08:24,983
you couldn't even imagine
what happened yesterday would happen.

1550
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:26,752
I really couldn't.

1551
01:08:26,752 --> 01:08:27,986
And I'm the one who made that happen.

1552
01:08:29,087 --> 01:08:31,457
Look at him.

1553
01:08:31,457 --> 01:08:33,225
- He's completely out of it right now.
- He's fallen hard.

1554
01:08:33,225 --> 01:08:35,494
- Se Hoon is totally out of it right now.
- "I really couldn't."

1555
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:37,463
You couldn't even imagine
what happened yesterday would happen.

1556
01:08:37,463 --> 01:08:38,430
I really couldn't.

1557
01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:39,832
And I'm the one who made that happen.

1558
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,802
I created that destiny,
and you seized the opportunity.

1559
01:08:46,104 --> 01:08:47,706
Look at him. He's completely out of it.

1560
01:08:50,008 --> 01:08:52,611
Somehow, if you end up with me,

1561
01:08:52,978 --> 01:08:54,246
I feel like it might actually
be good for you.

1562
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:59,084
If you really think
in terms of gains and losses,

1563
01:08:59,084 --> 01:09:03,188
it almost feels like you'd gain more
and I'd lose more.

1564
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:05,390
Wait.

1565
01:09:05,657 --> 01:09:06,558
Why?

1566
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:09,428
What you're saying really sticks with me.

1567
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:11,663
This is driving me crazy.

1568
01:09:13,432 --> 01:09:14,700
It sticks with you?

1569
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:17,136
It honestly feels
like someone's controlling me right now.

1570
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:18,470
But doesn't it make sense?

1571
01:09:19,204 --> 01:09:21,373
I think destiny is something you create.

1572
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,477
It is.

1573
01:09:25,477 --> 01:09:30,449
(What will Moon Se Hoon's destiny be?)

1574
01:09:30,983 --> 01:09:32,718
Is this really destiny?

1575
01:09:32,718 --> 01:09:34,753
(Se Hoon is left confused
after Tae In's talk of destiny.)

1576
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:38,190
I actually wanted to talk with Se Hoon.

1577
01:09:38,190 --> 01:09:39,725
Who were you planning to talk to?

1578
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:41,860
It was either you or Tae In.

1579
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:44,730
Today, the women will be introduced.

1580
01:09:44,730 --> 01:09:48,300
About twice her annual salary...

1581
01:09:48,300 --> 01:09:50,402
Maybe we'd have to be a weekend couple.

1582
01:09:50,402 --> 01:09:52,671
A weekend couple?

1583
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:55,073
This situation honestly feels
a bit uncomfortable.

1584
01:09:55,073 --> 01:09:58,010
My daughter was born...

1585
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:59,812
in 198...

1586
01:09:59,812 --> 01:10:01,246
(The women's ages and jobs
are finally revealed.)

1587
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,416
Today's date choice will be made
by the men's mothers.

1588
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:05,851
I'll leave it up to you, Mom.

1589
01:10:05,851 --> 01:10:07,519
This is too cruel.

1590
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:09,519
