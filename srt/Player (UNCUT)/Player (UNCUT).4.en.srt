1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,680
- (Previously on "Player")
- All your ex-flings.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,240
That's enough. Time for a finale move.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,200
If you want to know about Phe, get in.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,720
Thanks for saving me again.

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,120
It’s destiny!

6
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Just a friend, huh?

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,840
You’re not flirting again, are you?

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,760
If I find out you’re lying,
I’m telling Prang.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,960
I found a nice restaurant online.

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,520
I’d love to take you there.

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,520
I never knew you had a brother.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,320
Yes, an older one.

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,840
He runs a restaurant in New York.

14
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,400
Mind if I ask instead?

15
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,280
Do you like women?

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,760
If you really want to know,

17
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,760
we’ll have to see each other more often.

18
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,440
Oh, come on!
Just drop your card already.

19
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,680
Uno!

20
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,440
Damn.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,400
Last card!

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,560
Yay!

23
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,240
Serves you right.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,800
- Finally, I can go to bed.
- Wait, don’t get up yet.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,560
Krit, stop.

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,240
I haven’t won.

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,520
One more game, please.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,759
“My friends always say I’m too competitive.”

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,240
“No matter how small the game is.”

30
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,160
“Poj is really leaving.”

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,000
“Chai Klang.”

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,600
“Chai Noi.”

33
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
She’s so incredible.

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,400
“Where is everyone?”

35
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,720
“It’s nothing.”

36
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,840
“It’s just that…”

37
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,000
Our girl’s going to be famous for sure.

38
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,840
“I just don’t want to feel like I’m always coming in last.”

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,200
Where do you live?

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,480
I’ll take you home.

41
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,200
“So, no matter what life throws at me…”

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
“At the very least,
I won’t let myself stay at rock bottom.”

43
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,320
“Even if I fall, I’ll climb back up.”

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,920
“I just don’t want to feel like…”

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,520
“I’m stuck waiting for someone
to pull me out.”

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,600
“It’s not that I love winning that much.”

47
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
“But why…”

48
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,160
“Why do I have to lose?”

49
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,120
That’s so cute.

50
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,600
Then…

51
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,480
I’ll put this one right in the center
of my collage.

52
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,400
“Would you be free for dinner again, P’Ploy?”

53
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,960
“Why isn’t she replying again?”

54
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:36,480
“Am I getting karma
for ghosting all my old flings?”

55
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,880
Off shooting on location again, huh?

56
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,960
Didn’t even tell me about this.

57
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,920
Just don’t cause
any more trouble for now, okay?

58
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
Phe?

59
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,480
And if it’s not important,
please don’t contact me again.

60
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
If there’s anything,
I’ll call you myself.

61
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,960
It's Phe. I knew it.

62
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
“Why did I never think of that before?”

63
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,520
“Of course… They're siblings.”

64
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,240
I think…

65
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,280
Ploy probably knows more
about Phetai than we thought.

66
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
Yeah, maybe.

67
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,680
Based on what we’ve got so far

68
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,240
it’s fair to assume

69
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,920
they could be related.

70
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,880
But that doesn’t necessarily mean
they’re working together.

71
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,880
Still, it’s suspicious, isn’t it?

72
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,040
Calm down, girl.

73
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,240
Ploy’s a luxury celeb,
a total rich girl.

74
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,120
Why would she scam you for money?

75
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,000
Or maybe she’s rich

76
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,800
Because she teamed up
with her brother to con people.

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,240
Oh my god,
you’re just being dramatic.

78
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
She earns tens of thousands
every time she shows up at an event.

79
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,200
Celebs getting involved in shady businesses
isn’t that rare, though.

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,159
True…

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,520
but do you really think

82
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,680
someone like Ploy Pitcha

83
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,480
would be a scammer?

84
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,159
It’s hard to believe.

85
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,440
Still, she must’ve known something.

86
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,920
At the very least,

87
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,200
she might have given Phetai a place to stay.

88
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,840
Otherwise,

89
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,560
Ploy might already know about him

90
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,880
that you were one of his victims,

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,920
and that you’re out looking for him.

92
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,560
Or maybe…

93
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,520
she already knows.

94
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,560
That you’ve been digging
into Phe through her.

95
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,240
But if she knew,
wouldn’t she have pulled away from me by now?

96
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,000
Yet here we are...

97
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,280
getting closer and closer.

98
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,720
Hmm?

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,880
Aww.

100
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
If you really want to know,
there’s a way.

101
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,560
Just ask her straight up.

102
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
No, just play it cool.

103
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Huh?

104
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,160
If you ask her directly
and she is involved,

105
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,760
you really think she’ll tell you?

106
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,159
Worst case, Phe might catch on too.

107
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,960
I say keep pretending.

108
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,520
It’s the best move you’ve got.

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,960
And what if Ploy figures you out?

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,640
“See you soon.”

111
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,400
I’ve come this far.
There’s no turning back now.

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,400
Whatever happens… I’ll deal with it.

113
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,320
What’s up?

114
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,960
I just stepped out for a little walk.

115
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,600
Still got time before the event starts.

116
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,200
Sneaking off for crispy pork?

117
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,120
What? No way! Who’d sneak out for crispy pork?
Not me!

118
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760
You’re overthinking it.

119
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,240
Okay, okay.

120
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,520
I’m heading back up now.

121
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,160
Talk later, okay?

122
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,120
It’s not crispy pork,

123
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,080
It's braised pork belly.
Big difference.

124
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,040
(”Grand Terra Hotel”)

125
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
Besides the room we looked at earlier,

126
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,000
There's also a large hall
on the fifth floor for big events.

127
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,920
But usually, if you have

128
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,440
fewer than 100 tables,
we’d recommend that one instead.

129
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,880
Okay, then we’ll go with the smaller room.

130
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,040
Perfect. In that case,

131
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,360
we’ll send you a link
to fill out the booking details.

132
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,080
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

133
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,520
Um, excuse me.

134
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,800
Oh my gosh, you’re Jay!
Jay-Prang, right?

135
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,680
You’re even prettier in person!

136
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,480
Aw, thank you so much.

137
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,240
Do you also host weddings here?

138
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,880
Oh, yes we do.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,400
You can take a look
at the details here first.

140
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Oh, is this the same hall
that’s hosting the event today?

141
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,480
Yes, that’s right.

142
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,800
It’s gorgeous.

143
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,560
It really is.

144
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,200
You actually have to book it
at least two years in advance.

145
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,880
Two years?

146
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,920
That’s right. Two whole years.

147
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,440
Are you interested?

148
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
I’d like to book it right now.

149
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,400
Oh, wonderful! Absolutely.

150
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,360
Then I’ll note down the details here.

151
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,080
Sure.

152
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,680
- Okay.
- Jay Jirapat, please.

153
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,960
Got it.

154
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,360
Are you sure
you left your bag over there?

155
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,920
Um… I think so.

156
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,360
Stop! Wait!

157
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,160
The key!

158
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,560
What key?

159
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,320
Play it for me.

160
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,200
Yeah, that’s definitely him.

161
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
That’s Phe’s favorite shirt, for sure.

162
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,400
Can’t see the face clearly though.

163
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,080
Can you zoom in a bit more?

164
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,640
Closer, please.

165
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,040
That’s as close as it gets.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,760
“Confirmed… that’s definitely Phe.”

167
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,120
“But what were they talking about?”

168
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:47,320
“And that key Ploy gave him…”

169
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,000
What key?

170
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,240
“Anyway, if I can’t get any info today…”

171
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,400
“I’ll at least just win her over.”

172
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,760
“As in… charm her!”

173
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,440
“Until she spills everything.”

174
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,320
“With good music, a nice vibe.
Just the two of us.”

175
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,080
“As if.”

176
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,920
“Why would Ploy invite these two along?”

177
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,840
You look stunning today.

178
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,880
Obviously.
I look stunning every day.

179
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,480
Ugh, you two make me sick.

180
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,600
Gross.

181
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,120
Enough, stop teasing the kids.

182
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,720
A jealous little girl.

183
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,160
Ew, ew, ew!

184
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,480
Such bad manners.

185
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,120
- Should’ve let her sit alone
- Right.

186
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,680
Whoa.

187
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,960
[People whispering]

188
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,800
She really steals
the spotlight every time.

189
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,320
So Ploy Dior has become
her new stage name.

190
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Ploy Dior.

191
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,480
Ploy Dior.

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,320
Ploy.

193
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,160
“Of course. She wants me to get jealous.”

194
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,560
“And probably boost her ratings
while she’s at it.”

195
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,000
Who did Ploy come with, Jay?

196
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,560
Oh,

197
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,200
Min.

198
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,160
She’s from a high-society circle.

199
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,240
But I’ve never actually talked to her.

200
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,160
Is that Ploy’s new girlfriend, Prang?

201
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,280
Stop gossiping.
they’re coming this way.

202
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,400
Ploy! Min!

203
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,560
Please, have a seat.

204
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,560
How have you been, Prang?

205
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,200
It’s been ages
since we’ve all hung out like this.

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,200
I really miss those old days.

207
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,840
Well, it’s your fault, Min.
You never join us.

208
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,880
I only came today
because I wanted to meet the real Jay.

209
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280
Nice to meet you, Jay.

210
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,160
You’re even prettier in person.

211
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,720
After we finish eating,

212
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,840
Can I get your autograph for my niece?

213
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,240
She’s eight. A huge fan.

214
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,840
Of course, Min.
We should take her out sometime too.

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,480
Sounds great. Let’s make it happen.

216
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,080
Pun,

217
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
This is Min. She’s my friend.

218
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,200
Nice to meet you.

219
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,000
You must be Pun, right?

220
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,920
It’s lovely to finally meet you.

221
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
Ploy talks about you all the time.

222
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,560
So, how’s business going, Min?

223
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,280
It’s been doing quite well, actually.

224
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,040
Except that…

225
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,840
Someone keeps coming by for free food.

226
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,320
Hey! Don’t slander me like that.

227
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,160
She shows up more often
than at her own house!

228
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,760
Can I come along next time?

229
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,680
Sure, why not?

230
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,600
Let’s all go together.

231
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,200
Excuse me, I’m gonna go to the restroom.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,520
Want me to come with you?

233
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,520
It’s okay, I’ll be fine.

234
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,360
What day would work for you?

235
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,680
How about next week?

236
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,880
Does she really not know
this was supposed to be just the two of us?

237
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,480
Or is she bringing another girl
just to make me jealous?

238
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,040
Are you talking about me?

239
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,560
No.

240
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,080
I wasn’t talking about you, Ploy.

241
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,560
Are you mad at me, Pun?

242
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,560
Well, did you do anything
worth getting mad about?

243
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,440
Good question.

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,440
What did I do, exactly?

245
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,440
Nothing.

246
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,080
You didn’t do anything, Ploy.

247
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,640
Okay then.

248
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,200
Hey,

249
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
What’s wrong, girl? What happened?

250
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
Guess it’s our turn now.

251
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,520
“Luckily, I came prepared with backup.”

252
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,640
This actually works out perfectly.

253
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,000
Wait, what do you mean?

254
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,000
I already made a reservation, actually.

255
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,720
But since Ploy said she booked too,

256
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,320
that means we’ve got two extra seats.

257
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,840
You want me to come for drinks?

258
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,360
No, I want you to help me.

259
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,040
What?

260
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,160
Help you with what exactly?

261
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,560
Didn’t you say
you wanted to be alone with her?

262
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,080
Yeah, well… I’m not sure yet.

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,800
But better too many
than too few, right?

264
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,760
Just in case something happens.

265
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,760
But there are only two spots left.

266
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,840
Meaning…

267
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,000
Pick me!

268
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Over here!

269
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,560
No, no, no!

270
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,320
- Ugh…
- Here we go again.

271
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,880
Mhm.

272
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,600
Ones and twos!

273
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,600
Ones and twos!

274
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,880
Ones and twos!

275
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,560
Some people just have all the luck,
huh, Waanjieab?

276
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,520
Sorry, Waanjieab.
Better luck next round! Cheers!

277
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,240
Pun’s still not back?

278
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,240
I thought I saw her walk this way earlier.

279
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,640
Maybe she ran into someone she knows.

280
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,560
Wait.

281
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,359
I need backup.

282
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,680
What? We’re just getting to the fun part!

283
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,480
You stay here,
My sister’s met you before.

284
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,600
And you…

285
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,760
Dressed all cool, total Korean style.

286
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,080
You’d make the perfect date for me.

287
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,680
Date!?

288
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,840
Huh!?

289
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,800
Don’t tell me. A date? Who?

290
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,720
Don’t even say it.

291
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,400
Pun, God’s gonna strike you down for that!

292
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,120
Come on!

293
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,400
Just thinking about it
gives me chills.

294
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,520
Please help me out here.

295
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,560
Are you sure, Pun?
You’ve got a whole group of friends here.

296
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,360
Hm? It’s fine, Chakrit.

297
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,680
Ahem. Everyone.

298
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,960
This is Chakrit, my friend.

299
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,960
He came alone,
so I invited him to sit with us.

300
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,480
Hope that’s okay.

301
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,000
Of course, have a seat.

302
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,520
Nice to meet you all.
Thanks for having me.

303
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,480
Ladies first.

304
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,320
Ooh, such a gentleman!

305
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
Chakrit.

306
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,520
Huh? I remember you’re...

307
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,280
“Crap, did Prang ever meet Krit before?”

308
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,320
A chef, right?

309
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
That’s right, yes.

310
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,960
Wow, Prang, good memory!

311
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,920
I remember because Pun mentioned you once.

312
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,360
Yeah.

313
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,080
I’ve been telling everyone
about Chakrit, actually.

314
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,640
Funny, I don’t recall you telling me.

315
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,880
Well, we only just got close,
didn’t we, Ploy?

316
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,440
Give it time.
I’m sure I’ll tell you more soon.

317
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,120
Excuse me, who's having the cocktail?

318
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,120
Over here.

319
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
This cocktail is yours.

320
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,360
I didn’t even order yet.

321
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,640
You ordered for me, Ploy?
You really know me well.

322
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,840
Then next round,
you order one for me.

323
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,120
French fries!

324
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,280
Wow.

325
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,920
Oh, no, it’s fine… really.

326
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,720
Ahh, Chakrit’s favorite. I remember.

327
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,640
I've been cutting carbs lately,
but since you’re feeding me...

328
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,760
I’ll make an exception.

329
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,600
Is it good?

330
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,240
If it is, eat up.

331
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,560
Ahh...

332
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,600
Guys who eat a lot are cute.

333
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,080
You’ve got quite the appetite, huh?

334
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,240
Ahh...

335
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
There’s a DJ too.

336
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,040
Looks like he’s opening the stage
before the band starts.

337
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,920
Wanna go dance, Prang?

338
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,960
Sure!

339
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
Wanna dance with me?

340
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
No, thanks.

341
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,240
But I want to dance, Chakrit.

342
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,480
Wow, didn’t even let me finish my fries.

343
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,800
Go dance with me, then.

344
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,960
Thanks for going along with me.
You’re the cutest.

345
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
Aren’t you afraid someone
will snap a photo for Instagram?

346
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,760
Nah. We’ve gone public.
I can do whatever I want now.

347
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,200
Besides, the fans are loving it.
Think of it as good publicity.

348
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,080
Took me a while to find you;
the helmsman of the Jay–Prang ship!

349
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,520
It's you all along.

350
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,840
I’m not just the helmsman.
I’m the captain!

351
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,600
Put your arm around my waist.

352
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,320
Do I have to hold you this close?

353
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,280
Come on, don’t be so stiff.
It’s just a casual hold.

354
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,680
Casual?
This doesn’t look casual at all.

355
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,680
Are you trying to make Ploy jealous?

356
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,360
You’re supposed to be getting info from Ploy,
not just making her jealous.

357
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,240
This is part of the plan.

358
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,280
I’m investigating… if she gets jealous.

359
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,600
If she does, it means she likes me.

360
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,600
And if she likes me,
that means I’ll get the info I need.

361
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,000
Not sure about her,

362
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,720
but what about you?
Feeling jealous yet?

363
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,000
Jealous? Of what?

364
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,360
A tiger doesn’t fall for its prey,
you know.

365
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,360
Honestly?
I think you’re starting to catch feelings.

366
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,000
Krit!

367
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,800
Oh, Nont! What are you doing here?

368
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,640
I’m just hanging out with some friends.

369
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,280
“Damn, that’s Krit’s ex-fling.”

370
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,920
Yeah, it’s been a while.

371
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,720
How’ve you been, Nont?

372
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,000
I’m good, just busy with work.

373
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,200
You’ve changed your type, huh?

374
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Hey, it’s not what it looks like!

375
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,760
Hey, it’s fine, really.

376
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,520
The world’s open now.
Love is love, right?

377
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,640
Let’s just say... I get you.

378
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
Anyway, I’ll go find my friends.

379
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,880
Nont, wait!

380
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,440
Damn it, Krit!

381
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,000
Ugh! This is all because of Krit!

382
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,560
You’ve ruined everything!

383
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,400
Aha.

384
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,080
That restlessness of yours…

385
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,040
is it because you
didn’t get to investigate,

386
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,360
or because you’re jealous?

387
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,000
I’m not jealous.

388
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,080
Don’t deny it, Pun.

389
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,080
When love

390
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,280
sneaks into your heart,

391
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,560
there’s no stopping it.

392
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,000
I’m not in love!

393
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,520
Not even interested!

394
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,320
Good for you, then.

395
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,840
Wait, aren’t there supposed to be

396
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,760
an angel and a devil on your shoulders?

397
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,200
So who are you?

398
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,760
Huh?

399
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,680
Well, since we’re chasing
after a million baht,

400
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,000
it should be Angel...

401
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,200
and Sherlock Pun!
That’s more fitting.

402
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,280
Ugh, my brain’s fried.

403
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,920
Don’t lose focus, Pun.

404
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,560
This time,
money’s on the line and so is our pride.

405
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,880
Heh heh heh...

406
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,320
Hello?

407
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,440
“Hi, I’m calling from MPL.”

408
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,600
“We came across your freelance profile.
It’s really impressive.”

409
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,800
“Our company’s developing
a new mobile application.”

410
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
“So we're interested in having you
design the artwork for our new app.”

411
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,760
“Would you be available
at the moment?”

412
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,080
Yes, I’m available, sure.

413
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,400
“Great. We’ll send you an email
to schedule a follow-up meeting.”

414
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,760
- “Thank you for your time”
- Okay, thank you so much.

415
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,400
Yay!

416
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,880
Mind if I join you?

417
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,360
Go ahead, if you want.

418
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,280
Why didn’t you tell me
you were back last night?

419
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,840
I was tired.

420
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,360
I just wanted to rest.

421
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,040
So what brings you here, Ploy?

422
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,000
I came to see if a certain
someone’s sulking.

423
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,280
I’m not a kid.

424
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,960
Yes, you are.

425
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,560
A kid with a wild imagination.

426
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,240
Making up stories...

427
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,200
and sulking all by herself.

428
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,400
When exactly did I ever sulk at you?

429
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,120
“What should I do, Pun?”

430
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,440
“Oh god, what now?”

431
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,440
“Don’t fight it, Pun.”

432
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,600
You can’t resist love
once it starts flowing through your heart.

433
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,880
Pun, you’re on an important mission right now.

434
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,880
If you lose focus
and fall for your target,

435
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,440
your million baht will vanish in a heartbeat.

436
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,760
Just one kiss. That wouldn’t hurt, would it?

437
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,840
Give yourself a little reward, Pun.

438
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,800
Yeah.

439
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,960
Just one kiss.

440
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,560
It wouldn’t hurt, right?

441
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,520
Think of it as scoring a few points, Pun.

442
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,720
“If you’re going to do it,”

443
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,280
“Then answer this honestly, Pun.”

444
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,120
Are you doing it to win her over,

445
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,120
Or is it because of your own desire?

446
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,360
“There’s only one truth.”

447
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,840
If you can’t answer that question...

448
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:28,640
then maybe you shouldn’t do it at all.

449
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,840
Maybe, we should talk later.

450
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
I’ve got work to do.

451
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,040
But I’m not sure I’ll still have time to talk.

452
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,480
Some chances,

453
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,480
once missed, are gone for good.

454
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,280
I’ll get going then.

455
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,160
Okay.

456
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,200
Ouch...

457
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,360
What’s wrong with me?

458
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,320
Morning, babe.

459
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,160
You’re up early.

460
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,280
Don’t you have the day off today?

461
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:43,840
Mhm.

462
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,720
Jay...

463
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,560
Yeah?

464
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,840
Do you remember what we talked about...

465
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,480
the day Pun first got back to Thailand?

466
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,720
About what?

467
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,400
About Ploy.

468
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,600
And Pun.

469
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,040
Yeah.

470
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,320
Don’t you think
things have been a little strange lately?

471
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,360
Like... last night, for example.

472
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,400
I don’t know.

473
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,480
But if something is going on between them,

474
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,560
I actually feel bad for Pun.

475
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,320
You know what Ploy’s like.

476
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,320
But honestly...

477
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,600
do you really think someone like Ploy

478
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,600
would chase after anyone that hard?

479
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,560
Not really. Why?

480
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,440
Exactly. It just doesn’t add up.

481
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,680
Don’t stress yourself, babe.

482
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,440
You’re overthinking it.

483
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,960
Worry when there’s actually
something to worry about.

484
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,040
[Phone ringing]

485
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,640
Hello?

486
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,040
Um, Grand Terra Hotel?

487
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,480
About the reservation...

488
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,640
Sorry, what event did you say?
The signal’s...

489
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,520
Prang!

490
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,480
Okay, I’ll call back later.

491
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,280
Thank you.

492
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Something wrong?

493
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,040
I booked a spa day at that hotel,

494
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,560
but they just called to cancel said they’re fully booked.

495
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,600
I really wanted to take you there, Prang.
It’s hard to get in.

496
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,640
But just now, she mentioned
something about an event?

497
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,160
An event…

498
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,240
Maybe they’re hosting a big one.

499
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,680
They’ve got a ton of clients,

500
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,160
probably packed.

501
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:52,440
I’ll book again soon and take you next time, I promise.

502
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,520
Okay.

503
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,080
Your skin’s been dry lately, babe.

504
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,520
Let me grab you a face mask.

505
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,600
What’s up with her?

506
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,120
“Actually, about the wedding hall.”

507
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,800
“A client just cancelled their booking.”

508
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,920
“So we might have an opening
for late this year or early next year.”

509
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,520
“Would you like to confirm your reservation now?”

510
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,920
Guess I’ll have to
propose to you soon.

511
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,560
Pun.

512
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,440
Pun, hey.

513
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,080
Sit down, please. Sit down.

514
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,400
Mick?

515
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,320
So...

516
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,240
The company that reached out to you
was mine.

517
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,760
Your company?

518
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,560
That’s right. I’m the CEO.

519
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,520
Wow, it must be such a great company

520
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,440
to have the CEO himself, talking to an employee.

521
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,960
I just wanted to have a little talk with you, Pun.

522
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,640
If it’s not about work,
I’m not interested.

523
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,920
Pun, please. Just hear me out.

524
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,360
About our relationship,

525
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,560
I want to make things right to change.

526
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,880
I was impulsive back then.

527
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,760
And I promise
I won’t show off anymore.

528
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,760
That’s enough.

529
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,960
When I said it’s over, I meant it.

530
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:34,920
I miss you, Pun.

531
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,240
“There it is.”

532
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,800
Making the most out of a bad situation.

533
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,840
Use this CEO to our advantage.

534
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,000
Wait,

535
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,600
Don’t tell me you’re going
with the jealousy plan again.

536
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,080
I’m telling you...

537
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,440
this plan doesn’t suit you, Angel.

538
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,760
[Sighs]

539
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,960
Satisfied now?

540
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,280
Still, I really don’t recommend it.

541
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,280
I’m not into love or any of that.

542
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,320
But logically,

543
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:20,400
this will only make things worse.

544
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
But if she gets jealous,

545
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,360
it means she likes you.

546
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,680
And more importantly,
you might even earn yourself a few love points, Pun.

547
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,080
Think it through.

548
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,120
Don’t overthink it.

549
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,640
Well, Mick...

550
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:49,240
I’m glad to know you still think of me.

551
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,720
“Will she get jealous?”

552
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,560
We meet again, Pun.

553
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,520
This restaurant’s mine, actually.

554
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,800
Enjoy your meal.

555
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,080
I’ll leave you to it.

556
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,160
Pun.

557
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,400
That woman just now, she’s an actress, right?

558
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,400
Yes.

559
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,760
We live in the same building.

560
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,960
So what

561
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,960
just happened back there?

562
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
What do you mean?

563
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,040
It’s always like this.

564
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,480
But before she came,

565
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,400
You were turning me down
just a moment ago.

566
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:00,720
And suddenly...

567
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,840
It’s nothing. Really.

568
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,600
I’m not stupid, Pun.

569
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,639
But I get it.

570
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,120
Mick...

571
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,080
Look…

572
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,639
if you ever change your mind,

573
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,639
just let me know.

574
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,159
But..

575
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
don’t use me
to make someone jealous again.

576
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,960
Got it?

577
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,040
Let’s just eat.

578
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,639
Forget it.

579
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,880
We’ll talk business after we finish.

580
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,920
Seriously?

581
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,840
It’s nothing.

582
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,199
Shh.

583
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,360
So what now?

584
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,040
Well, at least

585
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,400
Mick’s mature enough.

586
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,440
He’s still hiring me for the project.

587
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,120
And you’re sure he won’t come after you again?

588
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,600
He promised

589
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,120
he wouldn’t get involved
in my personal life anymore.

590
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,000
Besides,

591
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,720
he’s the CEO.

592
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,160
He won’t have time
to mess around with an employee.

593
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,400
So,

594
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,160
Is Ploy actually mad at you?

595
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,480
I’m not sure, honestly.

596
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,320
But I think I’ll just hire
a private investigator instead.

597
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,160
Once I start working and get paid,

598
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,360
I’ll have some money to spare.

599
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,000
Help me find one, okay?

600
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,040
You’re starting to feel guilty,
aren’t you?

601
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,240
Or maybe...

602
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,200
you’re feeling something else.

603
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,440
("The Deviana")

604
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
Hold on, it’s still hot.

605
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:24,680
Prang.

606
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,760
Hm?

607
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
Why do you love Jay?

608
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Why ask?

609
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,840
Just answer me.

610
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Are you asking seriously right now?

611
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,760
Yeah.

612
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,840
Hmm...

613
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,160
I just do.

614
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,640
Come on, give me a real answer.

615
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,080
I’m serious.

616
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,880
Sometimes love

617
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:59,000
doesn’t really need a reason, does it?

618
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Just knowing you love someone,
that’s enough.

619
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:10,880
Then...

620
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,280
Aren’t you scared, though?

621
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,160
Scared of what?

622
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,720
Getting hurt.

623
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,760
Being disappointed.

624
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,080
Sometimes, sure.

625
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,920
But sometimes,
you just have to take the risk.

626
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,320
And what guarantees

627
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,360
that you made the right choice?

628
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,880
A guarantee?

629
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,960
There isn’t one.

630
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,200
Nothing in this world

631
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,800
ever stays the same anyway.

632
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,040
Oh.

633
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,080
Then why bother tying your feelings

634
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,200
to something so uncertain?

635
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,120
Look at it this way.

636
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,720
Imagine

637
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,240
there’s a cookie in front of you.

638
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,120
You can either eat it, or not.

639
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,240
You never try my cookie,

640
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,720
You never know if it’s any good.

641
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,720
The only way to find out

642
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,160
is to take a bite.

643
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,760
But if you hesitate too long,

644
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,680
you don’t dare to try,

645
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,960
you might never get the chance again.

646
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,280
So? Is it good?

647
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,520
Mhm.

648
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,840
But people aren’t cookies, Pun.

649
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,000
The right one for you

650
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,440
might only come once in a lifetime.

651
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,640
It’s good.

652
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,360
Hello? I’m on my way now.

653
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,080
Don’t worry, I’ll make it in time.

654
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,200
Traffic’s crazy today.

655
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,280
Oh, my makeup!

656
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,680
I dropped it in the car.

657
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,760
Oh, it’s green! I’ll call back later!

658
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,520
Ploy!

659
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Where are you heading?

660
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,360
To work.

661
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,520
Well…

662
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,640
What time will you be back?
Want to have dinner together?

663
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,080
I have a job in Rayong.

664
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,240
You never told me
you were going out of town.

665
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,480
Did you even ask me first?

666
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,200
So...

667
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,160
When will you be back?
Do you want me to pick you up?

668
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,440
I already have a driver.

669
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,600
Excuse me.

670
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,520
Uh... Ploy?

671
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,920
Ploy...

672
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,840
Are you mad at me?

673
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,400
What makes you think I would be?

674
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,920
Well, yesterday...

675
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,960
You saw me at the restaurant
and didn’t say a word.

676
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,600
I saw you with your friend.

677
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,880
And we’re talking right now,
aren’t we?

678
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,440
At this rate, if you don’t leave soon,

679
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,360
you’re going to be late for work.

680
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,560
Hey, Ploy!

681
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,400
Don’t be like this. [sobs]

682
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,800
About yesterday,

683
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,040
Mick, the guy I was with. He’s an ex.
But that was a long time ago.

684
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,760
And now he just wants
to hire me for a job.

685
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,360
I didn’t know! I swear! I’m so sorry.

686
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,480
And Chakrit, he’s gay.

687
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,000
He does drag
and looks prettier than me, honestly!

688
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,920
I was just teasing you.

689
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,240
I didn’t mean anything. [sobs]

690
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,200
Ahem.

691
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,160
Are you laughing at me?

692
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,880
I’m laughing
because you’re adorable.

693
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,960
Give me your car keys. I’ll drive you.

694
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,440
The keys...

695
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:03,800
Here.

696
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,560
But if you drive me,

697
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,560
How will you get to your work?

698
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,600
Ji will come pick me up.

699
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,520
Where’s the car parked?

700
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,480
Right over there.

701
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,440
Let's go.

702
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,520
Whoa!

703
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,920
Oh no! I got powder all over your shirt!

704
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,960
It’s fine.

705
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,080
Really, it’s fine.

706
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,200
I’ll have Ji bring me
a new shirt later, okay?

707
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,480
Okay.

708
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,560
Let’s…

709
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,120
have dinner together sometime.

710
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,800
Sure.

711
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,440
Let’s get to work.

712
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,640
"Just admit it already."

713
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,000
“You’ve got feelings for her.”

714
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,360
I won’t admit it.

715
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,640
And I won’t lose either.

716
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,640
Lose on what?

717
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,240
Losing to my curse

718
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,640
or losing to your own feelings for Ploy?

719
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,920
I meant

720
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,200
the investigation.

721
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,160
What?

722
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,880
You said you’d hire
a private investigator.

723
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,400
I thought you were done
digging around for info from Ploy.

724
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,520
Well…

725
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:27,320
Ugh.

726
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,000
Look!

727
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,520
Whatever I say, you never listen.

728
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,080
And I can’t stop you
from being so competitive either.

729
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,240
So if you don’t want to lose,

730
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,320
think of it as a new game.

731
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,920
What do you mean?

732
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,680
Instead of

733
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,800
focusing on who falls first,
or who wins,

734
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,280
try changing your perspective.

735
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,800
Refocus.

736
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,680
If you make her fall for you instead,

737
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,720
you win.

738
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,280
But now,

739
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,040
if you end up liking her first,

740
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,000
it doesn’t really count as losing,
does it?

741
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,240
I’m giving you your next quest.

742
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,880
“Get on it before it’s too late.”

743
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,480
Pun.

744
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,080
Yes?

745
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,800
The client from Phuket
just called me about the file.

746
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,320
Oh, I'm sending it right now.

747
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,840
Kwang, check the contract details too, please.

748
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,720
“People"

749
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
"aren’t cookies, Pun.”

750
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,040
The right one for you

751
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,240
might only come once in a lifetime.

752
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,720
Ploy,

753
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,320
Are you done with work yet?

754
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,600
Pun.

755
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,920
I already told you in chat
you didn’t have to come.

756
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,800
You didn’t want me to.

757
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,240
But you still texted me your room number.

758
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,960
I didn’t say I didn’t want you to.

759
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,840
It’s just far and it’s late.

760
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,400
What?

761
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,360
Aren’t you even happy to see me?

762
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,880
Did I ever say I wasn’t?

763
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,800
So tell me…

764
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,600
You kissed like a girl
on her first kiss.

765
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,280
Why?

766
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,800
Because...

767
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,360
I was holding your hand like this?

768
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,280
I mean…

769
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,880
how you just bumped your lips into mine like that.

770
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:40,440
Then let me try again.

771
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,400
Still such a baby.

772
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,880
Let me show you how adults do it.

773
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,080
"So..."

774
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,480
"Does that mean I win?"

775
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,640
I think we should stop here.

776
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:56,960
Ploy...

777
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,880
I’ve got an early shoot tomorrow.

778
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,040
I’m sorry.

779
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,200
Okay then.

780
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,560
Let’s just sleep
in each other’s arms tonight.

781
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,280
Okay.

782
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,720
Morning, Ploy.

783
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:35,960
Morning.

784
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,120
Your hair’s a total mess, huh?

785
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,560
Sleepy?

786
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,840
Mhm.

787
00:50:58,360 --> 00:50:59,360
I’ll sleep more.

788
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,280
Mmm.

789
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:21,080
I don’t want to go yet.

790
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,040
I just want to stay
with you a little longer.

791
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,880
I'll head out soon.

792
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,120
Well,

793
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,240
If I didn’t have errands today,

794
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,480
I could’ve stayed with you all day.

795
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,360
Drive safe, okay?

796
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,320
I will.

797
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,240
Let’s go.

798
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,080
Bye.

799
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,320
See you soon.

800
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:38,720
[Phone ringing]

801
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,760
Hello?

802
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,560
"Have you read the email I sent you?"

803
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,440
Oh, I just parked.

804
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,440
I’ll check it now.

805
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,320
"Go ahead and open it."

806
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,840
"I’m sure you’ll be pleased."

807
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,480
Who’s Phe talking to?

808
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,040
Golf?!

809
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,960
- (Next episode)
- Do you have any idea

810
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,000
where Phetai is now?

811
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,160
Where’s my half a million!?

812
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,720
I don’t want to investigate Ploy anymore.

813
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,240
Think carefully, Pun.

814
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,040
What’s the most important thing right now?

815
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,040
Pun, everyone just wants to help you.

816
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,480
But we can’t unless you open up to us.

817
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,000
I don’t like liars, you know.

818
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:10,280
“Welcome to Heart Pop Sports Day!”

819
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,160
Having you here already feels lucky enough.
