00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,920
left of what you still feel for me,

5
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,800
I won’t let go.

6
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,160
Can you just stop bothering me?

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,320
We’ve been through a lot.

8
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,640
I’m sorry everything turned out this way.

9
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,120
You wouldn’t understand

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,240
what it's like to feel unimportant.

11
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,160
That place you keep saying
you’re stuck in the middle,

12
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,040
I’m there with you.
Dad and Mom are there with you too.

13
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,560
I’ve always been proud of you, Pun.

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,920
Ploy gave me that million
to pass it on to you.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,360
To test whether you’d choose her or the money.

16
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,840
If there’s anyone who knows her best,
it’s you, isn’t it?

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,040
I’m really sorry.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,800
You can trust me, Ploy.

19
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,760
I do trust you.

20
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:10,880
People from New York!

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,680
Run!

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,920
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,600
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

24
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:38,120
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,000
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,320
♫ The closer we become ♫

27
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,479
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,479
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,080
♫ Game for your love ♫

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,760
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

31
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,880
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,199
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

33
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,480
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

34
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,960
♫ Game Over ♫

35
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,360
What? Where’s everyone gone?

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
Hello?

37
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
No one’s here.

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,400
Ahem.

39
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,920
How did you get here?

40
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
I came to watch those two fall in love.

41
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,120
Hope it’s real love, though.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,720
I’ve got a really bad feeling about this.

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,320
Oh, come on. Trust me.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,520
Those two are definitely getting together.
I’ll bet my life on it.

45
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,040
(gunfire)

46
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,680
Whoa!

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,000
What was that?

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,280
Sounded like an explosion.

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
Let’s split up and look.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,920
You two go that way.
I’ll head over here.

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,920
Be careful, Prang.

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:30,920
(gunfire)

53
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,280
(screams)

54
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,600
Okay.

55
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,600
How did you find me here?

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,640
I mean… I mean…

57
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,640
You wouldn’t want to kill me, right?

58
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,800
Because if you wanted me dead…
I’d already be dead.

59
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,200
Alright.

60
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
Are you two okay?

61
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
What the hell is going on, Phe?

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,480
What happened?

63
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,600
Sorry, but I don’t have time to explain right now, okay?

64
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,040
If I get the chance, I’ll explain everything, okay?

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,360
(gunfire)

66
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,560
Pun.

67
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,600
I’ll lead.

68
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,280
We should split up.

69
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,840
He’s after me, not you.

70
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,320
No.

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,440
We’re going together.

72
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:10,960
Let’s go.

73
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,800
Ouch.

74
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,000
Ploy!

75
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,680
I really shouldn’t have worn heels.

76
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,440
What are you doing?
You’re going to hurt your feet.

77
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,480
Come on.

78
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,240
Don’t lie to me again, okay?

79
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
What?

80
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,080
If we make it out of this,

81
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,680
You have to promise you’ll never lie to me again.

82
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,160
No matter what...

83
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,000
Same goes for you, Ploy.

84
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
No matter how angry you are at me,

85
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
don’t go sleeping with anyone else again.

86
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,440
I didn’t sleep with anyone.

87
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,200
Didn’t sleep with anyone?

88
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,240
What about the kiss mark, back then?

89
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,200
Do you know how many nights
I had nightmares about that?

90
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,560
I dreamed that

91
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
your whole body was covered in
someone else’s marks.

92
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
It almost happened, Pun.

93
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,920
But I couldn’t do it.

94
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,600
Because all I could think about was you.

95
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,400
“Almost” isn’t good enough.

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,680
I get jealous and a little possessive, you know?

97
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,760
I don’t like anyone touching you.

98
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,680
Well, if you hadn’t lied to me that day…

99
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,000
You lied too, Ploy!

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,920
Yeah, but you shouldn’t have started it.

101
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,160
Ugh!

102
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,120
Are you seriously picking a fight with me now?

103
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,920
I thought we’d already sorted this out.

104
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,560
I’ve been holding it in, Pun.

105
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,040
I was afraid I’d die without saying it.

106
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,880
If you’re afraid you’ll die,

107
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,400
then say something nice before you do.

108
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,920
I love you, Pun.

109
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,360
I love you too, Ploy.

110
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,280
Let’s go.

111
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:24,800
Get in!

112
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,400
(engine starts)

113
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,080
Ploy…

114
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,159
Ploy, I’m scared.

115
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:43,559
It’s alright.

116
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,440
Everything’s going to be okay.

117
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,000
You’re going to be alright, Pun.

118
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,560
I promise.

119
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,280
Hold on tight, okay?

120
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:09,760
(gunfire)

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,280
(gunfire)

122
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,040
(gunfire)

123
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,680
(gunfire)

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,520
(tire screeching)

125
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,960
He’s still following us.

126
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,680
(siren wailing)

127
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,240
Put your gun down. Now!

128
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,240
- ​Clear!
- Hey, someone’s here to help us, Ploy!

129
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,760
- Move.
- Take them into custody.

130
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,360
We’re safe now.

131
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,000
Hey!

132
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,440
Ploy?

133
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,280
Ploy. What’s wrong?

134
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,480
No…

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Ploy. Don’t be like this.

136
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,680
No, I don't want this.

137
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,680
Can you hold my hand?

138
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,960
Don’t let go, okay?

139
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,760
My butterfly.

140
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,200
No.

141
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,920
Ploy. Don’t leave me.

142
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,760
Help!

143
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,640
Help!

144
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,800
Help! Someone’s been shot.

145
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,360
“Alert the station. We need an ambulance.”

146
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,680
Ploy…

147
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,640
Ploy, please…

148
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,080
Ploy… Ploy…

149
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,240
Ploy…

150
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,560
(2 years later)

151
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,680
“It’s been two years.”

152
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,440
“But I still dream about you.”

153
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,600
“Every moment, good or bad,”

154
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,000
“comes back to me in my sleep,
never the same dream twice.”

155
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,000
“But every dream...”

156
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,360
“is always about Ploy.”

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,760
“Often, I sneak away from the rush of life”

158
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,840
“to sit here alone,
to take in the tranquility.”

159
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
“I put on my headphones
and listen to the same old songs,”

160
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:25,400
“the ones I always play when I miss...”

161
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,720
“the girl with the nice scent.”

162
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,960
“And here…”

163
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,280
“is where I let my thoughts spill freely
onto the canvas.”

164
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,000
“It would be nice if you were here.”

165
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,040
“Being alone in the house,”

166
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,880
“it’s cold.”

167
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,280
“And lonely.”

168
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,440
“I miss the warm kitchen…”

169
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,880
“and the person who would hug me from behind
while we cooked together.”

170
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,240
“It’s hard to believe”

171
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,200
“that this much time has passed already.”

172
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,920
“Over two years of living here”

173
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,960
“and besides the seasons,”

174
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,040
“so many other things have changed.”

175
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,080
(phone ringing)

176
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,680
Hello?

177
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,960
Hi, Pun.

178
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,760
I’m not coming home tonight.
I’m staying at my girlfriend’s.

179
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,800
Anne’s letting you stay over now?

180
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Not yet, but…

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,720
tonight’s the night.

182
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,160
And you’re not doing anything today?

183
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,600
Nope.

184
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,800
I’ve been swamped with work all week.

185
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,680
I just want a full day of sleep.

186
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Sure you won’t end up
overthinking and crying alone?

187
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,360
You’re one to talk, Phe!

188
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
Crying because your girl
won’t let you in the house.

189
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

190
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,080
Take care, okay? Grab something to eat.

191
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,720
Okay.

192
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,800
“Phe’s dating a Thai girl now.”

193
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,840
“She’s the new chef”

194
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,280
“who joined the restaurant recently.”

195
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
“As for me,”

196
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,280
“life in New York has been good.”

197
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,480
“My career is moving forward.”

198
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,800
“And I finally have my green card.”

199
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,760
“Comfortable life, good quality of living.”

200
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,760
“All that’s left...”

201
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,080
“is the longing”

202
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,680
“that never fades.”

203
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,960
(phone ringing)

204
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,520
Hello, Dad.

205
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,560
“Hello, Pun. When are you
coming back to Thailand?”

206
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,800
Hold on. I’ll check for you.

207
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,880
“I rarely go back to Thailand
since moving to New York.”

208
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,640
“And of course, Dad nags me about it all the time.”

209
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,360
“Find some time to come home, okay?”

210
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,280
I'm still upset about it.

211
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,120
About what happened two years ago.

212
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,040
Yes, I know… I know.

213
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,480
I’ll make some time
and come visit you soon, promise.

214
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,520
“Good girl.”

215
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,720
From now on, tell Mom and Dad everything.

216
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,800
Don’t hide things, big or small.

217
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,920
Yes, sir. Understood, Commander.

218
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,800
I’ll probably go back
around the end of next month.

219
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,640
“Alright. Don’t cancel on us again.”

220
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,760
“That’s all. Love you.”

221
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,920
“My family never knew
about the loan or the mafia.”

222
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,880
“not until Prang found out Ploy was shot.”

223
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,280
Everything came out.”

224
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,079
“I got scolded to hell and back.”

225
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,640
“Even Prang didn’t defend me.”

226
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,120
“This kind of music”

227
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,560
“reminds me of when I came here
two years ago.”

228
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,920
“I sat here alone”

229
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,000
“until hope showed up again
when I returned home.”

230
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,440
“But now...”

231
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,680
“I sit here, alone again.”

232
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,800
I wish you were here with me.

233
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,520
“Are you thinking about someone?”

234
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,920
Ploy.

235
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,640
"Ploy…"

236
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,600
“Ploy, don’t leave me. Please.”

237
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,120
Ploy.

238
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
Ploy, don’t leave me.

239
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,560
Ploy.

240
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,080
Pun.

241
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,320
How’s Ploy?

242
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,640
She’s already in the emergency room.

243
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,920
It’s okay, it’s okay.

244
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,080
It’s alright, Pun.

245
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,120
Ploy will be fine.

246
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,120
Yes, Pun. She’ll be fine.

247
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,280
The doctors here are really good.

248
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,000
Phe, can you sit still?

249
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,760
Everyone’s stressed right now.

250
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,600
The patient is stable now.

251
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,240
The bullet didn’t hit any vital organs.

252
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,440
But she’ll still need some time to recover.

253
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
I’ll take my leave.

254
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
From what you said,
weren’t they all arrested already?

255
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,840
Some of them managed to escape.

256
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,040
Once their boss was caught,
the members wanted revenge.

257
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,720
But...

258
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,040
I just didn’t think they’d follow us
all the way to Thailand.

259
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,520
I’m sorry. This is all my fault.

260
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,080
I’m the reason everyone got dragged into this.

261
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,720
(phone vibrating)

262
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,600
Excuse me.

263
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,120
Hello?

264
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,240
Ploy.

265
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,920
Prang, Ploy’s awake.

266
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,520
Ploy.

267
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,880
I’ll go get the doctor.

268
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,360
How are you feeling?

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,120
Ever since I met you,

270
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,200
I’ve ended up in the hospital so many times.

271
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,880
Am I your bad luck charm?

272
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,400
You’re a troublemaker.

273
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,160
Ploy...

274
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
I’m sorry.

275
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,520
For making you get hurt like this.

276
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,880
When I see you right here beside me,

277
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,400
maybe it was worth it.

278
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,680
Phetai, is your sister awake yet?

279
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,040
“Not yet.”

280
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,040
“All because of you.”

281
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,960
“Didn’t I tell you to stop behaving like this?”

282
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,280
“And look how it turned out.”

283
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
“Your sister ended up taking the hit for you.”

284
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,560
“Keep your voice down. This is a hospital.”

285
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,920
“Mom… it’s my fault.”

286
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,640
I’m sorry. I really am.

287
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,520
Sorry?

288
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,760
You’re saying sorry, does that stop your sister’s pain?

289
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,440
And what if something worse had happened to her?

290
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
How would I live with that?

291
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,760
“I can’t lose another child, not again.”

292
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,000
“It’s alright, love.”

293
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
She’s safe now.

294
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,360
It’s alright. She’s safe.

295
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,000
And what if she ends up scarred?

296
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,320
How will you make it right?

297
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:19,480
Mom.

298
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,360
Plastic surgeons these days are really skilled.

299
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,360
Their work is flawless.

300
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,000
At worst she’ll have, like…

301
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,480
a tiny little scar. Barely noticeable.

302
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,760
How are you so chill about this?

303
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,160
It’s your sister’s life.

304
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,640
Your own sister’s life!

305
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,480
And you think I don’t know that?

306
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,960
You think I don’t feel guilty?

307
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,080
“I know all of this is my fault, Mom.”

308
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,480
“You think I’m standing here chilled?”

309
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,400
“You think what I said just now
means I’m not worried about her?”

310
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,400
“You think you and Dad are
the only ones who care?”

311
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,200
I know it’s my fault.

312
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
All of this is on me.

313
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,760
What more do you want, Mom?
I’m already trying my best.

314
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,600
- But what you did before that…
- That’s enough.

315
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,160
Enough from both of you.
Go on. Go visit your sister.

316
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,840
Go, go. You too.

317
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,760
Calm down.

318
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,000
You’re awake?

319
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,400
Here.

320
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,720
Chicken Pad Krapow, not spicy.

321
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,480
Yours.

322
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,840
Does it hurt?

323
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,160
I’m sorry.

324
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,960
It hurts so much, Mom.

325
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,680
It’s alright now.

326
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,120
Mom’s here now.

327
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,160
Have some water.

328
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
Let me help you.

329
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,200
Thank you.

330
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:02,880
The doctor said…

331
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,960
you need to stay in the hospital
for another week.

332
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,160
Oh? And you…?

333
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,080
I’ve already taken leave from work.

334
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,240
I took the whole month off.

335
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,280
So I can be here for Prang’s wedding too.

336
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,320
Isn’t that still months away?

337
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Oh, that…

338
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,120
They moved it up.
It’ll just be a small family ceremony.

339
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,800
Right?

340
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,960
Honey, tell Ploy.

341
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,800
What? Why don’t you say it yourself?

342
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,880
I’m too shy.

343
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,120
Shy about what?

344
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,680
Just tell her.

345
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,080
Look at the ring.

346
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
“After facing danger,”

347
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,800
“and seeing my friend
nearly die in front of me.”

348
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,720
I realized how unpredictable life is.

349
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,600
And once I understood my own heart,

350
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,760
I don’t want to waste even a single second.

351
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,240
I want to spend all the time I have left

352
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,720
with the person I love.

353
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,000
And I promise
I’ll do everything to make you happy.

354
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,600
Throughout the time we’ve been together,

355
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,720
it has made me realize

356
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
that no matter how different we are…

357
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,360
no matter when we disagree...

358
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,600
or whatever problems we face…

359
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,040
just looking into your eyes,

360
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,120
I feel safe.

361
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,800
Just holding hands like this.

362
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,840
It makes me believe

363
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,800
that we can overcome anything together.

364
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,560
I feel so, so lucky

365
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,320
to have you in my life.

366
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,600
Thank you so much, Prang.

367
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,320
Ahem.

368
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,560
As your dear friend and family,

369
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,840
I hereby pronounce you both

370
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,680
married,

371
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,560
partners for life.

372
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,560
May you always be happy.

373
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,320
Yay!

374
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,600
Kiss!

375
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,640
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

376
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,960
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

377
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,840
♫ You’re my Love Game ♫

378
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,440
♫ Only you can make me feel the same ♫
-  Yay!

379
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,240
♫ Don’t you know my heart’s gone wild inside? ♫

380
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,200
♫ All I want is you here by my side ♫

381
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
- ♫ Forever, is that fine? ♫
- We’re married!

382
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,960
You’re heading back tomorrow, right?

383
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,240
I’m sorry.

384
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,760
I haven't really spent much time with you.

385
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,640
What do you mean?

386
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,920
You’ve been taking care of me for days.

387
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,840
That counts as spending time together already.

388
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,040
Pun.

389
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,200
Hm?

390
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,400
What about us?

391
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,960
I actually wanted to talk to you
about that too.

392
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,520
I don’t think I’d be very okay,

393
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,560
being the woman having an affair
with my own sister-in-law.

394
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,600
So here’s the thing, Ploy

395
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,120
I’ve made my decision.

396
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
I’m not moving back to Thailand.

397
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,080
It might sound selfish,

398
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,360
but…

399
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,240
my life in New York is my dream.

400
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,560
I once gave up everything to be with you.

401
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,120
But when you were gone,

402
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,040
I had nothing left.

403
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,040
And I don’t want you, Ploy,

404
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,360
to give up everything to come live with me.

405
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,640
Do you want us

406
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,600
to be long-distance or something?

407
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,560
Yes.

408
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,320
But I really believe

409
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,760
our love is strong enough.

410
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,800
We’ll find a way through it.

411
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,440
What do you think, Ploy?

412
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,080
“After that, we lived
across the world for two years.”

413
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,040
“I missed you terribly.”

414
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,960
I missed you terribly too.

415
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,440
“At first it seemed okay.”

416
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,200
“We still talked often.”

417
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,080
Love you.

418
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,640
“But it was only through a tiny screen.”

419
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,440
“Oh, I have to go now.”

420
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,640
You’re leaving already?

421
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,800
“Bye-bye.”

422
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,120
Bye-bye.

423
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,199
“What’s worse”

424
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,560
“is that our free time stopped lining up,”

425
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,480
“because of the ten-hour time difference.”

426
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,400
“I tried to make time to fly over to see her.”

427
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
“And even though seeing her made me happy,”

428
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,880
“Every time I came back, a scandal followed me home.”

429
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,639
(”Actress with initial P spotted in the US.
Rumoured to be rising toward lead-role status.”)

430
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,040
“Being exhausted then coming home
with no one to hold.”

431
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,880
“Missing someone…”

432
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,800
“but being unable to do anything about it.”

433
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,240
“(sighs) I think…”

434
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,560
“Each day, it’s getting harder for me.”

435
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,680
Hey, we haven’t talked in so long.

436
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,280
Don’t you want to start with something nice, Ploy?

437
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,440
“I just want you to know how I feel.”

438
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,240
I do know.

439
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
But when we finally get to talk,

440
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,960
I want that to be
the happiest moment for us.

441
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,680
“we’re not going to talk about our problems at all?”

442
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,560
“If I’m tired, ”

443
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,280
“do I just have to keep it inside?”

444
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,560
Do you think you’re the only one struggling?

445
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,640
I’m hurting too.

446
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,040
Every time I want to call you,

447
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,280
I can’t because you’re working.

448
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,520
I’ve been eating alone for so long.

449
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,240
I don’t like it either.

450
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,920
And do you think I’m okay

451
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,200
with you not visiting me for months at a time?

452
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,000
“Yes.”

453
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,360
“I know you must be tired too.”

454
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,320
“That’s why I think”

455
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,400
“long-distance just isn’t working anymore.”

456
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,480
Ploy…?

457
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,160
Ploy, what do you mean?

458
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,720
“I think”

459
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,040
“we should end things here.”

460
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
Ploy, do you mean

461
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,920
our relationship ends just like that?

462
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,800
“You didn’t even let me finish before crying?”

463
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,000
Such a crybaby.

464
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,160
Ploy…

465
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,600
There, there.

466
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,000
Don’t cry.

467
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,880
Hey, how did you get here?

468
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,280
Why didn’t you tell me?
I would’ve picked you up.

469
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,440
And what was that 'ending things' about?

470
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,480
I don’t want that. I’m not ending anything.

471
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,160
There, there, Pun.

472
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,560
Are you hungry?

473
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,080
Let’s go get something to eat.

474
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,480
Huh?

475
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,480
Come here. There, there.

476
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,480
Alright, alright. I won’t tease you anymore.

477
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,840
I’m really happy you came to see me.

478
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,680
But…

479
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,080
aren’t you going to explain anything?

480
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,840
I was planning to surprise you.

481
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,920
So...

482
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,160
what you said earlier was just teasing?

483
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:02,760
No.

484
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,360
I meant every word.

485
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,640
Then...

486
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,840
does that mean you’re breaking up with me?

487
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,080
Are you?

488
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,240
No.

489
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,600
What?

490
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,480
I’m so confused.

491
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,920
Try a bite first.

492
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,680
Then I’ll tell you.

493
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,120
How does it taste?

494
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,160
It’s good.

495
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:53,960
And...

496
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,960
what do you think of this restaurant?

497
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,680
Mhm.

498
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,040
It’s nice. I like it.

499
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,640
I remember walking past here often before.

500
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,640
But it looks familiar.

501
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,280
I don’t think it looked like this back then.

502
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Mhm.

503
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,440
And...

504
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,440
do you see that wall over there?

505
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,600
Don’t you think it looks a bit too empty?

506
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
It does look empty, yes.

507
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,560
But why? It has nothing to do with us.

508
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
I was thinking…

509
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,200
of asking you to help decorate it.

510
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
- Pun.
- Mm-hmm.

511
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,160
- This restaurant…
- Mm-hmm.

512
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,480
Do you know the owner, Ploy?

513
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,200
You’re talking to the owner right now.

514
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,320
This restaurant is ours.

515
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,560
Ji.

516
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,040
I have something to talk to you.

517
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,320
Yes?

518
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,800
If I move to New York,

519
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,360
what do you think about that?

520
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,720
Are you sure, Ploy?

521
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:48,600
Yes.

522
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,440
Then go.

523
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,040
If that’s what you want,

524
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,920
no one can stop you.

525
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,720
And your happiness

526
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,560
is over there.

527
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,720
So it’s right for you to go.

528
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:13,760
Isn’t it?

529
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,240
I can really go, right?

530
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,320
Yes, you really can.

531
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,480
“I’ve been taking fewer jobs since last year.”

532
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,240
“As for the shoe brand,
I handed it over to Min to manage.”

533
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,280
“And every time I flew to see you,”

534
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,760
“I secretly kept looking for a place.”

535
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,560
I think this location is great.

536
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,600
The owner’s moving back to Thailand,
so they sold it.

537
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,080
I think it’s better than starting from scratch.

538
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,480
Why aren’t you in bed yet?

539
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,800
- I’m going to.
- Hm?

540
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,720
I asked Ploy, not you.

541
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,440
Fine…

542
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,080
Phe was chatting with me for fun.

543
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,840
- I’m going to bed.
- Let’s go to bed.

544
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,480
Good night, brother.

545
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:56,080
Mm.

546
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:56,960
Bye-bye.

547
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:04,160
Are you saying
you’re moving here?

548
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,040
Well, since you won’t come back to Thailand,

549
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,440
I figured I’d move here instead. Problem solved.

550
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,520
But…

551
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,880
I don’t want you to give everything up because of me.

552
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,240
I don’t want to hold you back.

553
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,320
I’m not giving anything up.

554
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
I’m just done.

555
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,520
And ready to start over.

556
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,800
I don’t need anything else in my life,
except you.

557
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,880
My dream

558
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:52,960
is simply to be with you.

559
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,040
I only want you.

560
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,000
“Many times, life feels like walking
a long, dark road.”

561
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,880
“It makes us afraid.”

562
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,760
“Afraid of taking the wrong step.”

563
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,400
“Afraid of falling.”

564
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,200
“Because we think we’re walking it alone.”

565
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,120
“And the shadows around us”

566
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,760
- “feel empty.”
- (“How are you doing?”)

567
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,680
“In the end, that fear
keeps us from moving forward.”

568
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,040
“But what if”

569
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,880
“in those shadows,”

570
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:34,000
“there’s someone else walking too?”

571
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,440
“Walking alongside us.”

572
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,400
“Seeing us.”

573
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,120
“Or maybe”

574
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,200
“to keep walking through life…”

575
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,520
“all we really need is to believe.”

576
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,960
“Believe that someone
will stand by us sincerely.”

577
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,280
“And that we deserve that sincerity.”

578
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,760
“Believe that we’re allowed to make mistakes.”

579
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,520
“Allowed to fall.”

580
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,040
“Because there will always be someone,”

581
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,600
“who reaches out and catches us.”

582
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,840
Again?
