1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,880
(Previously on "Player")

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,800
Oh no! Pun, you're screwed!

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,840
Once you get your green card and citizenship,
we can just get a divorce.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,640
There are some expenses for it.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,560
A million baht!?

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,400
Bangkok...

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,200
He must have run off
with the money back to Bangkok.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,840
I want my money back!

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,440
I found a picture of Phetai’s mom!

10
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,880
So, you're saying...

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,600
This Ploy knows Phetai?

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,560
Nice pick.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,120
This is my all-time favorite.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
But this time I'm sure, Jieab.

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,640
That this Ploy Pitcha...

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,160
must have what I'm looking for.

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,800
[Sound of glasses clinking]

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,400
Let's go home.
There's a fight breaking out.

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,320
Yeah, I was wanting to leave anyway.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,000
He's probably not coming anymore.

21
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,760
Hey, I'm going in to help them.

22
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,520
You sit tight, stay right here.

23
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,400
Don't go anywhere. Okay?

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,800
Hey! Hello...

25
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:35,840
Excuse me...

26
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,479
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,520
("The Deviana")

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,600
"Seriously, who wrote her into my scene today?"

29
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,320
I usually see you at Jay's room.

30
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,920
How did you end up in this room today?

31
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,360
We came to get our stuff today.

32
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,640
And what about you, Ploy? Where have you been?

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,240
I just came from an event.

34
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,040
What's wrong?

35
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,079
Nothing.

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,880
By the way, this young lady...

37
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,320
Who is she?

38
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,760
That's my younger sister. It's Pun,
the one I told you about.

39
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,600
Hello.

40
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,800
So you're Pun.

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,200
Cute...

42
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,920
Just like Prang described.

43
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,399
[clearing throat]

44
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Ploy.

45
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,120
Spreading your charm the moment you arrive?

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,720
Not at all.

47
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,400
I was just complimenting her.

48
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,360
Your outfit is cute.

49
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,960
“Is she messing with me?”

50
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,920
So, I'll give you this room.

51
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,720
Huh?

52
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,920
So you can have some privacy.

53
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,960
Wouldn't you like it?

54
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,600
Oh, please...

55
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,680
Just say you want to be alone with Jay.

56
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,120
I wasn't going to say it at first.

57
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,360
I was afraid the single people would get envious.

58
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,080
But yes.

59
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,720
Come on, let's go get our stuff.

60
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,280
Okay.

61
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,520
You're leaving now?

62
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,600
I'll be back.

63
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Stay with me first.

64
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,160
We’re just next door.

65
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Thank you for...

66
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,280
not saying anything to embarrass me.

67
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,880
Not at all. I feel sorry for you poor kid.

68
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,600
And...

69
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,480
What happened last night?

70
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,920
Why did I end up in your room?

71
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,720
Call me "P’Ploy" first,

72
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,240
and then I'll tell you.

73
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,760
Okay.

74
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,240
P'Ploy.

75
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,840
I was about to leave the pub.

76
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,360
And I saw you sitting drunk.

77
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,000
Hey, I'm going in to help them.

78
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,800
You sit tight, stay right here.

79
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,520
Don't go anywhere. Okay?

80
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
Hey... Hello?

81
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,480
Hey…

82
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,280
Hey, you.

83
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,800
Hmm.

84
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,720
You okay?

85
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,720
I saw two men walking towards you.

86
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,640
They looked suspicious,
so I took you with me.

87
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,560
Min, pull over.

88
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,440
- Wanna come inside with us?
- Nah.

89
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,720
- You wanna come with us, babe?
- Want to keep the party going?

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,080
Excuse me.

91
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
She's with me.

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,920
Where do you live? I'll take you home.

93
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,120
- Careful.
- Be careful.

94
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,960
And...

95
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
Why...

96
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,840
was I naked?

97
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,720
The two of us...

98
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,520
We didn't do anything, did we?

99
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Thank you, bitch.

100
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,280
Oh my!

101
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,720
I changed your clothes and wiped you clean.

102
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,240
But it was so hard to get you into pajamas.

103
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,400
You kept struggling so much I couldn't do it.

104
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,720
Uh...

105
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,320
I'm going to the toilet.

106
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,240
Let's do Chicken Ka Prao today.

107
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,960
Your favorite. No chilies, okay?

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,120
I'll help you.

109
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,160
Okay.

110
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,600
Prang is cooking?

111
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,080
I can hear you, Pun.

112
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,240
Teacher Ploy has been teaching her lately.

113
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
You guys...

114
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,200
Are you close?

115
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,880
With Ploy?

116
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,720
I guess so? I don't know.

117
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,560
We've never labeled the relationship.

118
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,200
And...

119
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,960
Does Ploy have any siblings?

120
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,200
Or...

121
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
Does she have a girlfriend yet?

122
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,240
What's with all the questions?

123
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Well...

124
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,960
I saw she's close with Prang.

125
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Aren't you jealous?

126
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,840
Not with this one.

127
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,160
So that's a thing?

128
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,240
By the way... how do you all know each other?

129
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,360
If you want the media trained answer...

130
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
We were co-stars in a TV drama.

131
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,720
As for those two, they were already close.

132
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,960
But if you want the hardcore answer...

133
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,320
I used to hit on Ploy and got rejected.

134
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,040
As for those two, they used to date
during the time Prang and I broke up.

135
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,160
What?

136
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,920
Are you kidding me?

137
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Heh.

138
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,520
She used to date? With your sister?

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,000
Yeah.

140
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,160
And this plan you have, what is it?

141
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
Yeah, I have a plan.

142
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,360
Which is?

143
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,800
Use my charm, obviously.

144
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,040
I knew it.

145
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,880
Have you thought this through?

146
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,280
She's your sister's ex-girlfriend.

147
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,440
I'll just use my charm for a bit.

148
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,160
Once I get the information, I'll pull back.

149
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,320
Prang? She won't even realize what's up.

150
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,320
This sounds familiar.

151
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
Like when you made a deal with Phe.

152
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,520
Marry for a bit, get the citizenship, then divorce.

153
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,880
And how did that turn out?

154
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,920
You didn't even get to marry him before he ran off with your money.

155
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,840
It's not the same thing.

156
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,360
But what if...

157
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,400
she actually starts to like you? What will you do?

158
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,480
Just dump her?

159
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
Mmm, I guess so.

160
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,600
Gosh...

161
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,880
Why don't you just ask her?

162
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,160
"Excuse me, do you know Phe?"

163
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,320
"He took a million baht from me."

164
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,840
"Please help me." That's it.

165
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,120
Don't forget that they know each other.

166
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:40,120
What if they're covering for each other?
What do I do then?

167
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,680
I'm tired of warning you.

168
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,400
Do whatever you want.

169
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,000
But don't come crying to me then.

170
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,760
No way. I'm a pro.

171
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,960
Thanks for the warning.

172
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,760
Yeah.

173
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,800
You gorgeous thing.

174
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,080
You little Casanova.

175
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,560
However much she feels for you...

176
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,280
I curse you...

177
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,040
to feel a hundred times more for her!

178
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,520
Amen, Pun.

179
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,280
"No way."

180
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,920
“First step...."

181
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,000
- (“Plan A”)
- “Win her heart with sweets.”

182
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,680
Here. I came to return your clothes.

183
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,440
And also with...

184
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,240
A thank you dessert.

185
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Thank you.

186
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,840
But I’m on a diet.

187
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,520
But this is from my favorite shop.

188
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,240
There are orange cake and custard.

189
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,200
P'Ploy, please take it.

190
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,520
Give it to a friend, if you want.

191
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,920

192
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,800
Anything else?

193
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
Oh, right...

194
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,840
That day, I think I might have lost an earring at your place.

195
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,720
Can I come in and look for it?

196
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,360
- See? They're missing.
- Really?

197
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,240
But there were nothing when I cleaned it.

198
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,240
Well...

199
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,440
It could be in a nook or a cranny, you know.
You might not have found it, yet.

200
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,360
But... I believe it really fell in there.

201
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,760
Can I please come in and look?
If it's not too much trouble.

202
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,440
Okay.

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,880
Thank you.

204
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,160
Where is it...

205
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,560
Where do you think you dropped it?

206
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,720
Uh, that day... I was around here.

207
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,120
Here, there, and the bedroom too.

208
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,640
Okay, you'll look around here. I'll go check upstairs.

209
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,560
Okay.

210

212
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,640
What about the dressing room?
I went in there to change.

213
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,800
Nothing.

214
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,600

Okay.

218

I'm not free yet.

219
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
You didn't come that day.

220
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,240
But I'll think about whether
I can meet you or not.

221
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760

222
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,120

Oh.

225
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,480
I can't find it at all, Ploy.

226
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,400
You seem very close to Prang.

227
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,960
That picture was taken about 2 years ago.

228
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,800
You look like your mother, Ploy.

I have to take a work call. Be right back.

234
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,000
Okay.

235
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,560
What's up, Jieab?

236

237
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,120
He's back, did you know?

238
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,119
“Maybe you should go talk to him?
Wasn't he the one who introduced you to Phe?”

239
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,119
He's back?

240
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,880
I don't know.

241
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,440
I haven't been reading his messages lately.

242
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,520
He's asking for a relationship status.

243
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,599
It's uncomfortable.

“This is the result of being a player.”

245
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,720

Uh, well...

250
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,120
Pun, I'm seriously warning you.

251
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,920
If you're still going to...

252
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,160
Hey, the signal is bad. I have to go...

Are you looking for this?

256
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,520
Yes! This is it.

257
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,840
Aren't you going to ask where I found it?

258
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,280
Right.

259
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,440
Where did you find it, Ploy?
You're so good!

260
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,520
I looked for so long and didn't see them.

261

In the sofa crevice.

262
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,240
It's strange, isn't it?

263
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,240
I cleaned the other day and didn't see them at all.

264
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,800
It might be because of...

265
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,720
destiny, perhaps?

266
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,560

Oh, sure.

273
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,000
Uh...

274
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,080
I've found the earrings, so...

275
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,920
I'll be going now.

“You're so busy paying attention to other's business”

277
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,640
What about yours...

278
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Are you ready to admit you like women?

279
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,200
I...

280
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,440
But I think, for your first time, Pun.

281
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,920
It would be better to look for
someone less player than Ploy.

282
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,800
But...

283
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
I said I didn't.

284
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,080
Ploy is like a flower that lures in insects.

285
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,480
Just a sweet glance from her, and people swarm.

286
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,880
If you fall for her, watch your heart.

287
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,160
What? No.

288
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,520
But I'm rooting for you.

289
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,840
I’m curious what it’d be like,
if someone like Ploy,

290
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,520
fell in love.

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,000
She's here, guys.

369
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,760
What do I do?

370
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,400
Oh...

371
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:44,680
Whoops, the star just walked right by
without a glance.

372
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,200
Jieab.

373
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,800
You're coming with me.

374
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,520
Where?

375
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,520
Let's go!

376
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,520
Me again?

377
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,080
You're it, my dear friend.

378
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,240
Pun!

379
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,320
Pun!

380
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,240
Food support! From Ploy's fan club!

381
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,520
Here you go, for the beautiful Ploy Pitcha.
Here's a straw.

382
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,000
Pun.

383
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,600
You're acting like a stalker,
you know that?

384
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,320
Who ever heard of a stalker this beautiful?

385
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,240
Ake.

386
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,680
We're missing an extra.
What are we gonna do?

387
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,000
She got taken out by the flu.

388
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,520
Try to see if any of the other extras can be switched.

389
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,520
Where are you going?

390
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,560
You heard them. They need an extra.

391
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,480
It's not like if you offer,
they'll just let you do it.

392
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,440
You don't know if you don't try.

393
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,160
Don't, Pun.

394
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
I'm doing it!

395
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,680
Don't. No.

396
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,000
- Let's go!
- No...

397
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
Is this lady available?

398
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,960
I am.

399
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,200
No one else is eating, so excuse me.

400
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,000
- It's for the crew.
- Delicious.

401
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,200
You should try some, Koi.

402
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
- You’re here to stuff yourself?
- Here for the taste.

403
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,600
Where's Pun?

404
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,240
Filming a drama.

405
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,560
What...

406
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,960
Our friend is becoming a star.

407
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:43,040
Oh, Ploy, you're here too?

408
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,800
What a coincidence that
we're acting in the same show.

409
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,480
Oh, Ploy! You're in this show too?

410
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,520
Well, I just applied for fun.

411
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,920
It's such a coincidence
we're in the same show.

412
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,160
Hey, Ploy!
It's me, Pun. Remember?

413
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:06,800
What a coincidence. Wow, we get to be
in the same show. I'm so, so happy.

414
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,120
“Now we're in the same scene.”

415
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,520
“Let's see her not notice me now.”

416
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Heh heh heh.

417
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,280
“Damn it, she really didn't notice.”

418
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,040
“What kind of drama is this?”

419
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,520
Okay, come on.

420
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,200
You only have this one scene today.
It's simple.

421
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,480
It'll be a scene where the villain walks in,
clinging to the protagonist's arm.

422
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,200
And when they walk in together,
you jump out and grab onto the villain.

423
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,120
And she'll scream and be scared.

424
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,720
Okay? Got it?

425
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,840
Yes.

426
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,600
Boo...

427
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,960
Good, excellent.
Just like that. Good.

428
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,200
Come on, come on, we're ready.

429
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
Camera speed!

430
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,720
Ready! And... action!

431
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,520
Grandmother...

432
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
Grandmother, are you here?

433
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,120
Grandmother...

434
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,520
Charles, let's hurry.

435
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,400
I'm scared.

436
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,280
Grandmother.

437
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,520
Grandmother.

438
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,600
Grandmother, are you here?

439
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,320
Proud, don't cling to me so tightly.

440
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,680
Boo!

441
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,520
- Oh!
- Ahh!

442
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,920
Cut! Cut, right now, cut!

443
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,760
Miss... Miss...

444
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,520
Are you okay?

445
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,400
Sorry, I forgot I was supposed to
dodge more slowly.

446
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,880
Ghost girl, you okay?

447
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,800
Come here, I'll help you.

448
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,960
Oh, she's still okay. So...

449
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:14,240
Let's start over. Back to first marks.
Everything clear!

450
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,040
Back to first marks! Come on!

451
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,040
Clear the way. Clear the space.

452
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,880
Clear the set.

453
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,160
Ghost girl, go to your first mark.

454
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,920
So, how was it, big star?
You must have had fun.

455
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,920
And you didn't even
wash off all your makeup.

456
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,120
And what wig is this, Pun?

457
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,920
Don't be so loud. I have a headache.

458
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,360
If you have a headache,
you should have a little drink.

459
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,000
Not anymore.

460
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,800
So you didn't get any special moments, did you?

461
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,000
Of course not.

462
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,840
Ugh...

463
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,440
But not entirely.

464
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,320
Smelled so good.

465
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,800
What?

466
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,080
Nothing.

467
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,560
While you were gone, a bunch of people called.

468
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,880
Here, all your ex-flings.
About 10 million missed calls.

469
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Ugh, I'll talk to them all later.

470
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,520
When am I ever going to have
a proper encounter with her?

471
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,840
“I've tried so hard, in the end…”

472
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,880
“it was this easy to meet her.”

473
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,920
Why is everyone hanging out
in my room so much lately?

474
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,080
Don't you all have jobs to do?

475
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,840
Jay's room is fun.

476
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,480
And what time is this meeting going to end?
I have an early flight tomorrow.

477
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,000
Then you should go to bed, Jay.
Why did you come out?

478
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,960
I need Prang.

479
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,920
Give Prang back to me.
Then all of you can stay until morning.

480
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,400
No. Prang can't go right now.

481
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,840
That's right.

482
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,480
Honey... please, go to bed.

483
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,960
Just a moment, Jay.
I'll be right in. Wait a second.

484
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,120
If you all don't break up this meeting...

485
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,200
I'm calling the police.

486
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,160
Go ahead, call Prang's dad. He's a cop too.

487
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,040
I have his number. Want it?

488
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,920
But it would probably make big news.

489
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,280
Oh!

490
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:52,040
Pok 9, with deng.

491
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,920
- Prang...
- Just a moment, Jay.

492
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,760
The dealer has Pok 8.
I take everyone's money.

493
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:07,200
Wow, the dealer is so lucky.
And I had a (Sam lueang) high card.

494
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,280
Pun, you haven't opened your hand.
What's your score?

495
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,639
4, with 3 deng.

496
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,679
Should we let Pun be the dealer?
Maybe our luck will get better.

497
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,920
No way. If I'm the dealer
I'll end up paying everyone at the table.

498
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,199
- Prang.
- Nope.

499
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,920
You have a lot of money.

500
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,520
Can I have a hundred?
To get back in the game.

501
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,760
No, no, no. No.

502
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,120
Your luck is bad right now,
don't touch my money.

503
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,880
No... stop! Don't touch me.

504
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,280
No... you can not.

505
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,480
Not even you, Ploy?

506
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:58,440
“This is it. The poor little girl act.”

507
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,480
“A little clingy, and she'll fall for it.”

508
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,400
Please? Twenty would be fine.

509
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,840
I can't. My luck is on a roll right now.

510
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,960
I don't want anyone or anything to touch me.

511
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,240
Fifteen...

00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,480
Oh... you ordered while waiting?

518
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,960
You even remembered that I like pizza.

519
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,480
“I didn't remember.”

520
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,720
"I'm at an Italian restaurant.
What was I supposed to order, rice and a fried egg?”

521
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,760
Ball, there's something I want to talk to you.
It won't take long.

522
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,640
What is it?

523
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,880
- (“Ex-Fling #2 Top”)
- Who... who is your new person?

524
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,080
There is no new person, Top.

525
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,720

(“Ex-Fling #3 Mick”)

527
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:59,440
I can give you everything, Pun.
Whether it's a house or a car.

528
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,320
Mick. I just want to live a normal,
simple life.

530

Thee, calm down. Eat slowly.

My muscles aren't big enough, are they?

[Incoherent speech]

535
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,720

Right. Patcha.

I have to thank you, Pun.
It's because of you that I learned...

(“Ex-Fling #6 Golf”)

543
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,760
For the beautiful lady.

544
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,160
Have you been here long, Pun?

545
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,480
The pizza is almost gone.

546
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,400
After being in America, I thought
you would be tired of Western food.

547
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,520
Why don't you just order whatever you want, Golf?

548
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,520
You look cute today.

549
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,800
I like it when you look feminine.

550
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,000
Has it... been too long
since we've seen each other?

551
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,520
Yes.

552
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,560
Are you still unemployed, Pun?

553
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,040
My friend's company is hiring a graphic designer.

554
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,120
I can put in a good word for you,
if you're interested.

555
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,120
No, that's okay.

556
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,040
I've already applied for a job
and I have an interview coming up.

557
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,800
By the way...

558
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,800
Have you been in contact with Phetai?

559
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:51,680
Since I got back to Thailand,
I haven't been able to reach him at all.

560
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,040
You have a problem with Phe?

561
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,240
If there's anything I can do to help...

562
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
You're being so cold.

563
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,000
Can we talk about Phetai first?

564
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,920
So it's true, isn't it?
That you were dating Phe.

565
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,880
And the reason you asked me out today
was just to talk about Phe.

566
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,560
And once you're done,
you're going to dump me like the others, right?

567
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,040
Those three, four, five, six guys.
How could you?

568
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,120
How many, behind my back?

569
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:29,320
You knew I wasn't serious about you, Golf.

570
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,640
And you still kept pushing me for a relationship status.

571
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,640
You were being kind, paying for this and that for me,

572
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,640
I was just going with the flow, trying to be polite.

573
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,440
And don't act like you didn't know
that I was talking to other people.

574
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,560
They were here before you.

575
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,120
And yes.

576
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,400
I came here today because
I want to make it clear.

577
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,720
So, we're over.

578
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,240
Pun...

579
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,760
This meal is on me. If you're not full,
feel free to keep eating.

580
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:58,800
Pun.

581
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,520
Pun!

582
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,880
- Get over here!
- Hey!

583
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,680
Golf!

584
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,320
Let go of me!

585
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
- Golf, let go!
- Stay still!

586
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,560
- Let go of me.
- Stay still.

587
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,160
Be nice and get in the car.

588
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,720
If you want to know about Phe,
get in.

589
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,520
Pun, don't make me force you.

590
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,880
Got it?

591
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,160
Sit nicely.

592
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,280
What the hell?

593
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,040
Pun!

594
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,760
Who's that?

595
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,200
But she looks kind of familiar.

596
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,040
It's Prang, your ex-girlfriend.

597
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:58,160
No way. That one has fierce eyes,
she's fun to tease.

598
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,640
But this one...

599
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
is like a little tiger cub.

600
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,600
You smell so good.

601
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,680
Yeah, I'll handle it. Thanks a lot.

602
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,160
I have to go.

603
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,240
Sure. I'll check my schedule.

604
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
Okay. I'll head out right now.

605
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,480
Hey, she's here, guys.
She's coming to this way.

606
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,800
What do I do? Guys?

607
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:56,440
Food support! From Ploy's fan club!

608
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,040
“We're missing an extra. What do we do?”

609
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,680
Is this lady available?

610
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,520
I am!

611
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,920
“I don't know why…”

612
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,440
Here, I'll help you.

613
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,440
“I always seem to find you when you're falling.”

614
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,080
That girl you told me about,
she came to my restaurant.

615
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,320
And she brought a bunch of guys with her.

616
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,000
For the beautiful lady.

617
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,520
This meal is on me. If you're not full,
feel free to keep eating.

618
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,520
Pun.

619
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,920
“Again.”

620
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,320
“Meet like this again.”

621
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,960
“This time, I won't let you fall.”

622
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,080
- ("Next episode".)
- Are you free tomorrow, Ploy?

623
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,200
I'd like to treat you a thank you meal.

624
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,800
You're all mine, Miss Perfume.

625
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:17,920
- Who's that?
- A friend.

626
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,760
Just a friend? You're not being
a player again, are you?

627
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,200
I can't take this anymore.

628
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,920
I just found out you have an older brother.

629
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,200
Are you close with him?

630
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,800
Pun, why do you seem unusually concerned?

631
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,880
Don't tell me you've already
falling for her, have you?
