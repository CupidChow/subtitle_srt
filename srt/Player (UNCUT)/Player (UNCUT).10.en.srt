00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,000
[Viewer discretion advised]

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,360
- (Previously on "Player")
- Goodbye, Ploy.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,000
How about finding someone new?

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,880
I ran into Bee the other day.

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,640
But last time, she really did a number on Pun.

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,640
You’ve really changed.

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,080
Wanna come to the restroom with me?

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
I’m just bored.
I wanted to find something to do about it.

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,120
Ploy.

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,800
Getting with someone else
just to forget another.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,400
No matter how much you try to fill it,
it’ll never be enough.

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,200
Kiss me now.

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,960
I feel like
I’m being used right now.

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,840
I just want you to be clear about it.

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,840
Leaving things like this only hurts both of you.

17
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,680
I know you got close to me
to find out about Phetai.

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,520
I just wanted you to know

19
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,720
that I love you, Ploy.

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,960
What we had was never real.

21
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,400
It was never real from the start.

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,080
I’ve had enough of being betrayed.

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,000
(2 months later)

24
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,160
"Nice pick."

25
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,680
"This is my all-time favourite."

26
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,440
"I’m not free yet."

27
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,000
"Well, you didn’t show up that day."

28
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,200
“Is it the same again?”

29
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,440
“If it is, I think we’ve already talked about this.”

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,200
Let me think about it again

31
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,640
whether I can meet you or not.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,280
So, which girl have you caused trouble with this time?

33
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,440
There’s some girl from New York looking for you.

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,039
Her name’s Pun.

35
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:37,960
That’s it.

36
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,920
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,600
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,120
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

39
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,000
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

40
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,320
♫ The closer we become ♫

41
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,480
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,480
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

43
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,079
♫ Game for your love ♫

44
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:50,760
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

45
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,880
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

46
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,200
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,480
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,960
♫ Game Over ♫

49
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,320
“Thanks, Ploy.”

50
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,880
"I’ll pay you back as soon as I can."

51
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,560
And don’t forget what I asked for, alright?

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,720
Mm, sure. That’s easy.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,880
Uh… Ploy…

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,240
"Why"

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,160
do you have to make this so complicated?

56
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,079
"I…"

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
"I just don’t get why you want me to…"

58
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,600
"lie to Pun"

59
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,920
"about the day I’m supposed to pay it back."

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,800
Something urgent came up.
I have to go.

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,440
Are you outside?

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,480
Wherever you are, Pun’s on her way to you.

63
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,480
How I know doesn’t matter.

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,800
But you should tell me now

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,800
what’s really going on between you and her.

66
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,960
Then just give her the money back.

67
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,279
End it clean. I’ll transfer it to you.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,519
But I need one thing from you

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,640
You have to pay Pun back

70
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
on the exact day and time I tell you.

71
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,120
"What do you want to eat in Hong Kong?"

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Anything’s fine.

73
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,720
Oh, wait a sec.

74
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,360
“Hello? Pun, right?”

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,880
Who's this?

76
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,760
“Your soon-to-be husband, of course.”

77
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,480
Phetai?

78
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,360
"Why do you want me to stall Pun?"

79
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,600
What are you thinking, Ploy? Can you just tell me?

80
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,960
It’s none of your business.

81
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,760
Ploy.

82
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,280
Come on, I know how you feel about her.

83
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,400
I just don’t get why you have to make it such a mess.

84
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,520
"If you knew from the start,
why didn’t you just talk it out and sort it then?"

85
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,520
"Two of you wouldn’t be fighting like this now."

86
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
No matter what, it was always going to end like this.

87
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,320
Ploy.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,120
If this is how you see it,

89
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,680
why didn’t you just end it
when you knew Pun was digging into things?

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
What were you waiting for?

91
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,720
That’s it.

92
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,440
"Head straight to the studio after this, Jay."

93
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,640
You’ve got an interview at five.

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,960
Pass me the lipstick, please.

95
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
So what’s happening with the wedding?

96
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,600
Given up on it?

97
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,680
No, not at all.

98
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,560
These past two months,
Prang and I have been really busy.

99
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,600
And she’s stressed about Pun too.

100
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,440
If I ask her now, it’ll just kill the mood.

101
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,320
But honestly, if you asked her,

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,120
it might even make her feel better.

103
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,560
I don’t want to risk it.

104
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,800
Feeling a bit hurt, are you?

105
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,360
I get it.

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,480
Prang’s busy and stressed.

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,320
Pun’s situation matters too.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,360
But every day I go home
I barely talk to her.

109
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,200
Every time I ask how she is.

110
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,680
She doesn’t want to talk to me.

111
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,240
She says talking will just drag her down.

112
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,720
So what am I supposed to do?

113
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Take it easy.

114
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,480
Take it easy.

115
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,400
I worry about her, you know.

116
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,440
A lot.

117
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,840
But I’m tired too.

118
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you.

119
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,720
If Pun has any problems,

120
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,560
please let me know.

121
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,600
Thank you.

122
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,240
Phe?

123
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,159
Mm.

124
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,240
She still hasn’t called back?

125
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,400
Not yet.

126
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,240
Prang, I think you should give Pun some space.

127
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,400
Let her breathe a bit.

128
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,320
Once she’s got her head straight, she’ll call you.

129
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,680
But it’s been a few months, Jay.

130
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,320
I know you’re worried about her.

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,520
But she’s not a kid anymore.

132
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
You’ve got to let go.

133
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,800
I just want to talk to Pun
and sort things out. That’s all.

134
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,120
But she’s not ready to talk, Prang.

135
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,320
Try seeing it from her side.

136
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,680
She just doesn’t want you
to be disappointed about the money.

137
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,760
The more you push,
the more you’ll drive her away.

138
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,440
It’s not about the million baht at all, Jay.

139
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,080
Okay, Prang.

140
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,160
You really don’t understand me.

141
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,560
I’m sorry then.

142
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,080
Wait.

143
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,400
What’s wrong?

144
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,520
I’m going to the gym.

145
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,640
Jay.

146
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,320
Jay!

147
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
"Chatr, my love…"

148
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,080
Did you know sometimes even flowers have a heart?

149
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,760
A flower

150
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,920
that can only stay still,

151
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,520
never getting close to anyone,

152
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,520
using nothing but its own scent

153
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,720
to lure in passing insects.

154
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
And one day,

155
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,640
when that flower meets a butterfly

156
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,440
that comes to sip its nectar,

157
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,880
the flower doesn’t think much of it.

158
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
It simply assumes

159
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,800
it’s just another creature dropping by.

160
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,240
But why is it…

161
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,960
why is it that when that butterfly flies away

162
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,160
and never comes back,

163
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,560
the flower...

164
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,520
suddenly finds itself missing it?

165
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,960
Maybe

166
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,240
it was enchanted by its beauty

167
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,880
no other butterfly could match.

168
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,760
But by the time the flower realizes that…

169
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,640
that butterfly

170
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,960
has already flown away for good.

171
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,600
This little flower

172
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
misses that butterfly so terribly.

173
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,480
Misses it so much

174
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,920
its petals have started to wilt

175
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,840
and no one comes near it anymore.

176
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,120
- Ploy! Ploy!
- Ploy!

177
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,800
- Ploy! Ploy!
- Ploy!

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,240
Please! Help her.
Someone grab an inhaler. Quick!

179
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,800
- The inhaler. Hurry! Ploy!
- Miss Ploy? Miss Ploy!

180
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,320
Ploy. Are you alright?

181
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
(”The Deviana”)

182
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,480
"Ploy. Please tell me I’m wrong about this."

183
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
"Lucky me,"

184
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,880
I saw your story today, Ploy.

185
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,200
Otherwise I’d have missed all the fun.

186
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,520
Why is it so tense today?

187
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Who made you so mad?

188
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,240
Why did you stop?

189
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,920
Just go, Pinky. I’m not in the mood.

190
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,240
- Huh?
- Just go.

191
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,800
What the…

192
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,280
(”Dream: I’ve just arrived in Hong Kong.
See you soon.”)

193
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,640
How are you feeling?

194
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Better now.

195
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,640
Thanks.

196
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,480
I brought you some rice porridge.

197
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,400
Do you want to eat now?

198
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,960
I’ll eat it myself.

199
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,200
You can head back, Prang.

200
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,400
Have you spoken to Pun at all?

201
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,320
There’s nothing to talk about.

202
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,000
But you still ask Phe about her.

203
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,640
I talk to Phe too, you know.

204
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,280
I’m sorry, okay?

205
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,480
For dragging you into this mess.

206
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,400
I’m not sure I’m the one

207
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,120
you should apologize to.

208
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,320
Then who?

209
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,080
Pun?

210
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,440
The one who lied to me,

211
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,200
used me over and over for months.

212
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,280
As bad as each other.

213
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,880
You lied to Pun too, didn’t you?

214
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,120
Stop acting like the victim.

215
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,280
If you weren’t like this right now,

216
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
I’d probably slap you.

217
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,040
Go on then. Don’t hold back.

218
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,400
This is from me as Pun’s sister.

219
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,120
And this

220
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,319
is from me as someone who sees you as family.

221
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,040
You’ve never been like this before.
Do you realize that?

222
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,680
Not just now,

223
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,599
but all this time.

224
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,480
Normally, if someone tried to
take advantage of you,

225
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,200
you’d cut them off straight away.

226
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,400
So why now?

227
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
Why?

228
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,280
Why have you let the whole thing
with Pun drag on this long?

229
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,360
I haven’t ‘let’ anything.

230
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,960
It’s like you’ve once said.

231
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,080
If someone plays games with you, you play back.

232
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
If she takes advantage, I get even.

233
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,920
It’s fun, isn’t it?

234
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,520
Why put yourself through this, Ploy?

235
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,960
Doesn’t it hurt?

236
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,120
You okay, Prang?

237
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,080
I’m okay.

238
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,160
(”Pun”)

239
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,360
Don’t call her.

240
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,400
Are you really not going to talk to me?

241
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,720
What, Jay?

242
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,080
The other day you wouldn’t even talk to me.

243
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,640
I get it.

244
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,840
You’re stressed about Pun.

245
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,760
But it’s been over a month now.

246
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,920
When are you going to be yourself again?

247
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,280
Do you even realize

248
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,640
we barely spend time together?
Even when we’re together, we hardly talk.

249
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,120
I want to help you, Prang.

250
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,840
But you won’t let me in.

251
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,680
I’m tired.

252
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,880
I feel like

253
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,600
I’m on the outside.

254
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,880
I’m sorry.

255
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,000
I didn’t mean to make you feel that way.

256
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,600
I’m sorry for not thinking it through

257
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,720
and forgot about how you felt.

258
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,440
You’re free this Saturday, right?

259
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,760
Then, shall we go out?

260
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,280
My treat.

261
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Where?

262
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,400
Smile first, then I’ll tell you.

263
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
(”Best”)

264
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,640
Yes?

265
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,480
"Ploy…"

266
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Pun is really taking it hard.

267
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,280
Do you really feel nothing for her?

268
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,000
"Shame, really. I’ve been rooting for you."

269
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,080
But anyway, just giving you a heads-up.

270
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,240
Pun’s meeting up with Bee today.

271
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,320
She’s her first kiss.

272
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,000
"If you’re starting to cave,
you can always come take a look."

273
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:11,800
Two, please.

274
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,040
Took you long enough, Ploy.

275
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,080
They’re already in the bathroom together.

276
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,200
I’m here to have a drink,
not because of Pun.

277
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,560
You can see I’m with someone.

278
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,680
Obviously, you’re trying to make her jealous.

279
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,240
Are you going after them?

280
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
And is she drunk?

281
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,360
Pun? I don’t think so.

282
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Then she knows exactly what she’s doing.

283
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,160
Ploy?

284
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,560
Yes? What is it?

285
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,360
About that night,

286
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,360
Nothing happened between Pun and me.

287
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,760
I don’t need to know.

288
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,120
But thanks for telling me.

289
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,760
If you can’t let it go,
why not talk to her first?

290
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
This has nothing to do with you.

291
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,880
It does, actually.

292
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,880
I was dragged into this to make you jealous.

293
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,600
Sure.

294
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,560
I can tell.

295
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,240
Are you finished?

296
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,720
Then may I…

297
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,400
If you can see it that clearly,

298
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,200
then you already know

299
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,720
that she loves you, don’t you?

300
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,320
That girl, she’s really been through it.

301
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,360
I hurt her once too, you know.

302
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,520
Thought she’d sworn off love after that.

303
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,400
I’ve no idea what you two argued about

304
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,120
but from what I can see,

305
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
you both still care.

306
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,560
There’s no point staying angry.

307
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,960
You’ll only hurt yourselves.

308
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,440
That’s all I wanted to say.

309
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
Good luck.

310
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,400
"Why put yourself through this, Ploy?"

311
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,000
"Doesn’t it hurt?"

312
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,360
Best,

313
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,680
can you check something for me?

314
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,400
Make sure Pun gets back safely.

315
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,040
"I’m sorry."

316
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,360
"Get out."

317
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,600
I’ve had enough of being betrayed.

318
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
(”Pun’s hug”)

319
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,920
"This bottle will be one of a kind."

320
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,280
When you wear this one,

321
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,720
you’ll see my aura,

322
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,760
hugging you tight.

323
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,520
It’ll fade away.

324
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,360
It’ll fade away.

325
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,600
It’ll fade away.

326
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,480
It’ll fade away.

327
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,120
It’ll fade away.

328
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,040
It’ll fade away, eventually.

329
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,800
It’ll fade away, eventually.

330
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,320
"Wow!"

331
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
You booked out the whole cinema?

332
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,560
It’s been ages since we spent time like this.

333
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,640
Just being with you,

334
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,400
that’s enough to make me happy.

335
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,640
And honestly, I thought

336
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,160
you might’ve forgotten about me.

337
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
I’m sorry.

338
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,400
that I made you feel that way.

339
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,920
I want to be someone you can rely on, Prang.

340
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,240
I want to be by your side.

341
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:13,840
Well…

342
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,640
There's something I want to tell you.

343
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,000
Before this, I tried…

344
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,800
(phone vibrating)

345
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,880
Wait…

346
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,920
Hello?

347
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,080
Oh, sure. I’ll call you back.
One moment.

348
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,200
Okay.

349
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,680
What happened?

350
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Urgent work.

351
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,840
Well,

352
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,680
I need to take this for a bit. I’ll be quick.

353
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,080
Can’t your manager handle it?

354
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,320
Not this one. I have to do it myself.

355
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,760
I won’t be long. Please wait for me?

356
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,080
Prang…

357
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,640
(sighs)

358
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,320
You said we’d spend time together.

359
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,080
You like surprises, don’t you?

360
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,120
Jay.

361
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,360
Jay!

362
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,880
(phone ringing)

363
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,640
Yes, Jae Ang.

364
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,600
Yeah,

365
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
Jay’s here.

366
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,200
"She’s been planning this since sports day?"

367
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,800
I had no idea.

368
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,200
Yeah.

369
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,160
But it fell apart every single time.

370
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,360
(sighs)

371
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,080
Jae Ang,

372
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,480
I think I need your help.

373
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,440
Will you marry me?

374
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,040
We almost didn’t make it here.

375
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,200
I’m really sorry, Prang.

376
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,360
For everything.

377
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,040
And thank you so much.

378
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
I wouldn’t become who I am without you.

379
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,280
I’m sorry too.

380
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,560
For not giving you enough attention before.

381
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,280
I’ll do better I promise.

382
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,840
I love you so much, Prang.

383
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,840
And I love you just as much.

384
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,760
Ready to go to the honeymoon suite?

385
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,560
We’re not even married yet.

386
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,120
It’s the twenty-first century.

387
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,680
No one cares.

388
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,320
Shall we?

389
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,800
Alright.

390
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,520
Why bring me back to school?

391
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,400
Do you remember this spot, Ploy?

392
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,520
It’s where we first met.

393
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,720
What is it?

394
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,480
You disappeared after Hong Kong.

395
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,880
Because there’s nothing left to talk about.

396
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,320
Ploy.

397
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
What do you want?

398
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,560
You.

399
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,640
Don’t you miss me at all?

400
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,760
It’s over, Dream.

401
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,880
It really is.

402
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,520
And I never missed you. Not once.

403
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,440
So everything you did

404
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,000
being sweet one moment and cold the next,

405
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,160
acting like you cared about me,
then shutting me out.

406
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,360
All of that was just to see
how Pun really felt, right?

407
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:24,800
Right?

408
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,120
Thought so.

409
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,400
Heard it didn’t end well, though.

410
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,680
That’s none of your business.

411
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,840
Did she scam you or something?

412
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,800
What rubbish. Who told you that?

413
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
No one. Just saying.

414
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Then stop saying it.

415
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,280
You getting angry

416
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,760
means it’s true, isn’t it?

417
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,880
I’m leaving.

418
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:12,760
Ploy.

419
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,480
Please give me another chance.

420
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,680
That girl wasn’t serious about you anyway.

421
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
The only one who really loves you

422
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,400
who’s stayed true to you is me.

423
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,360
Don’t talk to me about sincerity.

424
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,320
You’re the one who taught me,

425
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,280
you were the first person to show me

426
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,480
that no one in this world is truly sincere.

427
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,960
And it’s always the person you trust most

428
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,400
who lies and betrays me

429
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,600
to get what they want.

430
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,120
Ploy.

431
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,640
Ploy.

432
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,720
I’m sorry.

433
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,440
I never meant

434
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,600
to hurt you like this.

435
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,800
I forgive you, Dream.

436
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,680
But let’s not see each other again.

437
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,360
Ploy.

438
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,920
Ploy.

439
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,000
I still can’t believe she set up
a surprise like that.

440
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,600
I was shocked, nearly died.

441
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Congrats.

442
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,760
Both of you.

443
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,640
Thank you, Ploy.

444
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,200
Come on. I didn’t even do anything.

445
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,600
Ahem. Since we’re here already.

446
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,920
Give us a blessing, Ploy.
Blow on our heads or something.

447
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,160
Oh, stop.

448
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,200
I’m not that old to be giving
wedding blessings, okay?

449
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
What?

450
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,000
Come on, Ploy.

451
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,720
You’ve been a third wheel…

452
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,080
supporting us the whole way.

453
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,800
Come on, give us a blessing.

454
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:25,600
Alright.

455
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,440
I wish the two of you

456
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,960
all the love in the world.

457
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,240
May you stand by each other
through every moment of life.

458
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,920
And even if you’re apart,

459
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,000
may your hearts always remember
the love you share.

460
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,800
May you always be each other’s blessing.

461
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Sathu!

462
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Should we give her a slap?

463
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Yes, please. She’s been annoying me for ages.

464
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,360
Hey, you just proposed to me, remember?

465
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,400
How are you, Ploy?

466
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,560
I’m alright.

467
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,120
You’re really not going to talk to Pun?

468
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,640
I though I’ve already
talked to Prang about this.

469
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,000
Ploy…

470
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,640
Enough.

471
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,560
It’s over.

472
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,880
But sometimes, when something’s over,

473
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,000
it isn’t really the end.

474
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,440
Pun may have been wrong,

475
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,000
but as her sister,

476
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,920
I can see it

477
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,040
when she really loves something

478
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,000
whether it’s art,

479
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,360
work,

480
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:58,200
or a person.

481
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,440
I believe that

482
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,160
her love for you was real.

483
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
So do I.

484
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,600
I don’t know

485
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,320
what real even means anymore.

486
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,920
If you’re angry about what happened,

487
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,200
I don’t think Pun ever meant
to lie to you all the way through.

488
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,520
Honestly, things got out of hand

489
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,080
because

490
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,920
Pun’s stupid.

491
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,600
Well, it’s true.

492
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,240
When people are in love, everyone’s acts stupid.

493
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,920
You’re stupid. Pun’s stupid.

494
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,640
Prang and I are stupid as well.

495
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,920
No one makes the right choices in love.

496
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,080
Exactly, like you.

497
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:49,360
Planning a proposal three, four times

498
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,640
and failing every time.

499
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,760
- Yes.
- That’s also... stupid.

500
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,680
How did we get here?

501
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,720
I...

502
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:05,680
I want you to just try talking to her again.

503
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,680
We all want to see you happy.

504
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,760
So do I.

505
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,040
"The two people who deserve love
the most right now"

506
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,640
are you and Pun.

507
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,120
"I really want both of you to be happy."

508
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,040
Luckily, it hasn’t gone off yet.

509
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,600
Pour the water and receive the blessing.

510
00:45:54,360 --> 00:46:05,280
(Merit-dedication water chant)

511
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,480
(”Pailin Priyakorn”)

512
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:08,680
Pailin.

513
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,120
I miss you so much.

514
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,280
Why don’t you ever come to me in my dreams?

515
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,080
Come visit me just once.

516
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,560
Since you’ve been gone,

517
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,000
every day of my life

518
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,480
feels empty and meaningless.

519
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,360
I miss you so much it hurts.

520
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,200
One day

521
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,440
we’ll see each other again.

522
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,560
Wait for me a little longer, Pailin.

523
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,040
Mom, please don’t say things like that.

524
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,440
Say what?

525
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,520
Don’t say your life has no meaning.

526
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,560
Or that you want to go be with her.

527
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,640
And what would you know about how I feel?

528
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,320
What would you know

529
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:20,200
about what it’s like for a mother to lose a child?

530
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:22,840
I don’t know.

531
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,720
But please don’t say things like that in front of Uncle Chai.

532
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,600
Why not?

533
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,360
Who are you

534
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,000
to tell me what I can or can’t say?

535
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,720
You have Uncle Chai beside you.

536
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,920
You still have Phe.

537
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,120
- And you still have me…
- Because of you.

538
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,640
Because of you, isn’t it?
Pailin isn’t here because of you.

539
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,560
Because of you.

540
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,560
Should I be the one who died instead?

541
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,320
If the one who died is me,

542
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:11,600
things would have been better, right?

543
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:14,880
How dare you speak to me like that!

544
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,160
Ploy, come back here!

545
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:21,840
For what?

546
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,800
Or do you want me to die
right here in front of you?

547
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,960
Would that make you happy?

548
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,360
Do you want me to die right here in front of you?

549
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,280
Should I, then?

550
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,000
Don’t.

551
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,920
If I died,

552
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,080
you wouldn’t be waiting for me to visit your dreams.

553
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,680
You wouldn’t be waiting for the day you join me.

554
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,480
If I died,

555
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,480
you’d be glad, wouldn’t you?

556
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,560
Glad to hear it

557
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,320
that the stain on your life

558
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,440
has finally faded.

559
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,680
Someone once told me

560
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,560
that I deserved to be loved.

561
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,920
I wanted so badly to believe that, Mom.

562
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,360
But I never could.

563
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,400
Because I’ve never felt that love.

564
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,040
Not even from the person I wanted it from the most.

565
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,240
Not once.

566
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,400
So I keep asking myself.

567
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,320
Do I not deserve love, Mom?

568
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,080
Do I not deserve to be happy?

569
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,520
And if my life is really that worthless,

570
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,280
maybe I should have died instead.

571
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,560
Stop it right now, Ploy!

572
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,560
(”Our first time in Pattaya”)

573
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,320
(”Good deeds never go unrewarded, it’s real”)

574
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,000
(”You deserve to be loved, Ploy Pitcha”)

575
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,280
You deserve to be loved.

576
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,680
To be loved properly.

577
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,680
If no one gives it to you,

578
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,520
I will.

579
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,240
(”Please come back.”)

580
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,320
(”She’ll never forgive me, will she?”)

581
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,040
(”I miss you.”)

582
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:32,360
(”Pun’s hug”)

583
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,840
"I’ve been in New York for almost two months now."

584
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,080
"Everything’s going well."

585
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,880
"My work"

586
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,640
"is finally starting to earn me something."

587
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,880
"And so is my artistic spirit."

588
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,120
"The museums…"

589
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,480
"the vintage flea market on 23rd Street…"

590
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,720
"the musicians on the rooftop,"

591
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,120
"playing songs I’m familiar with."

592
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,640
"the galleries…"

593
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,040
"Everything fills my mind"

594
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,400
"and my imagination."

595
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,320
"And my heart is in a place where I finally belong."

596
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,120
"It’s a place where ideas bloom endlessly."

597
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,160
"As for Phe…"

598
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,040
"after coming back to New York,"

599
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,160
"he quit gambling for good,"

600
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,480
"paid to have the front door rebuilt,
stronger than before,"

601
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,880
"and started taking his work
at his restaurant, seriously."

602
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,800
What are you doing, Phe?

603
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,480
Did you have to ruin the whole set?

604
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,720
Well, I had to defend myself at that moment.

605
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,520
Other than paying off the debts,

606
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:50,960
I’ve got to start over collecting all this stuff too.

607
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,160
You didn’t have to buy everything new.

608
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,880
You could’ve fixed them.

609
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,000
Look.

610
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,960
Glue it back together and it’s fine.

611
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:03,840
Maybe.

612
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,040
Some things

613
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:07,920
can be fixed, maybe.

614
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:29,600
Uno.

615
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,680
Game.

616
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,480
"At first, it was lonely."

617
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,400
"But I was lucky to have Jeong-Ah and Angie,"

618
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:37,480
"who helped me with so many things,"

619
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:40,840
"and became the people
I spent most of my time with."

620
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:44,160
"To be honest, they made me miss
Jieab and the others too."

621
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:48,400
So…

622
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,760
How was your work?

623
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,400
It’s pretty good, actually.

624
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,480
And I really enjoyed it here.

625
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:55,760
Oh!

626
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,320
Just a moment, okay?

627
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:02,880
"Catherine, she’s a lecturer at the university."

628
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:07,240
"She’s been helping me
ever since I first started my master’s."

629
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,240
"After that,"

630
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,400
"she pretty much became my mentor."

631
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,000
"She’s the one who offered me that job before,"

632
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,760
"the one I turned down."

633
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:19,880
"Luckily, when I came back,"

634
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:23,160
"Catherine still helped pull strings for me
to get the position again."

635
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,800
"My life is finally falling into place."

636
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,920
Umm, sorry.

637
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,080
It’s okay.

638
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,160
Our university is sending alumni back
to their home countries

639
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:36,480
to speak at an education fair

640
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,480
and promote the school.

641
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,640
And actually, I think you're
going to be perfect for that.

642
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,360
What do you think?

643
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,120
So…

644
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,240
You’re saying that

645
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,360
I have to go back to Thailand?

646
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:55,080
It's also a nice opportunity
to exhibit work you have done here.

647
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,400
Would you mind if…

648
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,680
I need a little time to think about it.

649
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,480
Yeah. Sure, sure.

650
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,800
Hello?

651
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,320
Pun, what time will you be back today?

652
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,680
"Come home soon, okay?
I’m waiting to have dinner with you."

653
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,360
I’m heading back now.

654
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:45,640
"Alright."

655
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:46,720
Mmm.

656
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:54,320
"Since I got back this time,"

657
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:57,040
"Phe’s been taking much better care of me."

658
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,480
"He calls to check on me morning and night."

659
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,600
"Some days he even drives me to work."

660
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,160
"And takes care of our house as well."

661
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:05,400
"He doesn’t even charge me rent."

662
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,720
"And now he’s trying to get us legally married again."

663
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,000
"For free."

664
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:13,960
"Probably because he still feels guilty
about everything that happened."

665
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,160
"Things are going well."

666
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,080
"It’s all going to be okay."

667
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:56,880
Oh, Pun!

668
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,720
Perfect timing. Dinner’s just ready.

669
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,440
I was just about to call you.

670
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,360
Oh, I forgot to mention.
Today we have our honorary chef.

671
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:43,000
- (Next episode)
- Ploy, please go.

672
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,640
Even if there’s only one percent left
of what you still feel for me,

673
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,560
I won’t let go.

674
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,840
You’re playing with my feelings.

675
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,920
Do you have any idea
what it took for me to get through everything?

676
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,680
How hard I tried
just to forget what we had?

677
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:57,360
I want you to think about yourself
for one week from now.

678
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,920
If you still feel anything for me,

679
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,880
meet me here, in front of this picture.

680
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,320
I’ll be right here waiting.

681
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,920
I’m not going anywhere.

682
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:16,920
