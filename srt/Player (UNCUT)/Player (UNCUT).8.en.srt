00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,840
[Viewer discretion advised.]

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,360
- (Previously on "Player")
- I’m starting to think

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,280
there’s definitely something going on
between Pun and Ploy.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,040
No need to go all out.

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,000
I just want the proposal to finally happen.

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,600
We just ran into Phetai.

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,160
Something urgent came up. I have to go.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,280
I’m sorry.

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,720
When will you be free next?

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,720
I won’t.

12
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,080
I won’t ask
why you let someone do that to you.

13
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,480
If you are angry,

14
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:28,520
then at least show it.
Let me know somehow.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,200
Come to Hong Kong with me.

16
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,960
I’ll go!

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,720
Anywhere you ask, I’ll go.

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,840
Who's this?

19
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,760
“Your soon-to-be husband, of course.”

20
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,120
Phetai?

21
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,040
Um, Ploy.

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,400
Well...

23
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,880
I’ve got an urgent errand.

24
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,760
Could you wait for me at the airport?

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,360
I’ll sort it out quickly
and come straight over.

26
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
Want me to drop you off?

27
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,480
Then we can go together.

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,880
Oh, no, it’s fine.

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,160
You can just wait in the lounge and relax.

30
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,880
I’ll be there in a bit. I’ll come right after.

31
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,760
Okay?

32
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,280
♫ You act so calm and cool
as you’re stepping close to me ♫

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,960
♫ You come around so endlessly,
I know what’s on your mind, you see ♫

34
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,480
♫ You play it off each time our eyes collide ♫

35
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,360
♫ But your gaze betrays the truth you try to hide ♫

36
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,680
♫ The closer we become ♫

37
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,840
♫ The more my heart’s undone ♫

38
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,840
♫ It trembles more each time we meet as one ♫

39
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,440
♫ Game for your love ♫

40
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,120
♫ But I’m a pro player, baby ♫

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,240
♫ I wish you’d slip and show your heart to me ♫

42
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,560
♫ But somehow, I can always see it clearly ♫

43
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,840
♫ I try so hard to hold my heart inside
But in the end, I can’t stop loving you so right ♫

44
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,320
♫ Game Over ♫

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,440
What would you like?

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,920
Chamomile tea, please.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,840
Sure.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Ugh. Where are you?

49
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,920
(”Phetai”)

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
I’m sorry. We’re closing now.

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,600
You can go ahead and bill me.

52
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Thank you.

53
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,360
Hello, Phe?

54
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,720
Where are you? Why didn’t you show up?

55
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,360
“Pun. Can we move it to tonight?”

56
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,520
Why do you keep doing this to me?

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,600
Do you know how long I’ve been waiting for you?

58
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,120
“11 p.m., Pun.”

59
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,360
“At the bar, where we bumped into
each other by the door.”

60
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,360
“You remember, right?”

61
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,120
Hang on, Phe…

62
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,760
(sighs)

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,440
“Go see Ploy, Pun.”

64
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,760
We already had plans.

65
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,560
What about that million, Pun?

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,240
Don’t forget! We’ve got to get that back.

67
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
But how upset would Ploy be?

68
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,960
We’ve planned this trip for so long.

69
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,360
And what about Prang? How would she feel?

70
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,520
If she knew we gave a million
to some random guy.

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,280
Does that even matter right now?

72
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,120
Ploy’s been at the airport
waiting all by herself for hours.

73
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,280
Come up with a good reason and tell her.

74
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,000
A reason? You mean a lie?

75
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,880
No, I mean

76
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,520
prioritize things.

77
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,800
Hmm. So are you really going
to let Ploy go to Hong Kong alone?

78
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,720
Then don’t let her go yet.

79
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,440
Tell her to wait and go together.

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,280
Make up any excuse you need.

81
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,520
Just stall for now.

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,400
Think about Ploy’s feelings for once, Pun.

83
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,200
And think about that million too.

84
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,040
Okay, enough! Both of you, stop.

85
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
I’ll decide.

86
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Have you arrived yet, Pun?

87
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
“Hello. Ploy.”

88
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,560
Well,

89
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,760
I really couldn’t sort the errand out.

90
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,200
Can we move our flight
to Hong Kong tomorrow?

91
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,040
Can you give me a clearer reason, Pun?

92
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,880
I just have to redo all my work from scratch.

93
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,400
But I really can go to Hong Kong with you.

94
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,600
“If it’s about the money, or any costs,”

95
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,840
“I’ll take care of it myself.”

96
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,040
Ploy. Please don’t stay silent.

97
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,159
And what do you want me to say, Pun?

98
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,560
Anything. Just whatever you’re thinking.

99
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,520
Get back to work.

100
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,000
Hong Kong can wait.

101
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,520
Are you mad at me, Ploy?

102
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,080
“Ploy.”

103
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,200
We’ll talk when we see each other, okay?

104
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,840
Then let’s have dinner tonight.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
“I’ll book new tickets right away.”

106
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,000
We’ll talk later.

107
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,280
Hey.

108
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,600
Prang, when are you coming home?

109
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,560
I miss you so much.

110
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,520
Just finished work. Heading back now.

111
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
Have you eaten?

112
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
“Not yet.”

113
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,840
I was waiting to eat with you.

114
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
Is that okay?

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,080
Sure. I’ll make your favorite.

116
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,280
Pun?

117
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,280
“Prang.”

118
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,960
“Hello? Can you hear me?”

119
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,480
“Prang.”

120
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,160
“Why so quiet?”

121
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,920
Oh, nothing.

122
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,039
Just ran into Pun.

123
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,679
Don’t tell me she’s getting drunk again,
that crazy girl.

124
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,200
Um, Jay, I’ll call you back.

125
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,600
Prang. Wait!

126
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,640
(”Will you marry me?”)

127
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,040
Ouch!

128
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,960
Where is it? The money you stole from me.

129
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,640
Shh. Keep it down, Pun.

130
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
Give it back so I can get out of here.

131
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,280
Can we just talk?

132
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,120
I don’t care

133
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,960
what you’ve done.

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,640
But do you know I got beaten up?

135
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,600
I’m not even your girlfriend.

136
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
When will you stop
dragging everyone else down with you?

137
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,360
Pun. Calm down. Okay? I...

138
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,400
I didn’t mean for this to happen. I swear.

139
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,040
How was I supposed to know
they’d come after you to the house, Pun?

140
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,840
Then why did you run?

141
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,440
If I didn’t, I’d be dead, Pun.

142
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,200
Take responsibility for what you did.

143
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,680
At least, didn’t you think to warn me first?

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,680
Pun.

145
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,200
I didn’t want anyone to be involved. Okay?

146
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,000
Phe...

147
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,480
You’re so damn selfish.

148
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,160
You’re lucky they didn’t follow you back to Thailand.

149
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,400
You really think

150
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
I have to live like this,
hiding all the time, for no reason?

151
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Think about why.

152
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,080
I think you’re just running from debt.

153
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,040
Let me tell you from the start.

154
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,760
“I was gambling.”

155
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,760
“No one in New York even knew
I was going to the casino.”

156
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
“At first, it was just to blow off some steam.”

157
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,360
Raise.

158
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,600
“I didn’t play that much,
not enough to get myself in trouble.”

159
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,320
“Winning, losing... It was all fun.”

160
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,800
Call.

161
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
All in.

162
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,600
“Until one day it wasn’t,”

163
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,240
“I got cocky, thought my luck was turning,
so I kept betting more and more.”

164
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
Full house!

165
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,280
Looks like great ties.

166
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
“And in the end,”

167
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,240
“I lost everything to them.”

168
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,800
“After that,

169
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,920
it became about trying to win it back.”

170
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,960
“Keep telling myself I’d win it all back.”

171
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,720
I really need to talk to Martin.

172
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,840
“So I tried borrowing money from the casino owner.”

173
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
“What? You wanted to see me?”

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,760
“Hold on.”

175
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,880
What’s with you?

176
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,720
Thai voiceover by Phetai.
Does it sound weird?

177
00:11:59,240 --> 00:11:59,960
For what?

178
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,160
Okay, okay. Fine.

179
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,960
Anyway,

180
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
“Martin owns the casino I played at.”

181
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
“Big-time mafia boss in New York.”

182
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,280
What do you want?

183
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,880
“Of course. I needed money.”

184
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,520
“And one day,”

185
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,160
“I was desperate enough
to sign a loan agreement with insane interest.”

186
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,880
(”Loan Agreement”)

187
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,760
(”Total of Payments $65,000
Annual Percentage Rate 10%”)

188
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,840
“But it wasn’t as simple as
just paying the money back.”

189
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,320
“I’d already booked a flight out beforehand.”

190
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,480
- “I didn’t trust those guys.”
- Please don’t shoot me.

191
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,800
- I’ll get you the money as soon as possible. Please don’t shoot me.
- “In case something went wrong, I could get away fast.”

192
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,160
You’d better get me the money.

193
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,240
“But if nothing bad happened,
It’d be like a vacation trip back home.”

194
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,760
- “And of course, something went wrong.”
- You understand that, right?

195
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

196
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,240
If you do not pay me,

197
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,520
your girlfriend...

198
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,800
dies.

199
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,640
So I had no choice but to run back to Thailand.

200
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,880
But who would’ve thought their network
reached all the way here too?

201
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,240
That’s why I’ve been living like this,
hiding all the time.

202
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,440
And that one million baht you took from me,

203
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,600
it didn’t help clear your debt at all?

204
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,440
What about Golf’s money?

205
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,920
Be honest. How much do you actually owe?

206
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,680
It helped, but…

207
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,320
the interest rates are insane, Pun.

208
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,400
Even after paying some back, I still owe him.

209
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,800
It’s quite a lot.

210
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,080
Then why did you meet Golf that day?

211
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,120
Because I knew he was messing around with you.

212
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,760
So I decided to pay him back myself

213
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,240
and told him to stay away from you.

214
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,400
How did it go, Jay?

215
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,280
Hey. Why are you here alone?

216
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,520
Prang had something urgent,

217
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,800
so she’s running a bit late.

218
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,720
It’s okay. It’s okay.

219
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,280
Have you ordered yet?

220
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,760
Want me to get something for you?

221
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,600
Phe.

222
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,880
Hmm?

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,480
There’s one more thing.

224
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,320
What is it?

225
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,600
Have you been in touch with your sister lately?

226
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,440
Well...

227
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,440
Yeah. We still talk sometimes.

228
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,720
At first, I even asked Ploy for help.

229
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,480
Then,

230
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,880
once you’re done with me,

231
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,480
can you stop asking Ploy for help too?

232
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,680
Pun...

233
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,160
Ploy’s my sister.

234
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,000
- You can’t just tell me to stop seeing my own sister…
- I mean...

235
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,560
Stop getting her involved in your mess.

236
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,080
I’ve been working with the police
to put those guys behind bars.

237
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,480
Once it’s done, I’ll...

238
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,000
probably head back to the States.

239
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,200
And that’ll be the end of it.

240
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,120
So…

241
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,600
Okay.

242
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,520
Okay.

243
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,880
I’ve transferred the money back to you.

244
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,840
And...

245
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,320
Do you still want that citizenship?

246
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,760
Huh?

247
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,920
American citizenship.

248
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,800
This time, I won’t...

249
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,400
I won’t charge you a single baht.

250
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,520
Think of it as payback
for everything I’ve done to you.

251
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,440
You really think...

252
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,320
I’m stupid enough

253
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,120
to let you fool me twice?

254
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,040
Try thinking about that.

255
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,600
I’ll get in touch.

256
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,800
Ah. Excuse me, ma’am.

257
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,440
I’m sorry, but...

258
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,000
you’re acting a bit suspicious for a while now.

259
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,599
Huh?

260
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,680
Um. There must be some kind of misunderstanding.

261
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,800
A misunderstanding?

262
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,160
If it’s just a misunderstanding,

263
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,359
then why are you acting so strange?

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,680
Am I good to go?

265
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,320
Ah! Oh my god, Prang!

266
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
You’re Prang Punnaputch, right?

267
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:34,160
Wow. You look even prettier in person!

268
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
I’ve been dying to get your autograph!

269
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,440
I’m gonna show it off to
my girls, my stans, and everyone!

270
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,640
Seriously, they can recite every line
from your shows by heart!

271
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,760
Can I have your autograph, please?

272
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,280
Sure, sure. Where should I sign?

273
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,120
Umm…

274
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,760
Right here.
Make it fierce and fabulous. Okay?

275
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,640
Is this alright, Jay?

276
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,800
So, what’s the plan this time?

277
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,080
Here’s the thing, Jae Ang.

278
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,680
When Prang gets here, right?

279
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,520
I’ll bring her to sit here.

280
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
Then I’ll serve her the food.

281
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,600
And when she lifts the lid,

282
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,120
she’ll find the ring I hid inside.

283
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,000
Then I’ll…

284
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,080
What’s wrong, Jay?

285
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,800
It’s not too cliché, is it?

286
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,560
No, I think it’s perfect.

287
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,320
- Really?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,640
“Please leave your message after the beep.”

289
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,840
“Hello?”

290
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,080
Hello, Ji.

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,240
I can’t get through to Ploy at all.

292
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
Are you with her right now?

293
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,200
“Didn’t Ploy go to Hong Kong with you, Pun?”

294
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,920
Wait...

295
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,560
Didn’t you drop her off at the condo this morning?

296
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:21,960
“No.”

297
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,920
“When we got to the airport
and finished unloading her luggage,”

298
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,840
“she told me to head back.”

299
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,280
(”Ploy Pitcha: Hong Kong. 3 hour ago.”)

300
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,120
What’s up, Pun?

301
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Hello, Jieab.

302
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,280
Hey.

303
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,840
I think I’m going crazy.

304
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,360
What’s wrong with you?

305
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,960
I went to see a play.

306
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,200
Oh? And then?

307
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,680
And…

308
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,320
there’s this one scene where

309
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,480
the leads are supposed to fly to Hong Kong together.

310
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,440
“But on the morning of the trip,”

311
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,080
the lead guy says he has urgent work,

312
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,120
so he can’t go with her.

313
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,880
And the girl says, “Get back to work.”

314
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,960
“Hong Kong can wait.”

315
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:06,920
Mm. And then?

316
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,840
If you were her, would you be mad at him?

317
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,280
I think I would,

318
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,520
“if he told me that last minute.”

319
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,360
So was he really busy?

320
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
Yeah, he was.

321
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,760
Are you okay, Pun?

322
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,440
Why does your voice sound shaky?

323
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
Do you think…

324
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,520
someone can give up on a relationship that easily?

325
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,360
I guess it depends on the person
and how strong the relationship is.

326
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,480
“Are you okay?”

327
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,000
- “Pun?”
- Huh?

328
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,440
I’m totally fine.

329
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,600
Well,

330
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,840
I really need to get back to work.

331
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
Let’s talk later, alright?

332
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,520
“Pun.”

333
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:07,880
“Pun.”

334
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,600
I’m heading out now.

335
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,560
Okay. Thanks so much.

336
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,680
Hope everything works out for you.

337
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,320
It will. Don’t worry.

338
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,760
Get home safe.

339
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,480
Good luck, Jay.

340
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,880
Ugh!

341
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,320
Why’s the traffic so bad right now?

342
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,680
Come on. Pick up, Ploy.

343
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,680
Hello, Jay?

344
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,240
I’m on my way back. Just wait a bit, okay?

345
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,600
What happened just now, Prang?

346
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,240
You sounded so freaked out.

347
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,840
I’ll tell you when I get back.

348
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,200
I’m in a hurry right now.

349
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,600
Ugh. Why’s it jammed now?

350
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,640
Is it something serious, Prang?

351
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,080
I said I’ll tell you later!

352
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,520
Do you get that, Jay?

353
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,160
“Let me focus on driving first.”

354
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,120
Okay, I...

355
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,040
- “Please leave your message after the beep.”
- No. Ploy. Don’t do this to me.

356
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
I love you.

357
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,240
(”Will you marry me?”)

358
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,640
Prang,

359
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,320
How did you get in here?

360
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,800
This is my room.

361
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,400
Why did you do this, Pun?

362
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
Do what?

363
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,280
Why didn’t you tell me what was going on?

364
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,120
What are you talking about?

365
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
I just came back from the bar.

366
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,320
Then I guess you already know

367
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
I got the money back.

368
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,480
Wait!

369
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
Let’s talk first.

370
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,280
There’s nothing to talk about.

371
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,240
This is serious.

372
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,600
We need to talk to Dad.

373
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,640
Do you think you can sort it yourself?

374
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,240
I’m not worried about the money.

375
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,960
I’m worried about you.

376
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,880
Prang. Just stop trying to fix things for me.

377
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,320
You and Dad...

378
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,040
have never expected anything from me anyway.

379
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,320
What are you talking about?

380
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,040
I have to go, Prang.

381
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,840
If we’re going to fight about this, let’s do it later.

382
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:53,840
Wait!

383
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,840
Just stop messing with me already.

384
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,280
You’re back, Prang?

385
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,600
What happened?

386
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,400
Let’s go.

387
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,920
Pun?

388
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,520
You’re travelling around here too?

389
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
Are you staying here, Dream?

390
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,040
Yes. We’re staying here.

391
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,840
Is that your bag, Pun?

392
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,840
Did you just get here?

393
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,240
Wow…

394
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,640
What a coincidence.

395
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,400
So, you just arrived, right?

396
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,480
I’ve been here for a while, actually.

397
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
But the person I came to see,
I can't reach her at all.

398
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,720
I’ve been sitting here for hours,
waiting for nothing certain.

399
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,000
Then would you like to stay here, Pun?

400
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,800
- I can make the arrangements.
- It’s alright.

401
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,120
I can handle it myself.

402
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,520
In that case, we’ll get going.

403
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,840
Ploy’s exhausted.
She’s been complaining the whole ride.

404
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,000
We’ll go ahead. Come on.

405
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Ploy.

406
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,680
I haven’t eaten yet.

407
00:31:58,760 --> 00:31:59,880
Dream. You go up first.

408
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,240
I’ll take her to the restaurant.

409
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,680
- Then let me come too.
- Dream. Just go up first.

410
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,080
Please.

411
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,640
Alright.

412
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,480
See you later.

413
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,840
Let’s go eat.

414
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,520
Why couldn’t I reach you at all, Ploy?

415
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,480
And how did she even get here?

416
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,320
Let’s go eat.

417
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,720
Is she staying with you?

418
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,280
But this trip was supposed to be ours.

419
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,760
You mean the trip you refused to come on?

420
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,240
I told you, Ploy,

421
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,320
we were supposed to go together.

422
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,840
I’ll take care of all the expenses myself.

423
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,440
And why’s that?

424
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,640
Because you were too busy with work?

425
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,960
Yes.

426
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,360
Eat.

427
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,520
Aren’t you hungry?

428
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,360
Ploy…

429
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,159
Yes?

430
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,320
Ploy.

431
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,960
Just say it.

432
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,880
I know I was wrong.

433
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,239
But are you really not going to look at me?

434
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,560
We’ll talk later.

435
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,360
Ploy.

436
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,200
Did you really have to do that?

437
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,520
It just fell.

438
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,720
I didn’t throw it away.

439
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,320
And you’re really not going to care at all?

440
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,520
What if I told you Dream’s staying with me?

441
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,760
What would you say then?

442
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,880
I’d book another room

443
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,960
and take you with me.

444
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,240
Should I book another room?

445
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,640
Ploy…

446
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,520
I’m sorry for bailing on the trip.

447
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,600
Sorry for being late.

448
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,040
I didn’t mean to.

449
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,520
Please don’t be mad at me anymore.

450
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,680
So…

451
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,680
you took me out for dinner,

452
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,480
brought me up to your room,

453
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,680
just to talk to me without even looking at me?

454
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,600
You’re Prang’s sister. I have to look after you.

455
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,080
What did you just...

456
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,800
Go take a shower and get some rest.

457
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,240
Well.

458
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,920
I’ll unpack first.

459
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,960
You go shower, Ploy.

460
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,600
Didn’t you say you were exhausted?

461
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,760
(knocking on door)

462
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,840
(knocking on door)

463
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,240
(knocking on door)

464
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,200
(knocking on door)

465
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,880
(knocking on door)

466
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,720
Who are you looking for?

467
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,640
Isn’t this Ploy’s room?

468
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,480
Oh! There she is.

469
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,880
Ploy, it’s Pinky. I’m here like we agreed.

470
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,320
Get out.

471
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,720
Get out!

472
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,600
Ploy. Please tell me I’m wrong about this.

473
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,440
You didn’t call her here to sleep with you, did you?

474
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,960
I’ve had a long day, Pun.

475
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,280
How could you do this to me?

476
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,560
What about you?

477
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,400
What did I do wrong?

478
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,200
Don’t think I wouldn’t find out

479
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,880
what you’re hiding from me?

480
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,240
What are you talking about?

481
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,960
Which guy did you ditch me for, Pun?

482
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,880
Golf?

483
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,440
Mick?

484
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,680
or someone new?

485
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,640
I didn’t sleep with anyone. I swear.

486
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,600
I just had to...

487
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,560
Had to what?

488
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,360
You had to what?

489
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,960
(knocking on door)

490
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,160
“Ploy.”

491
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,560
“Ploy, please.”

492
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,840
(knocking on door)

493
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:19,880
“Ploy…”

494
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,600
- (knocking on door)
- “Ploy, what’s going on in there?”

495
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,000
“At least open up for me, will you?”

496
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,360
“I left my lipstick inside.”

497
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,720
“Ploy!”

498
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:30,800
“Ploy!”

499
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,120
“Ugh!”

500
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,280
If you’ve found someone else, that’s fine.

501
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,040
At least then I’d know
neither of us ever really meant it.

502
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,240
That would make things easier.

503
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,520
I don’t have anyone else.

504
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,800
You’re the one who does.

505
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,160
You should go.

506
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,960
You can see I’ve got someone with me.

507
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,600
We’re not done talking.

508
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,280
Let me go.

509
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,120
Just leave.

510
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,800
“Lucky me,”

511
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,160
“I saw your story today, Ploy.”

512
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,480
“Otherwise I’d have missed all the fun.”

513
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,160
Why is it so tense today?

514
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,880
Who made you so mad?

515
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,880
- (Next episode)
- What should I do to forget?

516
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,520
Getting with someone else just to forget another,

517
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,480
it only makes things messier or heavier.

518
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,000
It’ll never be enough.

519
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,960
I just want you to be clear about it.

520
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,080
Leaving things like this only hurts both of you.

521
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,560
It doesn’t matter anymore.

522
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,640
All this time

523
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,440
was just a game to you?

524
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,120
In your heart,

525
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,880
there’s nothing left of me?

526
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,320
🎵 Tell you! 🎵

527
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,680
🎵 When I catch a stranger’s eyes 🎵

528
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,320
🎵 It’s like the world just stops in time 🎵

529
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,320
🎵 Anyone! would fall, they’d lose their fight 🎵

530
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,760
🎵 No one escapes my charm outright 🎵

531
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:18,920
🎵 Just one glance when you turn my way 🎵

532
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,920
🎵 Why do I lose my cool this way? 🎵

533
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:29,080
🎵 My heart melts down, oh what to do? 🎵

534
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,160
🎵 Teach me love, I’ll learn from you 🎵

535
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,400
🎵 Let me be your baby 🎵

536
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,680
🎵 Keep me right there in your mind
Let me stay beside you 🎵

537
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,160
🎵 Whatever you do I won’t mind 🎵

538
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,520
🎵 From now on, I’ll be your willing prey 🎵

539
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,200
🎵 Come and be my tiger for a day 🎵

540
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,800
🎵 Take my heart, my all. I’ll gladly pay 🎵

541
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,760
🎵 Never drift away 🎵

542
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,240
🎵 Hey love! 🎵

543
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,720
🎵 Would you turn and look my way? 🎵

544
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,120
🎵 I’m not teasing. I’ve waited all day 🎵

545
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:05,880
🎵 Hey love! 🎵

546
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,360
🎵 I don’t wanna be alone 🎵

547
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,000
🎵 Let me be the one you call your own 🎵

548
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:19,000
🎵 Just one glance when you turn my way 🎵

549
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,320
🎵 Why do I lose my cool this way? 🎵

550
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:29,040
🎵 My heart melts down, oh what to do? 🎵

551
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,120
🎵 Teach me love, I’ll learn from you 🎵

552
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,560
🎵 Let me be your baby 🎵

553
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,560
🎵 Keep me right there in your mind
Let me stay beside you 🎵

554
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:42,160
🎵 Whatever you do I won’t mind 🎵

555
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,840
🎵 From now on, I’ll be your willing prey 🎵

556
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,240
🎵 Come and be my tiger for a day 🎵

557
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,520
🎵 Take my heart, my all. I’ll gladly pay 🎵

558
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,000
🎵 Never drift away 🎵
