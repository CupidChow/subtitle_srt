1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
(Previously on "Player")

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,320
What if she actually starts to like you? What will you do?

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,840
Ploy is like a flower that lures in insects.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,480
Just a sweet glance from her, and people swarm.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,000
For your first time, Pun.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,400
It would be better to look for
someone less player than Ploy.

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,160
If you fall for her, watch your heart.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,960
Of all your ex-flings,

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,200
Golf is back home now. Did you know?

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,560
If you want to know about Phe, get in!

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,000
“For me, design is about
creating memories.”

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,280
“And lasting impressions.”

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,320
“Come to think of it”

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,320
“Even before I became a graphic designer,”

15
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,520
“My life had always been about

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,880
making the people I love feel special.”

17
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,440
“But somehow,”

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,000
“Every time I tried to impress someone,”

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,840
“I ended up being saved instead.”

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
Having fun? Let’s go.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,880
“They always came to save me.”

22
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,640
Did you color it wrong?

23
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,600
I’ll help you. Which part?

24
00:01:25,039 --> 00:01:25,760
This one.

25
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,200
"This time was no different."

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,200
“This time, I won’t let you fall.”

27
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
Pun, get back in the car.

28
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,400
Pun, please wait in my car first.

29
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,520
Pun!

30
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,640
Got connections?

31
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,760
Huh?

32
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,720
I asked if you have any connections?

33
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,640
Are you someone’s son
from a powerful family?

34
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,160
I know you’re an actress.

35
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,440
So, are you threatening me right now?

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,840
This could make headlines.

37
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,720
Assault and kidnapping...

38
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,920
What’s the sentence for that?

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
I really didn’t want to get involved,

40
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,600
But she didn’t seem to want to go with you.

41
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
Then stay out of it.

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,200
Spend your time

43
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,920
learning to drive instead.

44
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,600
You might wanna spend yours
to find some good backup.

45
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,160
Because her father
is the Commissioner General.

46
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,320
He won't just sit back
if his daughter’s been taken.

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,640
Wanna end up in jail?

48
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,600
[Tsk!, signs]

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,120
Let’s head back, Pun.

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
Pun.

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Uh…

52
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
Thanks for saving me again.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,640
No problem.
Guess I was just passing by at the right time.

54
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Right! It’s destiny!

55
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,760
“This is my chance.”

56
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,240
So, are you free tomorrow, Ploy?

57
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,560
I’d love to treat you to a meal
to say thanks.

58
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,800
Hmm

59
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,880
I’m not free tomorrow.

60
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,240
What about later this week then?

61
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
I’m busy every day, actually.

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,840
Well, technically,

63
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,240
I do have a little free time
tomorrow morning.

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
When exactly?

65
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I’m making merit downstairs at 6 a.m.

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,280
You could join me,
returning the favor.

67
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,760
6 in the morning?

68
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,880
“She wakes up that early?”

69
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,560
Fine, I’ll be there.

70
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,480
See you at 6, Ploy.

71
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,400
Okay.

72
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,480
Well then…

73
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,240
I’ll get going.

74
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Good night.

75
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,240
Here’s my number
or just add me on Line.

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,880
"In case we need to pick a meeting spot."

77
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,840
["Miss Sweetie"]

78
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,640
I’ve got you now, Miss Sweetie.

79
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,520
Damn it, Pun!

80
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,200
Why didn’t you set an alarm?

81
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey, I did! You just slept through it!

82
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,560
“Made merit for you already. Sleep well, sleepyhead.”

83
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,560
Ughhh!

84
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,880
Ughhh!

85
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,600
Jay

86
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,960
What are you up to?

87
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,800
Just looking for something.

88
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,120
What is it? Want me to help?

89
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
It’s okay.

90
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,720
I can’t find it anywhere.
I have to go out and buy it.

91
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:36,480
Perfect! I’ll come with you.

92
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,720
Didn’t you have plans with your friends today?

93
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,000
They texted me last night,
Turns out they’re all busy.

94
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
So I’m free now.

95
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,360
Babe, you want to stay in today?

96
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
I'll go out and grab you something.

97
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,320
Nah, I’ll tag along.

98
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Being stuck in the room is boring.
Let’s go shopping together!

99
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,120
Please? Can I?

100
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,400
Pleeease?

101
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,120
Please?

102
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,560
Okay?

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Fine.

104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,320
Let me grab my bag first.

105
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,520
Okay.

106
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,480
I really want to check out this new café.

107
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,840
It’s by the garden, near the fountain.
Just opened.

108
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,440
Take me there for some photos?

109
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,919
Sure.

110
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,240
Oof, my stomach hurts.

111
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,880
I’m gonna hit the restroom real quick.

112
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,080
You go first
and wait at the shop, okay?

113
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,160
I’ll meet you there, Prang!

114
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Hey Jay, wait!

115
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,720
What’s up with her?

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:07,040
“If I wanna win her heart,
I've gotta use what she loves most.”

117
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,680
These ones. Perfect.

118
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,920
Pretty, sexy, and totally irresistible.

119
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,560
How may I help you?

120
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720
“40 thousand!?”

121
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,160
“Pun, your taste’s a little too fancy.”

122
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,960
Huh?

123
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
Uh… I’ll just take a look around first.

124
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,320
Sure.

125
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,120
Pun!

126
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, Prang!

127
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Shopping for shoes?

128
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,200
Uh… yeah, kind of.

129
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,440
I’ll take the pair she picked.

130
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,120
Size 35, please.

131
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,560
Of course.

132
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,840
Wait, Prang

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,040
They're too expensive.
I can’t pay you back for that.

134
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,920
Just think of them
as a welcome-back gift from me.

135
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,080
Have you found a job yet?

136
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,760
Still… looking.

137
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,400
I actually have some friends
in your field.

138
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,920
Want me to ask around?

139
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,600
Heh, no thanks.

140
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,440
I can manage on my own.

141
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
Have you gone home
to see parents lately?

142
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,560
I just went back to pick up my car.

143
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Did you get to see them?

144
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,760
I was in a rush that day.

145
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,480
They’re probably worried about you.
Maybe give them a call.

146
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,680
Yeah, I know.

147
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,040
Once I’m done with a few things,
I’ll go see them.

148
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,280
Here you go.

149
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,120
Thank you.

150
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,960
Mhm.

151
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,320
Thanks, Prang.

152
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,120
If you ever need help with anything,
just let me know.

153
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,320
No, no, really.

154
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,920
I’m fine.

155
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,800
Yeah right, like I’m actually okay.

156
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,320
Thanks so much.

157
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,600
Take care of it for me, okay? Bye!

158
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,720
Get home safe.

159
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,680
Hey, Jay!

160
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,880
Who was that?

161
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,280
My friend.

162
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
Just a friend, huh?

163
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,480
You’re not flirting again, are you?

164
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,880
She’s really just a friend.

165
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,120
Anyway, what are you doing here?

166
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,160
Shopping.

167
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,240
And I ran into Prang.

168
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,360
Oh, Prang! I’m actually meeting her.

169
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
She’s waiting for me now. I’d better go.

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,720
Bye-bye!

171
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,160
If I find out you’re lying,
I’m telling Prang.

172
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,960
Have you been waiting long?

173
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,040
The bathroom line was crazy.

174
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,960
No, not at all.

175
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,520
Is anything wrong?

176
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,200
Huh?

177
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,960
Nothing. I just went to the restroom.

178
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,600
No,

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,360
I mean Pun. I just saw her.

180
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,160
Pun? Really?

181
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,520
Yeah, I ran into her just now.

182
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,240
Is something going on?

183
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,080
I don’t know.

184
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,520
I just feel like

185
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,280
she’s going through something.

186
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,640
Don’t worry too much, Prang.

187
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,960
She’s just stressed about finding a job.

188
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,120
She’s grown up now.

189
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,560
Let her handle it.

190
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,880
I just hope it’s only about the job.

191
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,600
Whoa, those cakes look so good.

192
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,280
You ordered everything I like!

193
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,480
This drink’s amazing.

194
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,320
Really?

195
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,400
Let's try this one.

196
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,800
“I miss you.”

197
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,160
I wonder if Ploy will like it.

198
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,960
I’ve got you now!

199
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,680
Miss Sweetie.

200
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,760
Oh, Prang.

201
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,320
What are you doing?

202
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,480
Nothing.

203
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,720
What about tomorrow morning?

204
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,360
What will you do?

205
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,360
Why?

206
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,760
I’d invite you to make merit.

207
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,200
What time?

208
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,520
Meet me outside the room.

209
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,080
6 a.m.

210
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,680
What? 6 a.m.?

211
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,960
I’m busy.

212
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,560
Busy doing what?

213
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,560
Uh...

214
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,040
Sleeping.

215
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,600
You should do some merit for once.

216
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,480
Train that lazy mind of yours to be kind.

217
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,880
No thanks. I’m tired.

218
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,160
So sleepy.

219
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,200
Come on, Pun.

220
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,000
Ploy invited us herself.

221
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,360
I don’t want us to seem rude.

222
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,160
Alright?

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,480
Hmm.

224
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,840
I’ll go.

225
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,560
Good.

226
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,040
Let's go to bed early, then.

227
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,600
Okay.

228
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,040
“I’ll set an alarm every 10 minutes.”

229
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,040
"Let’s see if I’d sleep through that."

230
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,320
See you tomorrow,

231
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,440
Ploy!

232
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,760
Heh… I’ve got you now.

233
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,880
[laughs]

234
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,560
I’ve got you now! Hahaha!

235
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,160
Miss.

236
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,400
Please prepare your offering.

237
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,480
Pun.

238
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,040
Pun.

239
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,360
Pun!

240
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,440
I’ve got you now!

241
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Morning already?

242
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,720
Please offer your alms.

243
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,000
Now pour water to dedicate the merit.

244
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
[chanting]

245
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:56,960
Ploy,

246
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
Is this why you like making merit?

247
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,400
Hmm… I’m not that religious, really.

248
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:11,000
I just think merit-making is
a kind of mental practice.

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,600
One that shows its effects quickly.

250
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,440
And

251
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,320
Do you believe in past and future lives, Ploy?

252
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,360
I don’t know.

253
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,960
I guess I’ll have to die first
before I can tell you.

254
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,440
Then come back and
tell me in lotto numbers, okay?

255
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,120
Three digits;
exact ones, please.

256
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,080
But honestly

257
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,440
It’s better not to wait for the next life.

258
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,120
Do good things for each other
in this one instead.

259
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,800
Like

260
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,120
Sharing my umbrella with a sleepyhead

261
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,480
Who didn’t bring anything.

262
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,280
Who knows?

263
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,120
We might keep running into each other.

264
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,720
"Who knows?"

265
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,600
"We might keep running into each other."

266
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,400
Good deeds never go unrewarded, it’s real.

267
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,320
Pun: "What are you up to, Ploy?"

268
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,400
“Thanks again for today.”

269
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
“Girls! Emergency!”

270
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,680
“I’m about to text Ploy, to flirt!”

271
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,000
“How should I start?”

272
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,680
Best: “Gosh. She’s right next door.

273
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,360
Just go to her room!”

274
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,080
“We’re not that close yet.”

275
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,800
Chakrit: “Then make it happen,

276
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,880
get close tonight!”

277
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,280
“How?”

278
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,880
Wanjieab: “Are you sick or something, Pun?”

279
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,240
“When it’s a guy you like,”

280
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,600
“you’re never this shy.”

281
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,360
“Just flirt with her
the way you flirt with men!”

282
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,080
“It’s not the same.”

283
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,120
“What do you mean it’s not the same?”

284
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
“Normally, guys are the ones
who come to me.”

285
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,520
"And when I flirted with them,”

286
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,440
“I never felt this nervous.”

287
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,840
“I don’t know how to act.”

288
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,440
“I can’t tell what’s too much or too little.”

289
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,040
“What if she thinks I’m weird… or too much?”

290
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,960
“Pun, why do you care this much?”

291
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,600
“Seriously, this is so not like you.”

292
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,880
"From the way you’re acting"

293
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,440
“Don’t tell me
you’ve actually fallen for her.”

294
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,040
“That’s game over, girl.”

295
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,800
“If you fall for your own target.”

296
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,840
“Oh, what a waste of time.”

297
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
“Stop nitpicking me!”

298
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,720
“Give me something useful!”

299
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,840
“Go for a soft,"

300
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,880
"no-makeup makeup look.”

301
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,520
“But bold lips. And a short skirt.”

302
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,880
"Show off your best assets"

303
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,760
“But keep that sweet and innocent vibe.”

304
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,600
“Then go to her room.”

305
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,720
“Ask her out! Dinner, a play, whatever.”

306
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,960
“Just don’t make it sound too plain.”

307
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,280
“Use what your mama gave you.”

308
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,920
“Maybe ‘accidentally’ show a little cleavage
just enough to tease."

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,400
"Or touch her arm a little."

310
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,200
“Do you have a version that’s less terrifying?”

311
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,160
“Something not so aggressive?”

312
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,800
“Pun, where did your confidence go?”

313
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,920
"Is it gone?”

314
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,960
“If you wanna win, bring it back.”

315
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,920
“Just be yourself.”

316
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,400
“Look at Ploy the way you’d look at
any of your flings.”

317
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,200
“She’s not that special. That’s it.
Case closed.”

318
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:58,960
"Whatever!"

319
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,960
Alright. Here goes.

320
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,400
“I had a great time making merit today.”

321
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,440
“It really made me feel at peace.”

322
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,160
(Pun: “I had a great time making merit today.
It really made me feel at peace.”)

323
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,560
Ugh, read it today or tomorrow.
Whatever. Up to you.

324
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,400
Who even cares.

325
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,400
Hmph.

326
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,520
“So… have you conquered her heart yet, babe?”

327
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,000
“If you still don’t know how,
come train in my room first.”

328
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,600
What now?

329
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,600
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

330
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,120
Okay.

331
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
That’s it?

332
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,120
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

333
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,040
Still nothing.

334
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,320
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

335
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Still nothing!

336
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,080
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

337
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,200
Still.

338
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,440
Still no reply?

339
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,840
No reply… no reply…

340
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,520
She’s really not replying.

341
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,640
(Ploy: “Okay.”)

342
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,760
You’re really not gonna text back,
huh, Ploy?

343
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,160
“Why isn’t she replying?! Reply, reply, reply!”

344
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,880
You’re really not gonna answer,
are you, Ploy?

345
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,760
Ploy: “Wanna go again?”

346
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,200
Let’s wait 3 minutes.

347
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,680
Three

348
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,920
Two

349
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,960
One

350
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,480
Screw it. I’m texting her!

351
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,120
Pun: “Going where?”

352
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
Ploy: “To make merit.”

353
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,320
Pun: “Mind if I come along?”

354
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,440
Ploy: “Not gonna bail on me again
for oversleeping, right?”

355
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,480
“Can I answer that with actions instead?”

356
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,160
“Then give me your answer
on the next Buddhist holy day.”

357
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,680
"6 a.m., outside my door.”

358
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,200
“Can I give my answer before that day?”

359
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,840
(Ploy: “?”)

360
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,960
“I found a nice restaurant online.”

361
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,080
"I’d love to take you there.”

362
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,360
Ahem.

363
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,680
Hello?

364
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,440
Hello?

365
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,760
Hello, Ploy?

366
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,720
You’re asking me out, right?

367
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,240
I just wanted to thank you
for helping me that day.

368
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,720
Let me see the place first.

369
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,520
What if I don’t show you, you won’t go?

370
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,360
Should I go?

371
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,600
I’d really like you to.

372
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,320
I’m free tonight.

373
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,160
Meet me in the lobby in 30 minutes.

374
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,240
Okay!

375
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,640
Oh, crap! I don’t even have a place yet!

376
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,320
Find one now, Pun!

377
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,200
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

378
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,760
Do you like this place, Ploy?

379
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,560
I do.

380
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,840
Good choice.

381
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,440
I just found out

382
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,760
You’re the one who taught Prang how to cook.

383
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,680
She forced me to.

384
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,400
Have you ever thought about
opening your own restaurant?

385
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,640
I noticed you seemed to love cooking too.

386
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
I like cooking for people close to me more.

387
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,040
My brother opened one,
and it looked like way too much work.

388
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,920
"Oh"

389
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,160
"It's time."

390
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,200
I never knew you had a brother.

391
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,560
Yes, an older one.

392
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,920
He runs a restaurant in New York.

393
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
New York?

394
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,280
I just came back from there.

395
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,440
What’s it called? Maybe I’ve heard of it.

396
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,240
Let’s Eat Thai.

397
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,440
It’s in Brooklyn. Know it?

398
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,760
Hmm. I'm not sure actually.

399
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,480
So

400
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,880
Have you ever been to
your brother’s restaurant?

401
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:09,880
Yeah.

402
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,200
But it’s been a while.

403
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,080
Are you two close?

404
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,600
I’m close with everyone who’s cute.

405
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,640
Well...

406
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,440
When I was in New York,

407
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,840
I actually thought about
opening a Thai restaurant too.

408
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,120
It’s a shame, really.

409
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,080
I didn’t know anything about running one.

410
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,000
Would’ve been nice to have someone to guide me.

411
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,320
By the way

412
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,600
Does your brother ever come back to Thailand?

413
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,560
I’d love to see the two of you cooking together.

414
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,040
He just got back.

415
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,320
And if I...

416
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,720
You ran out of my question quota for tonight.

417
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,160
Mind if I ask one instead?

418
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,440
Do you like women?

419
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,120
Like them or not,

420
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,800
That depends on who’s asking.

421
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,120
And if I’m the one asking?

422
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,560
You’re looking at me like I’m a kid, Ploy.

423
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,720
I don’t even realize I’m doing it.

424
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,720
But technically

425
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,080
I am older than you, Pun.

426
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,840
And that look in your eyes,

427
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,320
It’s like you’re staring at someone
who still hasn’t grown up.

428
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,840
You didn’t answer my question.

429
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,160
I did. I’ve answered everything you asked.

430
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,600
I asked

431
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,960
if you like women.

432
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,360
Was that too hard of a question?

433
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,440
Ploy,

434
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,960
I prefer answering with actions, not words.

435
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,640
If you really want to know

436
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,800
then we’ll have to see each other more often.

437
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,160
Oh shoot.

438
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
My phone’s dead.

439
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,280
Here.

440
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,440
Ploy,

441
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,320
I’ll go charge it and transfer the money back to you.

442
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,560
It’s alright.

443
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,040
Dinner’s on me tonight.

444
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,080
Are you mad at me?

445
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,960
I’m mad at myself.

446
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,800
Then why the pouty face?

447
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,480
I wanted to treat you, but you wouldn’t let me.

448
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,520
I’m free next week too.

449
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,640
Really?

450
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,960
I’ll make a list of things you need to buy.

451
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,360
To make up for dinner being on me tonight.
I’ll send it to you in chat.

452
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,400
If that’s okay,

453
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,720
come over to my place.

454
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,600
Okay.

455
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,840
Okay.

456
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:31,840
Thank you.

457
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,080
Like this.

458
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:36,840
Mhm.

459
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,200
Like this.

460
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,400
No.

461
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,200
Here, slice it thinner. Like this.

462
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,440
Ah, got it.

463
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,200
Careful with your fingers.

464
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,680
This is so weird.

465
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,360
Why’d you suddenly ask Prang to teach you how to cook?

466
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,160
So I can make my own meals sometimes.
Saves money, Jay.

467
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,720
You make it sound like you’re broke.

468
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,400
Broke? What?

469
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,280
You’re the one who said

470
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,840
saving up a little wouldn’t hurt.

471
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,800
Sure, sure.

472
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,400
I thought maybe
you were learning to cook for someone.

473
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,240
Nope.

474
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
No one to cook for.

475
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh, Pun.

476
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,560
This looks so awful.

477
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,080
Who’d even eat this?
None of the pieces are the same size.

478
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
They are the same!

479
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,600
No, they’re not.

480
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,520
They totally are.

481
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,440
None of them look good.

482
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,160
They’re good!

483
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,160
Oh!

484
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,840
Your face’s covered in vitamins.

485
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:40,840
Not funny.

486
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,600
Babe.

487
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,080
Hey.

488
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,840
Did you get everything?

489
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:26,120
Yep, all set.

490
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,360
But

491
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,880
All of this still doesn’t even come close
to half of what you paid for dinner.

492
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,760
It’s alright.

493
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:39,120
I was thinking,
should we invite Jay and Prang to join us?

494
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,679
Well...

495
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,280
If you’d rather have company tonight, that’s fine.

496
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,800
Go ahead and invite them if you want.

497
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,920
Does that mean

498
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,560
You’d like me to?

499
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,520
Sure. The more, the merrier, right?

500
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,160
Actually, no.

501
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,560
I’ve changed my mind.

502
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,600
Why’s that?

503
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,360
Because it’ll just give me a headache.

504
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,440
Two sisters cooking together...

505
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,240
Come on, let me help.

506
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:26,760
Let’s see what you bought.

507
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,000
This one.

508
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,720
And two of these, right?

509
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,480
Mhm.

510
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,680
Good job.

511
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,920
Do you like reading, Ploy?

512
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,160
I do.

513
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,160
But lately I’ve been busy.

514
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,880
Hardly have time to read anymore.

515
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,840
Books just end up sitting on the shelf.

516
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,240
Hmm… in that case.

517
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,000
Do you like movies?

518
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,560
I watched some, yeah.

519
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,080
Then...

520
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,560
Wanna go see a movie?

521
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,560
I heard there’s a new horror film out.

522
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,080
Looks really good.

523
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,880
You’re asking me to see a horror movie?

524
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,000
So

525
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,840
Are you coming or not?

526
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,160
Will you at least buy me popcorn?

527
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,080
Hmm

528
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,240
You can even hold my hand

529
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,800
if you get scared.

530
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,160
I’ll think about it.

531
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,560
How about 9 p.m.?

532
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,480

00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,400
Hm?

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,920
Okay.

535
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,960
I’ll book it then.

536
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,480

00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,680
That’s enough.

554
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,840
I can’t take this anymore.

555
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,000
Please..

556
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,440
Don’t go.

557
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,360
From now on,

558
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,720
We have nothing to do with each other anymore.

559
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,640
Goodbye

560
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,480
Sicha!

561
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,920
My love.

562
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,640
That was great.

563
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,520
Super great. Let’s take a break.

564
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,760
We’ll pick it up again in a bit.

565
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,080
Shooting’s coming up soon, Jay.

566
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,720
I still don’t feel quite right.

567
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,800
Can we run it one more time?

568
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,320
You were amazing, babe.

569
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,440
When it’s the real shoot,
it’ll flow naturally.

570
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,520
Remember when we acted together last time?

571
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,360
We went off-script,
and it still blew up.

572
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,800
Well, we were really feeling it back then.

573
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,120
Because someone around here
was pissing me off.

574
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,960
Wait, how did I get dragged into this again?

575
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,000
But now you’re adorable.

576
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,880
Really?

577
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:46,600
Really.

578
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,440
How adorable, exactly?

579
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,520
Like the whole world kind.

580
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,320
Say it again.

581
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,600
This much.

582
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,240
Here you go.

583
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,000
Popcorn and drinks.

584
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,160
Wow,

585
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,080
So you’re paying for all?

586
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,920
The movie, the popcorn,

587
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,520
and the drinks?

588
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,120
Yup. I’m older, remember?

589
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,000
You always use age as an excuse.

590
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,960
Next time, you’re treating me

591
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,360
to Omakase.

592
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,040
Wow, then you should probably call me

593
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,880
'Daddy Ploy'.

594
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,920
Ploy!

595
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,560
I’m not a sugar baby, you know.

596
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:57,320
I might be younger,
but I can take care of the grown-up one too.

597
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,720
Ploy,

598
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,400
Do you ever feel uncomfortable

599
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,360
When people stare at you like that?

600
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,240
As an actress,

601
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,400
If no one noticed me at all,
I’d probably be even more stressed.

602
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,640
Shall we go?

603
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,400
Which theater are we in?

604
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,880
I won't tell you.

605
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,480
I just want you to follow me.

606
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,200
This kid...

607
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,400
Shouldn’t have trusted you with the tickets.

608
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,600
You can hold my hand,

609
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,760
if you’re afraid of getting lost.

610
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:06,720
Ploy.

611
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,760
Hm?

612
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,440
Aren’t you cold?

613
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,000
No, I’m fine.

614
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,160
“Hold her hand.”

615
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,120
“Move closer, Pun. Come on. Don’t be shy.”

616
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,320
[screams from the movie]

617
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,560
Pun.

618
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,720
Yeah?

619
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,880
I’m scared of ghosts.

620
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,240
I told you,

621
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,040
If you got scared, you could hold my hand.

622
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,040
But it takes half the movie for you

623
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,000
To finally get scared.

624
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,520
You’re not scared, Pun?

625
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,120
I was terrified 10 minutes in.

626
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,920
Those sneakers look cute on you, by the way.

627
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,920
Well, this way, we’re the same height.

628
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,320
If you keep staring like that,

629
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,040
you’re gonna make me nervous.

630
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,160
Well, you’re just too cute, Ploy.

631
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,360
By the way,

632
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,480
Were you really scared of the ghosts?

633
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,760
Why do you ask?

634
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,320
Well, maybe,

635
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,520
you were just pretending,
so you could hold my hand.

636
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,160
Like how you pretended
to look for your earring in my room?

637
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,280
What?

638
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,880
Wait, what are you talking about?

639
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:18,000
I cleaned every corner of my room, Pun.

640
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,560
Your little tricks still need some work.

641
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,400
Well, I didn’t know you’d be so..

642
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,000
It’s fine.

643
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,360
It’s actually kind of cute.

644
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,480
Um, Ploy,

645
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,280
I have something for you.

646
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,800
Here.

647
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,320
I knew you liked these,
so I bought them for you.

648
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,600
Thank you.

649
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,760
Open it.

650
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,520
Size 35?

651
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,080
“That’s my size. Prang ordered that, didn’t she?”

652
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,640
I’ll take the pair she picked. Size 35, please.

653
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,560
I’m sorry.

654
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,000
It’s alright.

655
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,480
I attentively picked them for you after all.

656
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,320
Even if they don’t fit...

657
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:26,360
I’m just happy you thought of me.

658
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,280
Even if I can't wear them,

659
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,520
I’ll keep them safe.

660
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,680
It's so lovely.

661
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:46,480
Do you like butterflies, Pun?

662
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:48,520
Not really.

663
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,080
But lately, I don’t know why,

664
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,760
I’ve been thinking about butterflies a lot.

665
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:00,200
I was planning to fold a bunch of them,
and stick them together into a big collage.

666
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:03,920
Oh, that’s right.

667
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,520
Prang once mentioned that you like art.

668
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,560
You’re a graphic designer, aren’t you?

669
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,400
That’s really lovely.

670
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,200
I like that.

671
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,920
Hmm...

672
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,440
Can I try folding one too?

673
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,120
Hm?

674
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,840
Will you teach me?

675
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,120
Sure, of course.

676
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,240
I actually brought some paper.

677
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:41,880
Come here.

678
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,480
I’ll show you.

679
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:50,200
“I’ve always believed good design
is about creating lasting impressions.”

680
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,000
“Even before I became a graphic designer.”

681
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:59,200
“my life has always revolved around
making the people I love feel special.”

682
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,200
“I’ve worked so hard,
pouring everything I have into it."

683
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,080
“Just to impress someone.”

684
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,880
Hope the proposal goes smoothly, Jay.

685
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,800
Prang’s really lucky to have you.

686
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,680
“But somewhere along the way”

687
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,120
“I forgot something important; clients.”

688
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,960
“The people I actually wanted to impress.”

689
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:27,840
“I should’ve tried to understand them deeply.”

690
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:31,320
"To understand the deeper feelings and values within."

691
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,200
“What kind of value really moves them?”

692
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,120
“What kind of meaning brings out that kind of smile?”

693
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,080
“I want to understand it better.”

694
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,520
“I want to see

695
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,160
that smile again.”

696
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,600
Done.

697
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,560
Let’s see.

698
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,880
It's beautiful.

699
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,400
Of course.

700
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,240
Then I’ll put this one

701
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,960
right in the center of my collage.

702
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,440
Go ahead.

703
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,760
Compare it with the teacher’s, then.

704
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,160
Well, the teacher’s is a bit bigger.

705
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:00,760
"Actually,"

706
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,000
“It’s quite strange."

707
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,640
"Maybe, Ploy knows more about Phetai than she lets on."

708
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:08,960
Phe?

709
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:16,040
(Next episode)
