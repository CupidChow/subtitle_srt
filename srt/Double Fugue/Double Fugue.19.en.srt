Help!

18
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,160
Yuebai.

19
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,520
Yuebai.

20
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,720
Yuebai!

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,240
Yuebai!

22
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,210
Yuebai.

23
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,010
Where are you?

24
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,010
Yuebai, can you hear me?

25
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,240
Yuebai!

26
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,200
Yuebai.

27
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,090
Don't

28
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,690
be afraid.

29
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,290
Slowly

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,600
close your eyes.

31
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,090
Don't mind the darkness!

32
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,760
Just pretend

33
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,570
the darkness is golden wheat.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,040
Slowly

35
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,440
crawl to the door.

36
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,480
Push it open.

37
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,690
Can you hear me?

38
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,480
Yuebai!

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,290
Don't be afraid!

40
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,600
I'm right here.

41
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,920
Slowly

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,410
crawl forward.

43
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,370
Crawl forward slowly

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,880
and gently push the door open.

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,010
Can you hear me, Yuebai?

46
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,410
Lu Li.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,410
Are you okay?

48
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,250
It's you.

49
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,050
Don't be afraid.

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,440
Yuebai.

51
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,280
Since you love each other so much,

52
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,610
I'll let you be together.

53
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:02,840
Don't be afraid.

54
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Get out of the way!

55
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,690
Get out of the way!

56
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,010
How did it go?

57
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,080
Everything's done.

58
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,250
Financial crimes,

59
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,840
murder, and kidnapping.

60
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
She's in deep trouble.

61
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
Hopefully,

62
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,200
she'll never get out.

63
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,130
Yes.

64
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,050
About Lu Li...

65
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,010
(Lu Li File)
Should we...

66
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,250
What a good daughter.

67
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,640
How dare she fool me with a fake?

68
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,440
Keep an eye on them.

69
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,440
Report everything to me.

70
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,610
Yes.

71
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,490
Go on!

72
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,500
(Shilun Group Internal System,
Access Denied)

73
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,210
What's wrong?

74
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,730
Su Shilun locked most of my access.

75
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,880
Most of it?

76
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,010
Seems like we need to decode

77
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,360
the painting's secret soon.

78
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,800
Planning to stare a hole in it?

79
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,880
Why can't I figure out

80
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:41,040
this painting's secret?

81
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,250
What is it?

82
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,210
It's strange.

83
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,400
This color

84
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,210
looks different than yesterday morning.

85
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,800
How different?

86
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I got it.

87
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,090
Some painters

88
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,250
use special layers

89
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,450
on the surface

90
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,640
to hide the true meaning.

91
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,880
Do you have a UV light?

92
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,800
UV light?

93
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,090
I'll go check.

94
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,880
This one?

95
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,880
Yes.

96
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,250
127?

97
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,330
December 7th?

98
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,400
Is that an important date?

99
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,400
Not really.

100
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,800
Is it related to your mother?

101
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,730
Where are you going?

102
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,880
This is my mother's diary.

103
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,280
Her diary?

104
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,400
November 3rd.

105
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,800
December 6th.

106
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:41,520
But no December 7th.

107
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,400
Wait a minute.

108
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,850
Looks like

109
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,130
there's erased writing.

110
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,420
(Su Shilun.
I only have hatred for that name.)

111
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,560
(He takes advantage of my feelings
for him like a hidden snake.)

112
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,360

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,640

114
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:22,640
(but they're only unfounded rumors.)

115
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
Let me make announce formally.

00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,800

do it outside,

131
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,640
not in my house.

132
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:57,880
Thank you.

133
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,640
You put yourself

134
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,520
in such a state for a man.

135
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,250
How impressive.

136
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,640
I... It's not just about Tang Bei.

137
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,450
It's also about my dad.

138
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:25,920
I...

139
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,450
I keep feeling

140
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,760
he's different

141
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,130
from before.

142
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,010
Maybe

143
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,800
you never really knew the real him.

144
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,040
No way.

145
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,730
My dad always doted on me.

146
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,730
Do you know

147
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,490
why Wang Yayin ended up like this?

148
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,800
Isn't it
because she was greedy for our fortune?

149
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,090
Wrong.

150
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,090
Your dad deliberately gave her

151
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,280
a company with problems.

152
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,250
Wang Yayin used Tang Bei to trick you

153
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,850
and embezzled company assets.

154
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,330
She deserves punishment.

155
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,680
But Su Shilun wasn't satisfied.

156
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,040
He pinned all his crimes

157
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,800
on Wang Yayin.

158
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,520
Lu Li's parents

159
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,400
are also dead because of him.

160
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,280
And my mom.

161
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,730
No way.

162
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,090
Stop slandering him.

163
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,920
My dad's not like that.

164
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,640
You'll face it eventually.

165
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,730
(Tang Bei.)

166
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,080
(Stop making mistakes.)

167
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,520
Mistakes?

168
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,080
Why say I'm wrong?

169
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,170
Why say I'm wrong?

170
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,450
What did I do wrong?

171
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,170
It's Qin Yuebai who's wrong.

172
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,690
Qin Yuebai's wrong, got it?

173
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,250
I...

174
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,600
I just want to protect Yayin.

175
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,800
I want to protect you.

176
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,120
I want to protect all of you.

177
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,890
I just want to protect all of you.

178
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,280
I just want to protect all of you.

179
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,800
Once Qin Yuebai is gone,

180
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,450
everything will be fine.

181
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,560
Tang Bei.

182
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,800
Look at me.

183
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,560
Can you do it

184
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,210
just once for me?

185
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,650
Please don't do this.

186
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,410
It's not too late.

187
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:45,120
You could have a bright future.

188
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,320
But if you really kill someone,

189
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,600
what about me?

190
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,210
You already abandoned me once.

191
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,080
Are you going to abandon me again?

192
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,120
I'm sorry.

193
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,490
I...

194
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,730
I...

195
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,010
I'll turn myself in.

196
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,760
Lu Li.

197
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,250
You've lost everything,

198
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,040
yet you still want me

199
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,120
to help bring down Su Shilun?

200
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,120
If you want to discuss the deal,

201
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,010
you should show some sincerity.

202
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,600
What leverage

203
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,760
do you have left?

204
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,120
Lu Li.

205
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:02,210
Are you here for this?

206
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Now that I look closely,

207
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,010
your eyes

208
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,490
really resemble your father.

209
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,690
You're not worthy to say their names.

210
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,450
You even have the same temper.

211
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:35,080
No rush.

212
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,970
Is this what you want?

213
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,600
You know what?

214
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,690
This is my proudest creation.

215
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,120
You're a great artist.

216
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,170
A genius artist.

217
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:03,930
I believe

218
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,930
you understand

219
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,360
this passion for art.

220
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,010
You're a genius artist.

221
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,650
A genius.

222
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,930
I know you schemed

223
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,840
to get close to my daughter
just to reach me.

224
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,650
You only wanted these things.

225
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,690
It's a pity

226
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,320
you fell in love with her.

227
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,490
You believed in love too much.

228
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,840
Just like how your parents

229
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,840
believed in me.

230
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,040
You know we're all animals

231
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,490
in this world,

232
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,760
but animals are divided

233
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
into high and low levels.

234
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,890
If you believe in love,

235
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,930
you become a low-level animal.

236
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,800
Fire.

237
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,730
Are you afraid of fire?

238
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,490
You're afraid of fire too.

239
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,970
They were burned alive

240
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,890
in that car back then.

241
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,930
I often have nightmares.

242
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,800
I dream of them

243
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,170
struggling in the car

244
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,120
and screaming for help.

245
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,040
I often wake up terrified.

246
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:22,040
Maybe it's their punishment for me,

247
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,930
but it's useless.

248
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,800
Everything has turned to ashes.

249
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,250
Just like this evidence.

250
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,250
It will all turn to ashes.

251
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,650
You'll get nothing.

252
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,970
Fool.

253
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,250
Don't struggle.

254
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,760
Enjoy all this.

255
00:24:15,285 --> 00:24:16,960
(Exclusive
Artist Representation Agreement)

256
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:33,960
(Party B: Lu Li)

257
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,410
Is this sincere

258
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,040
enough?

259
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,360
Lu Li.

260
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,010
You used your lifetime agency contract

261
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,010
to exchange
for evidence of Su Shilun's crime.

262
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,890
Do you think it's worth it?

263
00:25:17,922 --> 00:25:19,747
(Su Shilun)

264
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,800
Here, Mr. Sun.

265
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,010
Take a look.

266
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,600
After all that have happened,

267
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,170
it's still the two of us.

268
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
With you joining us,

269
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,170
our group will only grow stronger.

270
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,170
Mr. Su.

271
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,250
Don't flatter me.

272
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
I'm only benefiting

273
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,360
from your lead

274
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,170
in this acquisition.

275
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,800
It's the boss behind me

276
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,250
who's wealthy

277
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,490
and capable.

278
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,210
Mr. Sun.

279
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,520
I haven't even met that boss

280
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,930
behind you.

281
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,040
How about this?

282
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,930
I'll arrange

283
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,280
the signing ceremony.

284
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,970
We're forming a powerful alliance.

285
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,690
I need to publicize it.

286
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,250
Please don't.

287
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,120
That person

288
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,250
likes to stay low-key.

289
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,080
Let's not ruin things.

290
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,320
Leave

291
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,170
this matter to me.

292
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,760
I'll leave it to you then.

293
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:28,970
Farewell.

294
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,280
Farewell.

295
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:37,800
Mr. Sun.

296
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:41,000
Mr. Su.

297
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,010
Here's an overview
of our acquisitions abroad.

298
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,840
