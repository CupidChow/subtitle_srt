15
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Look.

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,080
This...

17
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,600
This really is an original by L.

18
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,570
Bro, you actually have L's original?

19
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,650
How did you get it?

20
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,010
Do you believe me now?

21
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,290
Let me tell you a secret.

22
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,720
L and I are actually

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,090
buddies.

24
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,600
I knew it. Buddies?

25
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,810
Calling you "bro" is an honor.

26
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,290
It's a privilege.

27
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,480
Really, I'll toast to you.

28
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,370
Here.

29
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:39,850
L

30
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,290
must be so lucky.

31
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:41,690
I mean...

32
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,600
He's a genius artist

33
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,090
with someone who truly understands him

34
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:46,370
by his side.

35
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,250
Right?

36
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,040
Actually,

37
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:52,970
everyone

38
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,090
has a past they don't want to mention.

39
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,440
L

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,570
is living worse
than an average person now.

41
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,810
Think about it.

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,640
His parents

43
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,090
were involved in art dealing.

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,480
But something unexpected
happened to them

45
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,570
because of this.

46
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,440
Tell me

47
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,880
who could let that go so easily?

48
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,040
So his parents...

49
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,160
Let's not talk about them.

50
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,040
Here, let's drink.

51
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,130
Here, drink.

52
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,290
We should enjoy today.

53
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,160
- Here.
- Enjoy.

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,880
But no matter what...

55
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:30,850
Look.

56
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,200
The paintings you showed me.

57
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,410
For L to create those,

58
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,760
he's clearly a genius.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,760
An absolute genius.

60
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,760
You know what?

61
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,370
That painting I just showed you

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,690
is his masterpiece.

63
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,010
He'll never be able

64
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,040
to draw like that again.

65
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,600
What do you mean?

66
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
L

67
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,320
has stopped painting?

68
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:54,760
No.

69
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:57,600
He simply

70
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,530
can't paint any...

71
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:04,920
He simply

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,370
can't paint

73
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,320
like that anymore.

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,290
Now you know, right?

75
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:11,760
Yes.

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,410
Here, let's drink.

77
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,480
Let's drink up.

78
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:16,400
Drink.

79
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,370
Bro, let me refill for you.

80
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,130
- Here.
- Good.

81
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,170
So that means

82
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,690
ever since Qin Yuebai

83
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,520
became Lu Li's agent,

84
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,520
they've only been selling old works?

85
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,810
Exactly.

86
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,690
With L's current commercial value,

87
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,730
each painting is worth a fortune.

88
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,280
And new works are even more valuable.

89
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,520
It's been so long with no new paintings.

90
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
That's strange.

91
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,010
No new work at all?

92
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,570
Could it be
he really can't paint anymore?

93
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,880
That gives us something to play with.

94
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,170
Hello, Mr. Zhu?

95
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,760
Ms. Qin, are you playing games with me?

96
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,880
What do you mean by that?

97
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,010
Check the news yourself.

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,872
(Art Scandal: L Used Ghost Painters.
Parents Were Shady Business People.)

99
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,730
(Who knows
if someone else painted for him.)

100
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,360
(This is complicated.)

101
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,320
(Shady business people.)

102
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,730
(It could be a cycle of revenge.)

103
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,800
(L is seriously disgusting.)

104
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,930
(There was a lot of buzz
about the signing a while ago.)

105
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,010
(He might've been using his parents
to gain pity.)

106
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:04,920
(Check my profile.)

107
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,370
(I got inside scoop on L's parents'
reversed art and car crash.)

108
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,880
You have a callus on your pinky.

109
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,570
This only comes from years of painting.

110
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,200
Draw something for me.

111
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,690
What if I told you

112
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,730
it's true I can't paint anymore?

113
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,050
Would you still believe me?

114
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,440
(Who would believe)

115
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,170
(someone who can't even hold a brush)

116
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,730
(was once a genius artist?)

117
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:00,272
(Shilun Group)

118
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,280
Do you know what people outside

119
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,810
are saying about us?

120
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,610
They say we faked everything

121
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,010
just to promote my future son-in-law.

122
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,280
Even if it meant ruining our reputation.

123
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,200
This is all your doing.

124
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,010
Take a look.

125
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,570
Dad.

126
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,810
Let me explain.

127
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,640
I don't want any explanations!

128
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,440
I'm telling you.

129
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,200
You must immediately cut ties

130
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,370
with that Lu guy.

131
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,080
I'll take care of everything else.

132
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,400
I won't abandon Lu Li.

133
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,760
What did you say?

134
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,840
I will clear his name

135
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,250
and restore the gallery's reputation.

136
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,170
Someone

137
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,810
set him

138
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:50,880
and our group up.

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,960
I'll find out who's behind this.

140
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,080
Alright.

141
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,250
I'll wait and see.

142
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:47,760
Yuebai.

143
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,490
Are you okay?

144
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,370
The stock price is crashing,

145
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,880
so your dad's upset

146
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
and spoke a bit harshly.

147
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,640
Don't take it to heart.

148
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
Since when do you need to meddle

149
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,880
between me and my father?

150
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,760
It really has nothing to do with me.

151
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,730
But

152
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:10,280
now that Baoyan's gone,

153
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,490
I'm the only one left around Shilun.

154
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,370
If you come back to help more often,

155
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,400
he might be less stressed.

156
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,010
Come back?

157
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,970
Come back to watch you put on a show?

158
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,760
What's that supposed to mean?

159
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,370
Don't think I don't know

160
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,090
you're the one stirring trouble
behind the scenes.

161
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,330
Yuebai.

162
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,010
Come home more often.

163
00:10:22,035 --> 00:10:23,122
(Sorry.)

164
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,110
(The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.)

165
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,520
(Please try again later.)

166
00:10:32,712 --> 00:10:33,522
(Sorry.)

167
00:10:33,522 --> 00:10:36,072
(The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.)

168
00:10:36,122 --> 00:10:37,522
(Please try again later.)

169
00:10:41,197 --> 00:10:42,240
(Sorry.)

170
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,810
(The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.)

171
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,170
(Please try again later.)

172
00:10:59,247 --> 00:11:02,235
(Unknown Number: I might know what's up
with Lu Li. Can we meet?)

173
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,370
It's all my fault.

174
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:53,800
I...

175
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,920
I drank too much and ran my mouth.

176
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,640
Lu is my best friend.

177
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,610
I...

178
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:01,800
Ms. Qin.

179
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,760
What should I do now?

180
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,210
Calm down first.

181
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,730
So you're saying

182
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,400
a guy tried to cozy up to you

183
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,880
to get information on Lu Li?

184
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,010
What does he look like?

185
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,160
Well...

186
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,760
He's tall and thin,

187
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,800
has thick eyebrows, big eyes,

188
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:21,490
a high nose bridge

189
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,160
and

190
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,160
a mole on his eyelid.

191
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,130
And...

192
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,640
That's what he looked like.

193
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,210
It's him.

194
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,610
Who?

195
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,760
Tang Bei.

196
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,450
His surname isn't Tang.

197
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:41,250
- It's Hu.
- He lied to you.

198
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,450
Tang Bei is Su Baoyan's boyfriend.

199
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,490
So it wasn't Wang Yayin?

200
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,250
Who's Wang Yayin?

201
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,920
I never expected

202
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,640
Tang Bei loved Su Baoyan that much.

203
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:54,450
He did all this to avenge her?

204
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,130
No.

205
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,760
What do we do now?

206
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,800
Our top priority now

207
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,880
is to find Lu Li.

208
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,680
I know where he is.

209
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,970
Where?

210
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:04,730
When something happens,

211
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,760
Lu always

212
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,400
hides at home

213
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,640
and cuts himself off.

214
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,210
This is his house key.

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,610
After

216
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,010
what I did,

217
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,800
I don't have the face to see him.

218
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,160
Ms. Qin.

219
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:18,680
Check on him.

220
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,280
Don't let him do anything stupid.

221
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,850
Okay.

222
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,040
(Fraud, get out of the art world!)

223
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,760
(Ban artist L for good!)

224
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,160
(He's the one
who hired a ghost painters.)

225
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,560
(He can never paint again.)

226
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:53,685
(L hired ghost painter.
Frauds have no place here. Ban him.)

227
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,800
Wang Jiye,
how many times have I told you?

228
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,970
Knock!

229
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,160
I didn't expect

230
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,560
the abandoned building L tricked me into

231
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,760
wasn't actually a scam.

232
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,370
This place is quite tasteful.

233
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,610
Did you design it yourself?

234
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,450
Sorry.

235
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,800
I did mess with you on purpose earlier.

236
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,400
It's okay.

237
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,010
I uprooted all those rice fields anyway.

238
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,210
Are you really

239
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,090
giving up on painting?

240
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,450
Everyone online is saying...

241
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,490
What?

242
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,410
All your paintings
were done by ghost painters?

243
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,560
Yes.

244
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,360
What a joke.

245
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,450
Do you know who I am?

246
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:21,210
I'm Qin Yuebai, a top art curator.

247
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,280
My eyes

248
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,210
can tell a real painting

249
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,250
from a fake.

250
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,730
There's no way

251
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,210
I'd believe what people say online.

252
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,210
Lu Li.

253
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,890
I don't care what they say.

254
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,210
You're the only one I believe.

255
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,560
Thank you.
