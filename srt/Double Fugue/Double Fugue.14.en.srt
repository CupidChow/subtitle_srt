Right, Ms. Qin?

187
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,560
Yes.

188
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,800
I'll come back often.

189
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,250
I can't bear to leave all of you.

190
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,130
Neither can we.

191
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,450
Neither can we.

192
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,280
It's Qin Yuebai's happy day.

193
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,010
How could we not send her a big gift?

194
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,730
What happened?

195
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,520
Why the rush?

196
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,880
Isn't there

197
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,490
an assistant named Hui at the gallery?

198
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,490
Yes.

199
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,490
Su Baoyan's previous subordinate.

200
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,640
A friend of mine, who's a reporter,

201
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:19,880
told me

202
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,920
that Xiao Hui

203
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,800
was bullied for years

204
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,120
by an old artist surnamed Zeng.

205
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,280
He took it out on him
whenever he couldn't paint well.

206
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Zeng

207
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,800
was signed by Su Baoyan.

208
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,250
She barely managed him.

209
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,850
How cruel.

210
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,680
That old man kept harassing Hui

211
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,840
even after he took leave.

212
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,090
Hui ended up killing himself.

213
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,800
Good thing someone found him in time.

214
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,800
He's still in the hospital.

215
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,130
My friend told me

216
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,880
since we're close.

217
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:49,970
I figure

218
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,640
other media

219
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,040
must already know too.

220
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,450
They already know.

221
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,610
So soon?

222
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,450
It's everywhere online.

223
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,210
I think

224
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,280
someone did it on purpose.

225
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,520
This is Wang Yayin's gift

226
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,600
for my promotion.

227
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,520
- Hello?
- Hello?

228
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,010
Sorry, it's confidential for now.

229
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:19,690
Yes.

230
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:20,410
Hello?

231
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,520
It's confidential for now.

232
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,600
Please stop calling.

233
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,080
- Hello?
- Hello.

234
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:24,320
Sorry.

235
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,410
It's confidential for now.

236
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:26,490
Hello.

237
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,930
We're not giving interviews.

238
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,450
Hello, it's confidential for now.

239
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:30,440
Please ignore the rumors.

240
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,010
We don't know.

241
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,960
- Stop calling.
- Hello?

242
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,680
- Give me.
- Sorry.

243
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,690
It's confidential for now.

244
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,730
Hello? We can't...

245
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:35,730
Nothing to disclose.

246
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,520
- Stop calling.
- Hello.

247
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,040
Please wait for an official statement.

248
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,480
- Hello?
- There're too many calls.

249
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,000
Hello, sorry.

250
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,040
I'm not at liberty to say.

251
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,240
We can't respond for now.

252
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,120
- Get lost!
- Get out!

253
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,250
Get out of the art world!

254
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,450
Boycott shady art!

255
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,690
You're ruining lives!

256
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,760
Give me back real art!

257
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,120
Ms. Qin.

258
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:55,210
This is what he paid me.

259
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,600
What a bully.

260
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,410
They're taking advantage
of other's trauma.

261
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,400
Hui, I'm sorry.

262
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,080
(Say Qin Yuebai told Zeng to bully you.)
You got dragged into this.

263
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:09,880
No, Ms. Qin.

264
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,800
Please don't say that.

265
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
If you hadn't
terminated the contract with Zeng,

266
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,250
I don't know how long I have to suffer.

267
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,010
But

268
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,170
I don't know how Wang Yayin

269
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,450
found out about this

270
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,760
and wanted to use this

271
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,650
to threaten you.

272
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,490
No secret stays buried forever.

273
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
She just doesn't know

274
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,350
we terminated
the contract with him long ago.

275
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,840
Hui.

276
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,930
Can you help us put on an act?

277
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,040
Yuebai, you're back.

278
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,730
You're in a good mood.

279
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,210
I can't run the gallery,

280
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,120
so I can only make coffee to pass time.

281
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,080
You seem to know the gallery well.

282
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,690
Otherwise,

283
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,800
how could you give me
such an amazing gift?

284
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,490
The Su family is big and wealthy.

285
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,040
Leeches will be attracted

286
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:03,650
and try to extort us.

287
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,320
But I believe

288
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,520
the truth will always prevail.

289
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,320
Yes.

290
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,520
Justice and truth

291
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,730
will prevail in the end.

292
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,320
(I want to tell everyone)

293
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,930
(that the true mastermind)

294
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,210
(of this whole scandal)

295
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,520
(is Su Shilun's third wife,)

296
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,730
(Wang Yayin.)

297
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,140
(She instructed me
to slander the gallery,)

298
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,450
(manipulate public opinion)

299
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,490
(and slander Qin Yuebai.)

300
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,690
(She did all this)

301
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,010
(for power and control.)

302
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,890
(I was indeed bullied,)

303
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,250
(but the truth is...)

304
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:48,210
You all schemed against me.

305
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:54,520
You're skilled at using people's flaws,

306
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:55,970
but you forgot

307
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,320
about people's kindness.

308
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,410
Your distraction plan was clever,

309
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,360
but there's another move

310
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,890
called using their plan against them.

311
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,160
About today's incident...

312
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,010
Let's not discuss it.

313
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,010
You shouldn't have used

314
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,750
Shilun Group's reputation
to make a scene.

315
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,650
I admit I didn't think...

316
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,600
Don't go to the board

317
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,520
for now.

318
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,600
Defeating the enemy

319
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:04,890
feels so good.

320
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,930
It's barely begun,

321
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,840
yet she's already asserting dominance.

322
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,890
I guess more obstacles will appear

323
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:14,210
once you're on the board.

324
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,450
You're right.

325
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,600
But still,

326
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,410
we'll deal

327
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,930
with whatever comes our way.

328
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,760
Tonight, we're only celebrating.

329
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,185

330
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,930
Alright.

331
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,080
You've had enough.

332
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,840

333
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,250
No.
