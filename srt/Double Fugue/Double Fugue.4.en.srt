In regard to your recent appearance

29
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,560

36

thank you very much for your concern.

37
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,140
There are some rumors on the Internet

38
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,210
that are going viral now.

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,140
But these are all false accusations.

40

I solemnly announce

41
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,530

that every woman in this world would make.

I really didn't.

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,900

- Great.

73
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:05,900
Baoyan,

74
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,770
impressive.

75
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,180
You actually invited

76
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,650
Mr. Zeng to come here.

77
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,970
It's all thanks to my father.

78
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,250
If it weren't for his sake,

79
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,930
I couldn't get Mr. Zeng to come
by myself.

80

Mr. Su,

81
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,540
what a blessing.

82
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,060
You have such a capable daughter.

83
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,370
- I think
- Exactly.

84
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,490
no discussion is needed.

Next year's anniversary conference,

86

in my opinion,

87
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,740
should be handled by Baoyan.

88
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,130
Thank you, everyone.

89
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,490
Hold on.

90
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,930
I want to fight for it, too.

91
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,250
Qin Yuebai?

92
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,740
On what basis are you fighting with me?

93
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,840
At tomorrow's press conference,

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,570
I will sign an exclusive agency contract

95
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,490
with L.

96
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,370
L is a tough ask.

97
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,300
Yes.

98
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,130
Dad.

99
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,180
Let me go.

100
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,570
Let me go.

101
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,780
- Are you crazy?
- You are the crazy one.

102
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,930
Have you found L?

103
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,010
What to do tomorrow?

104
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,620
Why are you so worried about me?

105
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,930
I'm not worried about you.

106
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,690
I just

107
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,370
want to save my job.

108
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,810
Then you don't have to worry.

109
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,180
What do you mean?

110
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,300
Because

111
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,420
I've contacted L.

112
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:54,097
(Hello, Manager Qin, I am L.
Thank you for inviting me.)

113
00:05:54,097 --> 00:05:56,447
(But as you might know,
my schedule will be quite full.)

114
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,930
Can you tell the difference
between Li Kui and Li Gui?

115
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,100
If you say so,

116
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,100
do you know L very well?

117
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,980
I'm just wondering

118
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,690
why L would cooperate with you.

119
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,930
I'm a businessman, what do you think?

120
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,130
L is not short of money.

121
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,010
Wrong.

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,300
There is nothing in this world
that cannot be bought with money.

123
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,490
If so,

124
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,930
it just needs more money.

125
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:36,980
What if

126
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,920
that person you contacted isn't L

127
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,620
but a fake person,

128
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,540
and the real L appears?

129
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,330
What should you do?

130
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,690
That's my wish.

131
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,540
I'm waiting for his arrival.

132
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:56,620
I hurt you, didn't I?

We're still trying.

139

Okay.

140
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,570
As long as you can get anything on L,

141
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,180
money isn't an issue.

142
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:13,860
Okay.

143
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,620

Do you really think Qin Yuebai
can sign the contract successfully?

191
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,900
Do as I say.

192
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,420
Yes.

193
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,090
Time is almost up.

194
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,610
Where is the one you are waiting for?

195
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,380
Aren't you here?

196
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,300
Mr. L.

197
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,610
Are you sick?

198
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,540
Why did you start talking nonsense?

199
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,810
Sit.

200
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,280
In my house,

201
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,610
there are two sets of tableware.

202
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,380
They are of similar color.

203
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,300
When they are mixed up,

204
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,610
you can't make out which is which.

205
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,260
Most people will mess it up.

206
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,020
But

207
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,660
on that day, with the lights off,

208
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,210
you accurately picked out the same set.

209
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,090
You're sensitive to colors.

210
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:58,060
You can deceive the eyes of the world,

211
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,690
but you can't deceive
your subconscious instinct.

212
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,020
What do you think,

213
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,900
great painter?

214
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,500
It's just a set of tableware.

215
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,210
That means nothing.

216
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,660
Ms. Qin,

217
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,260
this is too ridiculous.

218
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,180
The day I announced L,

219
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,970
you just happened to

220
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,300
register on a social platform.

221
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,140
Could it be

222
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,850
a coincidence as well?

223
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,260
It's all your imagination.

224
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:36,970
Really?

225
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,780
What if I say

226
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,660
I have a photo of L?

227
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,380
Ms. Qin,

228
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,330
I'm not L.

229
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,660
You can't leave.

230
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,570
Today,

231
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,900
whoever I say L is,

232
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,180
is L.

233
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,500
You want me to go along with your act?

234
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,450
Won't you?

235
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,380
Why should I?

236
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,380
If you

237
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:16,380
don't sign it,

238
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,380
I'll fire you.

239
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,570
If I remember correctly,

240
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,380
you care a lot about this job.

241
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,260
Or maybe

242
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,810
you have another identity

243
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,210
and don't care about this salary at all?

244
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,300
We are now in the same boat.

245
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,900
Helping me

246
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,570
is helping yourself.

247
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,660
Look at the time.

248
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,850
Why hasn't L come yet?

249
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,000
I think they screwed it up.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,300
Qin Yuebai didn't show up either.

251
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,800
The time is up.

252
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,900
Yes, they aren't here yet.

253
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,080
What's funnier? They are shooting
themselves in the foot.

254
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,780
I think Qin Yuebai

255
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,540
most likely won't show up.

256
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,420
I'm sorry, everyone.

257
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,260
I might have to

258
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,690
disappoint you.

259
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,810
Perhaps

260
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:16,850
Ms. Qin Yuebai said it too early.

261
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,660
We don't have any surprises today,

262
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,180
only frights.

263
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,690
It seems like he won't show up.

264
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,300
Such an important ceremony...

265
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,020
How can he not?

266
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:26,610
He won't come for sure.

267
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,020
I don't think he is coming.

268
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,810
It's a no-brainer.

269
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,500
However,

270
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,570
today, I am going to

271
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,260
give everyone a new surprise.

272
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,380
And that surprise is that

273
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,780
we are going to sign a contract
with Mr. Zeng.

274
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,610
I'm sorry for
making you all wait for so long.

275
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:40,540
Qin Yuebai is here.

276
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,500
Thank you, Ms. Su, for warming up
the floor.

277
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,420
I apologize, everyone.

278
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,380
I'm late.

279
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,380
But I did bring a surprise.

280
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,180
(Artist contract)
This is the contract we signed with Mr. L.

281
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,730
I guess

282
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:39,090
some of you must be itching to ask:

283
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:41,160
how can I prove that

284
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,780
this contract was indeed signed by L?

285
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,810
What if

286
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,500
I forged this contract?

287
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,260
I can only answer this question

288
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,810
with artworks.

289
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,450
I hereby announce that

290
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,380
the original Mr. L's 'Bellflower'

291
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,690
will be exhibited in this gallery

292
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,090
next week.

293
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,450
It will be exhibited for 3 months.

294
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:02,450
Everyone is welcome to see it.

295
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,180
From its establishment, Shulun Gallery

296
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,500
has always upheld
the principle of pursuing excellence.

297
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:08,900
We know

298
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,850
that art is not only expression
and creation.

299
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,660
It's an embodiment of trust.

300
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,970
We promise

301
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,420
to continue

302
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,610
bringing outstanding works of art
to everyone.

303
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,850
We also promise

304
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:21,660
to keep every single one of our vows.

305
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,300
Thank you, everyone.

306
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,210
(I'm not L.)

307
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,450
(You lost the bet.)

308
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,380
(We are now in the same boat.)

309
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,140
(Helping me)

310
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,660
(is helping yourself)

311
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,560
(Thank you very much for witnessing)

312
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,220
(Upcoming Genius Painter L)
(the signing ceremony at Shilun Gallery.)

313
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,410
(We can be so great today)

314
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:28,260
(thanks to your attention)

315
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,240
(and love.)

316
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,810
(The original intention of our founding)

317
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,410
(is to show good works of art)

318
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,170
(to more people.)

319
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,980
(I hope more artists will continue
to join us)

320
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,570
(and witness a miracle.)

321
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:40,980
(Shilun gallery)

322
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,570
(has cultivated a large number
of excellent young artists.)

323
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,460
(I believe that)

324
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,260
(in the future)

325
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,570
(Shilun gallery will witness a miracle)

326
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,720
(with all of us here today.)

327
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,650
(We will definitely live up
to your expectations.)

328
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,020
Good boy.

329
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,810
Call Mr. Su.

330
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:55,610
Mr. Su.

331
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,020
So well-behaved. He looks just like you.

332
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,810
How old are you?

333
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,890
I am 7 years old.

334
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,810
At tomorrow's press conference,

335
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,610
I will sign an exclusive contract

336
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,300
with L.

337
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,810
You're sensitive to colors.

338
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,650
You can deceive the eyes of the world,

339
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,410
but you can't deceive
your subconscious instinct.

340
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,650
What do you think,

341
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,460
great painter?

342
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:40,980
(Today)

343
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,940
(whoever I say L is,)

344
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,170
( is L.)

345
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,090
Why didn't you knock again?

346
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,370
Why do I have to knock on the door?

347
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,810
I've helped you so much.

348
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,570
Shouldn't you thank me?

349
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,370
Thanks.

350
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,810
You're making me feel embarrassed.

351
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,780
If you really want to thank me,

352
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,220
get better soon

353
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,650
and draw a few more paintings
so that I can sell them.

354
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:14,810
At the very least,

355
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:16,410
let me earn enough to compensate for

356
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,810
what I sowed and that girl reaped.

357
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,700
But to be honest,

358
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,410
that girl is really smart.

359
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,650
She actually thought of

360
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:25,410
sending private detectives

361
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,810
to track you

362
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,220
and take a frontal photo of you.

363
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,810
Thankfully, you discovered it early.

364
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,570
Otherwise,
we would be stuck in this mess.

365
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:35,130
Thanks to you.

366
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,300
Your brain

367
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,540
is really different.

368
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,529
(The authentic "Bellflower"
will be exhibited soon in Shilun Gallery)

369
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:47,040
(and has attracted great attention
from the arts community)

370
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,540
By the way,

371
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,260
what's with

372
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,940
this "Bellflower" thing?

373
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,410
This should be Qin Yuebai's backup.

374
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,780
Backup?

375
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,170
After the auction,

376
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,780
she must have been looking
for the authentic "Bellflower".

377
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,130
First, she signed the contract.

378
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,640
Next, she holds the exhibition.

379
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,440
Most people would believe that

380
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,060
the person who signed the contract is L.

381
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,020
She used a truth

382
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,370
to package a lie.

383
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,220
Awesome.

384
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,780
She is awesome.

385
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,850
What if she suspects you?

386
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,850
She will continue to suspect me.

387
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,650
The key to the problem now is that

388
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,780
the true copy of "Bellflower"
is in your hands.

389
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,570
How could Qin Yuebai find it?

390
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,020
That's your showtime.

391
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,260
Me?

392
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,300
Find a suitable time

393
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,570
to sell her the authentic copy.

394
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:38,650
Also,

395
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,060
your trick must be flawless.

396
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:50,147
(Detective)

397
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:52,920
(Hello.)

398
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,260
(The phone number you have called
has been turned off.)

399
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,850
(Please dial again later.)

400
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,060
Feeling guilty?

401
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,170
Lu Li,

402
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,890
is this your

403
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:09,170
illusion trick?

404
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,810
Okay,

405
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,220
now that the game has begun,

406
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,740
I'll stay with you to the end.

407
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,210
(The signing ceremony between L
and Shilun Gallery was held successfully.)

408
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,080
(Painter L's pinnacle of art,
the ultimate bloom of value and charm.)

409
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,540
We did two different effects for him.

410
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,170
This lighting

411
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,570
can highlight his facial features.

412
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,940
It looks warmer here.

413
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,040
While over here...

414
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,170
Let me help you add some oil.

415
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,260
Here I come.

416
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,090
Cover the side of the nose.

417
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,940
Okay.

418
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,500
Ready.

419
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,370
Okay.

420
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,650
Do we still need the scarf here?

421
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,940
I think we can change the color.

422
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,740
Mr. L, please turn your face here.

423
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,370
Great, here.

424
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,330
Okay, give me a look.

425
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,740
Take two steps back, alright.

426
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:12,850
Great.

427
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,890
Ms. Qin, please look at these pictures
we just took.

428
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,810
Mr. L, again, please.

429
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,330
Okay, very nice.

430
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,130
Great.

431
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,410
Face me directly.

432
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,260
Relax a little.

433
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,370
Looks good.

434
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,810
Good.

435
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:36,980
Put your hands on the chair. Yes.

436
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,330
Turn around a little.

437
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,410
Okay.

438
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,890
Cross your legs a bit more.

439
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,980
Mr. L, over here.

440
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,810
Are you playing with me?

441
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,570
Playing with you?

442
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,090
It's just work.

443
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,130
The show must go on.

444
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,090
You're efficient.

445
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,980
You're beyond my expectations.

446
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,810
This makes me

447
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:25,570
want to dig out

448
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:28,060
more of your secrets.

449
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,060
I have a problem.

450
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
Are you so brave

451
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,700
that you aren't afraid of being exposed?

452
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:42,090
Well,

453
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,540
I've already got
the true copy of "Bellflower".

454
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,850
You have good taste.

455
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,700
A businessman is really different

456
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,330
from a painter.

457
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,500
It's your tastes that are too bad.

458
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,020
(Yuebai)
(Go out with me for a bit.)

459
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,410
We're going shopping.

460
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,300
I want to gift you something.

461
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,980
We've bought all the things.

462
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,170
From today onwards,

463
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,890
this is your studio.

464
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,850
Since we are putting on a show,

465
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,500
it must go on till the end.

466
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,570
Do you want to train me to become L?

467
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,090
Why not?

468
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,540
Is there a painter in this world

469
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,810
who is willing to be replaced
by someone else?

470
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,650
Maybe your existence

471
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,060
will make L panic

472
00:25:49,272 --> 00:25:50,235
and appear.

473
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,570
Must you find L?

474
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,370
Yes.

475
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,260
Okay.

476
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:07,610
I'll help you.

477
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,060
Ms. Qin,

478
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,650
I really didn't lie to you.

479
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,460
I can't draw.

480
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,610
There is a callus on your little finger,

481
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,890
it's a trace that appears
after painting for many years.

482
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,020
Draw it for me.

483
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,570
Lu Li.

484
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:29,460
You.

485
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,610
What's wrong with you?

486
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,220
Lu Li.

487
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:38,980
