00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,210
I always thought you were the one trying
to climb the ladder.

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,690
But it turns out it's your mom!

17
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,490
The daughter of a mistress,

18
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,570
why should you be above me?

19
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,490
Su Baoyan.

20
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm warning you.

21
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,210
Watch your mouth.

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,360
Why don't you go back and ask Su Shilun

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,800
who's the daughter of a mistress?

24
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,440
Qin Yuebai.

25
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,800
You...

26
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,080
Baoyan!

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,240
What are you doing?

28
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:05,440
Dad.

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,050
I...

30
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:06,930
She...

31
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:09,480
Why did you hit her?

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,010
I didn't.

33
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,570
Dad.

34
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,160
She's just an illegitimate daughter.

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,960
Why should she get to stand above me?

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,570
I'm the one...

37
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,370
I'm telling you,

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,760
stop causing a scene.

39
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,130
Baoyan,

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,600
there are reporters outside.

41
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,440
Do you want them to laugh at us?

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,600
I...

43
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,410
I didn't.

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,160
I wasn't trying to hit her just now.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,480
I didn't.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:30,880
Listen to me.

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,090
Whatever the problem is,

48
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,530
let's talk about it at home.

49
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,130
All right?

50
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:34,880
We'll talk at home.

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,370
Dad.

52
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,720
Tell her.

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,410
Tell her she's
the daughter of a mistress...

54
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,010
Enough!

55
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,410
Go home!

56
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,090
Go on!

57
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,090
Can we talk in private?

58
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,920
Qin Yuebai.

59
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You broke our agreement.

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,600
Mr. Su,

61
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,570
what do you mean by that?

62
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,290
Don't forget

63
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,690
the condition of our partnership

64
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,690
was that you'd
never expose our connection.

65
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,560
Surely you don't think

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,370
that whole scene
just now in front of the press

67
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,530
was staged by me?

68
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,880
Are you saying you couldn't?

69
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,290
What would I gain

70
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,720
by exposing our relationship?

71
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,880
Now that my identity is out,

72
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,480
the public's only talking
about one thing,

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,880
your relationship with my mother.

74
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,370
From the moment I used her painting

75
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,810
to land this position,

76
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:03,720
I swore

77
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,880
I would never
let her reputation suffer again.

78
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:11,880
You have my word.

79
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,600
As for the rumors about your mother,

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,320
I'll have people suppress them.

81
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,130
But what happened today,

82
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,170
I will get to the bottom of it.

83
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,690
Thank you, Mr...

84
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,880
Thank you, Father.

85
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,840
But you know,

86
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,280
calming the public down

87
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,200
will take some time.

88
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,200
So during this period...

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,010
Rest assured,

90
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
whoever is behind all this,

91
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,960
I'll take full responsibility
for any damage

92
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,130
done to the gallery.

93
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,570
I'll make sure you see

94
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,640
the value I bring

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,080
as a professional manager.

96
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,760
Are you trying
to negotiate terms with me?

97
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,810
I'm not negotiating with my father.

98
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,280
I'm making a deal with the head

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,690
of the Su Group.

100
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,320
You really have surprised me.

101
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,930
Very well.

102
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,690
You have my word.

103
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,370
You may continue as manager.

104
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,730
As for Qin Yuebai's value,

105
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,130
I'll be watching closely.

106
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,880
(Exposing your identity)

107
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,760
(was meant to stir up chaos
in the Su family.)

108
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,320
(Qin Yuebai,)

109
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,520
(you're getting more
and more interesting.)

110
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,490
What happened earlier,

111
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,490
aren't you
going to look into who did it?

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,960
My connection to Su Shilun

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,880
was bound to be exposed eventually.

114
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,400
This time it was unexpected,

115
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,640
but maybe

116
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,280
it's an opportunity.

117
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,320
As for whoever leaked it...

118
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,200
You seem very concerned.

119
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,320
It wasn't you, was it?

120
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,730
Of course not.

121
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,880
So timid.

122
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,130
Whoever's behind this,

123
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,280
even though I should thank them

124
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,490
for solving a problem for me,

125
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,880
they still tried to use it against me.

126
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,690
Once I find out who it is,

127
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,250
I'll make sure

128
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:13,320
they don't die in peace.

129
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,490
Yuebai.

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,170
Yuebai!

131
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
Where are you going in this rain?

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,640
There are still paintings
on display outside.

133
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,680
Everyone else is off work.

134
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,640
I need to bring them in.

135
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,297
("Invisible City")

136
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,810
Here, warm yourself up.

137
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,050
Careful, it's hot.

138
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,080
These works on outdoor display

139
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,960
are by unknown artists.

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,760
Is it worth it

141
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,050
to do this?

142
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,010
Some artworks
may have greater value than others,

143
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,170
but art itself knows no status.

144
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,490
To those unknown artists,

145
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:17,570
these paintings were created

146
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,440
with everything they had.

147
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,760
They're priceless.

148
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,370
Since they trusted the gallery

149
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,840
and placed their work here,

150
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,690
I have a responsibility to them.

151
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,970
You are putting on a show.

152
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:55,130
A gentleman judges
by actions, not intent.

153
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:57,160
As long as the outcome is good,

154
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
does the motive matter?

155
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,330
Spoken like a true businessman.

156
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:04,730
Shameless enough.

157
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:07,920
Thanks for the compliment.

158
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,610
Bai.

159
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,450
Senior Brother.

160
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,610
Bai.

161
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,730
Let's stay together forever.

162
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,330
We will.

163
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,800
Long time no see.

164
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,450
It's been so many years,

165
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,370
but you haven't changed at all.

166
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,130
Sorry.

167
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,970
Do I know you that well?

168
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,330
Bai,

169
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,850
about what happened back then,

170
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,400
I can explain it to you.

171
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,400
I did it all for work.

172
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,640
You don't need to explain.

173
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:20,970
Song Yun,

174
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,370
I know who you are.

175
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,520
You abandoned me so decisively back then

176
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,760
wasn't it all for your own gain?

177
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,680
You've come back now,

178
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm sure it's for the same reason.

179
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,490
I'll take that.

180
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,490
Thanks.

181
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,800
You should get back to work.

182
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,210
Bai,

183
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,450
you've really grown up.

184
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,850
Who knows, maybe someday

185
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:47,520
we'll be working together again.

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,920
What's that supposed to mean?

187
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,280
There's no need.

188
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Here's my card.

189
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,920
If you ever need anything,

190
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,730
give me a call.

191
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,130
Ms. Qin.

192
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,130
Ms. Qin.

193
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,610
The meeting is about to start.

194
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,040
We can't begin without you.

195
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,130
Sorry about that.

196
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,330
So sorry.

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,160
How could you forget the meeting?

198
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,560
What meeting?

199
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,010
No one told me there was a meeting.

200
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,760
Keep acting.

201
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,160
Weren't you just acting so well?

202
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,520
I wasn't acting.

203
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,130
I was...

204
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,450
I was just trying to help you out
of an awkward situation.

205
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,110
(China Region General Manager. Song Yun)

206
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,160
An ex-boyfriend, huh?

207
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,610
If you have time to gossip,

208
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,730
you should use it to think

209
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:55,970
about how to help me instead.

210
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,370
True.

211
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,520
The Su family
is circling like sharks now.

212
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,640
You really do need to find leverage

213
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,610
to prove yourself fast.

214
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,680
Naturally, you won't have time

215
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,640
to dwell on old feelings.

216
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,010
Don't forget,

217
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,040
you

218
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,040
are my

219
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,210
leverage.

220
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,040
Right,

221
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
Andrew's collection.

222
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,520
Can you help me
arrange a meeting with Andrew?

223
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,360
Ms. Qin,

224
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
Andrew usually doesn't see outsiders.

225
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't think the chances are good.

226
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,250
That's all right.

227
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,370
Please just do your best to try.

228
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,520
Money

229
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,160
is not an issue.

230
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,370
Understood. I'll try my best.

231
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,520
Thanks. I appreciate it.

232
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,280
Bai.

233
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
Pretty amazing, right?

234
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,610
You're incredible.

235
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,850
What do you want to eat?

236
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,040
Anything I want?

237
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,850
Of course.

238
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

239
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,730
Five years is a long time.

240
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,560
I don't want to hold you back.

241
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,010
Let's break up.

242
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,280
I'll carry you.

243
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,640
Keep acting.

244
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,730
Weren't you just acting so well?

245
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,210
I wasn't acting.

246
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,040
I was...

247
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,450
I was just trying to help you out
of an awkward situation.

248
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,370
Does it hurt?

249
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,130
As your assistant,

250
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,920
I should be on call

251
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,920
all the time.

252
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:14,250
Baoyan,

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,730
have some tea.

254
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:24,970
Still upset?

255
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,920
All right.

256
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:29,450
First, let me apologise.

257
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:30,760
I shouldn't have

258
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,560
embarrassed you at the gallery.

259
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,130
But let me make this clear,

260
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,040
I was not taking her side.

261
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,920
I just think,

262
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,130
as the eldest daughter of the Su family,

263
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,730
getting physical in front of the press,

264
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:43,850
don't you think

265
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,800
that was inappropriate?

266
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,330
An outsider?

267
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:49,970
Dad.

268
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,800
So you know she's an outsider too?

269
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:53,640
Of course.

270
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,010
She is an outsider.

271
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:56,160
To both of us,

272
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,400
she's nothing but an outsider.

273
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,160
I'll say this again,

274
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,560
Qin Yuebai

275
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,160
will never take away

276
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,840
anything that belongs to you.

277
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,490
Dad.

278
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,970
I knew you would never
treat me like that.

279
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,410
But Baoyan...

280
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,730
Have you ever considered

281
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,170
that maybe there are things

282
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,410
you haven't done well?

283
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,560
You're already a grown woman,

284
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,800
yet still not mature enough.

285
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,800
In the future,

286
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,730
when I hand everything

287
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,120
over to you,

288
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,650
how can I feel at ease?

289
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,320
That's why

290
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,730
from now on,

291
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,120
you must study hard,

292
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
keep improving,

293
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,930
so you can take on everything.

294
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,410
Trust me, Dad.

295
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,800
You raised me after all.

296
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,560
How could I lose to an outsider?

297
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,410
Of course not.

298
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:48,840
Of course not.

299
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,800
Here, have some tea.

300
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,970
Okay.

301
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,410
So, you know what to do now?

302
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,320
I do.

303
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:56,970
I'll get going then, Dad.

304
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:57,930
Good luck.

305
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,210
Go on.

306
00:17:59,210 --> 00:17:59,650
Okay.

307
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,520
Mr. Su.

308
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,360
Look into it.

309
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,120
Find out who

310
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,600
leaked the news today.

311
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:11,490
Yes, sir.

312
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,560
Keep an eye on Qin Yuebai.

313
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:15,560
Go.

314
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,730
Wait.

315
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,890
That assistant by Qin Yuebai's side,

316
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,120
is he new?

317
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:31,040
Find out who he is.

318
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,320
I'll investigate immediately.

319
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,800
(He looks oddly familiar.)

320
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,600
You're awake.

321
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,410
What perfume are you wearing?

322
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,250
Smells nice.

323
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,560
Pinewood.

324
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,520
It calms the mind.

325
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:18,760
Speaking of which,

326
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,450
dragging me out
so early just to drive for you.

327
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,360
What exactly are you after?

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,560
(Collector Andrew scores again,
mysterious work "Daisy" revealed)

329
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,450
"Daisy"

330
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,760
was painted by an unknown artist.

331
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,650
But its emotional depth

332
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,650
caused a stir as soon as it surfaced.

333
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,120
Unfortunately,

334
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,250
it disappeared
from the public eye in recent years.

335
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,010
No one expected it to resurface.

336
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,560
If I could secure
the rights to exhibit it...

337
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,840
For the gallery,

338
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,360
it would be phenomenal publicity.

339
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,840
I've heard of Andrew,

340
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,730
he has a bad temper.

341
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,040
And you need
an invitation to even meet him.

342
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,840
I tried.

343
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,840
Didn't get one.

344
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,560
So what's your plan?

345
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:07,840
I managed to find Andrew's home address.

346
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,080
Granted,

347
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,730
showing up uninvited is a bit rude,

348
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,760
but still,

349
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,650
let's meet him first and talk later.

350
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:34,650
Hello.

351
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,560
Mr. Andrew.

352
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm Qin Yuebai,
director of Shilun Gallery.

353
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,360
This is my assistant, Lu Li.

354
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:42,450
We know this visit is abrupt,

355
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,560
but we'd like to speak
with you about your collection.

356
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,320
You admit it's abrupt,
yet you still came?

357
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,930
Do you even have an invitation?

358
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,250
Please hear us out.

359
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,560
The better the work,

360
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,360
the more it deserves

361
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,360
a professional exhibition
to present it properly.

362
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:58,440
That one,

363
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,760
that's the one you're looking for.

364
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,800
Mr. Andrew.

365
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,560
Using Master Huang's sculpture as decor?

366
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,250
Collectors really do have
a different eye for taste.

367
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,920
My father used to collect art, too.

368
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,930
Who would've thought

369
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:26,410
you acquired Master Huang's
work so early on.

370
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,410
Since we're fated to meet,

371
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,930
go ahead and tell me why you're here.

372
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,040
Please.

373
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,170
Ms. Andrew.

374
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,650
We've brought several case studies

375
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,800
of successful exhibitions
from our gallery.

376
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,930
We've also put together a detailed plan

377
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,450
specifically for "Daisy".

378
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,560
If you don't mind,

379
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,010
please have a look.

380
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,730
You're surprisingly well-informed.

381
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,010
I only just acquired "Daisy".

382
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,010
I figured galleries
might approach me eventually,

383
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,360
but not this fast.

384
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,170
Great pieces wait for no one.

385
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,410
We came here today

386
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,560
in hopes that

387
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,600
you would authorize

388
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,250
Shilun Gallery to exhibit "Daisy".

389
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,520
We can talk about the other pieces.

390
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,210
But "Daisy",

391
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,210
I won't exhibit it.

392
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,040
And I won't sell it.

393
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,360
That's alright.

394
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,650
We can also discuss

395
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,840
your other collections.

396
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,930
We could organize

397
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,170
a solo exhibition for you.

398
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,840
For Ms. Andrew's exhibition

399
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,970
and any business cooperation,

400
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,210
please contact her agent directly.

401
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:33,970
Understood.

402
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:34,840
In that case,

403
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,120
we won't disturb Ms. Andrew any further.

404
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,600
If you have time,

405
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,520
please have a look.

406
00:22:43,485 --> 00:22:46,060
(Agent. Aron)

407
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:51,800
Hello?

408
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,650
Mr. Aron?

409
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,600
I'm the director of Shilun Gallery.

410
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,280
Bai.

411
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,135
(Song Yun)

412
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:11,822
(Agent. Aron. Song Yun)

413
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,560
(So it's him...)

414
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,040
This is my card.

415
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,640
Who knows

416
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,210
we might work together again someday.

417
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:25,730
(Song Yun.)

418
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,200
(So you planned all along)

419
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,450
(that I'd come to you again.)

420
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:33,560
Where are we going?

421
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,320
Take me home.

422
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:58,930
Do you really have to go?

423
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,250
Bai,

424
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,560
this opportunity to go to Germany

425
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,120
means the world to me.

426
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,600
I have to go.

427
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,840
Five years...

428
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,650
You want me to wait five years for you?

429
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,560
That's what I wanted to tell you.

430
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,010
Five years is too long.

431
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,730
I don't want to hold you back.

432
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,250
Let's break up.

433
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:57,335
(Song Yun)

434
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,760
Hello.

435
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,410
Hello.

436
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,490
- You're
- Song...

437
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,450
Yuebai?

438
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:07,730
Mr. Aron,

439
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,170
do you have time

440
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,320
to meet in person?

441
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,080
Mr. Su.

442
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,880
Lately, Qin Yuebai has been getting

443
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,880
pretty close with Andrew.

444
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,120
Andrew?

445
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,250
Yes.

446
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,040
To get the exhibition rights

447
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,410
for "Daisy", Qin Yuebai

448
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,210
sought out the collector, Andrew.

449
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,040
She really is quite determined.

450
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,690
Bring Baoyan here for me.

451
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:35,560
Yes, sir.

452
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:51,560
Dad.

453
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,080
I thought maybe you had

454
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,680
a new daughter and forgot about me.

455
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,840
Didn't I always tell you?

456
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,970
You are my one and only precious girl.

457
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,970
No one can compare to you.

458
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,010
Come here.

459
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,170
Just in time.

460
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,650
I was about to talk to you

461
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,040
about something with the gallery.

462
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:10,320
Do you know what Qin Yuebai

463
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,360
has been up to lately?

464
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,800
She's gone to

465
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,320
a collector named Andrew,

466
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,490
trying to negotiate
an exhibition for "Daisy".

467
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,520
Baoyan,

468
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,170
you should go find her too.

469
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,840
If you manage to find her first

470
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,170
and seal the deal,

471
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:23,970
I promise you

472
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,320
the gallery will be handed over
to you with ease.

473
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,450
The gallery?

474
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,520
Are you serious?

475
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,010
I mean it.

476
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,970
I'm telling you, Baoyan,

477
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:39,120
if you don't go find her now,

478
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,970
what if...

479
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:40,760
I'm going now!

480
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,840
I'll get ready right away.

481
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,360
This girl...

482
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,010
Mr. Su,

483
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
do you want us to assist

484
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,170
Ms. Baoyan in any way?

485
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,170
No need.

486
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,120
Baoyan

487
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,360
is too naive.

488
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,760
So I'll look for more chances

489
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,840
to toughen her up.

490
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,250
As for Qin Yuebai,

491
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,250
I'm quite curious to see

492
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,520
how capable she really is.

493
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,410
Either way, whoever wins,

494
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,930
the "Daisy" exhibition

495
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,360
can only be held at

496
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,730
Shilun Gallery.

497
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:37,835
(Building 35, Unit 1)

498
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,450
