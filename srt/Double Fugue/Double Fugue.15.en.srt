I'll head back to the office first.

30
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,200
Talk later.

31
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,200
You can go back.

32
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,290
Okay, Mr. Sun.

33
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,090

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,570
All thanks to you.

37
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,810
I didn't earn much,

38
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:28,730
but

39
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,810
I must treat this meal.

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,370
How about

41
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,760
tomorrow

42
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,200
at Qingyue Restaurant?

43
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,690
Alright. See you tomorrow, Mr. Jia.

44
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,050
See you then.

45
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,610
(This morning,)

46
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,280
(local entrepreneur Lu Xiuyuan)

47
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,120
(and his wife,)

48
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,730
(who were on the way to Shilun Gallery)

49
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,920
(for the opening ceremony,)

50
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,840
(got into a car crash)

51
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,810
(and passed away.)

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,010
(Let's meet tonight.)

53
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,280
Mr. Sun.

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,880
Pleasure to meet you.

55
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,010
Who are you?

56
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,610
I texted you.

57
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,400
Lu Xiuyuan?

58
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,050
You... You've got the wrong guy.

59
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,490
So scared?

60
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,880
You clearly know something.

61
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,810
Who are you?

62
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,250
What do you want?

63
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,050
I'm Lu Xiuyuan's son,

64
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,200
Lu Li.

65
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,690
I want to know

66
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,810
the full truth behind my father's crash.

67
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,640
I'm calling the police.

68
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,280
I suggest you

69
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
put your phone down.

70
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,570
Or all your deals

71
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,610
with Su Shilun

72
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
will be handed to the regulators.

73
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,610
I'll talk.

74
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:24,640
Lu Xiuyuan and Su Shilun

75
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,880
(17 years ago)
met at the gallery's

76
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,810
ribbon-cutting ceremony.

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,610
(Back then,)

78
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,810
(Shilun Gallery had a different name.)

79
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,440
(It was named after its previous owner,)

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,080
(Qin Wanyou.)

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,440
Here's to a successful partnership.

82
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,370
(It was called Wan Gallery.)

83
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
(At that time,)

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,080
(I was just a minor employee
at a finance company.)

85
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,010
(I was there to join the party)

86
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,010
(and land some wealthy clients.)

87
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,960
- Good.
- Good.

88
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,050
Yes, make it big.

89
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,280
- Great.
- Congratulations.

90
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,810
We've expanded again.

91
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
How handsome.

92
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,960
Mr. Su.

93
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,760
Hi, I'm Sun Yiming.

94
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,570
Here's my card.

95
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,200
It's quite lively today.

96
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,760
Let's take a look over there.

97
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,810
Mr. Su.

98
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,440
Wish you booming business.

99
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,370
What a great day.

100
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,200
Look at this.

101
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,760
The renovation here

102
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,690
will all be upgraded later.

103
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,935
(Wan Gallery Ribbon-Cutting Day)

104
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:40,880
(Su Shilun was at his peak)

105
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,810
(and didn't take me seriously at all.)

106
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,760
(I thought)

107
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,960
(we'd never cross paths again.)

108
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,640
(Unexpectedly, he reached out)

109
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,760
(to me after a while.)

110
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:56,285
(Qin Group's Funding Collapsed.
Can the Art Giant Survive This?)

111
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,570
Hello?

112
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,840
- Mr. Su?
- Mr. Sun, right?

113
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Yes.

114
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:12,960
Okay.

115
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:15,250
Alright, got it.

116
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,200
I'll arrive in a bit.

117
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,640
Okay.

118
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,210
(I never expected)

119
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,970
(Su Shilun contacted me)

120
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,040
(so that)

121
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,250
(an unknown financial agent)

122
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,160
(like me)

123
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,280
(could handle his assets.)

124
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,610
(More shockingly,)

125
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,850
(the money didn't belong to him at all.)

126
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,160
(He secretly transferred it
from the Qin family)

127
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,850
(through his engagement to Qin Wanyou.)

128
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,370
This part will be transferred
out of the finance firm

129
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,640
before going into the account
I mentioned.

130
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,370
Take a look.

131
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,800
What does this mean?

132
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,960
Okay, as per your request,

133
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,490
we've done a breakdown for this part.

134
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,040
(Without knowing it,)

135
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,610
(I helped launder a huge sum
for Su Shilun)

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,560
(and made good money.)

137
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,680
(My status soared.)

138
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,970
(My partnership with Su Shilun)

139
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,250
(shifted from behind the scenes.)

140
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,680
(He introduced me to many people,)

141
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,640
(including)

142
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,400
(his best friend, Lu Xiuyuan.)

143
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,760
It's my job.

144
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,010
It's my job.

145
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,000
With your help,

146
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,210
I have nothing to worry about.

147
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,210
It's my job.

148
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,010
Let me see.

149
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,560
- I have no questions.
- Just sign here.

150
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,880
It's official once signed.

151
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,130
Great.

152
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,850
Awesome.

153
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,490
Su, have you lost your mind?

154
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,640
You'll ruin everyone.

155
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:54,490
Buddy,

156
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,640
I told you.

157
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,250
It's all about trust.

158
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,560
If you can't trust me with this,

159
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,610
how can we work together?

160
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:01,490
How can I trust you?

161
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:02,850
(Just when I thought)

162
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,040
(our business would keep booming,)

163
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,850
(I overheard)

164
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:09,040
(him and Lu Xiuyuan arguing.)

165
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,610
Think long-term.

166
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,490
Our business will expand, alright?

167
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,610
Look at the accounts.

168
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,850
You're not getting anywhere.

169
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:17,880
Is that how you see me?

170
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,490
Yes, that's how I see you.

171
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,760
What do buddies rely on?

172
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,640
Trust.

173
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,680
If I don't trust you,

174
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,970
I won't be with you.

175
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:24,760
And?

176
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,610
If you trust me,

177
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,640
turn yourself in now.

178
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,010
I was kept in the dark like a fool.

179
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,610
I just wanted an honest life

180
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,370
and peace of mind.

181
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,560
You're despicable!

182
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,680
Is that what you think of me?

183
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,160
- Yes.
- Get out!

184
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,210
Don't ever come back!

185
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,680
Mr. Sun.

186
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,800
I missed you so much.

187
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,610
Sit.

188
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,880
- Okay.
- Here.

189
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,160
Sorry you had to see that.

190
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:58,330
People these days

191
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,250
are so greedy.

192
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,210
Unlike us two.

193
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,120
When united,

194
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,490
there's nothing we can't achieve.

195
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,880
All thanks to you.

196
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,560
I've calculated everything.

197
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,090
Why don't you take a look?

198
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,490
No need. I trust you.

199
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,610
That was the last time

200
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:19,800
I saw Lu Xiuyuan.

201
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,680
The next news I got about him

202
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,880
was

203
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,610
his death in the car crash.

204
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,970
I swear,

205
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,450
his death

206
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:31,450
had nothing to do with me.

207
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:32,520
Nothing?

208
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,490
Then why are you scared?

209
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,090
Lu Xiuyuan was the only one

210
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,610
who knew
about my dealings with Su Shilun.

211
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,560
It's alright if he's dead.

212
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:43,850
If he were alive,

213
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,800
of course I'd be scared.

214
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,970
So that's an excuse

215
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,090
to have him killed,

216
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:48,850
right?

217
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,730
No.

218
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,250
I wouldn't dare.

219
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,010
I'm not as bold as Su Shilun.

220
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,640
So you're saying

221
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,560
my parents' car accident

222
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,040
was orchestrated by Su Shilun.

223
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,210
Right?

224
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:11,640
(I saw Su Shilun get into
Lu Xiuyuan's car.)

225
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,210
(After the fight that night,)

226
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,090
(I saw Su Shilun)

227
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,400
(get into Lu Xiuyuan's car.)

228
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,210
(A few days later,)

229
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,800
(news of Lu Xiuyuan's accident came.)

230
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,680
(I thought)

231
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
(it must be connected to Su Shilun.)

232
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,210
(But I only suspected it,)

233
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,970
(I have no proof.)

234
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:10,680
You came here

235
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,680
to sound me out.

236
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,640
The one you're after

237
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,610
is Su Shilun.

238
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,850
What does it have to do with you?

239
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,370
Whether I got something to do with it,

240
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,210
you'll only learn

241
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,250
the truth from me.

242
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,610
If you want to take down Su Shilun,

243
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,610
I can work with you.

244
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,040
Work with me?

245
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,210
It's simple.

246
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,210
Once he's gone,

247
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,610
no one

248
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:47,850
can threaten me anymore.

249
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,920
But

250
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,370
I have one condition.

251
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,970
When it's done,

252
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,210
I want

253
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,760
Shilun Gallery.

254
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,400
Who are you to negotiate with me?

255
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,850
Don't try to threaten me.

256
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,970
Or you'd have taken it to the police.

257
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,450
Judging by the looks of it,

258
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,040
you don't have anything concrete.

259
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,040
Or you wouldn't come to me.

260
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,280
You'd go straight to Su Shilun.

261
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,760
Why should I trust you?

262
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,560
I want that gallery

263
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,280
for the land it's on.

264
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,800
I want to build a resort.

265
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,280
I already

266
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,010
talked to Ms. Qin about it.

267
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,450
She turned me down.

268
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,970
If I help you with Su Shilun,

269
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,970
besides the gallery,

270
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,210
the rest of Shilun Group is yours.

271
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:46,970
What do you think?

272
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,160
(After the fight that night,)

273
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:55,040
(I saw Su Shilun
get into Lu Xiuyuan's car.)

274
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:57,490
(A few days later,)

275
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,250
(news of Lu Xiuyuan's accident came.)

276
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,280
(I thought
it must be connected to Su Shilun.)

277
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
(Lu Xiuyuan was the only one)

278
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
(who knew
about my dealings with Su Shilun.)

279
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,040
(This morning,)

280
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,250
(local entrepreneur
Lu Xiuyuan and his wife,)

281
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,760
(who were on the way to Shilun Gallery
for the opening ceremony,)

282
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,610
(got into a car crash)

283
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:16,560
(and passed away.)

284
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,720
(So that's an excuse)

285
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,560
(to have him killed,)

286
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,160
(right?)

287
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,040
(No. I wouldn't dare.)

288
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,610
(I'm not as bold as Su Shilun.)

289
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,250
Let me tell you.

290
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,160
If you want to take from the Su family,

291
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,970
I need to see
what you're truly capable of.

292
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,640
I can work with you

293
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,640
to bring down Su Shilun.

294
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,210
(Only I can)

295
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:55,010
(reveal some truths to you.)

296
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,850
Sun Yiming.

297
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,800
I agree.

298
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,370
He agreed so quickly.

299
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,400
Is he playing me?

300
00:16:35,847 --> 00:16:44,747
(Art World Grenade! Genius Artist L
Goes Public With Gallery Manager)

301
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:56,880
Mr. Sun.

302
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,400
You seem in a bad mood today.

303
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,090
Who are you?

304
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,080
Someone who can help you.

305
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,520
What I have here

306
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,760
is Shilun Group's

307
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,600
weaknesses.

308
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,890
Once he's deep in debt,

309
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,600
you

310
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,800
can easily crush Su Shilun.

311
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,080
By then,

312
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,360
you can ask for the gallery as payment.

313
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,010
Why should I trust you?

314
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,400
It doesn't matter

315
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,250
whether you trust me.

316
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,970
What matters

317
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,360
is whether you've got the guts.

318
00:17:46,697 --> 00:17:51,497
(Shilun Group Financial Debt Report)

319
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,752
(Sun Yiming)

320
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,360
Ms. Qin.

321
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,450
I called to ask you again

322
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,280
whether you still refuse
to sell the gallery.

323
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,280
Mr. Sun.

324
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,560
No matter how many times you ask,

325
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,970
my answer is no.

326
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,010
What a pity then.

327
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,760
But nothing is always absolute.

328
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,560
What do you think?

329
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,010
Hello?

330
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,120
Lu Li.

331
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,280
Are you home?

332
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,080
I'm not home.

333
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,690
I'm outside.

334
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,560
I'll head back soon.

335
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm feeling down.

336
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,970
Can I wait at your place?

337
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,490
Sure, wait for me.

338
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,650
You're back.

339
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,600
How much did you drink?

340
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,600
Your face is all red.

341
00:19:58,890 --> 00:19:59,690
Not much.

342
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:08,690
What's wrong?

343
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,600
You're upset.

344
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,210
I met someone a few days ago.

345
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:16,840
It put me in a bad mood.

346
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,730
Who?

347
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,320
Who upset you?

348
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,450
Su Shilun's biggest rival.

349
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:35,600
His name is Sun Yiming.

350
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,450
You probably don't know him.

351
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,080
What's up?

352
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,800
He wanted me to sell the gallery to him.

353
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,410
He said he could help me
get everything I want.

354
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:52,690
And?

355
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:54,320
There's no way I'd agree.

356
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,840
Lu Li.

357
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,520
Do you know

358
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,490
what that gallery means to me?

359
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,730
It's my mom's blood, sweat and tears.

360
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,970
I saw how much

361
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,280
she sacrificed for it,

362
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,730
but Su Shilun made it his

363
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,080
and shamelessly

364
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,690
put his own name on it.

365
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,450
It's the only place

366
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,040
where I can quietly miss her.

367
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,930
That's why

368
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:50,250
I'll protect it with all I have.

369
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,450
No one can take it from me.

370
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,250
One day,

371
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,080
I'll even reclaim the name.

372
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,600
You'll help me, right?

373
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:36,840
I'm always here.

374
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,730
It's all done.

375
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,120
Good.

376
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,080
Shilun Group

377
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,250
looks shiny on the outside,

378
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,450
but it's actually full of holes

379
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,250
and falling apart.

380
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,250
Tell me.

381
00:22:59,170 --> 00:22:59,970
How did Lu Li

382
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,800
end up colluding with Sun Yiming?

383
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,120
Does Qin Yuebai

384
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,520
have such poor taste?

385
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:08,890
I'm not sure.

386
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,250
But Sun Yiming doesn't seem

387
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,520
to trust Lu Li.

388
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Then

389
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,650
we can make good use

390
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:27,800
of Lu Li.

391
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,210
Whatever you say.

392
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,040
Sun Yiming.

393
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,410
What are you trying to do?

394
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,280
I told you.

395
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,040
I want that gallery.

396
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,800
What did we agree on?

397
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,120
Who are we teaming up against?

398
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Su Shilun, right?

399
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:48,840
I'm a businessman.

400
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,250
Business is business.

401
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,600
When cash is on the table,

402
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,080
who wouldn't take it?

403
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,930
What's that got to do with Yuebai?

404
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,080
The gallery

405
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,840
is under Qin Yuebai's name.

406
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,250
If I don't pressure her,

407
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,210
who should I pressure?

408
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,800
Lu Li.

409
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,040
I'll give you a word of advice.

410
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:15,800
Don't let your fury rule you.

411
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,600
Don't betray your parents

412
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:22,040
for the daughter of your enemy.

413
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,210
Now that I've said it,

414
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,600
think it over.

415
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,930
You're awake.

416
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,360
Your apron

417
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,840
is pretty cute.

418
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
What a feast.

419
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,010
I didn't know you can cook.

420
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,690
I just think

421
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,450
we haven't sat down for a meal

422
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,450
in a long time.

423
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,730
That's true.

424
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,800
Yummy.

425
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,450
I didn't expect you to cook so well.

426
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,600
From now on,

427
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,800
you have to cook more often.

428
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,040
Yuebai.

429
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,410
What is it?

430
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,760
Yuebai, actually...

431
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,210
I...

432
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,600
Hold on.

433
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:16,170
Hello?

434
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:16,720
Hello, Ms. Qin

435
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,690
Bad news,
something happened at the gallery.

436
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,450
What happened?

437
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,010
Sun Yiming came to seize the gallery.

438
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,840
Something happened.

439
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,690
Baoyan

440
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,730
really caused me big trouble.

441
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,600
It allowed Sun Yiming to take advantage!

442
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:48,840
Maybe we can't keep the gallery anymore.

443
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:52,650
The gallery is where you started.

444
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:20,080
What I mean is

445
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:26,010
if this matter

446
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,410
gets out to gossipers,

447
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,010
they'll make a big fuss out of it.

448
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,970
I'm worried

449
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,730
about our stock price

450
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,890
and Yuebai.

451
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,690
Enough.

452
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,280
I'll talk to Sun Yiming again.

453
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,450
See if there's a way to fix this.

454
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,170
I can't believe

455
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,080
I haven't finished sorting out this mess.

456
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,930
I really spoiled

457
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:03,040
that girl.

458
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:35,322
(Shilun Gallery Acquisition Agreement)

459
00:28:47,835 --> 00:28:50,347
(Party A: Sun Yiming,
Party B: Shilun Group)

460
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,930
Sun Yiming must've pulled some tricks

461
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,520
to strike a deal with Su Shilun.

462
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,040
He must've held a grudge

463
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,450
after I rejected him.

464
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,600
Did you see him
at the gallery yesterday?

465
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:17,840
No.

466
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,650
Do you know him?

467
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:21,450
I've

468
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:22,840
only seen him in magazines.

469
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,800
Yuebai.

470
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,450
Calm things down first.

471
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,650
I'll figure out what happened.

472
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
