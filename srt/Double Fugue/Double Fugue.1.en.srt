Excuse me, everyone.

Su Shilun's

Who are you?

26
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,360
Ms. Qin Wanyou

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,080
has helped me a lot.

28
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,000
The dead are gone.

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,680
Take good care of yourself.

30
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,199
(Hello, Miss Qin.)

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,639
(When your mother was alive,)

32
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:19,199
(she kept a painting in the gallery.)

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,479
This is her last work at Shilun Gallery.

34
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,360
It means something special to her.

35
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,360
(Please)

36
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,319
(keep it safe.)

37
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,719
Mr. Su.

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
We're at the parking lot.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,879
No matter what it takes,

40
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:35,560
get hold of the painting in her hand.

41
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:46,160
4768.

42
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,879
This is the one.

43
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,319
(It's her.)

44
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:43,759
You...

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,519
Help me.

46
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,240
Found her?

47
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,240
- No.
- No.

48
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:10,519
Here.

49
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,399
You must be thirsty.

50
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,439
Drive quickly.

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,839
So, you're the viper and I'm the farmer?

52
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:25,680
Go through them

53
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,120
and go out through the back exit.

54
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,879
Quick.

55
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,680
Chase them.

56
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,000
Aren't you leaving?

57
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,199
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,800
I had no choice.

59
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,399
Thank you.

60
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,040
You're welcome.

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,040
I'll be going now.

62
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
See you again.

63
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,759
You dropped your knife.

64
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,120
(Qin Yuebai,)

65
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,279
(after going through
what I went through,)

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,319
(how will you retaliate
against Su Shilun?)

67
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:21,137
(Tangbei)

68
00:07:21,562 --> 00:07:23,600

00:07:27,162 --> 00:07:27,874
(Baoyan)

70
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,199
Hello.

71
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,199
Baby,

72
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,360
I'm going to my friend's birthday party
tonight.

73
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,160
Be good

74
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,079
and go to bed early.

75
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,360
Okay.

76
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,560
Don't stay outside until late.

77
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,720
Stay safe.

78
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:52,879
Okay.

79
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,319
Don't stay up too late tonight.

80
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,639
Don't worry.

81
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,040
You're the best.

82
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,920
You love me the most.

83
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,399
Of course, I love you the most.

84
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:06,360
I've got to go.

85
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,199
Talk to you later.

86
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,440
(Waking up from a nap,)

87
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,559
(I leaned quietly on the sofa.)

88
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,160
(My hand gently placed )

89
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,159
(October 29 cloudy)
(on my slightly raised belly.)

90
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:50,679
(Suddenly,)

91
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,679
(my palm)

92
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,039
(felt a slight tremor.)

93
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:56,320
(October 30 Cloud)
(It feels like)

94
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,399
(a gentle fairy)

95
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,080
(dancing lightly in my belly.)

96
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:01,799
(Dear baby,)

97
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,720
(your gentle touch)

98
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,240
(let me truly felt your existence.)

99
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,120
(It has also filled me)

100
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,720
(with endless longing)

101
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,080
(for the day I will see you.)

102
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,600
(I feel very sorry)

103
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,799
(for your mother's death, too.)

104
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:29,675
(I love Shilun.)

105
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,799
White lily of the valley.

106
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:35,960
Your mother's favorite flower.

107
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,879
I can give you the gallery.

108
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,799
I can give up everything.

109
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,720
I just want to save my child.

110
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,120
Remember this,

111
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:49,919
from now on,

112
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,679
Yuebai is my child, not yours.

113
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,720
(Mother,)

114
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,759
(this is the person
you gave your all to.)

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,240
(Don't worry,)

116
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,360
(I will make him miserable.)

117
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
(Whatever he owes you,)

118
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,760
(Shilun Gallery Life is short)
(I will take it all back.)

119
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,760
(Art lives forever)
(I will take it all back.)

120
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,080
(Su Shilun's ex-wife Qin Wanyou
passed away.)

121
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,640
(The cause of her death)

122
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,520
(is exactly the same as your parents'
car accident twenty years ago.)

123
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,159
(Lu Xiuyuan, local entrepreneur)

124
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,159
(was on the way to Shilun Gallery
with his wife)

125
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,400
(for the completion ceremony)

126
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,860
(when they were met with a car accident)

127
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,900
(and unfortunately passed away.)

128
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,519
Hi.

129
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:39,000
Hello.

130
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,720
Courier speaking.

131
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,399
Please help me send a package

132
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
to Shilun Group.

133
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,639
Okay.

134
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:54,387
(Lu Xiuyuan Su Shilun)

135
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:56,450
(Death Certificate Lu Xiuyuan)

136
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,000
I followed your orders

137
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,159
and got close and intimate with Baoyan.

138
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,519
I'll make her trust me even more.

139
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,360
Don't worry.

140
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,279
Whatever you want

141
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,200
will be yours.

142
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,720
Can you sing a stanza with me?

143
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,039
Now is not the time.

144
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,559
It's time

145
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,879
to see how you perform.

146
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,879
Ms. Su is back.

147
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,039
Be good.

148
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,279
Sober.

149
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,279
We're home.

150
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,920
My Dad is coming home.

151
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,759
Why are you still babbling upstairs
all day?

152
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,600
You should be preparing for his return.

153
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,519
You must be confused.

154
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,639
Your father is on a business trip.

155
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,240
He won't be able to come back.

156
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,440
Today is my birthday.

157
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
My Dad will come home on my birthday
every year.

158
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:27,720
Don't worry.

159
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,399
Happy birthday.

160
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,840
You are young

161
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,919
and full of temper.

162
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,399
Unfortunately, you are still ignorant.

163
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,279
What now?

164
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,480
You don't want my Dad to come home?

165
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,000
Perhaps,

166
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,120
you have some shameful things to hide?

167
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,440
You smell so good, Sober.

168
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,560
Who taught you to talk
to your elders this way?

169
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,360
You're so pretty.

170
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,919
Elder?

171
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:58,039
Aren't you embarrassed to call yourself
an elder?

172
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,639
You're just a mistress who
took advantage of my Mom's illness

173
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,240
and climbed into the bed to get ahead.

174
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,320
Are you worthy of being called an elder?

175
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,639
Mr. Su.

176
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,039
They didn't get the painting.

177
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,799
Useless fools.

178
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,159
Is the birthday gift for Baoyan ready?

179
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,360
Yes, Mr. Su.

180
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Sober.

181
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,039
She's worse than you.

182
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,159
Isn't that right?

183
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,480
No matter what,

184
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,440
from a legal perspective,

185
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,120
you have to call me

186
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,559
'mother'.

187
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Don't worry.

188
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,720
Don't even think of taking anything

189
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:03,159
that belongs to the Su family.

190
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,320
Let's wait and see,

191
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,159
my good daughter.

192
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,360
Madam, Ms. Su.

193
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,759
Mr. Su is back.

194
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,240
Let's go, Sober.

195
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,360
Go and play.

196
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,680
I'm going to see your Grandpa.

197
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,799
Dad, you're back.

198
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,639
You're finally back.

199
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,120
Didn't you say you were too busy?

200
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,519
I thought you weren't coming back.

201
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,039
You would nag me for a month.

202
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,639
It'll be more than a month.

203
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,240
I'll nag you till my birthday next year.

204
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:32,879
Really?

205
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,759
This is my gift to you.

206
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,039
See if you like it or not.

207
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,080
Thank you, Dad.

208
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,559
I like it very much.

209
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,960
Dad.

210
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,159
I want

211
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,759
to ask for a bigger gift.

212
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:45,600
Is that okay?

213
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:46,759
Say it.

214
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,759
If I can do it, I will.

215
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,759
Really?

216
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,159
Can I ask for anything at all?

217
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,879
Certainly.

218
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,759
Well,

219
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:00,480
can you give me Shilun Gallery?

220
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,759
Shilun Gallery?

221
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,480
What a big ask.

222
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,080
I knew it was impossible.

223
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:09,320
Okay,

224
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,960
after the board meeting,

225
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,679
I will hand the gallery to you.

226
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,960
How's that?

227
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:15,559
Really?

228
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,639
Of course.

229
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,080
Pinky promise?

230
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:18,880
Here.

231
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,840
Pinky swear,
no backing out for a hundred years!

232
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,480
Dad, don't worry.

233
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:23,559
I'll make

234
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,799
a lot of

235
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:25,720
money for you.

236
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,560
Well,

237
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,679
I would appreciate it
if you didn't lose any money.

238
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,879
Dad, that's impossible.

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,360
Alright,

240
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,960
I have something to do at the company.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,760
I'll celebrate your birthday
after I'm done.

242
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:36,480
Alright.

243
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,760
Have a cup of coffee.

244
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,800
I want to grab something.

245
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,360
What do you want? Let me help you.

246
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,399
It's not important.

247
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,440
Let's talk about it when I come back.

248
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,039
Okay.

249
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:22,680
Mr. Su,

250
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,000
Qiang said he wasn't able to get
the painting that day

251
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,879
because Qin Yuebai

252
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,240
was rescued by another man.

253
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,360
Didn't you say there was a courier?

254
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:31,759
Where's the stuff?

255
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,100
(Lu Xiuyuan Su Shilun)

256
00:17:02,337 --> 00:17:08,775
(Lu Xiuyuan Su Shilun)

257
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,960
Have you checked the email address?

258
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,839
Yes.

259
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,519
But they were obviously on guard.

260
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,799
They hid the address.

261
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,400
At the moment,

262
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
the source has not been found yet.

263
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:23,680
In your opinion,

264
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,759
should we continue?

265
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,640
Since they are a death reaper,

266
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:39,160
they will definitely show up.

267
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,920
You are excused.

268
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:43,839
Yes, sir.

269
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,240
Let's give Sober

270
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,640
a good-looking hairstyle.

271
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,759
Who's the prettiest?

272
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,359
Who is the cutest puppy in the world?

273
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:26,039
It's our baby, Sober.

274
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,440
So cute.

275
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,600
(Dad)

276
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,720
Hi, Dad.

277
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,640
Baoyan.

278
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:35,640
Come to my place.

279
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,759
I'll give you a surprise.

280
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,200
Okay.

281
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,599
I'll go to the company right now.

282
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,599
See you later.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,119
Let's go, Sober.

284
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:43,319
We're going to your Grandpa.

285
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:44,079
Let's go.

286
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,599
Let's go.

287
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:07,319
Everyone.

288
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,720
I have some important news
to announce today.

289
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,160
(Shilun Group)
The board has discussed and decided

290
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,279
that from

291
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,480
today onwards,

292
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:17,880
all operations of Shilun Gallery

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
will be taken over by my daughter,

294
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:20,480
Su Baoyan.

295
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:23,160
Everyone...

296
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,880
Nobody told us about this.

297
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,799
She has no experience in this either.

298
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,000
It's too sudden.

299
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:33,880
Who is this?

300
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,400
You...

301
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:37,240
- Do you know her?
- No.

302
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,240
Excuse me, everyone.

303
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,079
I am

304
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:46,759
Su Shilun's

305
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:48,160
illegitimate daughter.

306
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,839
What?

307
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,880
Illegitimate daughter?

308
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,240
I haven't heard
about an illegitimate daughter.

309
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,519
Didn't we just meet?

310
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,640
Have you forgotten me already?

311
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:00,359
Father.

312
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,319
Mr. Su.

313
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,599
Mr. Su.

314
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,160
This meeting is suspended.

315
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,359
What? Suspended?

316
00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:13,839
What's happening?

317
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:14,920
Mr. Su.

318
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,759
This has never happened before.

319
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,759
Father.

320
00:20:43,612 --> 00:20:44,387
(I love Shilun)

321
00:20:48,325 --> 00:20:50,950
(I love Shilun)

322
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,720
Did your mother tell you?

323
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,000
No.

324
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,400
Until she died,

325
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
she did not say a word about it.

326
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,240
Do you know

327
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,079
how helpless I was back then?

328
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,200
- I was...
- Father,

329
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,440
I'm not here to question you.

330
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:35,599
Yuebai.

331
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,720
I know what you want.

332
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,680
I can give it to you.

333
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:49,319
Is there

334
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,799
a misunderstanding between us?

335
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,799
We are father and daughter.

336
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,480
Do we need these pretentious words?

337
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:58,759
You just want

338
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,920
my mother's painting, right?

339
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,160
Very well.

340
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:15,880
Give me a price.

341
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,240
I don't want money.

342
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,720
I want to use this painting

343
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,319
to exchange for a position.

344
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,480
What position?

345
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
A position that's useful

346
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:33,240
in Shilun Gallery.

347
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Okay, I promise you.

348
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,559
However,

349
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
I have a condition.

350
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,240
What is it?

351
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,759
You cannot reveal your identity.

352
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,160
Can you do it?

353
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,039
You have a deal.

354
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:01,559
Why are you doing this?

355
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,440
Because I'm the same as Su Baoyan.

356
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,839
I have your blood in my veins.

357
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,000
Besides,

358
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
the gallery is my mother's
to begin with.

359
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,400
You always have

360
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,079
multiple choices.

361
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,960
In this world,

362
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,240
you are my only relative.

363
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,480
Didn't you say you want to give me
the gallery?

364
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,680
Why did you appoint a manager

365
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,359
on top of me?

366
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,120
Listen to me.

367
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,160
I don't want to listen.

368
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,119
I don't want to listen.

369
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,759
Girl,

370
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,119
listen to me.

371
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:21,519
Come here, let me tell you.

372
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,680
Come here.

373
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,640
I really don't know what to do with you.

374
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,279
Listen to me.

375
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:36,960
That lady today

376
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:39,519
used to be a famous manager
of Nan'an Gallery.

377
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:40,400
I'll tell you,

378
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
she is very capable.

379
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,519
Think.

380
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,880
You just took over this gallery.

381
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:46,640
Seriously,

382
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,720
who would listen to you?

383
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,799
You can't convince anyone.

384
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,599
If you have such a capable person
beside you,

385
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,160
I can be at ease, right?

386
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:55,680
Moreover,

387
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,519
what's a manager?

388
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,680
It's just a title.

389
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,440
You are my daughter.

390
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,000
Who would dare to compete with you?

391
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,319
Really?

392
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:06,960
When did Dad ever lie to you?

393
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,599
Let me tell you,

394
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:11,119
everything I'm doing now

395
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,119
is paving the way for you in the future.

396
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:14,759
Say,

397
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,559
in the future,

398
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,880
all these,

399
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,400
including Shilun Gallery

400
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,480
and the entire group, will be yours.

401
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,079
Who would dare to compete with you?

402
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:29,319
But Dad, don't you know?

403
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,960
There is only one manager's office
in the entire gallery.

404
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,440
This is a problem.

(Shilun Gallery)

407
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,519
As expected.

408
00:26:26,839 --> 00:26:28,319
You really are something.
