I work here.

Sorry.

37
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,590
I haven't received
the announcement of your employment.

38
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,550
You can't enter

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,660
No?

Hello, Ms. Qin.

42
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,660
I know her.

43
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,590
She's my boss.

Everyone here knows her.

- Good morning, Ms. Qin.
- Good morning.

49
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,110
Please excuse me.

50
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,550
Good morning, Ms. Qin.

51
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,310
You are quite punctual.

52
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,670
Deliver this document
to the first floor for me.

53
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,750
Any issues?

54
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,910
Buy some bread for me.

55
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,430
Get a contract for me.

56
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,670
Get a delivery package for me.

57
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,310
Pick up my clothes
from the dry cleaners.

58
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:17,990
Ms. Qin.

59
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,940
Done.

60
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,020
Buy a few cups of coffee for me.

61
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,990
What?

62
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,020
Remember. I just want

63
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,430
Blue Whale coffee.

64
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,620
Okay.

65
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,140
I've given you the easy way out.

66
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,940
But you want to do it the hard way.

67
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,820
Tomorrow,

68
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,500
I'll make you resign voluntarily.

69
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,110
(Hello.)

70
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,940
(I've received your mail.)

71
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,550
(I'll reply to you as soon as possible)

72
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,550
(after my holiday ends.)

73
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,230
(Honorable Mr. L,)

74
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,790
(I'm the new manager of Shilun Gallery,)

75
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,870
(Qin Yuebai.)

76
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,550
No.

77
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,350
This is too formal.

78
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,060
(Honorable Mr. L,)

79
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,140
(You are cordially invited...)

80
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,780
(Honorable Mr. L,)

81
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,070
(I'm the manager of Shilun Gallery,)

82
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,020
(Qin Yuebai.)

83
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,420
This Mr. L

84
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,020
is too mysterious.

85
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,780
That's a quick response.

86
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,350
(Hello, Ms. Qin.)

87
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,900
(Come to this address after work.)

88
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,320
(I can meet you for half an hour.)

89
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,200
(Bring a cup
of Blue Whale Coffee for me.)

90
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,040
(Thank you.)

91
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,500
Mr. Qin.

92
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,470
I've bought you your Blue Whale Coffee.

93
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,190
There is a stash of documents
on the table.

94
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,780
Sort them out for me tonight.

95
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,750
I'm already off the clock.

96
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:14,990
What is it?

97
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,380
Can't you do it?

98
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,420
If you can't do it,

99
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,870
you can resign with HR tomorrow.

100
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,020
(For Mr. L, I'll endure this.)

101
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,710
Mr. L.

102
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,620
Are you here?

103
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,020
Mr. L.

104
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:15,950
Mr. L.

105
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,780
Mr. L.

106
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,110
Mr. L, are you here?

107
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:31,470
Mr. L.

108
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:45,470
(Send)
(I've arrived at the address.)

109
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,380
(May I know where you are?)

110
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,950
Mr. L.

111
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,900
Looks like I won't be able
to see you today.

112
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,470
I'll visit you again next time.

113
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,870
This is your coffee.

114
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:07,870
Please enjoy it.

115
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,140
She has come all the way here.

116
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,070
But you've drawn all the curtains

117
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,140
and refuse to see her.

118
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:27,780
In my opinion,

119
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,870
this lady is quite smart.

120
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,260
No matter how smart she is,
you are smarter.

121
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,110
I never thought you would ask me

122
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,590
to bring a counterfeit
to the auction house as bait.

123
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,590
Then you would save her like a hero

124
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,470
at the auction house.

125
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,350
I have to give it to you.

126
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,140
But Lu,

127
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,870
you have finally become
a renowned artist.

128
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,140
Why do you want
to keep your identity hidden?

129
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,470
If you keep nagging,

130
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,020
I'll destroy your paddy field.

131
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,500
How could you say that?

132
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,660
I'm just worried about you.

133
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,870
Now, I just want
to crack my parents' case.

134
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,140
I don't want extra trouble.

135
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,420
He's a weirdo.

136
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,350
What is your plan?

137
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,840
My parents' death

138
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,420
is related to the painting
left behind by Qin Yuebai's parents.

139
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,640
Now that I've become her assistant,

140
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,300
I'll have a chance to see that painting.

141
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,260
But Qin Yuebai
is probably the only person

142
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,420
who knows the real meaning
of that painting.

143
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,540
In my opinion,

144
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,660
you are so handsome.

145
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,620
You just have to seduce her.

146
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,780
After you get together,

147
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,190
she'll tell you everything.

148
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,350
Look.

149
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,280
And then,

150
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,040
- What did you say just now?
- you are handsome and she's pretty.

151
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,230
Handsome.

152
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,590
You look handsome.

153
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,620
You are very handsome.

154
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,990

Who is it?

157
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,950
Qin Yuebai.

158
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,110
Who else can it be?

159
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,780
See?

160
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,020
She even messaged you after work.

161
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,020
Go now.

162
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,590
I'll leave the form to you.

163
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,020
Get it done before I come back.

262
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,820
that you've harvested
all the paddy fields.

263
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,240
I went through all the fields.

264
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,150
You've worked hard.

265
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,990
Drink less.

266
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:13,820
You are drunk.

267
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,500
Are you joking?

268
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,470

Let me tell you.

273
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,390
I leveled his paddy fields.

274
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,390
I'm sure he'll ask me for compensation.

275
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,630
For someone like L,

276
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,340
we need to make him unhappy.

277
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,230
The more upset he is,

278
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,580
the better he'll remember you.

279
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:53,950
Drink.

280
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:05,100

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,390

282
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:08,710
Cheers.

283
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,860
Tell me.

284
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,230
Do you think he'll remember me?

285
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:35,820
Yes.

286
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,470
Lu Li.

287
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
I was played by him.

288
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,710
Be careful.

00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,860

290
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:12,230
What are you doing?

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,670
You are awake.

292
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,340

298
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,190
(I know your secret.)

299
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,320
You couldn't tell
that the painting was fake

300
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,880
because

301
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,710
you are red-green colorblind.

302
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,750
How did you get here so quickly?

303
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:56,750
I...

304
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,230
The earlier I come,
the earlier I can make fun of you.

305
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,470
500,000 yuan?

306
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,040
It's not even enough

307
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,230
to buy her earrings.

308
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,340
Worry not.

309
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,280
I'm willing to pay you 500,000 yuan

310
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,340

(Head Chef)

312
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,320
Instead of cutting vegetable
in the kitchen,

313
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,670
you came to ruin my plan.

314
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,950
Why?

315
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,470
I did this for you.

316
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,430
I caught you.

317
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,230
Mr. L.

318
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,190

320
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,190

Ms. Qin has got a game.

342
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,750
Yes.

343
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,580
Look at her.

344
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,260
She's not playing around.

345
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,640
I heard that Ms. Qin

346
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,840
was already very good
when she worked for Nan'an Gallery.

347
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,040
Right? I heard about that too.

348
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,680
(I love a beautiful career woman.)
She managed to turn a new artist

349
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,720
(A friend's friend is L's best friend.)
into a money tree in just half a year.

350
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:48,400
Just half a year?

351
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:48,560
Yes.

352
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,240
Just half a year.

353
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,760
- That's amazing.
- She's just a clown.

354
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,320
That's right.

355
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,100
By the way, that Su...

356
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,540
Stop it. She's here.

357
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,060
Let's get back to work.

358
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,600
Infamy is also a way of being famous.

359
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,190
Right?

360
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,470
Stop complaining.

361
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,300
You are right.

362
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,780
Our clients are Gods.

363
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,710
How many versions have we done?

364
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,340
Let's talk over dinner.

365
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,100
Okay.

366
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,190
She's leaving.

367
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:11,260
She's leaving.

368
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,260
Yes.

369
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,500
Tell me if anything happens.

370
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,190
Hello.

371
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,780
Why does everyone
only pay attention to her?

372
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,230
Don't they know
that I'm the owner of the gallery?

373
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,190
Get me on the trending list

374
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:30,990
right now.

375
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,630
What I don't lack is money.

376
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,990
Ms. Baoyan.

377
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,600
You

378
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,950
are already on the trending list.

379
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,840
(Early Morning.)

380
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,440
(Su Baoyan's Night Out with a Model)
(The Heiress of Shilun Group)

381
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,000
(The Paparazzi Caught Her
Being Intimate)

382
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,240
(with a Male Model on a Date)

383
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,820
Hello.

384
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,540
Baoyan.

385
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:55,710
Do you know who did it?

386
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,580
Did you do that?

387
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,020
Yes.

388
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,260
Who allowed you to do that?

389
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,300
Can't you tell?

390
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,080
Now, everyone knows

391
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,680
that Su Baoyan is trying
to kick you out.

392
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,100
Right now,

393
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,760
we need to initiate the attack first.

394
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,580
Even so,

395
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:13,990
it's my own problem to solve.

396
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,950
You are wrong.

397
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,260
This concerns all of us.

398
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,580
Look at all of us here.

399
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,470
If you are defeated,

400
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,260
will it end well for us?

401
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,060
Qin Yuebai.

402
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,780
