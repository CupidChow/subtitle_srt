everything you asked me to investigate.

What's wrong?

17
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,490
Nothing.

18
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,090
What did you just say?

19
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,440
Look at this.

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,290
Isn't this Sun Yiming's company?

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,810
So

22
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,200
Sun Yiming changed his mind
because of Tang Bei

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,720
and chose to work with him instead?

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,880
Look here.

25
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:32,660
(Funds Flow Statement)

26
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,040
Such abnormal transactions...

27
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,970
Did Su Shilun use the gallery as collateral
to Sun Yiming

28
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,760
to settle his debt?

29
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,160
Look again.

30
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,090
This one.

31
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,970
Shilun Group's huge loss

32
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,880
was due to that financial discrepancy.

33
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,410
Su Baoyan

34
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,370
really made a big mess.

35
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,320
It wasn't Su Baoyan.

36
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:01,130
Who is it then?

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,130
Su Baoyan has gone abroad.

38
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,440
Tang Bei will never

39
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,290
get involved for her.

40
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,320
If I'm right,

41
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,690
it's Wang Yayin

42
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,440
who's behind Tang Bei.

43
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,040
Wang Yayin again.

44
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,850
Even if it's true,

45
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:21,970
we have no proof.

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,130
Sun Yiming won't trust me,

47
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,600
so he won't trust Tang Bei either.

48
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Say.

49
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,530
Could he have dirt on Tang Bei?

50
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,440
Dirt?

51
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,690
You have a point.

52
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,690
Well...

53
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,370
But he wouldn't give it to us either.

54
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,040
What does Sun Yiming do for a living?

55
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:48,920
A businessman.

56
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,640
What do they value most?

57
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,130
Profit.

58
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,160
Exactly.

59
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,370
If we offer him enough profit,

60
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,570
something tempting enough,

61
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,040
it would work.

62
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,320
Yes.

63
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,250
Lu Li.

64
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,640
Did you do all this

65
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,280
for yourself

66
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,050
or Qin Yuebai?

67
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,960
I owe it to her.

68
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,440
I've worked here for years.

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,520
There's nothing we can do.

70
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,690
Give us an explanation.

71
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,880
Have they? Quiet down.

72
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,130
Quiet down.

73
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,280
- Quiet down.
- I won't stay quiet.

74
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,960
She's here.

75
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,730
The market value dropped so much.

76
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,200
How did it become like this?

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,250
Think of a solution.

78
00:05:59,022 --> 00:06:01,497
(Shilun Group)

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,690
Why is it you?

80
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,640
Mr. Su's abroad for business.

81
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,440
I'm representing the board for now.

82
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,520
Sit where you like.

83
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,130
What gives you the right to sit here?

84
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,400
Qin Yuebai.

85
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,250
How dare you show up?

86
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,130
Look what you've done.

87
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,050
The gallery's gone because of you!

88
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,050
It was our blood, sweat, and tears!

89
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,640
What gives you
the right to be on the board?

90
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,880
Someone
who's never set foot in the gallery

91
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,840
has no right to say that.

92
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:38,640
You...

93
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,320
Everyone.

94
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,690
Yuebai's young.

95
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,930
She needs you

96
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,840
to tolerate her.

97
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,250
Even if she made

98
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,840
some irreparable mistakes.

99
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,760
I believe

100
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,960
it wasn't on purpose.

101
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,690
How about this?

102
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,490
Yuebai.

103
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,170
Bow and apologize

104
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,730
in front

105
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:01,810
of everyone.

106
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,440
And this matter

107
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,370
will be over.

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,640
I've never been

109
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,440
the one who should apologize.

110
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,520
What attitude is that?

111
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,490
Hello?

112
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,520

Yuebai.

119
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,680
Yuebai, stop the car.

120
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,880
Let me explain.

121
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,250
I have something to say.

122
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:45,160
Yuebai.

123
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,680

124

Yuebai.

125
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Yuebai, let me explain.

126
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,520
You've lost your mind!
Do you want to die?

127
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,560
Yuebai, let me explain.

128
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,880
I did agree to help Sun Yiming

129
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,520
buy the gallery,

130
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,370
but I had no choice.

131

Sun Yiming doesn't trust me,

133
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,800
so what happened afterward

134
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,880
has nothing to do with me.

135
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,490
It was...

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,160

00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:51,250
Now's the perfect time to strike.

192
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,250
Qin Yuebai is alone and weak.

193
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,450
She even drove away Lu Li.

194

196
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,250
is perfect.

198
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:37,730
to stop me now.

199
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,360

200

Famous entrepreneur Lu Xiuyuan

202
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,650

203
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,890
in a car crash.

204

They left behind a young son.

205
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,080
It wasn't an accident.

206
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:15,560
It was Su Shilun?

Every time I stand

208
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,080
in this dazzling city

209

and watch its flashy nightlife,

210
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,280
I remind myself constantly

211
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,250
never to forget the hatred.

212
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:38,520
Only then can I survive.

213

This flash drive

214
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,250
holds evidence
of Tang Bei and Wang Yayin's crimes.

215

No matter how hard it gets
and no matter the result,

we'll

218

face it together.

shareholder restructuring meeting

221
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,120
is nearly over.

222
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,890
Only one vote left for Ms. Wang.

223
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:40,840
We await the final result.

224
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,690
Wait.

225
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,040
Qin Yuebai, why are you here?

226
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:51,080
Wang Yayin is suspected
of embezzling company assets.

227
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,040
The evidence is concrete.

228
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,760
Everyone knows

229
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760

230

Your lie is pathetic.

She framed Su Baoyan.

232
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,690
The Su family is chaotic.

233
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,490
Utter chaos.

234
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,840
Who knows if it's real?

235
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,250
She did this at such a time.

236
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,010
It turns out

237
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,760
the company
no longer belongs to the Su family.

238
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,080

239

What do you mean by that?

240
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,890
What do I mean?

241

You heard me.

Everyone in Shilun Group

248
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,450

Does she really have that much data?

251

Take a closer look.

Is the data true?

253

Can we verify it?

254
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,730
It can't be real.

255
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,920
(Wang Yayin's Asset Embezzlement)
Doesn't look real.

256
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:12,760
It might be real.

257
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,490
Look at the transactions.

258

Wang Yayin.

259

Don't worry.

260

Everything is recorded.

268
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,080
Yeah.

I'm telling you.

Just because I helped you once

279

doesn't mean we're okay.

I'm telling you.

281
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,250

how those board members would react

289
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,760

290

what you sent her

292
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,080
