=Episode 5=

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,535
Was the patient exposed
to anything stressful before collapsing?

16
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,690
No, nothing.

17
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,130
He was painting.

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,600
Then, he suddenly started
having trouble breathing,

19
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,320
sweating,

20
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:58,690
and then he collapsed.

21
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,080
Based on our examination results,

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,880
it's likely a panic disorder.

23
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,490
Panic disorder?

24
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,440
A type of acute anxiety disorder.

25
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,130
It is triggered suddenly
when the patient's

26
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,250
sore spot is touched.

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,530
But we'll need further observation
to be sure.

28
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,600
You could try
some desensitization exercises.

29
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,160
Okay.

30
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,200
Once this drip's finished,

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,250
go home and get some rest.

32
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,880
Thank you.

33
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,010
So you believe it now?

34
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,920
How could

35
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:46,920
a genius painter be a good-for-nothing
who can't even hold a brush?

36
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:01,810
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,760
What you said

38
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,600
is right.

39
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,760
When I was a kid,

40
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,130
I did learn to paint.

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,290
However,

42
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,600
because of an accident,

43
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,440
I never picked up a brush again.

44
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,720
By the way,

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,250
well,

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,530
now that we've got our hands
on Bellflower,

47
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,040
do you think I should still pretend

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,520
to be Mr. L?

49
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,010
Of course, you should carry on.

50
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,810
How cold-hearted you are.

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,850
No sympathy at all.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,010
If you don't receive treatment,

53
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:47,850
how will you recover?

54
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,290
Don't worry.

55
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:52,600
I'm here with you.

56
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,850
You'll recover soon.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,130
How can I trust

58
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,200
a dodgy businessman?

59
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,530
Businessmen are all about profit.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,370
Right now,

61
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,530
you're my biggest cash cow.

62
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,010
What cow?

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,600
A cash cow.

Didn't you just buy them yesterday?

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,250
Yes.

72
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,640
I don't like them anymore.

73
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,080
Take them.

74
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,200

75
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400

Mr. Tang, you're here.

78
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,130
You seem unhappy.

79
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,490

Nothing.

81
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,170
I just want to max out
my dad's credit card today.

82
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,280
Did your dad upset you?

83
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,170
No.

84
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,520
Tell me.

85
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,050
Why does my dad...

86
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,170
No, it's not that.

88

Why is she hosting the new exhibition?

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,250
Actually,

90
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,440
I have a way

91
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,250
that could help you.

92
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,250
What is it?

93
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,520
Go to the gallery's storeroom...

94
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,250
I knew you loved me the most.

95
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,200
It's so good to have you.

96
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,640
Is everything arranged?

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,520
Don't worry, Ms. Su.

98
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,880

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,760
- Understood.
- Understood.

102
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:23,640
Let's go.

103
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:46,948
Quick.

104
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:55,809
Change it.

105
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,610
Look at the time.

106
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,400
Yeah.

107
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,610
They told us nine o'clock.

108
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,760
What time is it now?

109
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
They said it would start.

110
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,490
Why aren't they here yet?

111
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,760
Are they sure about it?

112
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,480
We've been waiting for a long time.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,880
We've been waiting for a long time.

114
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,080
We've been waiting for ages.

115
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,570
Yuebai, Yuebai.

116
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,280
Don't open the doors.

117
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,160
Why?

118
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,810
There's a problem with the painting.

119
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,240
Haven't you noticed?

120
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,810
The color in this painting is wrong.

121
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,170
It's been switched.

122
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll check the CCTV footage.

123
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,200
There's no time.

124
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,240
How about this?

125
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,400
I'll go and look for it first.

126
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,200
The real painting must
still be in the gallery.

127
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,840
It'd be difficult to get such
a valuable painting out of the gallery.

128
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,800
I'm counting on you.

129
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:45,760
What on earth is going on?

130
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,010
Can someone come out
and explain what's happening?

131
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,280
We can't just wait here for nothing.

132
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,370

What is it?

137
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,450
That professional fraud buster told me

138
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,480
that Bellflower

139
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,250
is the real deal.

140
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,450
No... That's not possible.

141
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:28,640
I...

142
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,520
Yesterday...

143
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,970
I had someone swap it out yesterday.

144
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,760
That's impossible!

145
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,560
Hang on a minute.

146
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,370
Let me have a look.

What are we going to do?

152
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,090
I really did swap it.

153
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,970
I really...

154
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:07,450
It's alright.

155
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,610
Don't worry.

156
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,160
What do we do?

157
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,850
We'll just have to think
of something else.

158
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,680
It was Su Baoyan who did it.

159
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
The CCTV footage is gone.

160
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,370
How can you be so sure?

161
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,610
I bluffed it out of her.

162
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,120
(Su Baoyan)
If it really wasn't her,

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
she'd have called me up
and given me a right telling-off by now.

164
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,210
She's guilty and blocked me.

165
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,010
Thank you.

166
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,610
What for?

167
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,490
Thank you

168
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,970
for being clever enough

169
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,400
to guess the real painting

170
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,210
is in the warehouse.

171
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,800
Bellflower is priceless.

172
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,080
Su Baoyan wouldn't dare damage it.

173
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,880
Moving it rashly

174
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,400
would only increase the risk of damage.

175
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,330
So the best thing to do would be

176
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,040
putting it together
with the old paintings

177
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,160
in the warehouse.

178
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,160
You seem to know a lot about it.

179
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,370
You're not in on this, are you?

180
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,640
How ungrateful.

181
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,760
Not the first time, is it?

182
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,490
Go back to the warehouse

183
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,970
and check all the paintings.

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,210
Aren't you worried
I'll do something about it?

185
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,680
Would you?

186
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,850
Is everything arranged?

187
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,840
Don't worry, Ms. Su.

188
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,160
Be careful tonight.

189
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,160
Nothing can go wrong.

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,600
Understood?

191
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,610
- Understood.
- Understood.

192
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,400
Let's go.

193
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,560
Yuebai.

194
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:50,760
Yuebai.

195
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,280
Don't open the doors.

196
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,120
Why?

197
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,680
There's a problem with the painting.

198
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,490
Tang Bei.

199
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,010
You...

200
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,210
You're my boyfriend.

201
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,490
You shouldn't have to do this.

202
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,090
It's alright.

203
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,120
It's what the elders want.

204
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,850
It's alright.

205
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,090
What kind of elder is she?

206
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,610
She's not my real mom.

207
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:43,250
Why should she order you about?

208
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,280
Doing all this work

209
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,760
is not tiring. Besides,

210
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,760
the most important person is your dad.

211
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:53,970
I want to make a good impression on him.

212
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,760
Tang Bei,

213
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,210
you're so good to me.

214
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,250
Wang Yayin is such a pain,

215
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
always pretending to be virtuous.

216
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
Today, she's even ordering you about.

217
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,610
She's really too much.

218
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,490
With you here,

219
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,560
who would dare bully me?

220
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,610
Well, let me help you.

221
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,970
Can you cook?

222
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,560
Yes, of course I can.

223
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,370
I'm very clever.

224
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,090
Let me teach you.

225
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,760
Hold the knife flat.

226
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,000
Then curl your fingers in a bit.

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,080
Like this, is it right?

228
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,760
Yes.

229
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,800
Cut down like this.

230
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:34,760
Yes.

231
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,010
Is anyone home?

232
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,520
Delivery.

233
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,040
Who would send me a delivery?

234
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,800
Give me the knife.

235
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,010
I'll go and have a look.

236
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,040
Hello?

237
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,880
Coming, coming.

238
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,970
Who is it?

239
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,090
Delivery.

240
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:53,680
Hello.

241
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,970
Delivery for Ms. Su Baoyan.

242
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,680
- Thanks.
- Bye.

243
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,490
Ms. Su.

244
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,920
Ms. Su.

245
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,250
What is it?

246
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,450
Your delivery's arrived.

247
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,450
Who would send me something?

248
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,210
How do I open this?

249
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,040
I've got a knife.

250
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,010
Be careful.

251
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,560
Here.

252
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,760
Baoyan.

253
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,010
What's wrong?

254
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,280
Where are you hurt?

255
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,370
I'm alright.

256
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,490
This is a fake painting of Bellflower.

257
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,250
Get rid of it immediately!

258
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,010
I reckon

259
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,010
this must be a rival's tacky prank

260
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,760
after Qin Yuebai took over the gallery

261
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,010
out of jealousy.

262
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,080
Are you alright?

263
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,040
What are we going to do?

264
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,520
You can't keep going on

265
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,840
like this, right?

266
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,000
Alright.

267
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,410
I feel so bad to see you like this.

268
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,890
Anyway,

269
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:49,600
I've found something out.

270
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
That might help you.

271
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,210
What?

272
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,080
It's about Qin Yuebai.

273
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,970
I've checked all the paintings
in the storeroom.

274
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,250
Everything else is fine.

275
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,490
Money well spent.

276
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,600
We've got a bit of a thing going now.

277
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,040
Thanks.

278
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:37,080
Today,

279
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,490
I really owe you one.

280
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,970
Sometimes, I feel like

281
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,170
I'm always

282
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,210
walking on a tightrope.

283
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,410
I can't afford to relax for a second.

284
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,650
It's like

285
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,010
if I make one mistake,

286
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,560
it'll lead to irreversible consequences.

287
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,650
Luckily

288
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:11,170
you helped me out today.

289
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:14,210
Lu Li,

290
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,800
thank you.

291
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:19,970
You're welcome.

292
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:22,250
Cheers.

293
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:30,760
Cheers.

294
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,040
This painting...

295
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,690
Congratulations.

296
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,640
Congratulations
on a successful art exhibition.

297
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,450
You flatter me.

298
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,600
You're really something

299
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,600
to make such an important exhibition
so successful.

300
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,970
You must come next time.

301
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,450
Okay, I'll be off then.

302
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,280
The composition is too precarious.

303
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,250
This exhibition is really good.

304
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,650
Qin Yuebai,

305
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,360
you've really impressed me.

306
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,450
Now that you're here,

307
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,970
why don't you have a look around?

308
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,930
No wonder my dad always says

309
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,210
I should learn from you.

310
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:25,970
So,

311
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,490
someone with red-green color blindness

312
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,760
can be in charge of our gallery.

313
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,410
Please, tell us about it.

314
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,880
Isn't that you she's talking about?

315
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
Everyone, take a look.

316
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,010
Whose name is written on it?

317
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,890
A color-blind person
is in charge of the gallery?

318
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,280
Isn't that a kind of deception?

319
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,970
Ms. Qin, are you really color-blind?

320
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,760
How can you be in charge here?

321
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,250
Please answer our questions quickly.

322
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,970
Ms. Qin, can you answer us?

323
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,080
Ms. Qin, can you answer our questions?

324
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,040
Ms. Qin,

325
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,080
I know your secret.

326
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,280
You couldn't tell
that the painting was fake

327
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,080
because

328
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,970
you are red-green colorblind.

329
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,080
A businesswoman who trades art

330
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,690
was born colorblind.

331
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,600
If everyone knows this...

332
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,450
I understand why you don't want

333
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,600
to keep me by your side.

334
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,840
I did a good job, didn't I?

335
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,040
Just you wait.

336
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,080
She'll definitely get what's coming
to her in the end.

337
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,920
How dare she be smug?

338
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,720
You're the best.

339
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,520
Ms. Qin, please answer my question.

340
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,320
How can you manage the gallery?

341
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,250
Yes.

342
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,760
It's true.

343
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,600
I am indeed
a red-green color-blind patient.

344
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,520
Anyway,

345
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,730
color-blindness
is a congenital condition.

346
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,170
It cannot be chosen.

347
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,520
Nor can it be changed.

348
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,650
However,

349
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,210
color-blind patients

350
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,450
can also appreciate the splendor of art.

351
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,840
Everyone, please look at

352
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:08,600
that painting.

353
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11,450
What can you see?

354
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,840
Wheat.

355
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,730
Rice.

356
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,250
It's not just rice.

357
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,040
What does this have to do
with the painting?

358
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,760
There's also wind.

359
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,730
There are many things in this world

360
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,760
that can't only be perceived

361
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,600
through color.

362
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,120
Everyone, please imagine.

363
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,170
If you are now

364
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,210
in the middle of a pitch-black night,

365
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,970
how can you see
the golden color of the rice paddies?

366
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,520
Sometimes, you don't use
your eyes to see the colors.

367
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,450
We feel them.

368
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,760
For example, the breeze
combing through the paddies.

369
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,650
The fragrance of
the rice husks you smell.

370
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,970
They can all represent gold.

371
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,360
The sound of the wind.

372
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,650
The scent of rice.

373
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,730
The husk.

374
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:13,320
That's all gold.

375
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,800
We color-blind patients

376
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,520
can use other senses besides color.

377
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,520
We can also use

378
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,650
sound,

379
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:24,890
touch

380
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,080
and smell

381
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,650
to experience this world.

382
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:29,800
You may not know this,

383
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,800
but Shilun Gallery

384
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,040
is holding an exhibition

385
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,560
for the color minority.

386
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,520
I have another piece
of good news to share.

387
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,040
Mr. L

388
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,320
will be participating

389
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:48,520
the art exhibition.

390
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,250
Mr. L will be participating?

391
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,970
Ms. Qin, please satisfy our curiosity.

392
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,800
What kind of person is this Mr. L?

393
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Mr. L...

394
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,120
It's better for you all to stay closer
to the artwork

395
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:05,120
and further away from the artist.

396
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,760
So as to keep a sense of mystery.

397
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,410
A sense of mystery?

398
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,520
Is this a way of respecting
and protecting the artist?

399
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,170
Protecting and respecting the artist.

400
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,320
Yes.

401
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:16,080
Our gallery hopes

402
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,410
that whether or not you can see color,

403
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,450
you can all experience
the splendor of art.

404
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,250
Even if you can't see color,

405
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,680
your heart

406
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,410
can still feel it.

407
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,760
Thank you for your support.

408
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,730
Welcome to our next exhibition.

409
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,240
Ms, Qin,

410
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,970
we've just received
an anonymous tip-off.

411
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,560
You're Su Shilun's
illegitimate daughter.

412
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,160
The color blindness you just admitted to

413
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,480
is strong evidence
of your father-daughter relationship.

414
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,800
Is this information accurate?

415
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,170
Yes.

416
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,730
I'm sorry, everyone.

417
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:10,210
Today,

418
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,730
we won't be responding
to any topics unrelated to the event.

419
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,250
Well, let's leave it here for now.

420
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:16,800
It's alright.

421
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,170
Thank you, fellow reporters,

422
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:21,120
for your concern for me.

423
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,320
I don't know
where these rumors came from.

424
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,010
Personally,

425
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,450
I've never liked discussing
my family affairs.

426
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,170
But since you're all asking,

427
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,410
I can only say

428
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,080
that everyone at Shilun Gallery

429
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,010
is already as close as family.

430
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,970
Whether it's me,

431
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,520
Mr. Su

432
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,360
or the gallery staff,

433
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:43,730
we're all family fighting side by side.

434
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,760
That's it for today.

435
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,520
That's your sister.

436
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
She is not.

437
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,450
We can't just let this slide.

438
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,970
Mr. Su, please don't leave!

439
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,250
Was it an accident or a mistake?

440
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,320
Mr. Su, please explain!

441
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,520
We need an explanation
about the illegitimate daughter!

442
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,650
Say something, Mr. Su!

443
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:58,930
Are you color-blind too?

444
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:08,410
Let go!

445
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,760
I always thought you were the one trying
to climb the ladder.

446
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,250
But it turns out it's your mom!

447
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,040
The daughter of a mistress,

448
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,120
why should you be above me?

449
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,040
Su Baoyan,

450
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,650
I'm warning you.

451
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,760
Watch your mouth.

452
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,930
Why don't you go back and ask Su Shilun

453
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,360
who's the daughter of a mistress?

454
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,010
Qin Yuebai.

455
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,360
You...

456
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:35,650
