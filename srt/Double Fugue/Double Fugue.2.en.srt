00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,110
Ms. Su,

16
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,130
let Sober sit next to me.

17
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,240
I'll treat it like my new best colleague

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,490
and take care of it.

19
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,400
Ms. Su Baoyan.

20
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,800
Nice to meet you.

21
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,000
You are pretty.

22
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,280
And that's all.

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,650
Because you're in a long queue.

24
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,560
If anything, you can only be

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,000
his second mistress.

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,770
Ms. Su,

27
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,800
you're mistaken.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,490
Stubborn, aren't you?

29
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,650
Tell me then.

30
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:56,680
Who are you?

31
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,050
What dirty trick did you use

32
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,090
to get into the gallery?

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,280
Who am I?

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,170
You

35
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,210
will find out soon, Ms. Su.

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,210
Don't celebrate too early.

37
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,930
We'll see

38
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,610
how long

39
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,490
you last here.

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,280
What do you think of this proposal?

41
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,240
Not bad.

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,210
I think Proposal B is doable too.

43
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,650
You can try this.

44
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,520
Hello, everyone.

45
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,610
I am the new manager, Qin Yuebai.

46
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:44,930
Nice

47
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,240
to meet you all.

48
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,280
I heard

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,650
you just had a tough period.

50
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,240
As a token of appreciation,

51
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,090
I brought red envelopes for everyone,

52
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,840
together with three days
of paid days off.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,960
Rest well.

54
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:57,960
A break!

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,050
Thank you, Ms. Qin.

56
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,080
Thank you, Ms. Qin.

57
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,000
No need to thank me.

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,650
You deserve it.

59
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,610
Also,

60
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,090
no dog allowed

61
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
in the office.

62
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,280
You've been fired.

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,720
She's trying to assert her dominance.

64
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,840
We have to work harder now.

65
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,840
She's scary.

66
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,360
Right?

67
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,570
Yeah.

68
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,650
She's not bad.

69
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,890
New head, new style.

70
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,770
Exactly.

71
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,810
Come, Sober.

72
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,400
Poor thing.

73
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:28,060
(Tang Bei)

74
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,520
Yes, Manager Su?

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,960
Don't call me manager.

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,400
Someone pissed you off?

77
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:41,920
That new girl!

78
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,810
Whatever. I don't

79
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,770
want to talk about it.

80
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,120
Can you pick me up later?

81
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Let's take a stroll to clear my mind.

82
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,840
I'm in a meeting now.

83
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,650
I'll come to you later, okay?

84
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,160
All right.

85
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,330
Hi, Ms. Su.

86
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
Terminate the contracts
with all artists.

87
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
Now.

88
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,450
Ms. Su,

89
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,090
this is...

90
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:13,960
Don't dally.

91
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,920
Do what you're told.

92
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Noted.

93
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,010
Did you see the news?

94
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,720
What?

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,240
Shilun Gallery terminated its contracts
with all its artists.

96
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
Shilun Gallery?

97
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,400
Yes.

98
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,450
Why so sudden?

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,922
(Breaking News: All artists gone from
Shilun! Where is its future?)

100
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:41,960
They laid off all artists.

101
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,840
Oh my God.

102
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,210
What crazy news.

103
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,650
Right?

104
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,010
Shilun Gallery.

105
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,650
What's happening?

106
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,400
(New manager arrived at Shilun Gallery.)

107
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,810
(All artists have been retrenched.)

108
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,040
(Is this a complete internal reshuffle?)

109
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:05,920
(Nevertheless,)

110
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,600
(this new)

111
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,650
(management decision
leaves everyone curious)

112
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,600
(about the longevity of the art gallery)

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,160
(in the foreseeable future.)

114
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,450
Increase the contrast.

115
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,840
So?

116
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,720
Do you like

117
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,770
my present?

118
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,650
You cripple the company

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,960
just to have your revenge.

120
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:33,720
The current batch is gone.

121
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,250
But there's always the next batch.

122
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,330
I know what I should do

123
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,810
once I run the art gallery.

124
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,890
I have

125
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,570
a top priority right now.

126
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,130
And that is

127
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,600
to get rid of you.

128
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm afraid I'll let you down.

129
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,920
Thank you

130
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,010
for giving me the stage to perform.

131
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,160
Remember all this.

132
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,360
Okay.

133
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,520
And look here.

134
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,635
(A Genius Artist Emerges)

135
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,960
You want to engage L?

136
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,360
Everyone knows

137
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,810
that art prodigy is cranky

138
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,210
and mysterious.

139
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,010
He doesn't do contracts

140
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,810
and never attends any events.

141
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,400
No one knows where he lives.

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,040
Contracting him

143
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:22,360
is a fool's errand.

144
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,210
You think so?

145
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:27,720
We'll see.

146
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,410
Ladies and gentlemen,

147
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,570

151
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,330

152
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,360

Hello, Mr. Han.

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,000
Anything from this side?

800,000 yuan.

162
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,720
Ms. Qin, are you there?

163
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,210
I'm here at the auction.

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,240
Thank you for the information.

165
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,810
After I buy L's art piece,

166
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,760
I'll buy you a meal.

167
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,880

1.6 million yuan from No. 26.

173
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,960
2 million yuan.

174
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:12,810
2 million yuan from an outsider.

175
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
2.6 million yuan.

176
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
3 million yuan.

177

178
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,330
Anything higher, sir?

179
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,690
Never mind.

180
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,240
It costs 3 million yuan now.

181
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,090
Okay.

182
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:25,240
3 million yuan, once.

183
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,680
3 million yuans for a painting.

184
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,760
3 million yuan, twice.

185
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
Anyone?

186
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,410
Do I hear a higher bid?

187
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,960
3 million yuan, thrice.

188
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,760
Deal.

189
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:34,810
Congratulations.

190
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,450
Let's look at the next time.

191
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,410
Yeah.

192

The next masterpiece

193
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,530
comes from the genius painter, L.

194
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,210
It's called

195
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,530
Bellflower.

196
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:54,840
The starting bid

197
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,600
is 600,000 yuan.

198
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,760
It begins now.

199
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:57,930
800,000 yuan.

200
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,210
800,000 yuan.

201
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:01,050
- 900,000 yuan.
- 900,000 yuan.

202
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,120
1 million.

203
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,600
1.8 million.

204
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,720
2 million.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,290
3 million.

206
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,210
3 million.

207
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,960
Any higher bid?

208
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,290
3.5 million.

209
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
3.5 million.

210
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,450
3.7 million.

211
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,090
3.7 million yuan from an outsider.

212
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,240
4.5 million.

213
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:21,640
4.5 million from No. 31.

214
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,290
5 million.

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,170
5 million?

216
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,410
Who is the bidder?

217
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,000
5 million yuan from No. 10.

218
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,840
Anyone will bid higher?

219
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,570
You wear

220
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,960
a post-modernism scarf.

221
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:44,960
(Him again?)

222
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,690
It matches L's painting.

223
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,720
This painting by L

224
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,050
doesn't pander to the market's taste.

225
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:54,330
But it highlights his artistic style.

226
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,330
Don't you agree?

227
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,530
That's right.

228
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,090
I'm sick of

229
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:58,960
Van Gogh

230
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,170
or Monet.

231
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,600
I prefer post-modernism now.

232
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,930
For example,

233
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,760
Mucha.

234
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,720
I'm pretty sure
you have never heard of him.

235
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,210
He's one of the underrated ones.

236
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,050
Also, this scarf

237
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,210
is bespoke.

238
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,760
You can't find it anywhere else.

239
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:16,810
Why are you sneering?

240
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,410
Darling,

241
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,760
I want that painting.

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,570
Baby,

243
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,760
you have great

244
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,690
taste.

245
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,330
That painting

246
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,600
should be displayed in our gallery.

247
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,210
5.1 million.

248
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,760
5.1 million.

249
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,880
Shouldn't we let those

250
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,960
who knows how to appreciate art

251
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,480
purchase this painting?

252
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,840
Right, Ms. Qin?

253
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,640
5.1 million, once.

254
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,690
- 5.1 million...
- 6 million.

255
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,600
6 million.

256
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
6.1 million.

257
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,410
6.1 million.

258
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:55,930
7 million.

259
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,330
7 million yuan from No. 10.

260
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,210
Darling.

261
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,050
It's okay.

262
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,210
7.1 million.

263
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,640
7.1 million.

264
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,210
Anything higher?

265
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,050
8 million.

266
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:12,410
8.1 million.

267
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,600
It's fine.

268
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,210
Mister,

269
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,290
one-upping

270
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,720
each other like this

271
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,760
serves no purpose.

272
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,000
You know what?

273
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:23,720
I'll give you 500,000 yuan.

274
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,360
Can you

275
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,450
do me this favor

276
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,330
and let me buy the painting?

277
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,290
500,000 yuan?

278
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,810
It's not even enough

279
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,840
to buy her earrings.

280
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,050
Unless

281
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,840
it's fake.

282
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,960
Darling, he said my earrings were fake.

283
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,530
I don't need your money.

284
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,960
I don't know what you are doing here,

285
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,410
but I am

286
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,760
definitely getting the painting.

287
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,410
If you're here to ruin my plan,

288
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,720
I'll make you pay dearly.

289
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,930
9 million.

290
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,960
Worry not.

291
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,450
I'm willing to pay you 500,000 yuan

292

on her behalf.

293
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,640
That's too kind.

294
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,960
9.1 million yuan.

295
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:17,600
You're amazing, Darling.

296
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,600
Of course.

Ladies and gentlemen,

299
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,690
anyone can go higher?

300
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:29,210
Ms. Qin,

301
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,330
even if you win the bid,

302
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,640
Mr. L will not see you either.

303
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,210
All right.

304
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,290
9.1 million yuan, once.

305
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:42,120
9.1 million yuan, twice.

306
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:43,720
Congratulations.

307
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,090
You'll own the painting.

308
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:48,210
9.1 million yuan, thrice.

309
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,120
Deal.

310
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,720
Congratulations, mister.

311
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,320
What a wonderful tale
in the history of auctions.

312
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,000
Can we give him

313
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,450
a round of applause?

314
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,410
Okay. Okay.

315
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,810
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

316
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,090
You gave up?

317
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,000
You too?

318
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,240
But good art is priceless.

319
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,600
Why did you give up?

320
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:11,290
But artists have a price.

321
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,050
Also,

322
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,640
a businessman doesn't know true art.

328

How much did they pay you?

329
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

330
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,290
Are you going to pay me double?

331
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,690
I can.

332
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,240
So long as you tell me

333
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,690
who sent you here.

334
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,290
Unfortunately for you,

335
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,210
no one sent me here.

Instead of cutting vegetable
in the kitchen,

340
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,760
you came to ruin my plan.

341
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,880
Why?

342
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,050

do try the food prepared by our helper.

346
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,760
It's very delicious.

Sure. I'll try them.

348
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,690
I'm actually quite nervous.

349
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Relax.

Look how sweet he is.

384
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:38,730
Come.

385
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:39,920
Yeah.

386
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,970
Baoyan won't stop

387
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,290
praising you.

388
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,050
This has nothing to do with you.

389
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,360
I'm talking to Dad.

390
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,680
Don't eavesdrop.

391
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,160
Baoyan.

392
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,730
I must have left
one dish in the kitchen.

393
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:04,530
Bei,

394
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,010
can you bring it out for me?

395
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,570
The kitchen is over there.

396
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,050
Sure.

397
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:13,970
Baoyan.

398
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,840
Thanks, Dad.

399
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,050
Thank you.

400
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:35,747
(Lu Li, Working Experience, Designer
Design Service Co. Ltd)

401
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,810
Lu Li.

402
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,730
Ms. Qin.

403
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,920
The interviewee is here.

404
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,730
We're running an art gallery,

405
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,090
not a restaurant.

406
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,600
We don't need a head chef.

407
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:26,397
(Lu Li)

408
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:28,880
It's your resume.

409
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:30,600
You've been rejected.

410
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,880
But I haven't even said anything,
Ms. Qin.

411
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,920
Like I said,

412
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,680
we're not looking for a head chef.

413
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:44,970
You'll regret this.

414
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,570
Regret this?

415
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:54,730
Impossible.

416
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,320
(Ms. Qin, the Bellflower on the auction
yesterday is a counterfeit.)

417
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,520
(Ms. Qin, the Bellflower by L
on the auction yesterday)

418
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,120
(was sent to be verified by the buyer.)

419
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,280
(It was found to be a fake.)

420
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:42,330
So you knew
the painting was a counterfeit.

421
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:45,010
Who are you?

422
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:46,970
You have your way,

423
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:48,090
and I have mine.

424
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,120
Don't pry further, Ms. Qin.

425
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,680
An auction house

426
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,490
is selling a counterfeit.

427
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,810
Perhaps they are on the verge
of bankruptcy

428
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,600
and wanted

429
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,250
to squeeze out whatever money they can.

430
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,290
Smart.

431
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,770
But L's work
is notoriously difficult to replicate.

432
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,160
That painting is almost identical.

433
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Who can be this skillful?

434
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,570
And why did you help me?

435
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,050
For

436
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,250
a favor.

437
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,120
I want to be your assistant.

438
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,730
Why?

439
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,600
Did you forget that I saved you?

440
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,090
So?

441
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,330
If I can't ask for a favor
with my act of kindness,

442
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,810
I'll have to resort to threats.

443
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,490
What do you mean?

444
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,120
Ms. Qin,

445
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,160
I know your secret.

446
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,360
You couldn't tell
that the painting was fake

447
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,160
because

448
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,290
you are red-green colorblind.

449
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,970
You are bold, indeed.

450
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,330
A colorblind woman

451
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,090
is running an art gallery.

452
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,970
A businesswoman who trades art

453
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,570
was born colorblind.

454
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,490
If everyone knows this...

455
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,330
I understand why you don't want

456
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,810
to keep me by your side.

457
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,010
Come to work tomorrow at eight.

458
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,570
Now get out of my sight.

459
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,530
If you're late,

460
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:38,730
I'll fire you.

461
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,530
Also,

462
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,840
reverse psychology

463
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,330
doesn't work on me.

464
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,290
Because you should be the one

465
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,730
who is afraid.

466
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,010
Hello?

467
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,330
Hello?

468
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:11,120
The lift is broken.

469
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:13,680
- Hello?
- Low blood sugar?

470
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,920
I see you even risk
your health there, Ms. Qin.
