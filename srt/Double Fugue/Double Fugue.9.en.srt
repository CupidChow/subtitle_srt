Yuebai.

16
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,650
Don't.

17
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,360
Why should I listen to you?

18
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,130
You're scheming against me.

19
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,090
I'm betting.

20
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,160
Obviously,

21
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,090
I won my bet.

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,690
What are you going to do?

23
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,440
Put on a show.

24
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,400
That way, Su Shilun

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,440
won't be able to force me
into a marriage, right?

26
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,530
Knowing your personality,

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,480
you wouldn't just sit around
and wait to die.

28
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,160
But why me?

29
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,720
You're my assistant.

30
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,970
Making six thousand a month.

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
Why wouldn't I use you?

32
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
That's a different cost.

33
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,570
Wang Han really has terrible taste.

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,000
You have so many schemes.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,480
If you don't want it, give it to me.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,360
(Qin Yuebai passionately
kissed a mysterious man in public)

37
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,160
It's too late to regret it now.

38
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,090
That's fast.

39
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,040
So,

40
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,600
you see me as

41
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,690
a stepping stone?

42
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,920
(That's too ugly.)

43
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,560
(Transferred 25,000 yuan)
(That's too ugly)

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,170
Are you sick in the head?

45
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,640
Shilun,

46
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,520
did you read the news?

47
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,160
(Qin Yuebai kissed a man in public)
Yuebai

48
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,400
is becoming more outrageous.

49
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,010
I read it.

50
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,200
That's all she's good for.

51
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,880
She wasn't raised by your side
since she was little,

52
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,690
so she's a bit rebellious.

53
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,130
But what do we

54
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,730
tell the Wang family?

55
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,520
Help me see
if this painting is straight.

56
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,930
It's a little crooked, isn't it?

57
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,400
Have Yuebai come back.

58
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,170
Father.

59
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,880
This is my boyfriend, Lu Li.

60
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,320
Since you've brought him home,

61
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,170
let's have dinner together.

62
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,930
Ask the housekeeper prepare something.

63
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,130
Hello, Mr. Su.

64
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,130
I... I'm Lu Li.

65
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,440
Yuebai told me

66
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,850
that you enjoy collecting
cultural artifacts and calligraphy.

67
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,370
So,

68
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,610
I specifically

69
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,050
picked up some antiques
and paintings from a collector

70
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,320
as gifts for you.

71
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,130
Come upstairs with me for a moment.

72
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,130
How annoying.

73
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,690
How could Wang Yayin

74
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,320
actually invite her to our home?

75
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,170
She really thinks
she's the lady of the house.

76
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,130
Come here.

77
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:17,520
Sober.

78
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,730
It's so annoying.

79
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,730
Wang Yayin is bad.

80
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,880
Say Wang Yayin is bad.

81
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,080
Say it, hurry.

82
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,570
Wang Yayin is bad.

83
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:31,320
Don't think

84
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,960
that you can win me over

85
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,520
with these random gifts.

86
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,370
Let me tell you, brat,

87
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,370
if you want to take anything
from the Su family,

88
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,810
I need to see your real skills.

89
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,130
Mr. Su,

90
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
I'm just showing respect

91
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,960
to my girlfriend's father.

92
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,960
I didn't mean to curry favor.

93
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,370
Is that so?

94
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,570
I really didn't expect

95
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,960
that Qin Yuebai
would reject the Wang family

96
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,200
and choose you in the end.

97
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,050
It seems

98
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,050
I overestimated her from the start.

99
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:05,730
I think

100
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,400
it's you who underestimates her.

101
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,370
What did you say?

102
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,880
I hope you're right

103
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,280
that I underestimated her.

104
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,680
I'll accept the gifts for now.

105
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,680
But remember this, brat,

106
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,920
don't bring shame to the Su family.

107
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,680
That's my spot.

108
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,880
Congratulations.

109
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,200
The gallery flopped.

110
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,280
You're back to making beds.

111
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,210
Little sister,

112
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,040
if your eyesight's bad, go see a doctor.

113
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,370
Who's your little sister?

114
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,450
What's with your tone?

115
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,880
See that?

116
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,640
Some people just love to freeload.

117
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,880
Even a dog wouldn't want that.

118
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,090
I'm not eating anymore.

119
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,330
Come over here, Sober.

120
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,730
Sober.

121
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,920
Come here, Sober.

122
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:13,970
Come here.

123
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,370
Sober, stay down.

124
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,490
Come here now.

125
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,970
Come here for a hug. Come on, come here.

126
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,450
Baoyan.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,950
The relationship announcement
was pretty sudden.

128
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,370
If we'd known you had someone in mind,

129
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,450
we wouldn't have worried about you.

130
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,850
Exactly.

131
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,970
Even a turtle can find
a green bean pleasing.

132
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,160
Let alone the two of you.

133
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,970
I'm not leaving.

134
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,280
Why didn't you come after me?

135
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,640
Everyone's eating.

136
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:53,760
Here.

137
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,450
Have more vegetables.

138
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,680
(A wall full of portraits.)

139
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,380
(Why is there only a flower
in the middle?)

140
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,730
(This must be related to the painting)

141
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,920
(Yuebai's mother left behind.)

142
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:01,850
Who is it?

143
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,730
It's me.

144
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,370
I got thirsty
in the middle of the night.

145
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,760
I asked Lu Li to get me some water.

146
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,730
It's too dark, he can't find it.

147
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,160
Okay, got it.

148
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,640
The water dispenser is downstairs.

149
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,640
(Who exactly are you?)

150
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
(You have your ways.)

151
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,130
(I have my methods.)

152
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:58,280
(You don't need to ask any further.)

153
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,090
Marrying him
means leaving the Su family.

154
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,730
Are you willing to do that?

155
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,560
Can you tell the difference
between Li Kui and Li Gui?

156
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,450
If you say so,

157
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,520
do you know L very well?

158
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,760
I'm just curious.

159
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,280
(You seem)

160
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,130
(to know a lot
about painting and collecting.)

161
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,640
(You wouldn't happen to be)

162
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,680
(a hidden world-class master,
would you?)

163
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,160
(I've learned by osmosis.)

164
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,680
(But my father does
like collecting things.)

165
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,730
(What are you hiding?)

166
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,280
Ms. Qin,

167
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,130
I've looked into that matter.

168
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,490
Can you meet me?

169
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,760
What did you find?

170
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,850
Take a look at this first.

171
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:03,710
(Buyout agreement)

172
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,560
(Bank account transaction details)
That private investigator from before

173
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
was probably threatened.

174
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,280
Or rather,

175
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,330
he was bribed.

176
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,330
So,

177
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
the photos are fake.

178
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,250
Yes.

179
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,680
Do you know where that investigator is?

180
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,920
I want to see the real photos.

181
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,680
He's probably already left the country.

182
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,850
I'm guessing
he took a confidentiality fee.

183
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,130
However,

184
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,560
I found this at his place.

185
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,370
Take a look.

186
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:35,947
(Party A: Wang Jiye)

187
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,947

189
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,090
Long time no see.

190
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,280
Hello, Ms. Qin.

191
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,160
Were you satisfied
with the painting we auctioned

192
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:07,970
for you last time?

193
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:08,880
Of course, I was.

194
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,040
I trust your work.

195
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,680
Next time, I'll treat you to a meal.

196
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,040
You're too kind.

197
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,520
Actually, the reason
I asked you here today

198
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,450
is to ask you about something.

199
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,010
Go ahead.

200
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,560
Do you know

201
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,520
Wang Jiye?

202
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,450
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,280
But I can't disclose client information.

204
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:30,450
Is that so?

205
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,090
You can't disclose client information,

206
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,640
but you can

207
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,760
collude to auction fake paintings.

208
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,880
If I'm not mistaken,

209
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,350
you took a hefty cut
from that fake painting of L last time,

210
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,160
didn't you?

211
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,040
Wang Jiye

212
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,160
is a regular at our auction house.

213
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,330
Whenever he gets his hands
on something good,

214
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,130
he brings it over.

215
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,090
However,

216
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,370
he's not exactly selling fake paintings.

217
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:02,330
Because

218
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,280
he arranges the buyers in advance.

219
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,730
If you have any misunderstandings,

220
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,890
should I arrange a meeting for you?

221
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,320
I happen to have an appointment
with him today.

222
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,890
Keep him busy for me.

223
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,250
Before nightfall,

224
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:19,450
don't let him get distracted.

225
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,840
As long as you help me with this,

226
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,450
all the paintings
in my gallery from now on

227
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:26,520
will still go through you.

228
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,730
No one will ever know

229
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,120
about the fake paintings.

230
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,360
Okay.

231
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,120
(Great Painter,)

232
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,890
(Unknown Number)
(Nanhua Building Rooftop.)

233
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:56,040
(If I don't hear from you)

234
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,450
(Wang Jiye)
(I'll send your photo to her.)

235
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,360
Mr. Wang,

236
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,720
these are some of the paintings

237
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,600
that our auction house
auctioned off last time.

238
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,080
Take a look.

239
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,840
Do you have any more paintings by Mr. L?

240
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,360
Yes, I do.

241
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,080
Then,

242
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,970
(Lu Li)
how about getting two more paintings

243
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,280
to be auctioned

244
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,490
at our auction house?

245
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,280
No problem.

246
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,560
What would you like to eat?

247
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,360
Here.

248
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,890
Have some.

249
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:45,535
(Lu Li)

250
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,410
Okay.

251
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:56,730
Next time,

252
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,170
I'll get you a couple more.

253
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,170
I really didn't know
who I was with, did I?

254
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,320
Mr. L.

255
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,650
Lu Li,

256
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,490
you've gone to a lot of trouble.

257
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,800
Bribing a private investigator

258
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,890
and forging photos

259
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,650
to put on a show for me.

260
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,040
Can't paint?

261
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,280
PTSD kicking in?

262
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,890
It's a pity you're not an actor.

263
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,250
I should give you an Oscar.

264
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,250
What are you really after?

265
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,250
Whatever it is you're after,

266
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,080
I can't afford L.

267
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,450
Let's just call it quits.

268
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,690
I'm valuable enough.

269
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,360
You can use me to achieve your goals.

270
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,080
What value do you have?

271
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,360
I am the identity of L.

272
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,690
Isn't that enough?

273
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,010
Why are you so insistent

274
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,520
on staying by my side?

275
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:16,250
I...

276
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,890
If I said

277
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,970
that I really can't paint,

278
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,250
would you still believe me?

279
00:21:34,622 --> 00:21:37,385
♪You are my tender♪

280
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:40,747
♪And love will be forever♪

281
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:46,710
♪Through the wind,

282
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,410

283

♪Tender♪

284
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,040
I'm sorry.

285
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I don't know what happened.

286
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,560
I just fell asleep.

287
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,280
I'm not usually like this.

288
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:09,410
Really.

289
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,890
Let's come more often later.

290
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,080
I'm sure I can understand it.

291
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:13,760
It's okay.

292
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:14,920
I'm already happy

293
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,360
that you came to the opera with me.

294
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,730
Don't force yourself.

295
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,410
But I didn't expect

296
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,690
that you'd actually enjoy opera.

297
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,890
And that you understand it all.

298
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,690
Can you sing it, then?

299
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,120
Could you sing a few lines for me?

300
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,080
Now?

301
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:30,930
Okay.

302
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,890
You're so good.

303
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,720
Aren't you a business major?

304
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,350
How are you so good
at singing opera too?

305
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,080
It's a hobby.

306
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,080
You sing this well just as a hobby?

307
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,800
Then how did you

308
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,450
come to like opera?

309
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,760
Before,

310
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,760
I didn't really have any hobbies.

311
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,360
How should I put it?

312
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,170
A lot of things

313
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,600
are just as distant to me as the words

314
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,930
"parents" and "friends".

315
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,840
But then,

316
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,890
I happened to hear a piece of opera.

317
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,890
It pulled me out

318
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,560
of a really bad

319
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,360
experience.

320
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,840
I...

321
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
It's all in the past.

322
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,080
It's okay now.

323
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,280
Really.

324
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,840
A horse steps into the Tang Dynasty.

325
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,210
The vast universe

326
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,280
is turning around.

327
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,840
Is my singing awful?

328
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,280
You really think it's bad?

329
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,760
I'll sing a few lines for you.

330
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,320
Say it's good.

331
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,730
It's okay, I like it a lot.

332
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,080
Don't worry.

333
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,280
From now on,

334
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,560
you'll have more than just opera.

335
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,690
You'll have me.

336
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:16,250
I'll enjoy lots of operas

337
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,840
with you.

338
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,280
I can learn too.

339
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,760
Even though I'm not a great singer now.

340
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,800
Okay.

341
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,360
You...

342
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760
You should get to work, right?

343
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,970
(Wang Yayin)
Then go, hurry up and go.

344
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,120
It's okay.

345
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,650
Go to work.

346
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,930
I'm telling you, I'm really

347
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,650
a very understanding girlfriend.

348
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,040
You should be happy to be dating me.

349
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,560
Go on.

350
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:54,690
Go.

351
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,000
Bye.

352
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,040
Then I'll get going now.

353
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,080
Let me know when you get home.

354
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,840
Okay.

355
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:37,930
Did you go on a date?

356
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,010
We had a meal.

357
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,490
Those previous deficits

358
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,160
were originally intended

359
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,890
to be filled by the marriage between
Qin Yuebai and the Wang family.

360
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,280
Now she's made her escape.

361
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,410
What are your plans?

362
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,410
If it really doesn't work out,

363
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,520
I can only transfer some funds

364
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,800
from my overseas account.

365
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,600
There's no way to get back

366
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,120
the money that's been transferred out.

367
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,520
If you really have no other choice,

368
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:18,450
I might have a solution for you.

369
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,210
Tomorrow, send this document

370
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,210
to Su Shilun anonymously.

371
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,210
As long as Su Shilun
receives this document,

372
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
he'll know

373
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,800
that all of this
is his precious daughter's doing.

374
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,560
(Project Investment Approver: Su Baoyan)

375
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,640
But if Su Shilun

376
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,930
(Project Investment Approver: Su Baoyan)
knows about this,

00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:43,930
do you know

378
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,410
what the consequences will be for us?

379
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,080
Having a change of heart?

380
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,080
How could I?

381
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,280
What do you mean?

382
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:32,520
This is too important.

383
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,520
I need to take care of it now.

384
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:37,690
Also,

385
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:39,730
I'll re-encrypt

386
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,170
the overseas fund accounts.
