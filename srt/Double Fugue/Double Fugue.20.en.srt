Mr. Sun.

16
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,490
I haven't even met that boss

17
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,880
behind you.

18
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,010
How about this?

19
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,880
I'll arrange

20
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,240
the signing ceremony.

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,930
We're forming a powerful alliance.

22
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,650
I need to publicize it.

23
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,210
Please don't.

24
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,080
That person

25
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,210
likes to stay low-key.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,050
Let's not ruin things.

27
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,290
Leave

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,130
this matter to me.

29
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,720
I'll leave it to you then.

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:06,930
Farewell.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,250
Farewell.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,760
Mr. Sun.

33
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,040
Mr. Su.

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,970
Here's an overview
of our acquisitions abroad.

35
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,810
Please take a look.

36
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,570
Well done.

37
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:33,640
It's good.

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,250
Mr. Su.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,010
We've sold off

40
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,370
all the company's shares.

41
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,600
What a waste

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,970
of over a decade of effort.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,250
Is it?

44
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,290
Come here.

45
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,200
Let me tell you something.

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
You know what they say?

47
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,810
A dying beast

48
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,760
still has its fangs.

49
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,370
No matter how perfect the disguise is,

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,970
it's still an empty shell.

51
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,970
Besides,

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,690
I don't know what Wang Yayin

53
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,760
might reveal.

54
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,920
If there's an earthquake coming,

55
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,570
I'm not going down with it.

56
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,320
You're wise, Mr. Su.

57
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,320
That idiot, Sun Yiming,

58
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,250
thinks he got a great deal.

59
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,640
(Sun Yiming: Let's meet at the gallery
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.)

60
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,130
If it weren't

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
for him and the big boss behind him,

62
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,600
I wouldn't have been able to leave.

63
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,760
Go get ready.

64
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,850
Yes, Mr. Su.

65
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,160
Hello, Lu Li?

66
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,130
What is it?

67
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:06,320
Hello, Yuebai?

68
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
I found it.

69
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,760
Found what?

70
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,570
The evidence.

71
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,250
Okay.

72
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:11,640
I got it.

73
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,970
I'll be on my way.

74
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,640
Where are you going?

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,050
Don't you want evidence?

76
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,960
Lu Li found it.

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,920
Hurry, he's here.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,640
Mr. Su is here.

79
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:37,920

80
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,130
Please give us an interview.

81
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,730
Respond to recent business issues.

82
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,640
Mr. Su, could you,

83
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,730
give us an interview?

84
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,930
Mr. Su, please respond.

85
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,570
Please respond.

86
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,570
It's about your wife.

87
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,000
Mr. Su, please comment

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,570
whether you're involved with your wife,

89
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,720
Wang Yayin's alleged crimes.

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,800

- Mr. Su!

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:55,930
Mr. Su is here.

92
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:57,440
- Hurry.
- Mr. Su!

93
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,130
Please address the recent controversy.

94
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,080
Are you aware
of what your wife was involved in?

95
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,130
What's really going on?

96
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,200
Mr. Su, please tell us

97
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,250
if your wife's crimes

98
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,960
have anything to do with you.

99
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,840
Is your wife's

100
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,520
job-related crime connected to you?

101
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
Mr. Su, please give us an interview.

102
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,440
Mr. Su, do you have any comment?

103
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,400
Mr. Su.

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,570
Please give us an interview!

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,730

Can you respond
to the personal controversies

112
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,840
you're facing?

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,130
Don't let anyone else in.

114
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes.

115
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,810
Is your wife's crime connected to you?

116
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Mr. Su, please respond.

117
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:33,840
Sorry.

118
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,570
We're not accepting interviews.

119
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,400
Please step back.

120
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,640
Please leave.

121
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,930
Step aside.

122
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,370
Thank you.

123
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,130
Long time no see.

124
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:55,930
Mr. Su.

125
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,570
Please sit.

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,520
Play a round of chess with me.

127
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,130
You're in quite the mood, Lu.

128
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,130
Mr. Su.

129
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:18,730
You've spent your life
sacrificing others.

130
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,760
Who knew you'd end up

131
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,640
being a sacrifice.

132
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,370
This game of chess is quite interesting.

133
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,840
It's not over yet.

134
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,520
How do you know

135
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:38,610
who the final sacrifice is?

136
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,760
Just like this piece here.

137
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,840
What if I add this?

138
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,235
(Acquisition Contract)

139
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,320
Sun Yiming chose to work

140
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,440
with an inexperienced brat like you?

141
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,760
Is this a joke?

142
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,690
If the price is right,

143
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,760
nothing is impossible.

144
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,050
Who do you think you are?

145
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,840
Aren't you overestimating yourself?

146
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,730
I'm not that capable.

147
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,370
But what if I add your overseas assets?

148
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,520
What do you mean?

149
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
A murderer

150
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,370
probably can't board a plane.

151
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:15,130
- Mr. Su!
- Mr. Su!

152
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,040
Please say something!

153
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,330
Don't let anyone follow me.

157

Do you like the exhibition

158
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,210
I prepared for you?

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,760
So this is

160
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,490
the trump card you begged

161
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,730
from Sun Yiming.

162
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,250
Who can prove

163
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,640
that I was the one who did this?

164
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,450
Who can prove that it's me?

165
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,560
How unexpected.

166
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,970
I really overestimated you.

167
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,040
You're as foolish

168
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,370
as your mother.

169
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,160
Su Shilun.

170
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,400
You'll pay for this!

171
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,210
Shut up!

172
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,130
I'll pay for it?

173
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,160
That's coming

174
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,370
from my biological daughter,

175
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,130
who's cursing her father

176
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,330
to pay.

177
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:10,450
Don't forget

178
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,800
you're my daughter.

179
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,920
I know

180
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,040
you deliberately got close to me,
came to our house,

181
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,450
and entered Shilun Gallery

182
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,130
just to avenge your mother.

183
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,130
But don't forget.

184
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,160
Besides having a mother,

185
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,850
you also have a biological father.

186
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,370
Why must you do this to me?

187
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,370
Why must you do this to me?

188
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,560
Why?

189
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,850
Why leave me no way out?

190
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,970
Why leave your own father

193

194
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,040

195
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,920
You don't own up to your actions.

196
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,970

198

199

201

what your real father

202
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,920
is truly like.

203
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,640
Let me tell you,

204
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,560
I did this!

205
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,640
I killed them!

206
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,800
If I had to choose again,

207
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,400
I would still kill them.

208
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,010
Even if I had to choose countless times,

209
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,450
I'd still kill them.

210
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,730
What can you do about it?

211
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:58,250
I couldn't

212
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,040
do anything to you before,

213
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:06,610

214
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,850

215

217

Not even for one day.

218

221
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,120
(that you must fight
for the things you want.)

222
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,800
(Even ignoring the outcome.)

223
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:15,840

in the future.)

traded himself

241

for the gallery and evidence.

242
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,730
Of course
I have to work hard and make money

243
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,800
to buy him back.

244
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,520

245
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,760

246

248

256
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,520

267

Maybe leaving

268
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
is the best choice.
