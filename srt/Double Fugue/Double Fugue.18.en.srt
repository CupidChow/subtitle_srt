(She may face over ten years in prison.)

192
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,800
(The full story coming up next.)

193
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,930
Go away!

194
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,360
Baoyan.

195
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,560
You have no right to care about her.

196
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,170
I'll kill you!

197
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,450
Who said you could speak?

198
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,010
Orphaned country bumpkin.

199
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,650
Stop! What are you doing?

200
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,360
I'll beat you!

201
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,600
This is kid business.
Adults shout stay out of it.

202
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,760
If you continue,

203
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:49,930
I'll call the police

204
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:50,930
to arrest all of you.

205
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,650
- Buddy, let's go.
- Let's go.

206
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,170
Are you okay?

207
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm fine.

208
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,560
What's your name?

209
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,450
My name is Tang Bei.

210
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,450
Tang Bei.

211
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,450
(Listen here.)

212
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,800
(Running solves nothing.)

213
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,600
(You must always)

214
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,930
(be in control of the situation.)

215
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:54,385
(Building 35, Unit 1)

216
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,520
Qin Yuebai.

217
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,120
I'll make sure you pay the price.

218
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:46,930
(Hello.)

219
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:48,410
(The number you dialed)

220
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:49,650
(is currently unavailable.)

221
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,040
(Please try again later.)

222
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,450
(Sorry.)

223
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,930
(The number you dialed)

224
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,170
(is currently unavailable.)

225
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,560
(Please try again later.)

226
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:02,872
(Tang Bei: Qin Yuebai is with me.)

227
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,600
Yuebai!

228
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,010
Yuebai!

229
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:27,840
Yuebai!

230
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,170
Yuebai!

231
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,170
Yuebai!

232
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,280
Yuebai!

233
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:41,930
Yuebai!

234
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,250
Great Artist,

235
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,970
you finally showed up.

236
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,010
Tang Bei.

237
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,360
Where did you hide Yuebai?

238
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,690
This has nothing to do with her!

239
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,760
How could that be?

240
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:00,410
Before she came,

241
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:01,410
we were all...

242
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,490
We were all doing fine.

243
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
After she showed up,

244
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,040
everything turned upside down.

245
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,080
So

246
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,360
I want you to experience

247
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,600
what it feels like to see

248
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,080
someone you love

249
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,970
slowly die in front of you.

250
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,170
Tang Bei, are you insane?

251
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,970
Wang Yayin is using you.

252
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,210
You want to be used forever?

253
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,760
She loves me.

254
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,080
And I love her.

255
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,840
Without her, I wouldn't be here.

256
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,690
Yes.

257
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,600
Stop acting in front of me.

258
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,210
Tell me

259
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,760
where you hid Yuebai!

260
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:53,360
Qin Yuebai.

261
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,410
I remember she has

262
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:00,170
claustrophobia.

263
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,210
What do you mean?

264
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,970
She's in the shipping container
behind me.

265
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,120
It's not even locked.

266
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,320
But I forgot

267
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,890
her exact location.

268
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:19,280
Time's almost up.

269
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,800
She's dying.

270
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,360
I've prepared a ladder for you.

271
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,690
It's over there.

272
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,410
Yuebai.

273
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,250
Yuebai.

274
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,690
Yuebai!

275
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:05,760
Yuebai.

276
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,840
Yuebai.

277
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:23,970
Yuebai!

278
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,690
Yuebai!

279
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,930
Yuebai.

280
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,210
Yuebai!

281
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,250
Yuebai!

282
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,650
Is anyone there?

283
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,760
Is anyone there?
