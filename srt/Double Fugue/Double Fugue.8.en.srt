why not

17

find a good marriage for Yuebai?

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,720
After the press conference,

19
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:52,720
public sentiment

20
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,690
hasn't been in our favor.

21
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,880
If we find Yuebai

22
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,130
a good husband,

23
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,930
it'll show how thoughtful
we are about her

24
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,570
as well as shut the gossip down.

25
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,570
Most importantly,

26
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,290
Baoyan won't get upset.

27
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,970
Besides,

28
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,920
if Yuebai has support
from her husband's family,

29
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,970
she won't be thinking about things

30
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,600
that should belong to Baoyan.

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,570
Dear,

32
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,200
do you have anyone in mind?

33
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,040
Mr. Wang of Zhuoyue Group.

34
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,160
Do you remember?

35
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,090
He has a son

36
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:44,090
named Wang Han.

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,760
That kid

38
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:47,760
is fine in every way,

39
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,290
but just a bit wild.

40
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,290
Mr. Wang has been hoping
to find him a wife

41
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,530
who can keep him in check.

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,720
If Yuebai marries into the family,

43
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,160
she won't be mistreated.

44
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:05,920
Mr. Wang?

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,690
All right.

46
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,530
I'll leave it to you.

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,370
Don't worry.

48
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,920
Help me press a bit longer.

Won't take long.

She's been causing trouble at home.

She alone is enough,

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:36,490
now there's also Qin Yuebai.

About Qin Yuebai,

59
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,730
I'll handle it.

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,080
Do it quickly.

66

What?

68
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,730
Your dad sent someone to look for you!

69
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,160
Where are you going, Mr. Wang?

70
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,840
My dad's come to catch me. I have to go.

71
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960

Lu Li?

74
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,560
So it was you.

75
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
You always tricked me
since we were kids,

76
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
and you're still doing that now.

77
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,810
Now tell me.

78
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,520
What do you want?

79
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,690
Stay away from Qin Yuebai.

80
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,730
Qin Yuebai?

81
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,370
Who is it?

82
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:20,730
Liver streamer? Flight attendant?

83
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,280
Or a model?

84
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,960
Ouch.

85
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,610
I remember it now.

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,490
She's the fiancee

87
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,690
my dad set me up with.

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,320
Why?

89
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
You like her?

90
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,520
It's none of your business.

91
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
You've always been better than me.

92
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,200
Now I'm going to marry
the woman you like,

93
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,960
that's a win for me.

94
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,520
You can try.

95
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,730
But when you do,

96
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,280
I'll send your gambling debt,

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,520
a complete record,

98
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,010
straight to your dad.

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,280
If I'm not wrong,

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
he gave you the money

101
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,130
as your startup capital.

102
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,370
Don't worry.

103
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,730
I'll make sure this marriage
won't happen.

104
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,130
Don't tell my dad.

105
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,570
(Trying to kick me out of the Su family
like this?)

106
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,760
(In your dreams.)

107
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,080
I've sorted everything out.

108
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,080
So messy.

109
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,490
You're off the clock.

110
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,570
Why?

111
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,280
You don't want to rest?

112
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,130
Where are you going?

113
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,010
To see my fiance.

114
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,960
I'll drive you.

115
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,050
Wait in the car.

116
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,160
Come on.

117
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,210

118
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,370
Who are you?

119
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,760
Wait your turn to serve, you know?

120
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,800
Mr. Wang,

121
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,040
this chick is pretty.

122
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
Come and sit here.

123
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:05,920
Sit here.

124
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,450
Wang Han,

125
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,370
come over.

126
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,370
This is my fiancee.

127
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,160
Don't be jealous.

128
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:23,520
Come.

129
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,850
I'll give you a kiss.

130
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,040
How dare you slap Mr. Wang?

131
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
Are you insane?

132
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,560
That fast?

133
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,040
Let's leave.

134
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:14,450
Mr. Wang,

135
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,330
have another drink.

136
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,560
I'll pour it for you.

137
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,040
You're leaving already?

138
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:22,680
Buzzkill.

139
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,450
Cheers.

140
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,210
Right.

141
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,160
Miss Qin,

142
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,160
Mr. Wang is outside.

143
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,250
He insists on seeing you.

144
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,210
He says he has something to say
in person.

145
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,490
All right.

146
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,610
Here he comes.

147
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,560
- Yuebai, marry him!
- Yuebai, marry him!

148
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,010
- Yuebai, marry him!
- Yuebai, marry him!

149
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,560
- Yuebai, marry him!
- Yuebai, marry him!

150
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,010
- Yuebai, marry him!
- Yuebai, marry him!

151
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,560
- Yuebai, marry him!
- Yuebai, marry him!

152
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:13,210

155
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760

- Yuebai, marry him!

156
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,970
- Yuebai, marry him!
- Yuebai, marry him!

157
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,450
Do you think she'll say yes?

158
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Of course, she will.

159
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,560
Who's this guy?

160
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,640
He's good-looking.

161
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,250
Qin Yuebai,

162
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,040
what do you mean?

163
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,680
Wang Han,

164
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,610
did you get hit in the head
or something?

165
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,370
Don't you hate being bossed around?

166
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,010
Yeah.

167
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,090
In my whole life,

168
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,970
only two women have ever hit me.

169
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,250
One is my mom,

170
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
the other is you.

171
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,330
Besides,

172
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,640
I've sworn

173
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,730
that I'm going to marry a woman

174
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,130
just like my mom.

175
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:53,970
That's right.

176
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,330
It's you.

177
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,760
You're insane.

178
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,490
Qin Yuebai,

179
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,370
I'm going to marry you.

180
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,680
What are you doing?

181
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,090
I've changed my mind.

182
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,370
I go back on my word.

183
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,610
Can't I?

184
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,250
What?

185
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,850
Even if you tell my dad

186
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,210
about all the trouble I've caused,

187
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,210
even if he beats me to death,

188
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,970
I'm still going to marry Qin Yuebai.

189
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,850
She's the type

190
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,400
I've never met before.

191
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,010
If you dare,

192
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,800
let's have a fair competition.

193
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,250
She won't choose you.

194
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
Don't be so sure.

195
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,040
I'll invite you to sit at the main table
at my wedding.

196
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
Why did you suddenly close the shades?

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,640
It's too bright.

198
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,160
Too bright.

199
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,250
Do you have time tonight?

200
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,090
Yuebai.

201
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,040
Sorry I'm late.

202
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,040
Hop in.

203
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,760
Is this bouquet

204
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,970
for Yuebai?

205
00:14:58,970 --> 00:14:59,370
Yeah.

206
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,800
Thanks.

207
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,850
Wang Han bought this.

208
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,880
His taste isn't that great.

209
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,850
What are you looking at?

210
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,210
You like it?

211
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:54,800
Don't worry.

212
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,840
We'll make sure to do it.

213
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,800
Here's your delivery.

214
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,490
The phone number ends in 5428, Miss Qin.

215
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,210
Your fiance sent these flowers.

216
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,090
Please sign here.

217
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,280
Look. Someone sends flowers.

218
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,800
Sorry, there's no one with the surname Qin
around here.

219
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,120
You must have the wrong address.

220
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:09,040
Can't be. This is the right place.

221
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,090
I'm sure.

222
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,800
I'm Miss Qin.

223
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,800
Just give them to me.

224
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,480
Sure.

225
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,610
He even sent flowers here.

226
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:15,600
How sweet.

227
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,160
(Dear, see you at Mingzhu Restaurant at 8 PM)
I want flowers too.

228
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,480
So nice.

229
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,240
(Dear, see you at Mingzhu Restaurant
at 8 PM)

230
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
That's a bit over the top.

231
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:21,680
Exactly.

232
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,370
So sweet.

233
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,040
Yuebai.

234
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:40,370
Yuebai.

235
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,040
Qin Yuebai.

236
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:43,760
What are you doing?

237
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,370
Wang Han's a total playboy.

238
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,640
He's bad news.

239
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,330
That's my flowers.

240
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,680
You just threw them away.

241
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:54,680
I...

242
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,090
Isn't that good?

243
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,680
Anyway,

244
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,520
I'm not that serious about marriage.

245
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,760
With him behaving like that,

246
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,880
we'll just live own our lives.

247
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,280
Besides,

248
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,650
I actually think
he's kind of interesting.

249
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:08,930
Marrying him

250
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,080
means leaving the Su family.

251
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,760
Are you fine
with being treated like this?

252
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,490
Why not?

253
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,120
I compromise to advance.

254
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,890
Wang Han's the only son
of the Wang family.

255
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,360
He's got endless resources.

256
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,800
If I marry him,

257
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,560
wouldn't all that be mine?

258
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:24,210
Maybe Su Shilun will have to
show me some respect

259
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,360
when he sees me.

260
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,450
Do you love him?

261
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:01,730
Love?

262
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:04,800
Lu Li,

263
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,490
I didn't expect you to be so immature.

264
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,250
I don't have time for love games.

265
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,320
Marriage is favor-trading

Besides,

268

who knows, maybe feelings will develop
over time?

269
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,490
