15
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,440
Baby,

16
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,770
sorry I'm late.

17
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,960
It's okay.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,490
Anyway,

19
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,960
I'm in a good mood today.

20
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,490
I'll forgive you this once.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,520
Something good happened?

22
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,290
Care to share your joy?

23
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,130
My dad said

24
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,480
he wanted to give me the gallery.

25
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,370
For real?

26
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,250
Yes.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,760
But

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,320
he insists I compete

29
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,850
with Qin Yuebai

30
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,320
for the same painting.

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,570
I have faith in you.

32
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,810
You can do this.

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Let's do it together.

34
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,040
Of course.

35
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,320
We'll succeed

36
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,410
if we do it together.

37
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,370
No way I'd lose to Qin Yuebai.

38
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,640
How have you been

39
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,690
all these years?

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,720
Not bad.

41
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,010
We haven't been here

42
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,160
for many years.

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,720
Yuebai.

44
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,880
You left the barley drink in the car

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,080
I made for you this morning.

46
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
Drink it while it's still warm.

47
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,600
Hello.

48
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,970
I'm Lu Li.

49
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:02,920
Her assistant.

50
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,720
Nice to meet you.

51
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,040
And you?

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,970
Song Yun.

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,480
Nice to meet you.

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,410
Nice to meet you.

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,010
What are you doing here?

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,370
My boss came here for business.

57
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,880
As the assistant,

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,370
I should help out, right?

59
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,720
Bai,

60
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,200
with an assistant like this,

61
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,480
you should be happy.

62
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,480
Being passionate about work is my duty,

63
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,320
Song.

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,810
Lu Li,

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,760
he's Andrew's agent, Eric.

66
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,290
It's okay, Bai.

67
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,690
There's no need to be so formal

68
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,720
between us.

69
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Waiter,

70
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:49,720
one Americano, please.

71
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,290
And a latte with tiramisu

72
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,880
for this lady.

73
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,570
Habits are hard to change.

74
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,360
Mr. Lu,

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,570
what would you like to drink?

76
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:04,920
Same as her.

77
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
One Americano,

78
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,570
two lattes,

79
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,130
and two tiramisus.

80
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,170
You know, Mr. Song.

81
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:20,200
Since we work and live together

82
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,960
every day,

83
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,810
naturally, we have similar habits.

84
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,760
Right?

85
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,130
So kind of you.

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,760
I didn't expect you

87
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,570
to have a sweet tooth, Mr. Lu.

88
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,730
You were abroad for years.

89
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,730
It's normal for guys to like sweets.

90
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,170
Bai,

91
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,730
your favorite dessert shop

92
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,960
opened a branch in town.

93
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,520
We should go there next time.

94
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:05,880
Yeah.

95
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,170
Let's go there. I like dessert.

96
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,320
But

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,810
honestly,

98
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:13,880
whether or not you like sweets
isn't important.

99
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:14,960
What matters is

100
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,520
that people shouldn't

101
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,480
live in the past.

102
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,520
You have to look forward.

103
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,490
Don't you agree,

104
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,880
Mr. Song?

105
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,320
Mr. Eric,

106
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,490
let's get back to business.

107
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,640
If I want

108
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,690
"Daisy" from Miss Andrew,

109
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,730
what are the conditions?

110
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,490
What did she say?

111
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,130
She asked us to come to you.

112
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,930
She doesn't handle the business side.

113
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,200
If I'm not mistaken,

114
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,170
you've already gone to see her,
haven't you?

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,320
Yes.

116
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,200
There you go.

117
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,250
That's what

118
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,440
she always says

119
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,960
to turn people away.

120
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,810
I may be her agent,

121
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,600
but I have no say

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,170
over who gets to exhibit her pieces.

123
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,730
You have to convince Andrew herself.

124
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:08,840
But

125
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,730
since we know each other,

126
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,570
I can give you a clue.

127
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
She's been looking for
a kind of mineral lately.

128
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,960
I don't know what the exact type is.

129
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,570
If you can help her find it,

130
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,130
there might be hope.

131
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,080
Thank you.

132
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,130
We have no time to lose.

133
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,400
Let's go find the mineral now.

134
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,440
The clock is ticking.

135
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,010
Come on.

136
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

137
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:44,880
Your barley drink.

138
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,130
Song Yun mentioned
that you knew each other.

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,490
What's your relationship?

140
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,200
Hello, Mr. Song.

141
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,810
I'm Su Baoyan from Shilun Group.

142
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,130
I'm here

143
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,520
to talk with you

144
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,200
about Andrew's work.

145
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,810
Hopefully, we'll have
a great collaboration.

146
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,610
No problem.

147
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,200
It's not hard to find minerals.

148
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,730
What's hard is

149
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,730
figuring out why Andrew needs them.

150
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,730
On the surface,

151
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,130
collectors acquiring raw minerals
is normal.

152
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,960
I saw a few raw minerals

153
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,960
in Andrew's room.

154
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,490
They had signs of being cut.

155
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,130
Not like they were meant for crafts.

156
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,200
More like they were meant
to be made into pigments.

157
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,810
Pigments?

158
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,610
Yes.

159
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,280
In ancient times,

160
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,730
only the highest-grade stones
were made into pigments.

161
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,930
Mid-grade stones were made into crafts.

162
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:00,170
So I suspect

163
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,200
Andrew wants to make pigments herself.

164
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,280
How do you know my phone password?

165
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:10,930
You told me last time.

166
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,320
When?

167
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,160
(Sound of Waves: Famous Collector Andrew
Damages Ancient Painting)

168
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,370
Mystery solved.

169
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,200
Andrew might want to restore

170
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,570
that ancient painting herself.

171
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,730
You seem to know a lot

172
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,160
about painting and collecting.

173
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,130
And back at Andrew's place,

174
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,400
you mentioned your dad's collection.

175
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,010
Don't tell me

176
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:42,130
you're some kind of
hidden world-class master?

177
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,730
I grew up around it,

178
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,090
that's why.

179
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,730
But my dad did love collecting.

180
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,330
But he's

181
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,090
already

182
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:57,800
passed away.

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,960
Don't believe me?

184
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,850
If you don't, I can take you
to visit his grave.

185
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:14,800
Sorry,

186
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,520
I was just asking.

187
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,130
Now I'll find someone to ask

188
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,520
where to find minerals.

189
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,730
No need.

190
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,130
I know a place.

191
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,370
These are Miss Andrew's information

192
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:34,970
and her collecting preferences.

193
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,330
I don't have time to go over all this.

194
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:46,040
I paid you a big sum

195
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,640
to tell me

196
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,330
what kind of stones will make Andrew

197
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,850
hand over "Daisy".

198
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,280
What's with all this mess?

199
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,440
Ugh.

200
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
Perhaps we were on the wrong track

201
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,160
from the beginning.

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
What Andrew wants

203
00:09:57,850 --> 00:09:59,010
isn't raw minerals.

204
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Thanks for your hard work.

205
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,640
Instead, what she really wants is
raw minerals for making pigments.

206
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,330
How do you know that?

207
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,970
See that?

208
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,840
The whole company

209
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,370
isn't even as useful as my boyfriend.

210
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,370
Go now.

211
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,800
Find the raw minerals

212
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,210
used for making pigments.

213
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,400
But

214
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,400
we still don't know

215
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,130
what color she wants.

216
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:27,970
You,

217
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,450
buy every type,

218
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,800
every color.

219
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,160
I've got plenty of money, anyway.

220
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,450
Go now.

221
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:33,920
Yes.

222
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,850
I'll go right away.

223
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,370
So annoying.

224
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,970
Thank goodness I have you.

225
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:41,800
Trust me.

226
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,680
I'll definitely

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,370
win back the gallery.

228
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,400
And then,

229
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,610
I'll give you a super big gift.

230
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,090
Why did you bring me here?

231
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:57,800
Supper?

232
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,130
These may be food stalls,

233
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,160
but a few of them up ahead

234
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,250
sell stones.

235
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,040
Where?

236
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:08,920
Up ahead.

237
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,250
I'll take you.

238
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,640
How much?

239
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,330
Nice?

240
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,400
Do you know what kind of mineral
she's looking for?

241
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,970
Based on my deduction,

242
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,640
Andrew probably needs

243
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,640
Tiger's Eye and Malachite.

244
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,370
You're impressive.

245
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,760
I have a sharp eye for color.

246
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,800
Just up ahead.

247
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,010
Almost there. Let's go.

248
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's go.

249
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,400
Ma'am.

250
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,970
We'll have a look.

251
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:17,760
Sure.

252
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,370
Have you found it?

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,610
I'll look again.

254
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,450
No.

255
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,160
Thank you.

256
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:47,010
No problem.

257
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:02,520
Ma'am,

258
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,560
can I take a look at this stone?

259
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,210
This one?

260
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,160
Yes.

261
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,850
My old man uses it to prop up
the table leg.

262
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,250
You want it?

263
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,010
Are you selling?

264
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,730
Sure. You want it?

265
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,730
It's not the exact same material,

266
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,850
but the color is very close.

267
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,800
Do you have more?

268
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,920
Or just this one?

269
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,040
My old man

270
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,400
used to be a miner.

271
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,610
He loved bringing back

272
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:35,160
all kinds of strange stones.

273
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,760
Those that could be cut into gems

274
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,970
have all been used up.

275
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,090
The rest

276
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,370
weren't suitable.

277
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,640
There are still a bunch in his car.

278
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,130
If you want,

279
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,040
I'll take you there.

280
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
That's great, ma'am.

281
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,080
I'll go with her.

282
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,010
You wait here a moment.

283
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,800
Okay.

284
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,920
I'll take you to them.

285
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,680
What's wrong?

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,330
Someone was following me just now.

287
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,320
It's okay.

288
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,040
I don't think the person will come back.

289
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,370
It's my fault. I came back late.

290
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,610
Did you get it?

291
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,010
Let's go.

292
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,040
Why is there such a big deficit?

293
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,040
I was impatient.

294
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
The asset figure being transferred

295
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
is too much.

296
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,730
I made a mistake.

297
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,250
But I think

298
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,920
all the problems can be solved quickly.

299
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,010
Actually,

300
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,970
if the deal between the company
and Mr. Wang

301
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,800
is signed,

302
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,610
the extra funds

303
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,760
can make up for the deficit.

304
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,330
It's just that Mr. Wang's focus

305
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,370
isn't on this right now.

306
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,730
He said

307
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,970
if we could solve his son

308
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,250
Wang Han's marriage,

309
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,080
this deal

310
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,160
would be closed right away.

311
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,560
Are you saying

312
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,250
that for such a big deal,

313
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,850
all we need to do

314
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,040
is to set up that spoiled brat
with someone?

315
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,970
Su Shilun

316
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:08,170
adores Su Baoyan.

317
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,600
Easy.

318
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,800
I'm talking about
that illegitimate daughter,

319
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,970
Qin Yuebai.

320
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,250
Don't you think

321
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,210
she's the perfect choice

322
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,040
to be Mr. Wang's daughter-in-law?

323
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,450
Well, well.

324
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
Don't be anxious.

325
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,010
I know

326
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,450
you want to help me take over

327
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,040
the Su family's wealth
as soon as possible, right?

328
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:57,760
Don't worry.

329
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:01,120
I'll take care of everything.

330
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,970
I have faith in you.

331
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,010
Give me the stuff.

332
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,120
I'll go myself.

333
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,120
Miss Su.

334
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,120
Stay home and look after Sober.

335
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Wait for my good news.

336
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,600
Sorry.

337
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,970
You're too late.

338
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,520
Miss Andrew

339
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,840
has accepted my gift.

340
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,410
Is that so?

341
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,410
It doesn't matter whether a good gift

342
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,010
arrives early or late.

343
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,840
Miss Andrew,

344
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,720
these minerals

345
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,010
should match the colors you need

346
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,360
for restoring the ancient painting.

347
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,560
You all actually figured that out.

348
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,210
You're clever.

349
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,970
But Miss Su has brought me

350
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,320
enough raw minerals.

351
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:40,930
Well,

352
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:42,010
Miss Andrew,

353
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,210
can I have "Daisy"?

354
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,970
Miss Andrew,

355
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,890
actually,

356
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,560
I didn't bring these minerals today

357
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,760
to exchange for "Daisy".

358
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,650
It's just a gesture.

359
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Because I know

360
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,760
restoring ancient paintings

361
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,210
takes passion

362
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,520
and persistence.

363
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,320
I truly admire you.

364
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,840
I'll give up

365
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
on "Daisy".

366
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,320
Because I know

367
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:20,040
this painting means a lot to you.

368
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,120
After I learned the story behind it,

369
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,410
I decided

370
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,560
I didn't want to profit off

371
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,170
something so beautiful.

372
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,320
Sorry to bother you.

373
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:43,760
I'm sorry,

374
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,560
Miss Su.

375
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,970
I've decided

376
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,520
not to exhibit "Daisy".

377
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,560
Qin Yuebai,

378
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,730
I really don't understand
what you're after.

379
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,970
You dragged me down with you
when you failed?

380
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,760
If you don't want it, fine.

381
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,040
But why stop me?

382
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,040
You're right.

383
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,970
I just want to let you know.

384
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:08,520
If I can't have it,

385
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,320
I'd rather destroy it
than let you have it.

386
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,250
You're happy?

387
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,840
Yeah.

388
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,120
I never thought

389
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,360
you'd be that kind of person.

390
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,650
If you can't get it,

391
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,840
no one else can.

392
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Just found out?

393
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,650
What?

394
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,560
Scared?

395
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,120
Then you'd better not

396
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,970
cross me.

397
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,800
What's wrong?

398
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,800
I think something's wrong with the tire.

399
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,120
What happened?

400
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,170
Flat tire.

401
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,120
Hello, is this a towing company?

402
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,520
Yes.

403
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,970
We've got a flat tire on the road.

404
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,120
I'll send you the address.

405
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,650
It'll take about two hours.

406
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,320
You called the tow truck?

407
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,000
- Yeah.
- How long will it take to arrive?

408
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,840
At least two hours.

409
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,360
I've got something to do
at the gallery this afternoon.

410
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,120
What now?

411
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,010
We can only wait.

412
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,040
Where are you going?

413
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,760
Miss Qin,

414
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,320
don't just think about work
all the time.

415
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,010
Take a moment.

416
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,170

These reporters

461
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,690
just want to stir up trouble.

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,120

463
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,280
You look mad.

00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,080
They're such a pain.

Do I need their opinion

on my family matters?

467
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,210
This is

468
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:04,840
a tricky situation.

469
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,360
But no matter what,

470
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,650
Yuebai is part of the Su family.

471
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,280
If we treat her unfairly,

472
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,250
people will talk.

473
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
But you know what Baoyan is like.

474
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,490
If you give Yuebai shares,

475
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:26,490
Baoyan will be heartbroken.

476
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:36,970
Dear,

477
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,250
you know me the best.

478
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:45,690
In my heart,

479
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:46,970
it's the same as yours.

480
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,360
Even though Baoyan has a bad temper,

481
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,650
she's still our precious princess.

482
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,450
We can't upset her.

483
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,280
Of course.

484
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,730
Honestly,

485
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:03,490
this whole thing
is giving me a headache.

486
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,930
If you ask me,

487
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,010
why not

488
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,080
find a good marriage for Yuebai?

489
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,280
After the press conference,

490
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,280
public sentiment

491
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,250
hasn't been in our favor.

492
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,450
If we find Yuebai

493
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:29,690
a good husband,

494
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,490
it'll show how thoughtful
we're about her

495
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,120
as well as shut the gossip down.

496
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,120
Most importantly,

497
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,840
Baoyan won't get upset.

498
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,520
Besides,

499
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,490
if Yuebai has support
from her husband's family,

500
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,520
she won't be thinking about things

501
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,170
that should belong to Baoyan.

502
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,120
