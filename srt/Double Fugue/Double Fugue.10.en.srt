Tomorrow, send this document

to Su Shilun anonymously.

17

As long as Su Shilun
receives this document,

18
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
he'll know

19
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,770
that all of this
is his precious daughter's doing.

(Project investment approver: Su Baoyan)

21
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,360
But if Su Shilun

22
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,880
(Project investment approver: Su Baoyan)
knows about this,

23
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,880
do you know

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,360
what the consequences will be for us?

25
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,040
Having a change of heart?

26
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,040
How could I?

27
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,250
What do you mean?

28
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,480
This is too important.

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,480
I need to take care of it now.

30
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,640
Also,

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,690
I'll re-encrypt

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,130
the overseas fund accounts.

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,850

receives this document,)

(he'll know)

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:46,440
(that all of this
is his precious daughter's doing.)

36
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,480
Don't worry.

37
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,690
From now on,

38
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,970
you'll have more than just opera.

39
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,090
You'll have me.

40
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:55,530
Dad,

41
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,090
see how nice he is to me?

42
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,640
I knew you love me the most.

43
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,160
I'm so lucky to have you.

44
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,920
I'll beat you up.

45
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,130
You told the teacher,
so you're getting a beating!

46
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,170
Next time I see you, I'll hit you again.

47
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,610
- Eat my punch!
- Let go!

48
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,570
What are you doing?

49
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,370
Grown-ups shouldn't
butt into kids' business.

50
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,370
If you keep this up,

51
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,570
I swear I'll call the cops.

52
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,610
You'll all get arrested.

53
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,250
Come on, let's go.

54
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,050
Are you okay?

55
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,370
I'm okay.

56
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,570
What's your name?

57
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,200
Tang Bei.

58
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,570
Tang Bei, don't be scared.

59
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,640
(Don't run away.)

60
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,010
(Running solves nothing.)

61
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,200
(You have to take the initiative)

62
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,440
(and keep it in your hands.)

(Qin Yuebai)

65
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,370
I still have a document to sign.

66
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,880
With this tension,

67
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,930
who'd go in there?

68
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,370
Exactly.

69
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,960
Where's Mr. Lu?

70
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,130
I haven't seen him today.

71
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,690
No clue what's going on.

72
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,170
I'll get it signed.

73
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,280
Ms. Qin,

74
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,370
that garden project of ours is sold.

75
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,400
The Feng Group bought it

76
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,280
for a client.

77
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,810
It was a huge deal.

78
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,570
Everyone is happy for you.

79
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,400
You could at least pretend.

80
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,930
Since you already know,

81
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,570
let's just drop the act.

82
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,400
What's the big deal?

83
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,320
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

84
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,010
- Hello.
- I've heard so much about you.

85
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,930
Please, sit.

86
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,520
You flatter me.

87
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,080
You all know I'm from Jiangnan.

88
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,690
I just bought a new estate recently.

89
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,960
The usual décor is just too plain.

90
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,690
You found the painting "Thunderstorm".

91
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,730
I was thrilled.

92
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,130
Ms. Qin,

93
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:02,170
I really appreciate this opportunity.

94
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,010
You're too kind, Mr. Zhou.

95
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,490
You're one of
the top collectors in the country.

96
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,880
Earning your trust

97
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,400
is truly an honor for our gallery.

98
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,170
Not at all.

99
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,320
Ms. Qin, we were introduced
by mutual friends.

100
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,010
Let's skip the pleasantries, shall we?

101
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,520
Sure.

102
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,640
I'll double-check with you again

103
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,610
to confirm the details.

104
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,880
How about that?

105
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,200
Ms. Qin, no need to explain more.

106
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,320
I leave it all to you.

107
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Alright then.

108
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,570
You trust me,

109
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,570
I'll make sure you're satisfied.

110
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,320
Great.

111
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,690
I'll wait for your contract, then.

112
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,610
Alright.

113
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,680
- Looking forward to working together.
- Looking forward to working together.

114
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,090
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

115
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:34,730
Bye-bye.

116
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,160
That's thirty-five total.

117
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,970
Alright.

118
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,760
It's paid.

119
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,560
Okay.

120
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,130
Everything went as you said.

121
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,090
It's all done.

122
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,090
Thank you.

123
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:19,640
One latte, please.

124
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:20,560
Alright.

125
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,560
I'm exhausted.

126
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,090
Guess who I just saw?

127
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,280
Don't bother me.

128
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,280
You can stop waiting.

129
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,880
She's busy making money.

130
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,490
She has no time for a scammer like you.

131
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,850
So, you saw her?

132
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,090
I just saw her.

133
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,560
She was with a guy
who's into collecting.

134
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,450
That guy said

135
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,490
he wanted to buy a painting
for his Jiangnan estate.

136
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:06,800
He was going all out to impress her.

137
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,210
He even said money wasn't a problem.

138
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,280
Get to the point.

139
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,130
Okay, the point is,

140
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,560
after Qin Yuebai left,

141
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,250
that guy talked
to the Su family's daughter.

142
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:17,970
What's her name?

143
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,800
Su Baoyan.

144
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,280
Right! He even

145
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,730
talked with Su Baoyan for a bit.

146
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:22,560
Are you sure?

147
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,730
Definitely.

148
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,640
I have a sharp eye

149
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,490
for pretty girls.

150
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,010
Where are you going?

151
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,450
I just got back!

152
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,090
Ms. Qin,

153
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,090
Mr. Zhou's contract has arrived.

154
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,010
Okay.

155
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,160
If the deposit clears,

156
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,970
they will wire the funds today.

157
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,280
Alright.

158
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,160
Yuebai.

159
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:04,400
Yuebai!

160
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,730
Wait a second!

161
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,210
I already told you,

162
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,280
you're not welcome here.

163
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,280
Sober.

164
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,920
Sober.

165
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,680
(Shilun Gallery closes
a billion-yuan deal.)

166
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,960

for an astronomical price.)

167

(This painting)

171
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,160
(is also one of Shilun Gallery's
most iconic pieces.)

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,920
Was Shilun Gallery's

173
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,730
recent sale of Thunderstorm
money laundering?

174
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,560
Ms. Qin,

175
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,330
has the gallery engaged
in money laundering?

176
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,490
Please answer our questions.

177
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:42,730
Ms. Qin, please respond.

178
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,680
Has the gallery laundered money
in the past?

179
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,490
Is it true?

180
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,680
You really gave the gallery a big gift,

181
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,360
Qin Yuebai.

182
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,680
Ms. Qin, were previous art sales
also used for laundering?

183
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,480
- Ms. Qin!
- Ms. Qin!

184
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,160
Was that action

185
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,970
- truly money laundering?
- Can you respond?

186
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,280
Would you take a moment
to answer our questions?

187
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,370
Is it actually true?

188
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,560
Ms. Qin!

189
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,400
Was there
any money laundering involved?

190
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,520
Can you respond?

191
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,330
Ms. Qin!

192
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
Thank you all

193
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,680
for your concern about Shilun Gallery.

194
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,370
The painting Thunderstorm
was never sold.

195
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,370
So there's no such thing
as money laundering.

196
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,880
I don't know who deliberately

197
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,730
started this rumor,

198
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,330
but it's slander against us.

199
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:19,040
The evidence

200
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,560
has already been compiled.

201
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,610
It'll be handed over
to the authorities right away.

202
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,730
I believe the truth will come out soon.

203
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,760
This is our lawyer.

204
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,610
If you have questions,
please speak with her.

205
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,570
There's work to be done,
so I'll be leaving now.

206
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,880
Ms. Qin, please don't go!

207
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,280
Excuse me!

208
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:33,970
Sorry, everyone.

209
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,130
You made a huge mistake.

210
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,970
And now you're covering it up.

211
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,760
What?

212
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:42,640
Trying to bribe your way out of this?

214
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,520
A word of advice.

215
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,610
Don't pop the champagne too early.

216
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,090
Ms. Qin, please explain!

217
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,250
Did you really commit a crime?

218
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,800
Ms. Qin, wait up!

219
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,130
Ms. Qin!

220
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:55,730
Wait!

221
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:29,330
Thanks for stepping in

222
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,920
just now.

223
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,760
If I was able to help you,

224
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,130
does that mean

225
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,400
we can keep working together?

226
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,040
When I pick a partner,

227
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:45,730
I don't look at skills

228
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,010
or reputation.

229
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,680
I value honesty.

230
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,880
I really wasn't lying to you.

231
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,370
One can't paint with panic disorder.

232
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,400
Besides,

233
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,610
I don't want people to know L is sick.

234
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,490
But even if L can't paint,

235
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,610
he doesn't need that assistant salary.

236
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,040
So why exactly

237
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,280
do you stay by my side?

238
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,680
Because we share the same goal.

239
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:19,760
The Su family?

240
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,730
I can't tell you everything yet,

241
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,370
but I can promise you

242
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,730
that from now on,

243
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,850
I won't lie to you again.

244
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,400
And...

245
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:33,920
I'll prove my new value to you.

246
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,010
Deal?

247
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,210
I'll wait and see.

00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,250
I left the gallery in your hands,

251
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,040
and this is how you handled things?

252
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,760
Father,

253
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,040
the misunderstanding
has been cleared up.

254
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,160
As for the backlash,

255
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,370
I'll contact a PR firm
to resolve it quickly.

256
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,560
The stock of Shilun Group took a dive.

257
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,040
Do you know how much wealth I've lost?

258
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,400
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,760
Do you think an apology fixes it?

260
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,520
Remember what you promised me?

261
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:56,920
(Hello, everyone.)

262
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,730

(you're more valuable than ever.)

268
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,330
Alright.

269
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,130
This matter

270
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,130
shall be put to rest for now.

271
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,330
Qin Yuebai,

272
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,920
don't think you're invincible.

273
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,330
You're still too young.

274
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,520
You lack experience.

275
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
From now on,

276
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,450
be more cautious in your work.

277
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,970
Got it. I'll work harder.

278
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,130
You'd better make me believe it. Go on.

are you okay?

acting too much on my own?

come in, I want to talk to you.

how serious this mistake is?

You haven't even married
into our family yet,

333
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,360
so don't meddle in our affairs.

334
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,410

and explain it to you.

00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,560
I demand an explanation!

351
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,760
I've never laid a hand on you.

352
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,520
I hoped that one day,

353
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,730
you could carry the entire Su Group
on your shoulders!

354
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,800
That I could hand over
the family business to you!

355
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,840
And you've let me down.

356

to do this behind my back.

357
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,360
Fine.

Starting now,

360
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,970
you'll stay home
and reflect on your actions

361
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,930

362
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,560

363
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,210
is good-for-nothing.

364
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,560

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,650
Sign here. And here too.

376
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,730
(Party B Signature)
All these need your signature.

377
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,260
(Party B Signature: Su Baoyan)

378
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,200
All signed.

379
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,120
Perfect. Here you go.

380
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:51,690
Give me the pen.

381
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,010
Alright.

382
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,520
I'm heading out.

383
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,730
Good girl.

384
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,040
(Tang Bei.)

385
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,040
(Why did you do it?)

386
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,010
Father.

387
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,970
The reporters already know

388
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,600
this has something to do with Su Baoyan.

389
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,410
However,

390
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,040
the news

391
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,210
has already been intercepted.

392
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,320
As you know,

393
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,410
the public outcry just died down.

394
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,010
If another scandal breaks out now,

395
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,520
it won't do the Su family's

396
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,360
reputation any good.

397
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,690
Let's get to the point.

398
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,250
What is it you really want?

399
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,360
I don't want anything.

400
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,880
I just hope

401
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,490
I won't have to keep cleaning up messes.

402
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,560
That's all?

403
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:57,690
Of course.

404
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,040
Father.

405
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,210
Do you really think

406
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,800
with Baoyan's personality,

407
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,800
she'd actually

408
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,560
sit quietly at home?

409
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,600
I think

410
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,490
it could backfire.

411
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,410
She might cause even more trouble.

412
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:18,490
And by then,

413
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,170
it'll just be more work for you.

414
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,010
Go on.

415
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,210
You know,

416
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,970
there are a lot of great

417
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,650
art schools abroad.

418
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,080
I know you want to protect her.

419
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,760
But sometimes,

420
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,170
letting go

421
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,800
might be the best form of protection.

422
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,800
We'll do as you say.

423
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,250
