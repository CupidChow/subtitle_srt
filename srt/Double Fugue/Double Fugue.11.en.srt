15
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,010
Why are you so late?

16
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,850
Did you see
how Su Shilun treated Su Baoyan?

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,600
Even his most beloved daughter...

18
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,770
I can't imagine what he'd do to us.

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,850
So...

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,370
You plotted all this?

21
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,440
Luckily,

22
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,690
someone out there

23
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,200
hates Su Baoyan more than we do.

24
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,600
It must be Qin Yuebai.

25
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,410
Don't tell me

26
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,570
you feel sorry for her.

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,040
Feel sorry?

28
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,200
What's that?

29
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,760
I feel sorry for you.

30
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:51,570
Find a day to return this to Baoyan.

31
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,760
Don't let Su Shilun see it.

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Do you care about her that much?

33
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,320
Why not return it yourself?

34
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,760
She threw this to me.

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,010
Tell me.

36
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:05,640
Should I keep it

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,570
or toss it?

38
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,200
Besides,

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,760
Su Baoyan

40
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,250
will still be useful to us someday.

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,010
If we return this to her,

42
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,370
won't she be even more devoted?

43
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,370
And that Qin Yuebai

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,010
will be trouble sooner or later.

45
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,810
Here's the info you asked for.

46
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,130
Having a famous artist like you

47
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,760
give advice

48
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
on my small exhibit

49
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:54,370
must be beneath you.

50
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:55,720
Not at all.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,130
I'm getting paid anyway.

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,040
You're okay

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,760
with playing assistant?

54
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,010
I can't paint anymore anyway.

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,850
Getting 6,000 yuan a month
is good enough for me.

56
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,520
Your advice is pretty good.

57
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,690
But

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,370
why adjust the lighting this way?

59
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,250
This painting

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,440
uses special
light and gradient techniques.

61
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,170
That's why I added a light in that spot

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,730
to better highlight the details.

83
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,520
By the way,

84
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
I have a question.

85
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,690
Compared to gallery shows,

86
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:01,010
this exhibition

87
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,320
is pretty small.

88
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,250
Why are you taking it so seriously?

89
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,760
It's small,

90
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,760
but

91
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,050
the participating artists

92
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,440
are young newcomers.

93
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,160
To them, this might be
their first chance to go commercial.

94
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,730
Of course I need to take it seriously.

95
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,280
If

96
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,010
I can help them take their first step,

97
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,810
it's more fulfilling
than any major exhibition

98
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:22,840
could ever be.

99
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,280
They're lucky

100
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,400
to meet you.

101
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:31,570
It's not luck they're relying on.

102
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,130
It's passion

103
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:34,960
and hard work.

104
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,610
What's wrong?

105
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,370
Nothing.

106
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,930
I just remembered

107
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,760
that I also wanted to be an artist
when I was little,

108
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,840
but I gave up.

109
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,130
If I can help them,

110
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,570
it's like fulfilling my dream.

111
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,170
Do you recognize this painting?

112
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Gauguin's painting?

113
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:17,730
What do you mean?

114
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,640
It's Gauguin's
Self Portrait Dedicated to Van Gogh

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,370
It means

116
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,400
some people may only talk about profit,

117
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,280
but their actions

118
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,370
are as if reaching for the moon.

119
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:42,222
(Artist Mi Luo, Emerging Artist,
Winner of W Art Competition)

120
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,160
Ms. Qin.

121
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,840
Are you discriminating against Mi Luo,
who's from a poor background?

122
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,240
Is this exhibition just a way
to curry favor with the powerful?

123
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,040
It's simply an internal decision.
Please focus more on the exhibition.

124
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,130
Please answer our questions.

125
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,080
That's all for now.

126
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,730
- Ms. Qin!
- Ms. Qin!

127
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,210
It's already trending?

128
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,400
Someone must've hired bots.

129
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,350
Contact the public relations firm
we've worked with

130
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,550
to suppress the public opinion.

131
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,920
Don't let it affect the exhibition.

132
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,119
Okay.

133
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,840
Also, contact the other artists.
Tell them not to believe the rumors.

134
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,120
- Keep preparing as usual.
- Okay.

135
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,730
Aren't you going to explain?

136
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,160
Explain what?

137
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,970
This is obviously slander.

138
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,130
The best way to handle rumors
is to clarify,

139
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,130
not to delete posts.

140
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,250
Also,

141
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,730
what's with Mi Luo?

142
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,130
Don't worry about it.

143
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,520
Don't worry about it?

144
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,970
What about the exhibition then?

145
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,970
I'll figure it out.

146
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,160
But...

147
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,600
I told you.

148
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,880
This has nothing to do with you!

149
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:07,920
Got it.

150
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,880
Help me look into Mi Luo.

151
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,080
Preferably meet him in person.

152
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,330
Is Yuebai really suppressing Mi Luo
through the exhibition?

153
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,250
What do you think?

154
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,330
Is Yue Bai like that? You idiot.

155
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,510
(Xinjiang Bridge)

156
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,280
Hello?

157
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:45,040
Are you Mi Luo?

158
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,610
I'm from Shilun Gallery.

159
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:49,760
My name is Lu Li.

160
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,970
What's up?

161
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,970
I'll be direct.

162
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,970
I don't know why you suddenly withdrew
from the exhibition,

163
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,330
but Yuebai is being cursed and attacked

164
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,240
by everyone right now.

165
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,730
I want to know why.

166
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:05,800
This is between Ms. Qin and me.

167
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,560
Why should I tell you?

168
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,040
Because she may endure it all

169
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,760
like a fool,

170
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
but I have to protect her.

171
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,680
I was the one who asked Ms. Qin

172
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,330
to withdraw my qualification.

173
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,920
I signed up

174
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,850
because I wanted to gain recognition.

175
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,610
But when the exhibition
was nearly ready,

176
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,520
I backed out.

177
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,450
I was afraid of being watched

178
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,640
and being scrutinized.

179
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,210
I'm just not ready.

180
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:44,250
Is it because

181
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:46,760
of depression?

182
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,920
Ms. Qin didn't blame me at all.

183
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,520
She even said she'd give me time.

184
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,730
We'll have another chance

185
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,010
to work together when I recover.

186
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,760
I'm really grateful to her.

187
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,610
I just didn't expect the gallery

188
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,720
to be caught in such news.

189
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,730
I caused Ms. Qin and the gallery

190
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,130
a lot of trouble.

191
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,250
I'm truly sorry.

192
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,520
You must have also faced

193
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,560
a lot of public pressure.

194
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,130
Since Yuebai chose to protect you,

195
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,450
she must have had her reasons.

196
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,400
Just focus on your art.

197
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,760
When your mind is a mess,

198
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,010
your lines will be too.

199
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,520
I'll go now.

200
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,370
Wait.

201
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,370
So that's the current situation.

202
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:48,760
Is there any other way to resolve it?

203
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,250
Not at the moment.

204
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,760
Alright, got it.

205
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,760
Ms. Qin, Mi Luo just posted on Weibo.

206
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,200
(I withdrew from the exhibition)

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,440
(because of personal reasons.)

208
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,520
(I didn't expect it
to cause such a misunderstanding.)

209
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,210
(I'm very sorry.)

210
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,330
How is Mi Luo?

211
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,730
Don't worry.

212
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:29,130
I didn't threaten or coerce him.

213
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,560
He just couldn't stand seeing

214
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,040
you getting attacked by public opinion

215
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,120
and came forward himself.

216
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,610
Is it that simple?

217
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,210
I sacrificed

218
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,850
a tiny bit of my privacy

219
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,450
and gained a follower.

220
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,520
I have to thank you again.

221
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,210
I thought

222
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,450
I pissed you off.

223
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,640
At least you know you're annoying.

224
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,250
If I didn't understand you so well,

225
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,880
how could I be your brilliant assistant?

226
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,640
Actually,

227
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,730
it's not like

228
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:14,160
I'm being a saint

229
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,370
for no reason.

230
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,450
I just know how miserable
this illness is.

231
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,280
The more miserable it is,

232
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,800
the less you want others to know.

233
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:28,490
My mom

234
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,850
was like him too.

235
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,450
We can't change the past,

236
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,850
but Mi Luo will get through this.

237
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,800
We'll help him together.

238
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,370
How did this thing

239
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,040
suddenly end up trending?

240
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,170
Did you look into it?

241
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,170
Yes.

242
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
It's just as I thought.

243
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,450
Some people

244
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:12,650
are restless even when they're grounded.

245
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,840
So what are you going to do?

246
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,800
Fight back?

247
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,240
It's no use fighting

248
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,450
a public opinion war with her.

249
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,170
I'm planning

250
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,890
to use this incident

251
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,930
to get something I want.

252
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,930
What do you want?

253
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,840
Peace.

254
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,650
You're here.

255
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,320
Come on over.

256
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,450
You're in a good mood.

257
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,800
Of course.

258
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,520
Today's a good day.

259
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,450
That was a clever move.

260
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,120
Getting Qin Yuebai
to drive Su Baoyan away.

261
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,560
Things are finally calm.

262
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,520
I thought you wavered.

263
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I didn't expect

264
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:14,930
such a pleasant surprise.

265
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,560
You're not here to see her off, are you?

266
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,970
How could I be?

267
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,730
I'm here

268
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,210
to have a drink with you.

269
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,320
Miss, you're back.

270
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,930
Dad, can I not go?

271
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,890
No.

272
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,930
Yes.

273
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:53,930
Sober.

274
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,520
Sober, come up here.

275
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,560
Sober, do you hear me?

276
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,600
Come up here!

277
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,320
Come on up!

278
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Sober, come here.

279
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,320
Sober.

280
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,560
Come here, Sober!

281
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:21,520
Give me my dog back!

282
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,010
Sober, come here.

283
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:27,650
Sober.

284
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:28,410
Sober, come here.

285
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,800
Sober, come here.

286
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,600
Come here, Sober.

287
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,040
Maybe

288
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,010
you shouldn't take the dog overseas.

289
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,730
Air cargo isn't that safe.

290
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,840
I knew it.

291
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,210
You're just trying to steal my dog.

292
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,320
Give me. Dream on.

293
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,930
How annoying.
Don't go looking for her again, got it?

294
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,250
Miss Su, it's time.

295
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,650
Su Baoyan has left.

296
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
It'll be even harder
for us to meet from now on.

297
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:09,520
We need to be extra careful.

298
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,930
Got it.

299
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,040
There's Qin Yuebai left.

300
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:22,930
What do we do about her?

301
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,890
I have a feeling this Qin Yuebai

302
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:31,800
is more troublesome than Su Baoyan.

303
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,760
Obviously.

304
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,840
And Qin Yuebai has Lu Li by her side.

305
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,040
I might have a way

306
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,600
to deal with Lu Li.

307
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,800
Let's hear it.

308
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:51,650
Wait for my good news.

309
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,320
With the typhoon,

310
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,760
the rice fields were all flattened.

311
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
A year of hard work

312
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,410
has gone to waste.

313
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,320
Who are you?

314
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,690
My last name is Hu.

315
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,040
My family's in the rice business.

316
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,170
I'm here to purchase rice.

317
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,450
I heard from a Mr. Lin
in the next village

318
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,450
that the best rice is grown here.

319
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:17,970
What a pity.

320
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,320
No matter how good it is,
it's all destroyed.

321
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:25,010
I'm suffering a huge loss this year.

322
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:28,650
Sir.

323
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,930
It's indeed unfortunate to lose money.

324
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,650
But

325
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,560
life isn't only about money.

326
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,170
Look.

327
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,760
How all the rice stalks are blown down

328
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,010
looks quite beautiful.

329
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,040
I don't know if I'm seeing things,

330
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,600
but the more I look at them,

331
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,680
the more they remind me

332
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,550
of that Van Gogh painting
called Wheat Fields.

333
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,600
Yes, Wheat Fields.

334
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,170
How beautiful.

335
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,730
You know art?

336
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,650
A little.

337
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:56,120
I think

338
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,320
there are
only two things I love in life.

339
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:58,930
One,

340
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,650
rice.

341
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,760
It satisfies my material needs.

342
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:03,730
And the other,

343
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,560
oil paintings.

344
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,320
They enrich my soul.

345
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,560
Sorry,

346
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,400
I was a bit abrupt earlier.

347
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,520
Since there's no rice here,

348
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,450
I'll be on my way.

349
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,320
Hold on.

350
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,600
What did you say

351
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,890
my field looked like?

352
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,250
Van Gogh's Wheat Fields.

353
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,650
You know your stuff.

354
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,930
I planted it to look like that!

355
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
Mr. Hu, right?

356
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,410
Mr. Hu!

357
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,320
I've been farming this land for years.

358
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,650
I never expected

359
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,120
to meet a kindred spirit.

360
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,970
I...

361
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,800
Say no more.

362
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,320
Let's go. I'll show you around.

363
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,450
Let's go. Come on.

364
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,450
I'll show you around.

365
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,560
Bro, you've had too much to drink.

366
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:54,250
This is nothing.

367
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:55,840
Come on, drink!

368
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,210
No, bro.

369
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,650
You're my big brother.

370
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,170
Right? I think

371
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,170
I've got to toast you

372
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:12,970
for your pursuit

373
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:14,450
and love of art.

374
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,600
Here. Cheers to art.

375
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:16,800
Come on.

376
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,760
You're too kind.

377
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,730
Those paintings and works

378
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,600
we talked about earlier

379
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,930
really touched me deeply.

380
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,800
Of course.

381
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,840
I absolutely love those art pieces.

382
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,320
But you know

383
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:40,560
I'm just a humble rice merchant.

384
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,360
I've seen very few

385
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,890
original masterpieces.

386
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,040
I'm not like you.

387
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,170
What's a masterpiece?

388
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,800
What's a masterpiece?

389
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,520
You know L, right?

390
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,650
I have

391
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,970
all his originals.

392
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,360
Bro.

393
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,210
That's hard

394
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:08,320
to believe.

395
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,170
It sounds a bit exaggerated.

396
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,320
Everyone knows L.

397
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,930
Such a mysterious artist.

398
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:13,600
This year,

399
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,360
only one painting

400
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,280
was shown publicly.

401
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:18,520
Bellflower.

402
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,170
- You don't buy it?
- I don't buy it.

403
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,170
Look.

404
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:40,650
This...

405
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,170
This really is an original by L.
