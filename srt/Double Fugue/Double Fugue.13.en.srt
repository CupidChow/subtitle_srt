by romance.

192
00:14:59,130 --> 00:14:59,970
How about

193
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,490
we invite both of them over this weekend

194
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,920
and ask them face to face?

195
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,730
This concerns the company.

196
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,680
We can't be careless.

197
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
You can arrange it.

198
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,610
How did it go?

199
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,160
Right after the statement was released,

200
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,880
Su Shilun eagerly

201
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,970
message me.

202
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,920
He wants us to go back this weekend

203
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,330
for a family dinner.

204
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,010
Let me see.

205
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,610
This isn't a family dinner.

206
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,280
This is clearly a trap!

207
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,090
Are we going?

208
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,130
Of course.

209
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,680
Of course we're going.

210
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,330
The stage is ready.

211
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,610
It'd be a shame not to go.

212
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,210
I'll get changed then.

213
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,160
Ms. Qin,

214
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:48,970
you're here.

215
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,970
You two are finally here.

216
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,330
Your father talks about you daily.

217
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,560
What's the meaning of this?

218
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,520
Did I do something wrong?

219
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,890
Well played.

220
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,730
You used others to do your dirty work.

221
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:32,410
Using others

222
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:33,560
to do my dirty work?

223
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,520
You gave me Su Baoyan's weakness

224
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,760
and made her leave the country

225
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,930
without blood spilled.

226
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,120
You're really good.

227
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,210
Look at you.

228
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,210
Spending too much time with artists

229
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,930
makes your imagination wild.

230
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,520
The one who embezzled

231
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,120
wasn't her.

232
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,410
It was you.

233
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,210
Aren't you afraid I'll tell Su Shilun?

234
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,690
Try me.

235
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,760
You're all here.

236
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,890
Let's reintroduce ourselves.

237
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,410
Mr. L.

238
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,320
Pleasure to meet you.

239
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,930
Mr. Su.

240
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,080
It's my pleasure.

241
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,210
It's mine.

242
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,120
Please sit.

243
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,690
Father.

244
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,210
Here's the thing.

245
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,320
We invited you today

246
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,930
mainly to ask one thing.

247
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,210
Lu Li.

248
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,520
What exactly happened to you?

249
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,730
How come you can't paint anymore

250
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,970
at such a young age?

251
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,010
Isn't that

252
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,120
unfair to Yuebai?

253
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:15,690
Only the people in the family

254
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,930
know what it's really like.

255
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,690
Yuebai.

256
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
Listen to your tone.

257
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:22,280
Forget it.

258
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,800
It's a good thing

259
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,890
that they get along.

260
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:31,970
Lu Li.

261
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,170
Following up on Yayin's question.

262
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,560
I'm curious too.

263
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,890
Your hands seem fine.

264
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,890
Why can't you paint anymore?

265
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,730
Father.

266
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,970
The statement says it clearly.

267
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:47,690
If you didn't understand it,

268
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,490
I'll read it to you again.

269
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,760
Yuebai.

270
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,760
That's no way to speak to your dad.

271
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,170
He's just concerned about you two.

272
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,210
If there's any problem,

273
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,450
just tell us.

274
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:00,690
We're a family.

275
00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:02,010
We can face it together.

276
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:07,320
Anyway,

277
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,760
renewing the contract with Mr. Zhu

278
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
is crucial to our company.

279
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,800
If you can't close the deal,

280
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,010
don't bother with the gallery.

281
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,490
Father.

282
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,120
Let's make a bet.

283
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,890
If I fail,

284
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:23,490
I'll leave the gallery.

285
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
If I succeed...

286
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,890
What do you want?

287
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:30,120
I want a seat on the board.

288
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,010
Deal.

289
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Deal.

290
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:49,690
Enough about work.

291
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:51,360
The food's getting cold.

292
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,600
Shall we eat first?

293
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,520
Are you not mad?

294
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,600
No.

295
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,210
Thank you

296
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,010
for siding with me.

297
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,970
I wasn't siding with you.

298
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,600
I was siding

299
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,120
with profits.

300
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,320
Profits?

301
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,690
What's the next step then?

302
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,520
No idea.

303
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,760
Can't I not have a plan?

304
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,080
We'll cross that bridge
when we get there.

305
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,730
We'll cross that bridge
when we get there?

306
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,040
Ms. Qin.

307
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,490
Busy?

308
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,930
I was nearby for a business deal,

309
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,170
so I stopped by.

310
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,930
So many proposals?

311
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,280
Yeah.

312
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,930
There's more than one way
to do business.

313
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:08,410
As long as the price is right,
everything is negotiable.

314
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,890
At the end of the day,
it's all because of Lu Li's illness.

315
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,170
If it weren't for him,

316
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,410
you wouldn't have to work so hard,
right?

317
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,120
Here.

318
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,490
Don't tell Lu Li

319
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:19,600
about any of this.

320
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:21,280
Why not?

321
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,120
I don't want to pressure him.

322
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,490
I want him to take it slow.

323
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,010
Is there anything else you need?

324
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,320
Carry on.

325
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,690
I'm off.

326
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,450
I'm off.

327
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,890
Thanks.

328
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:40,460
(Mr. Zhu)

329
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,210
Hello, Mr. Zhu?

330
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,360
Ms. Qin.

331
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,170
Were you scaring me on purpose?

332
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,410
It's really not cool.

333
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,650
But

334
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,930
it's a clever move.

335
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,280
We've got to renew the contract.

336
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,690
What?

337
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,320
Still pretending?

338
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,210
Isn't Lu Li

339
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,690
painting by the riverside?

340
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,730
It's

341
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,280
already topping the trending rankings.

342
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:22,547
(Wang Jiye)

343
00:24:26,335 --> 00:24:27,447
(Wang Jiye)

344
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,080
Hello?

345
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,650
Hello, Jiye?

346
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,490
I'm heading to the riverside.

347
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,010
Do you know Lu Li's exact location?

348
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:33,930
I know.

349
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,320
He's under the bridge
by the river at the Old Bund.

350
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,120
Okay, send it to me.

351
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,120
