1
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,560
I, Shen Lang,

2
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,760
am willing to give up my martial arts today.

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,440
I apologize to Master Li.

4
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,120
No!

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,040
Shen Lang!

6
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,760
Brother Shen!

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,080
Shen Lang!

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,680
Brother Lianhua.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,060
Your mother's debt

10
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,840
will be repaid today.

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,080
Why go to such lengths?

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,330
Master Leng.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,280
My revenge is complete.

14
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,880
Our grievances are settled.

15
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,680
Can you let us go now?

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:16,960
Shen Lang,

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,080
do you think by giving up your martial arts

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,640
you can take Bai Feifei away?

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,039
Bai Feifei cannot leave.

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,080
Feifei!

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,009
Take Brother Shen away.

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:44,880
Let's go.

23
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Anyone who stands in my way will die.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Brother Shen.

25
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,000
If you want to die,

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,280
you can only die by my hand.

27
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,840
Everyone here,

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,280
if anyone dares to make a move,

29
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,000
I, Zhu Qiqi, swear here and now,

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,039
with all the resources of my Fugui Manor

31
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,759
and my vast fortune,

32
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,520
I will hunt you to the ends of the earth.

33
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,380
There will be no rest until death.

34
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,210
I didn't kill Li Changqing.

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,680
I know.

36
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,560
Then what do I owe him?

37
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,210
That makes you give up your martial arts to apologize for me?

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
You think by doing this,

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,130
I would forgive you?

40
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,600
Whether you forgive me or not doesn't matter.

41
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,329
I just don't want anything to happen to you again.

42
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,400
Do you realize

43
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,320
that doing this

44
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,600
could cost you your life?

45
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,160
My life

46
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,720
has always belonged to you.

47
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,400
Ten years ago, Chai Yuguan forced me to kill your mother.

48
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,960
I didn't do it myself.

49
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,490
Your mother grabbed my hand

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,079
and drove the dagger into her own chest.

51
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,120
Before she died, she told me 'a life for a life.'

52
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,079
Master.

53
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,120
Child.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,520
A life for a life.

55
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,420
Your father's life

56
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,079
I return to you.

57
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Take good care of my daughter.

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
My mother.

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,290
Why are you only telling me now?

60
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
There was no news about Chai Yuguan at that time.

61
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,440
The Pleasure King was gaining fame beyond the border.

62
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,970
I thought

63
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,880
rather than letting you recklessly seek revenge against him,

64
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,880
it was better for you to hate me more.

65
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,620
I know this approach was foolish,

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,080
but it was the only way

67
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,480
I could think of to protect you.

68
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,360
Protect?

69
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,640
You all claim you want to protect me,

70
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,800
but none of you consider your own lives.

71
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Have you ever thought

72
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,480
if I'm left alone in this world,

73
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,600
what meaning would my life have?

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,840
Feifei.

75
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,020
Don't touch me.

76
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
How could it be meaningless?

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,480
If you're willing to remain my wife,

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,880
how could I die so easily?

79
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,410
How could I leave you to live alone?

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,320
People say

81
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,480
when a woman truly falls in love,

82
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,010
she always acts foolishly.

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,860
Little do they know men are just the same.

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Feifei,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
during the time you were away from me,

86
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,840
I felt life had no meaning

87
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,000
and no flavor.

88
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
Feifei.

89
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,800
My wife.

90
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,040
Don't keep pushing me away anymore,

91
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
will you?

92
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,960
I've been desperate to see

93
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,640
what kind of person our child would be.

94
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,720
I've been thinking about it like crazy,

95
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,760
almost to death.

96
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,000
The most righteous and chivalrous man

97
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,060
with the highest wisdom in the world.

98
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,720
And the most evil and vicious woman

99
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
who is also the wisest in this world.

100
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,600
The child born to them,

101
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,409
what would they be like?

102
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
Without doubt,

103
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,960
they would be the smartest person in the world.

104
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,600
Would it be a boy or a girl?

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,920
Would they be righteous or evil?

106
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Would they inherit their father's kindness?

107
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,920
Or their mother's wickedness?

108
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,960
No matter what,

109
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,240
we would certainly love them very much.

110
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,520
Why don't you name our child?

111
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
Shen Fei.

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,000
Shen Fei.

113
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,900
Then we can call him A-Fei.

114
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
A-Fei.

115
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,560
That works.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,000
So,

117
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,680
when will we be able to see him?

118
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,760
I want to see him right now.

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
As you commanded.

120
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,210
The body double is dead.

121
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,440
From now on,

122
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,320
there is no more Chai Yuguan in Zhongzhou.

123
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,960
Only the Merry King.

124
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,400
You truly are my good son.

125
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,760
Well done.

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
Rest assured.

127
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,420
I've taken control of Zhongzhou.

128
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,580
Don't rush.

129
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,200
The most important thing now

130
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,360
is to get the Invincible Mirror

131
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,560
from my dear daughter.

132
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,000
Shen Lang's martial arts have been destroyed.

133
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,800
You've avenged your mother.

134
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,060
Why are you still coming here?

135
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,320
Liuhe Powder.

136
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,440
It helps martial artists restore their meridians.

137
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,700
Many have offered fortunes for me to make it, but I refused.

138
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,490
If you don't take it,

139
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,960
I'll take it back.

140
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:39,920
Thank you.

141
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,660
Don't be quick to thank me.

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
I have conditions.

143
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,160
What conditions?

144
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,610
That Chai Yuguan at Renyi Manor

145
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,760
is fake.

146
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,240
I know.

147
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,000
You know,

148
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,840
and Shen Lang knows even better.

149
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,680
You insisted on killing that body double.

150
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,280
Though Shen Lang had doubts,

151
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,680
he pretended to know nothing.

152
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,760
Both of you

153
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,240
are just deceiving yourselves.

154
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,760
If you truly want to

155
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,130
start a new life in this courtyard,

156
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,700
I'm willing to find my own way to kill him.

157
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,960
Consider it fulfilling

158
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
our brother-sister bond.

159
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Do you know where Chai Yuguan is now?

160
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,960
Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger told me

161
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,810
the true Merry King's location before they died.

162
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,800
But a hunter

163
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,040
needs to lure the prey into a trap

164
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
to make the kill easier,

165
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
isn't that right?

166
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,840
Stop being mysterious.

167
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,900
Beware of my Wandering Soul Needles.

168
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,520
Ten years ago,

169
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,120
though Chai Yuguan obtained the hundred schools' manuals,

170
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,880
there was one

171
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
he never got.

172
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,520
You

173
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,920
want the Invincible Mirror.

174
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,800
I've arranged to meet him

175
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,160
at Yuebin Tower in three days at noon.

176
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,960
I'll poison him during the meal.

177
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,600
As for you,

178
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,920
whether to wait in ambush outside

179
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,960
is your choice.

180
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,200
Chai Yuguan is naturally suspicious.

181
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
How would he agree

182
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,160
to dine with you?

183
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,760
Because

184
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,680
I've acknowledged him as my son.

185
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,880
A son welcoming his father

186
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,520
is filial piety,

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,440
perfectly natural.

188
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,920
You really have no shame.

189
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,220
Shen Lang has dignity,

190
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,460
but now his martial arts are gone.

191
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,280
He carries too many burdens.

192
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,640
Sometimes

193
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,520
I wish he could learn from you.

194
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,640
He can't learn it,

195
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,370
and I can't teach it.

196
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,330
I'm warning you,

197
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,820
stay away from him.

198
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
Don't worry.

199
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,040
After Shen Tianjun died,

200
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,240
he never practiced

201
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,900
his family's ultimate skill,

202
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,090
the Three Heavenly Extinction Moves.

203
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,520
Having lost all his power and starting anew

204
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,240
with Pure Yang inner strength

205
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,240
combined with the most powerful techniques.

206
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,120
For him,

207
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,100
isn't this actually a blessing in disguise?

208
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,560
I know what to do now.

209
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,520
Feifei!

210
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,040
Feifei!

211
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,320
What's wrong, Shen?

212
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,520
I thought

213
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,040
you had left after all.

214
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,840
I promised you

215
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,300
I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye again.

216
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,400
Come.

217
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,640
From now on,

218
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,960
I won't be the master of Ghost Palace,

219
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,890
and you won't be the hero Shen Lang.

220
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,840
We'll settle down here

221
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,720
and live in anonymity.

222
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,840
We'll turn this

223
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,360
and that

224
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,180
into everything we've imagined.

225
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,770
Alright.

226
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,160
But before that,

227
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,130
I need to return to Ghost Palace once more.

228
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,040
Because those who follow Ghost Palace

229
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,900
mostly have tragic backgrounds.

230
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,330
I need to go back and settle them first.

231
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Let me go with you.

232
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,260
You have something more important to do,

233
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,680
which is to heal your wounds.

234
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,720
This

235
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,920
is medicine to restore your meridians.

236
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,960
You need to practice diligently

237
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,760
so that

238
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,480
you can protect me in the future.

239
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,120
Actually, whether I recover or not isn't important.

240
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:47,560
But

241
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
I'll do as you say.

242
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,370
It's perfect timing. I need some rest too.

243
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:54,520
During this time,

244
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,360
I'll repair this roof.

245
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,160
I also need to buy some poultry

246
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,760
and pick out two good horses.

247
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,520
There's a lake nearby

248
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
where I can go fishing.

249
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,420
But most importantly,

250
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,640
on this roof,

251
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,980
I need to cover it with windmills.

252
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,440
Once all this is done,

253
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,740
ten days should be enough, right?

254
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,000
By then,

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,660
you should be back too, right?

256
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,120
I will.

257
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,560
Good.

258
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,560
I'll wait for you.
