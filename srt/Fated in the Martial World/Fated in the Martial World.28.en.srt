1
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,760
You haven't fully recovered from your injuries.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,080
Why are you in such a hurry to come to Yunmeng Manor?

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,600
Uncle Wujiu, don't worry.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,060
These minor wounds are nothing serious.

5
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,250
I've been waiting for you for quite some time.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:37,920
The one you've been waiting for

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,320
is probably not me, is it?

8
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,840
I've been waiting for the Invincible Treasure

9
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,900
and for you as well.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,650
This Invincible Treasure,

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,760
is it real?

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,600
You can choose not to take it.

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,560
So it really is the Invincible Treasure.

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,160
But I've always wondered

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
why you don't practice it yourself.

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,120
You've clearly seen

17
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,200
what happened to Tie Huahe.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
I know what I'm doing.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,400
Have you arranged

20
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,000
the matter I asked you about?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,060
The banquet at Yuebin Tower is ready.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:39,000
That old fool Chai Yuguan

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,009
will definitely come for this.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,039
See you then.

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Congratulations, young master,

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,240
on obtaining this manual.

27
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,600
The Invincible Manual?

28
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,880
I have my own plans for it.

29
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,850
Wang Lianhua has hundreds of schemes in mind.

30
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,410
I don't know if what he says is true.

31
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,680
This journey

32
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:01,300
will certainly be extremely dangerous.

33
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,480
Chai Yuguan is treacherous and cunning.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,240
This time

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
is our rare opportunity.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,560
This time,

37
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,320
we must completely eliminate Chai Yuguan.

38
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,680
After killing Chai Yuguan today,

39
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,560
our vengeance will be complete.

40
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,360
That's right.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,980
We've been lying low for ten years

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,200
just for this moment.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,120
Uncle Wujiu,

44
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,810
all these years,

45
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,880
thanks for taking care of me.

46
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,040
You are family to me.

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,600
When all this is over,

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
you can live any life you want.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,200
The life I want

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
is simply

51
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,660
to see you live like an ordinary woman

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,620
no longer involved in the martial world.

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,560
All right.

54
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,640
The young master has been gone for so long.

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,900
Why is there still no signal from inside?

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,930
I'll go check it out.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,040
Be careful.

58
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,480
With your lightness skills, Uncle Wujiu,

59
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,940
don't you trust yourself?

60
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,560
Uncle Wujiu.

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,440
Uncle Wujiu.

62
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,000
Run!

63
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,620
It's Wang Lianhua's trap.

64
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,240
Go now!

65
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,050
If we leave, we leave together.

66
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,720
Chai Yuguan.

67
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,640
Don't take the words of jianghu people seriously.

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,100
Don't trust the promises of jianghu people.

69
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,720
Be careful.

70
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,460
Congratulations, young master.

71
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
This journey

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,460
will surely be extremely dangerous.

73
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,010
The life I've dreamed of

74
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,120
is simply

75
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,770
seeing you live like an ordinary woman

76
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,380
no longer involved in the martial world.

77
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,280
Uncle Wujiu.

78
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,400
Uncle Wujiu.

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,080
Uncle Wujiu.

80
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
Uncle Wujiu.

81
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Uncle Wujiu.

82
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,920
Uncle Wujiu.

83
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
Uncle Wujiu.

84
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,960
Sister.

85
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,170
Hurry and greet Father.

86
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
Father.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,680
You look just like your mother.

88
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
You don't deserve to mention my mother.

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
How could that be?

90
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,440
Your mother was once my most beloved companion.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,480
But now my daughter wants to kill me.

92
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,760
This truly breaks my heart.

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,840
Nevertheless,

94
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,160
I still must thank you.

95
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,040
Thank you for finding the Invincible Mirror for me.

96
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,720
Wang Lianhua.

97
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,520
My daughter has impressive skills.

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
My son has unmatched intelligence.

99
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,280
Truly worthy of being Chai Yuguan's children.

100
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,760
As for the Invincible Mirror,

101
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,760
I'll gladly accept it.

102
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,320
As a greeting gift,

103
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Upon my return,

104
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,000
I've brought many treasures from beyond the border.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,880
They've all been sent to Yunmeng Manor.

106
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,980
We're all family here.

107
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,360
Rest assured.

108
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,520
The troops I've brought,

109
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,400
the wealth,

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,640
the martial arts manuals,

111
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,760
along with the Invincible Mirror,

112
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,520
are enough for us father and son to rule Zhongzhou.

113
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,320
Good.

114
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,560
You two siblings chat first.

115
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,480
I'll take my leave now.

116
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,460
Farewell, Father.

117
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,380
It's just the death of someone unimportant.

118
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,240
Why are you so angry about it?

119
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
You recognize a thief as your father.

120
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,320
You're worse than an animal.

121
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,120
If I didn't do this,

122
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,560
how could I gain Chai Yuguan's trust?

123
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,650
Do you really think he's so easily fooled?

124
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
Our subordinates are merely pawns.

125
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,400
Some people have to die.

126
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,560
But Fan Wujiu was different.

127
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,000
What's the difference?

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He is my family.

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
I am your real family.

130
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,320
I will use this assassination

131
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,240
to completely gain Chai Yuguan's trust.

132
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,600
I'll use him to reach the position of martial arts leader.

133
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll kill him the moment we reach the top.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Only then

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,080
will my mother's spirit

136
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,240
finally see.

137
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,400
What even Chai Yuguan couldn't accomplish back then,

138
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,440
I will achieve.

139
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
I

140
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,960
won't let her down.

141
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
As long as I achieve my goal,

142
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,880
whoever dies,

143
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,840
I don't care.

144
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,560
Helping me

145
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,920
is your only choice.

146
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,960
You calculated correctly.

147
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,920
You knew I wouldn't let Fan Wujiu die in vain.

148
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,200
Fine.

149
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,600
I'll help you.

150
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
Sister.

151
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,360
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,920
Let's go home.

153
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,240
Brother Shen

154
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,360
is really here.

155
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,490
The news from Yunmeng Manor

156
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,740
should be correct.

157
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,770
Alright.

158
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,040
I'll go by myself.

159
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,900
You can go back.

160
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,600
That day at Renyi Manor.

161
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,000
I...

162
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,720
I suddenly learned that

163
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,360
the old manor lord died because of Bai Feifei.

164
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,620
I acted foolishly in a moment of impulse.

165
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,680
Miss Qiqi,

166
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,960
do you still blame me?

167
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
Of course I blame you.

168
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,080
But today,

169
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,400
you're putting the greater good first.

170
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,780
I do have some admiration for you.

171
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,760
Miss Qiqi now

172
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,410
has also earned my respect.

173
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,280
Shen.

174
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,160
Master Shen.

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,960
Qiqi, Uncle Leng.

176
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,280
What brings you here for tea?

177
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,090
Master Shen, something terrible has happened outside.

178
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,960
I've lost all my martial arts skills now.

179
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,720
I just want to retire to the mountains.

180
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,180
These jianghu matters...

181
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Why not leave them for you jianghu people to solve?

182
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,280
Shen.

183
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,640
The Pleasure King has entered the pass.

184
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
The Ghost Palace envoy Fan Wujiu has been killed.

185
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,600
Feifei has...

186
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,520
been taken away by Wang Lianhua.

187
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:58,860
Say that again.

188
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,520
What happened to Feifei?

189
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,050
The Chai Yuguan we captured earlier was fake.

190
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,560
Wang Lianhua is working with the real Chai Yuguan.

191
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,240
Ranxiang.

192
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,080
Young master.

193
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,480
They're gone.

194
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
All gone.

195
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
Yunmeng Manor...

196
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,440
all the disciples...

197
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,560
they've all...

198
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,840
perished.

199
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,720
Who?

200
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Who did this?

201
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,240
It's...

202
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,320
Chai...

203
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,960
Yu...

204
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,610
Did you hear about Chai Yuguan?

205
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,480
Chai Yuguan.

206
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Ranxiang.

207
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
Let's go quickly.

208
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,080
That's Chai Yuguan we're talking about.

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,740
We can't afford to offend him.

210
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
Let's go quickly.

211
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
How could it be...

212
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,330
how could it possibly be...

213
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,240
Chai Yuguan?

214
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,400
Chai Yuguan.
