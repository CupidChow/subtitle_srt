1
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,920
Stop!

2
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,320
You like taking advantage of women, huh?

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,120
I'll give you all you can handle.

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,840
The Qinyang Ghost Cave Sect

5
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,160
is just trash bullying women in public.

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,600
Don't be afraid.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,400
I'll help you.

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
Run!

9
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,080
You look smart

10
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,680
but why are you so foolish?

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,010
When someone takes advantage of you, you should fight back.

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,920
What's wrong with you, girl?

13
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
I just saved you

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:28,680
and you just walk away

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,280
without even saying thanks.

16
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,080
If you're unkind, I still can't be disloyal to you.

17
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,479
As your savior,

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,680
I must make sure you remember me.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,039
My name is Zhu Qiqi.

20
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,570
You can call me Sister Qiqi.

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
And you?

22
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,960
I should at least know who I saved.

23
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,720
I, Feifei, thank you for saving my life.

24
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,560
We'll meet again if fate allows.

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,840
Isn't today quite a fateful encounter?

26
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,520
I came to the flower market to look for someone.

27
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,720
He's the greatest hero in the martial arts world.

28
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,880
I see you're all alone.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,600
Why don't you come with me?

30
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,060
I'll introduce him to you.

31
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,280
No need.

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,260
Don't be so polite.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
The person I want to introduce you to

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,960
is a top figure in the martial arts world.

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,400
He's the number one hero in the martial arts world.

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,400
You must meet him.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
Recently, he got into a lot of trouble

38
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
because of a female disciple from Renyi Manor.

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,200
Shen,

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,770
you were so hard to find.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Qiqi.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
The people from Renyi Manor were right.

43
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,329
You are indeed here.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,880
You all...

45
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,680
Shen,

46
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,880
let me introduce you.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,440
This is Miss Feifei whom I just rescued

48
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,240
while performing a heroic deed.

49
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,079
Miss Feifei.

50
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,320
This is the man I told you about,

51
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Shen Lang, the greatest hero in the martial arts world.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,280
Shen.

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,280
Shen.

54
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,560
The martial arts world has been quite chaotic lately.

55
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,720
I heard that a female disciple from Renyi Manor

56
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,800
falsely accused you of killing Master Li.

57
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,600
And that you took her away from Renyi Manor.

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,040
What's really going on?

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,440
I want to see

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,780
who dares to slander my dear Shen.

61
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,840
Where is she?

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,440
I'll tear her limb from limb.

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,800
Is she hiding in here?

64
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,360
Come out!

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,960
Who dares to slander my Brother Shen

66
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,360
Is he in there?

67
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:25,960
It's for me.

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,200
Brother Shen.

69
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,090
That female disciple from Renyi Manor

70
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,800
Could it be her?

71
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,960
I was such a fool.

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,120
I even saved you.

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,800
I should have killed you.

74
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,880
Why didn't you dodge?

75
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,560
Miss Qiqi is kind-hearted

76
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,240
and won't hurt me.

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't think that just because you're pretty and sweet-talking

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,130
I won't take action.

79
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,280
Thank you.

80
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,960
I never expected

81
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,140
that you could smile like this, miss.

82
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
You two

83
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,770
are making eyes at each other right in front of me.

84
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
Shen, stay away from her.

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,520
She's the one who slandered you.

86
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,080
Stay away from my Shen.

87
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,680
Shen, let's go.

88
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,530
What are you doing here?

89
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,450
I'm here to protect you.

90
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,940
I've heard about your situation.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
The martial arts world of Zhongzhou

92
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,600
has so many eyes watching you.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,730
It's too dangerous.

94
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,120
Otherwise,

95
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,080
come back with me to Fugui Manor.

96
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
We'll get some money from my father first,

97
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,880
then recruit skilled martial artists from everywhere

98
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,680
to protect you and keep you safe.

99
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
What do you think, Shen?

100
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Qiqi,

101
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,560
if you feel unsafe,

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,760
I can take you back right now.

103
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,080
Don't even think about leaving me behind again.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,410
Why does that Bai Feifei get to follow you?

105
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,760
You even bought her a pinwheel.

106
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
I don't have one.

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,500
Did she drug you or something?

108
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,970
Or put some kind of spell on you?

109
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Why else would you trust her so much?

110
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,320
Enough. It's getting late.

111
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,760
I think you should go back and rest.

112
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,440
I can take care of myself.

113
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,920
Please believe me.

114
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
This Bai Feifei is definitely suspicious.

115
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,080
Sneaking around in the middle of the night.

116
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,680
Something's definitely up.

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,160
I'll catch you red-handed.

118
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,020
And show him your true colors.

119
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,850
Uncle Wujiu,

120
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,540
sorry to keep you waiting.

121
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,159
Shen Lang's bait worked perfectly.

122
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,920
Since the Qinyang Ghost Cave couldn't resist,

123
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,200
should we target them first?

124
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,159
The Qinyang Ghost Cave is full of traps.

125
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,090
We can't rush in.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,200
I'll find another way

127
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,620
to force out Chai Yuguan's whereabouts.

128
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
Qiqi,

129
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,400
what are you doing in the middle of the night?

130
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,000
You'll see when we get there.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,320
Brother Shen, look!

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,240
You witch,

133
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,240
caught in the act!

134
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,000
Qinyang Ghost Cave.

135
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,760
Why are you here?

136
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,490
Of course we had to come.

137
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,000
Otherwise who knows what you're sneaking around

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,799
and plotting.

139
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,039
This assassin from the Ghost Cave

140
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,360
was searching for your room in the courtyard

141
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
when I killed him.

142
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,060
As if I'd believe that!

143
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,240
This man died right in front of you

144
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,440
and you still deny it?

145
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,360
I'll beat the truth out of you!

146
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,980
Miss Qiqi, with your amateur skills,

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,420
you'd better back off.

148
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,680
Qiqi,

149
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,010
stop this nonsense.

150
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,240
Brother Shen!

151
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,440
We've known each other since childhood,

152
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
yet you hit me because of her?

153
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,600
Miss Qiqi,

154
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
you're the one jumping to conclusions.

155
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
I'm talking to Shen.

156
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,620
Why are you butting in?

157
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,280
Shen, you must believe me.

158
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,480
She's been following you all this way.

159
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,960
She must have ulterior motives.

160
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,080
It was your Shen who insisted I come along.

161
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,240
It has nothing to do with me.

162
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,760
Stop spreading lies.

163
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,520
You must be deceiving Shen.

164
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Then what exactly am I after?

165
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,640
You are...

166
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,560
You...

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,040
What if Li Changqing's death

168
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,240
was actually you framing Brother Shen?

169
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,840
Then let's say I did it.

170
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,900
Catch me if you can.

171
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,880
Please don't mind her, miss.

172
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,120
Qiqi is just being impulsive.

173
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,120
She means no harm.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,840
Why are you still defending her?

175
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,320
Brother Shen, just ignore her.

176
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,120
Qiqi.

177
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
If you keep making trouble,

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,680
I'll send you home tomorrow.

179
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,300
You're going to be the death of me.

180
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,970
Please control yourself, young hero.

181
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,800
Miss Feifei.

182
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,520
Bai Feifei.

183
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,280
Bai Feifei.

184
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,000
You little brat. I'll drug you unconscious.

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,450
I'll tear off that sheepskin of yours.

186
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,240
And Shen even buys you pinwheels.

187
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
Miss Qiqi, why are you in my room?

188
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,760
I...

189
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,520
I misunderstood you today.

190
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,840
I specially brewed some good tea

191
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,560
to apologize to you.

192
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,290
Indeed, this is excellent tea.

193
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,460
Of course it is.

194
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,330
I carefully selected it just for you, Feifei.

195
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,640
Why aren't you drinking?

196
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,650
You came to my room to bring tea.

197
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,740
There must be a reason, right?

198
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,930
I wish your family good health.

199
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,120
My father is dead and my mother is gone.

200
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,780
I have no family or relatives.

201
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,320
Then I wish you

202
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,400
prosperity for your martial arts school

203
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,360
and advancement in your martial skills.

204
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,680
Because of the Invincible Manual,

205
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,880
everyone at my Renyi Manor branch has been killed.

206
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,610
Now I have no school or faction.

207
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,520
Then I wish you safe travels.

208
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,440
But your brother Shen and I

209
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,840
are being hunted down.

210
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,250
I didn't realize your situation was so terrible.

211
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,180
It's all right.

212
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,680
Then let's wish

213
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,010
for our fortunate meeting.

214
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,240
Thank you for the tea.

215
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,000
Never mind.

216
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,640
I just remembered this isn't even good tea.

217
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:41,320
Tomorrow,

218
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,740
I'll brew you something much better.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,330
I think it's quite good.

220
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,440
I told you not to drink it.

221
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,900
Why did you still drink it?

222
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,000
I couldn't possibly reject

223
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,460
Miss Qiqi's kindness.

224
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,480
You seem smart,

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,160
but why don't you have any caution around others?

226
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,720
Would Miss Qiqi

227
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
really harm me?

228
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,040
Feifei.

229
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,440
Oh no.

230
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,560
This sleeping potion is strong enough to knock out a bull,

231
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,080
and I used double the dose.

232
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,050
What am I going to do now?

233
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,760
The antidote.

234
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,240
Wait here.

235
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,700
I'll get you the antidote.

236
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,160
How naive.

237
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,300
It's bad. No time to expel the poison.

238
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,620
Looks like I've been drugged.

239
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,720
The antidote is here.

240
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,800
Bai Feifei!

241
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:29,760
Stop!

242
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,520
Keep hitting her.

243
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,840
Beat her until she talks.

244
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,570
Speak up!

245
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,160
Where did Shen Lang hide the Invincible Mirror?

246
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,040
Well...

247
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,250
You should ask Shen Lang yourself.

248
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,120
Give me that!

249
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,080
You're asking for death.

250
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,540
Then what use are you to me?

251
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:01,960
Stop!

252
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,600
Feifei!

253
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
It really is you.

254
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,080
Qinyang Ghost Cave! Tie Huahe!

255
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
Brave men!

256
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,720
Catch these little ones!

257
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,440
100 taels reward for each one!

258
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,960
Kill Tie Huahe

259
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,320
Reward: 1,000 taels.

260
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,440
Antidote.

261
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,960
You're so badly wounded.

262
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,320
It's all my fault.

263
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,480
Don't let her escape!

264
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,100
Go quickly!

265
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,810
If we leave, we leave together.

266
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,180
You want to escape?

267
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,360
It won't be that easy.

268
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,020
Don't move!

269
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,480
Move again and I'll kill him.

270
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,040
Go now!

271
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,880
Their target is Shen.

272
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,360
The Ghost Palace's Soul-Wandering Needles.

273
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,320
So you're the one pulling the strings.

274
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,920
Feifei.

275
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,480
Feifei.
