1
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,200
Sister.

2
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,120
This man is almost dying.

3
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,520
Why are you still being tender with him?

4
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,040
Get out.

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,200
Wandering Soul Needle.

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
I'm your own brother.

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,850
You're willing to save a mere pawn,

8
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,160
how could you bear to kill your own brother?

9
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,620
Who said I want to save him?

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,490
If you say one more word,

11
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,360
you can forget about getting the antidote.

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,490
I'll make sure you're worse than dead.

13
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,800
Worse than dead.

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,560
The only thing in this world that truly makes one feel worse than dead

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,420
is loving someone you can't have.

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,400
I think the one who's worse than dead

17
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,130
might actually be you, sister.

18
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,420
Sister went to great lengths.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,200
Using Shen Lang to destroy the Ghost Cave Sect,

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,240
now that you've achieved your goal,

21
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,420
yet you're reluctant to discard this useless pawn.

22
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,039
Could it be

23
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,770
that sister has developed real feelings,

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
afraid of loving someone you can't have?

25
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,160
Bai Feifei.

26
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,800
You've fallen for him.

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,840
No, I haven't.

28
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,140
If that's the case,

29
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,200
he's just a pawn.

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,770
I'll eliminate him for you right away.

31
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,320
Look at yourself now.

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
Still claiming you haven't fallen for him?

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,360
Shen Lang is no fool.

34
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,720
There are only a few of us in this inn now.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,000
If you try to save him,

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,560
your identity as the master of Ghost Palace

37
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,960
will be exposed.

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
One small mistake,

39
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,680
and everything will be lost.

40
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
If you truly have feelings for Shen Lang,

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,880
sister,

42
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,320
the fastest way to cut off those feelings is

43
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,280
to kill the one you care for.

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,600
Our revenge remains unfulfilled.

45
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,720
Do you want to follow in your mother's footsteps

46
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,480
and be ruined by a man?

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,960
Impossible.

48
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
Sister.

49
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,040
Don't forget you and Shen Lang are on different paths.

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,100
We're the ones walking the same road.

51
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,560
Remember how your mother was used by that bastard Chai Yuguan.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,280
Think about it carefully.

53
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,000
You're right.

54
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,440
Tomorrow.

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,800
Help me lure away Cold Third Master and Zhu Qiqi.

56
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,079
Why bother?

57
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,240
Let's finish him now.

58
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,100
Don't you dare.

59
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,650
We're the only ones in this inn.

60
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,600
If he dies now,

61
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,360
both of us will be implicated.

62
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,480
Fine.

63
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Tomorrow at noon.

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,360
I'd like to see

65
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,040
if our young palace mistress

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,960
can actually go through with it.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,120
Cut off her feelings.

68
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,010
This mark...

69
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,000
you bit me.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll kill you!

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
Kill all of you!

72
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,320
Feifei.

73
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
Go quickly.

74
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,120
Our revenge isn't complete.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,240
Do you want to follow in your mother's footsteps

76
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,440
and be ruined by a man?

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,840
Feifei, hurry!

78
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Stay alive! Stay alive!

79
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,280
It seems

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,920
sister has made the right choice after all.

81
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,560
Once a move is made, there's no turning back.

82
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
Follow me.

83
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,180
I have something good to show you.

84
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,400
Have a seat.

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,200
What is this?

86
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,760
You'll know soon enough.

87
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,600
This one

88
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,780
is the Thousand Fists Manual.

89
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,720
This is the Five Supreme Skills.

90
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,500
And this one

91
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,400
is the Dragon Capture Technique from the Beggar's Sect.

92
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,930
The Creation Method from the Ghost Cave Sect.

93
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,490
This is the most important.

94
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,800
This is a dagger manual left by someone with the surname Li.

95
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,120
But I haven't decided what to name it yet.

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,320
Why don't we call it

97
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,960
Flying Daggers of Li?

98
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,880
From now on, we're allies.

99
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,680
I'll naturally share everything with you.

100
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,680
Allies.

101
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,720
You want revenge,

102
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,480
I can help you.

103
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,120
I want to become the martial arts alliance leader,

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,450
and you must help me too.

105
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,520
Martial arts leader.

106
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,040
Martial arts leader.

107
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
How naive.

108
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,920
This martial world is nothing but a garbage heap,

109
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,800
yet you're so eager

110
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
to become the leader of this trash pile.

111
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,880
Ridiculous.

112
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,880
So what if it's a garbage heap?

113
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,340
As the leader, I can still command the world.

114
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,240
Shen Lang is already dead.

115
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,880
The martial world will surely fall into chaos again because of the Invincible Manual,

116
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,480
splitting apart in a bloody storm.

117
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,080
We just need to stir up this chaos from the shadows.

118
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,960
Once we kill Chai Yuguan,

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,130
the entire martial world will be ours.

120
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,000
Who told you

121
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,410
that Shen Lang was dead?

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,960
Feifei!

123
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,720
Feifei, are you here?

124
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
Feifei!

125
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,600
Here you are.

126
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,809
You're here too.

127
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,020
Brother Shen is awake.

128
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,400
Awake?

129
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,159
Yes.

130
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
I didn't expect your martial arts to be so ordinary,

131
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,080
but your medical skills are impressive.

132
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,680
Brother Shen woke up right after taking your medicine.

133
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,410
My Fugui Manor owes you a favor.

134
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,220
If you need anything in the future, just ask.

135
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,240
Hurry up. Brother Shen wants to see you.

136
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,760
My dear sister.

137
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
Is Shen Lang really that important to you?

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,920
Brother Shen,

139
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,120
Feifei is here.

140
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,520
Shen.

141
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,840
Seeing you all are fine

142
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,080
puts my mind at ease.

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,000
Feifei,

144
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
how is your hand?

145
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,480
Shen, don't just focus on Feifei.

146
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,920
You woke up

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,580
because Wang Lianhua and I put in a lot of effort.

148
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Your cold poison,

149
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,210
if it weren't for Wang Lianhua,

150
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,680
we might have had to move heaven and earth

151
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,360
to seek help from the remnants of the Ghost Palace.

152
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,160
Ghost Palace?

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,720
Yes.

154
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,320
Wang Lianhua said

155
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,200
your cold poison

156
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,600
can only be cured by the Wandering Soul Needle from the Ghost Palace.

157
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
But where can we find someone from the Ghost Palace now?

158
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
But Wang Lianhua is amazing.

159
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,920
He created a prescription.

160
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,520
I

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,000
searched every pharmacy in the city with Mr. Leng,

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and finally gathered all the herbs.

163
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,040
I never thought

164
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,400
Brother Lianhua would have the skill to cure cold poison.

165
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,760
Brother Shen was severely injured,

166
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,920
and we had no other options,

167
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,250
so I had to take the risk.

168
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,920
Fortunately, Miss Feifei provided great help,

169
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,850
otherwise even I couldn't have...

170
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,040
Brother Lianhua's prescription is so miraculous.

171
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,040
May I take a look at it?

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,620
I have the prescription here.

173
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,440
What's wrong?

174
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,760
Nothing.

175
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,810
I've certainly learned something new today.

176
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,640
I'll never forget

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
your life-saving kindness.

178
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,250
Why are you being so formal with me?

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,460
I'm just glad you're okay.

180
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,160
Wang Lianhua.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,120
You did well saving him.

182
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm definitely keeping you as a friend.

183
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,120
If you ever run out of money while traveling,

184
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,920
just mention my Fugui Manor.

185
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,970
Miss Qiqi, you're so generous.

186
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
I spend a lot,

187
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,520
don't regret it later.

188
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,480
Not just you,

189
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,280
but also Uncle Leng and Feifei.

190
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,200
Oh no!

191
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,080
Uncle Leng is still searching for herbs.

192
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,020
He doesn't know you're awake.

193
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,960
I need to tell him.

194
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,880
Come with me.

195
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,000
Why should I?

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,330
Because we're friends!

197
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,720
Oh, Feifei.

198
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,120
Go back to your room and rest.

199
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,580
Don't get too close to him.

200
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,160
Get some rest then.
