1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,520
Then tell me.

2
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,400
Why did you lie to me?

3
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,280
I trusted you so much.

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,240
In this whole world,

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,040
you're the person I trusted most.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,480
Do you know that?

7
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,240
So all those times you helped me

8
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,320
and protected me,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,080
was it all because of guilt?

10
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,130
I do feel guilty toward you,

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,200
but throughout this journey,

12
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,480
I've protected and safeguarded you

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,680
because of my sincere feelings for you.

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,440
Go ahead, do it.

15
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,760
No!

16
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,720
During these ten years.

17
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,580
You've known the truth all along.

18
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,530
And all the injustice suffered by my Youling Palace.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,640
But

20
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,800
You said nothing.

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,120
This place

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,000
Is where you stabbed my mother to death, isn't it?

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,039
My life has always belonged to you.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,530
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

25
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,960
This is what I owe you.

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,600
Brother Shen!

27
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,079
Brother Shen!

28
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,040
Shen Lang.

29
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,480
The hair tie is broken.

30
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,680
Our bond is severed.

31
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
My heart,

32
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,480
it's time to take it back.

33
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,520
If we meet again,

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,280
I will surely take your life.

35
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
Feifei.

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,800
Heal your wounds.

37
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,760
I'll kill you myself.

38
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,800
From now on,

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,760
you are my husband.

40
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,560
Mother.

41
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,320
I'm sorry.

42
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,840
I have failed you.

43
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
I couldn't kill Shen Lang.

44
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm sorry.

45
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,200
Forgive me.

46
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,440
I couldn't kill him.

47
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
Tell me,

48
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,600
why couldn't I kill him?

49
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,400
Fan Wujiu.

50
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,080
Yes.

51
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,880
Spread the word across the martial world.

52
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,940
Gather our forces.

53
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:32,840
I will

54
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
restore the Ghost Palace.

55
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,840
We are the disciples of Ghost Cave Sect you rescued.

56
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,100
My Weiwu Escort Agency

57
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,040
is at your service, Young Palace Master.

58
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,920
Those you saved in Luoyang

59
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,210
are at your command.

60
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,320
We are deeply grateful.

61
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,720
We wish to follow you, Young Palace Master,

62
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,440
and await your orders.

63
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,520
Thank you all for your trust.

64
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,520
I, Bai Feifei, will not let you down.

65
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,570
Here and now,

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,480
I swear in my mother's name

67
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,940
and in the name of the entire Phantom Palace.

68
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,920
I will eliminate everyone who tramples

69
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,200
and humiliates you.

70
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,320
Restore the Phantom Palace!

71
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
Restore the Phantom Palace!

72
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,480
Restore the Phantom Palace!

73
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,320
Restore the Phantom Palace!

74
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Restore the Phantom Palace!

75
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,080
Revive the Ghost Palace.

76
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Shen Lang.

77
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,380
The hair tie is broken.

78
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
Our bond is severed.

79
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,760
My heart

80
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,880
it's time to take it back.

81
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,660
When we meet again,

82
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,720
I will surely take your life.

83
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Brother Shen.

84
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,520
Brother Shen.

85
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,200
Stop drinking.

86
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,000
Perfect.

87
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,000
You can drink with me.

88
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,600
Shen.

89
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,840
Why are you doing this to yourself?

90
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
Giving up on yourself like this.

91
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,920
If she really causes you so much pain,

92
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,320
then let's just pretend she never existed.

93
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,520
We can go back to how things were before.

94
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,050
You can be the wandering hero Shen Lang again.

95
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,820
I'll stay by your side.

96
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,840
Okay?

97
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,360
But

98
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,680
she's already there.

99
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,240
Where?

100
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,580
It seems I'm the one who needs a drink,

101
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,720
not you.

102
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,120
My son,

103
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,320
trust no one.

104
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,520
This matter ultimately began because of me.

105
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,800
If you have any resentment,

106
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,400
feel free to take it out on me.

107
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,480
Shen Lang.

108
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,560
Young master,

109
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,720
please take a rest.

110
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,400
Yes, I have.

111
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,880
No, I haven't.

112
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,520
Yes, I have.

113
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
Never.

114
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Yes.

115
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,000
No.

116
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
It doesn't count.

117
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,440
There are also banknotes.

118
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,240
I have.

119
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,080
I haven't.

120
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
I did.

121
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,720
I didn't.

122
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,120
Yes, I have.

123
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,800
No, I haven't.

124
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I have.

125
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,800
If these banknotes

126
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,850
could really provide answers,

127
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
then perhaps

128
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,100
there wouldn't be so many regrets in this world.

129
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,720
Shen.

130
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,240
Have I ever been in your heart?

131
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,680
Even for just a moment?

132
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Qiqi.

133
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm sorry.

134
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,760
It's okay.

135
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,240
It's really okay now.

136
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,880
I was the one who decided to like you.

137
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,280
Now I've decided

138
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,130
not to like you anymore.

139
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,560
You,

140
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,800
and Feifei,

141
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
and that hateful

142
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,680
yet lovable Wang Lianhua.

143
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,720
You all are

144
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,920
very precious to me.

145
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,480
I want all of you to be well

146
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,680
and stay by my side.

147
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
Now it's all good.

148
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,680
You and Feifei love each other.

149
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,560
So you all can

150
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,880
stay by my side.

151
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,610
I don't have to lose anyone.

152
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,720
Qiqi.

153
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,880
Thank you.

154
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,640
Would you join me for a drink?

155
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,200
Qiqi.

156
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,800
You know,

157
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
all these years

158
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,080
since my father died,

159
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,840
I've been wandering

160
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,760
through this world,

161
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,200
meeting many people.

162
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
These people all have their own agendas,

163
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,720
fighting for fame and fortune,

164
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
stopping at nothing.

165
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,320
To be honest,

166
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
I've long been tired of this world.

167
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,200
But only you

168
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,520
are so pure.

169
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,660
Always treating me with such sincerity.

170
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,320
You made me feel

171
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,880
that this world

172
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,410
might not be so terrible after all.

173
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,040
You showed me

174
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,520
what pure love truly is.

175
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,240
Only now can I understand what I'm feeling.

176
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Stop drinking.

177
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,320
Since you already understand your feelings,

178
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,560
don't just sit here drinking your sorrows away.

179
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,480
Feifei wants to break up with you completely,

180
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,120
but you can't let her go.

181
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,440
Why don't you go talk to her and clear things up?

182
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,160
Besides,

183
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,480
the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

184
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,360
has already sent a message to the King of Joy beyond the border.

185
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,800
The King of Joy will enter the border sooner or later.

186
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,200
Feifei is also secretly gathering forces.

187
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,680
The two of them

188
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
will inevitably face off against each other.

189
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,370
Your father's revenge,

190
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,520
Baijing's death,

191
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,540
you'll have to face them someday.

192
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,600
Brother Shen.

193
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,520
Go find her.
