1
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,560
Shen.

2
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,880
I think I touched something.

3
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,520
Be careful.

4
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,800
The Guiku Sect is full of traps

5
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,720
and very dangerous.

6
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,360
Qiqi,

7
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,680
why don't you stay here

8
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,479
and wait for news from Feifei and me?

9
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:38,680
Why can you two go

10
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,520
but I can't?

11
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,440
I, Zhu Qiqi, am not a coward.

12
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Having one more person to help is always good,

13
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
isn't it?

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,840
Fine. Let's go then.

15
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,720
Shen.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,329
Stepped on another one.

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,920
Shen,

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,600
what's going on?

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,730
This time, please be very careful where you step.

20
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,160
It seems Tie Huahe was prepared.

21
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,440
The Guiku Sect's traps

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,700
have been rearranged.

23
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,600
Six Jia, nine chapters. Heaven is round, Earth is square.

24
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,730
Four seasons, five elements. Blue, red, white, yellow.

25
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,720
This stone forest array mimics celestial movements.

26
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,880
To break this formation,

27
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,540
one must first break through the eastern gate where the sun rises.

28
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,519
I received an invitation from Fugui Manor

29
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,480
and came today specifically to help Brother Shen

30
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,940
with my humble abilities.

31
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Brother Shen's brilliant reputation

32
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,180
is confirmed upon meeting you today.

33
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,500
This person's eyes...

34
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,460
seem familiar.

35
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,159
Thank you for your kind words.

36
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,320
Besides being skilled in both civil and martial arts,

37
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
you're also versed in the art of divination.

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,480
Such cleverness and wisdom,

39
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,360
such literary talent and charm,

40
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,200
under heaven,

41
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,920
could only belong to the Man of a Thousand Faces, Wang Lianhua.

42
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Brother Lianhua.

43
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,540
You flatter me, Brother Shen.

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,520
Everyone in the martial world says you're both wise and brave,

45
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,050
yet you can't even break through this small stone forest array?

46
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,170
It seems I've arrived too late.

47
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,640
So you're the one

48
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,440
who's rumored to be constantly attracting admirers, Wang Lianhua?

49
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,480
This young lady has such rosy lips and white teeth,

50
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,740
with a perfect figure,

51
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,360
clearly from a noble family.

52
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,960
I've heard that Brother Shen is close with

53
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,760
the Zhu family's daughter, Qiqi.

54
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
So this must be

55
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,400
Miss Qiqi, isn't it?

56
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,120
So everyone in the martial arts world knows

57
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,980
that Brother Shen and I are close?

58
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,880
What exactly do you all say about us?

59
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,620
In the martial arts world,

60
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,040
they say Miss Qiqi

61
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,040
once saved Brother Shen's life.

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,760
They say you've known each other since childhood,

63
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,560
growing up together like childhood sweethearts.

64
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,040
What else?

65
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
Well,

66
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,680
they also say you two are a perfect match.

67
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,720
A match made in heaven.

68
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
You're so young,

69
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,800
yet you've mastered the Five Elements.

70
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,160
This interest of yours

71
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,800
is rather unusual.

72
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,160
Your hands are so delicate and soft.

73
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,500
They seem perfect for threading needles

74
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,960
and embroidery.

75
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:41,890
What are you two talking about?

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,600
I don't understand any of it.

77
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,240
Thank you for your help today, Brother Lienhua.

78
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,960
But now that this formation is broken,

79
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,620
why can't we see the entrance?

80
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,620
Brother Shen, please be patient.

81
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,500
What have you done?

82
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,080
Feifei.

83
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,480
Miss Feifei.

84
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,690
There are some grudges between us.

85
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,240
But we came to Guiku Sect

86
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,080
without interfering with each other.

87
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,320
You wouldn't take my life, would you?

88
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,780
You fell down here with me.

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,460
If anything happens to me,

90
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,100
you'll be implicated too.

91
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,160
If you die,

92
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,400
it would naturally be the Guiku Sect's doing.

93
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,000
What does that have to do with me?

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,440
No.

95
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:06,880
You...

96
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,600
I swear I never told anyone about your identity.

97
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,040
No.

98
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,340
I was wrong.

99
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,320
I was wrong.

100
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,680
I shouldn't have used

101
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,410
that despicable Mind Control Dream Inducing technique on you.

102
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,320
Wrong.

103
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,300
I was wrong.

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,240
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,200
No,

106
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,680
sis,

107
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,280
I'm your brother.

108
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,240
His son

109
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,400
deserves to die even more.

110
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,740
Chai Yuguan also deceived my mother.

111
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,370
I will definitely kill him too.

112
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,120
Shen.

113
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:27,880
Don't

114
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,640
be afraid.

115
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,080
It's okay. I'm here.

116
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,920
I'll protect you.

117
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,130
Good thing I'm here, right?

118
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,920
Otherwise, it's so dark,

119
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,570
you'd be scared to death

120
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,620
and how would you find anyone?

121
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,770
What's that?

122
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,000
Qiqi.

123
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,720
I wasn't scared at first,

124
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,600
but in this tomb passage,

125
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,240
there seem to be many corpses.

126
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,120
If you keep getting startled like this,

127
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,920
I,

128
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,850
will be frightened to death by you.

129
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,680
This person died mysteriously.

130
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,410
If they were killed by someone,

131
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,740
there's not a single wound on their body.

132
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:34,240
Yet only on the wrist there are overlapping old and new scars.

133
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,180
If they wanted to commit suicide,

134
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,780
why would they cut their wrists repeatedly?

135
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,320
Shen.

136
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,640
Tell me.

137
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,760
Why are there corpses

138
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,720
in this haunted cave?

139
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,160
There's one here too.

140
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,280
Qiqi.

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,800
If you're really scared

142
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,260
and can't help but scream,

143
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,480
you might as well call out

144
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,960
for Lienhua and Feifei.

145
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,330
Maybe we'll find them sooner that way.

146
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,200
Feifei!

147
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,720
This is the Heart-Devouring Pill.

148
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,850
It takes effect once every seven days.

149
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,600
You know what you should say

150
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,330
and what you shouldn't, right?

151
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,000
Are you hurt?

152
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,000
It's only been a moment since I last saw you.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,960
How did you two end up like this?

154
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,080
Especially you.

155
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,720
And also,

156
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,000
why did you dig such a big hole?

157
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,860
Planting flowers.

158
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,000
Brother Lianhua, you're in good spirits indeed.

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
In such dire circumstances,

160
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,640
you still remember to engage in refined pursuits.

161
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,300
Don't tease me, Brother Shen.

162
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,560
How was your journey?

163
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,720
You all missed out on quite a treat.

164
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,520
All the way here,

165
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,450
you didn't get to hear Miss Zhu's beautiful singing.

166
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,480
It seems Tie Huahe already knew we were coming

167
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,740
and set up traps for us.

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,330
Since everyone is fine,

169
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,320
we should quickly find a way

170
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,650
to escape from here.

171
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,920
Wait for me, Shen!

172
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,440
Wait for me!

173
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
Shen,

174
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,600
I'm scared.

175
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,880
It's alright.

176
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,400
The trap map indicates

177
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,060
there are hidden arrows here.

178
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,010
Everyone step back.

179
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,200
These traps

180
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,280
haven't been triggered.

181
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,760
Could the traps in this haunted cave be broken?

182
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,720
Their inner strength is weak

183
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,580
and their meridians are in chaos.

184
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,880
They're all at the end of their rope.

185
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,680
These are all disciples of the Ghost Cave Sect.

186
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,210
These are medicine people.

187
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Medicine people?

188
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,640
It's an evil martial art.

189
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,480
They draw power from living people's blood while practicing.

190
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,960
And those who are kept

191
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,720
to provide blood are called medicine people.

192
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,650
So many medicine people died here.

193
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,480
Could it be Tie Huahe

194
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,400
practicing the Invincible Mirror technique?

195
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,200
I thought

196
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,720
this Invincible Mirror that everyone in the martial world covets

197
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,450
was something extraordinary.

198
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,000
I never expected

199
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,140
it would be such a cruel and vicious martial art.

200
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,360
Martial arts are just skills

201
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,760
with no inherent good or evil.

202
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
It's just that...

203
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,640
It's the people who are evil.

204
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,680
To achieve mastery quickly,

205
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,570
they're willing to use their own disciples as medicine people.

206
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,720
It's a pity my disciples are so disappointing.

207
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,640
However,

208
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,320
the perfect test subject

209
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,960
has delivered himself right to my doorstep, hasn't he?
