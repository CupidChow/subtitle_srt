1
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,120
Jin Diezi and Chi Yang'er.

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,440
You have half an hour to come out and confess.

3
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,720
Tell us where Chai Yuguan is.

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,920
I wondered who it was.

5
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,600
So it's the spoiled Miss from the Zhu family.

6
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,250
Looks like Shen Lang snuck into this heroes' banquet

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,680
to work with Renyi Manor from the inside.

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,720
Young Master Shen.

9
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,480
Is that true?

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,690
If that's the case, why go to all this trouble?

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,840
The two of us could just fight you directly,

12
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,240
wouldn't that be better?

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:04,959
Who do you think you are?

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,000
I paid 5 taels of silver

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,530
to see the King of Pleasure.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,600
Do you really think everyone

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,120
is here for you?

18
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,760
Is the King of Pleasure here or not?

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,520
Shen Lang, right now

20
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,440
you're on Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect territory.

21
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,700
I suggest you recognize your situation.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,560
Do you think we're all pushovers?

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,400
Well said.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,520
You all came here today for the King of Joy.

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,920
If you don't see him,

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,640
I'm afraid you two masters will

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,680
be disappointed today.

28
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,140
Bai Feifei.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,060
Bai Feifei,

30
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,360
why are you so arrogant?

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,200
Everyone here belongs to my Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect.

32
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,640
Well, I'd like to see

33
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,020
how many people from your sect are actually still here.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,079
Ladies and gentlemen, don't be curious.

35
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,840
Today, the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

36
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,800
is openly hosting this so-called Heroes' Banquet here

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,640
to welcome the infamous Happy King into the city.

38
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,560
Our Renyi Manor has come here

39
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,920
specifically to break that Happy King's legs.

40
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,360
Miss Qiqi,

41
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,720
it's time.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
[Breaking down the door]

43
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,370
What's going on?

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,640
Miss Qiqi,

45
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,160
you must have planned this in advance

46
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,960
and invited experts to help you.

47
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,040
Both masters of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect are here.

48
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,720
The rest of those martial world scum

49
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,200
have all been slaughtered.

50
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,680
Good.

51
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,160
Lady Zhu is formidable.

52
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,640
We admire you.

53
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,320
Lady Zhu is mighty.

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,840
At this heroes' banquet,

55
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,000
throughout the martial world,

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,640
those who wanted to support Chai Yuguan

57
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,570
have been completely eliminated.

58
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
Congratulations, young palace master.

59
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
Just a bunch of rabble.

60
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,760
If Qiqi hadn't brought people to find them,

61
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,960
I would have actually hoped they'd lure Chai Yuguan here.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,720
This way,

63
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,320
we can catch them like rats in a trap.

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,360
You've already dealt with them.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,280
And you've helped build

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,620
Miss Qiqi's reputation as a heroine.

67
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,090
Young Mistress.

68
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,480
Miss Qiqi is here.

69
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,180
I won't see her.

70
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,520
You two may leave.

71
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,820
She clearly helped me,

72
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,370
yet why won't she see me?

73
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,760
Long time no see.

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
The two of us

75
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,440
are now on separate paths,

76
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,570
with nothing to do with each other.

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,520
I'm now known as the witch of the Ghost Palace.

78
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,520
While you

79
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,200
are known as a heroine.

80
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,640
This

81
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,440
is not a place you should come to.

82
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,000
Go back.

83
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,650
What do you mean 'separate paths'?

84
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,680
Do you really want nothing to do with me?

85
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,700
Since we parted at Yunmeng Manor,

86
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,450
you haven't been doing well, have you?

87
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:16,840
But you should know

88
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,240
I've been thinking about you all this time.

89
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,080
I'm sorry.

90
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,460
It's your sister who has wronged you.

91
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,960
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm truly sorry.

93
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,000
This has nothing to do with you.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,360
Miss Qiqi,

95
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,760
please leave.

96
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,040
You are my sister.

97
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,090
That day on the main street,

98
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,760
I announced it to the world with lanterns and decorations.

99
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,040
You are my sister.

100
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,600
I'm too foolish.

101
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,480
The grudge between you and Brother Shen,

102
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,640
I can't resolve it.

103
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,040
But you can't just

104
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,400
reject Brother Shen

105
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,240
and then reject me too.

106
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,400
Feifei, do you know?

107
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
I miss you so much.

108
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
I miss you every day.

109
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,640
Even in my dreams,

110
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,040
I see the days when the four of us were together.

111
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,240
We can't go back.

112
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,360
You will.

113
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,640
You definitely will.

114
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
Don't keep your sadness bottled up.

115
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,650
Take good care of yourself.

116
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,040
Leave the rest

117
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,660
to your big sister.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,060
I've already broken my promise once.

119
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,500
It won't happen a second time.

120
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,890
I promised I would be your support.

121
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Wait for me.

122
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,049
Don't be afraid.

123
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,040
I'll help you.

124
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,820
I, Zhu Qiqi, will become sworn sisters with Bai Feifei.

125
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,920
All expenses on this street

126
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,160
I will pay for.

127
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll celebrate your birthday like this every year from now on.

128
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,800
I keep my word.

129
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,720
You repeatedly gave me trouble at the heroes' banquet.

130
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,360
And now

131
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,200
you've come for my life.

132
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,660
Young Master Shen is hard to kill.

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,640
I'll have to do it myself.

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
Brother Lianhua.

135
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,560
Why reveal your true face?

136
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,440
How can I pretend not to know?

137
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,440
The two of us

138
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,690
were bound to face this day.

139
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,400
Why pretend otherwise?

140
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,400
Why don't you fight back?

141
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,360
The death of Yunmeng Fairy

142
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,090
is ultimately connected to me.

143
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,960
I'm willing to let you beat me

144
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,220
to vent your anger.

145
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,440
When my father died,

146
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
I was just as angry as you are now.

147
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
I understand you.

148
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,960
My mother...

149
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,050
My mother was different from your father.

150
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,370
She taught me martial arts since I was little,

151
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,440
all so I could avenge her.

152
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,680
But I couldn't understand her pain.

153
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,210
I thought she was just a woman obsessed with old grudges.

154
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,200
I never took revenge seriously.

155
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,840
In the end,

156
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,980
I learned she died by severing her own vital energy.

157
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,700
She was just upset with me.

158
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,040
It has nothing to do with you.

159
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,480
Those who have truly tasted despair...

160
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,080
Now in this world,

161
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,920
there's one more.

162
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,320
I'm afraid everyone is the same.

163
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,600
Once we care,

164
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,240
we carry a burden.

165
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,480
Those burdens we'd rather bear pain

166
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
than put down.

167
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,440
You and I are the same.

168
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,920
Yet for those we care about most,

169
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,160
we are helpless.

170
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,560
Completely helpless.

171
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,440
This wine...

172
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,680
Why did you save us?

173
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,640
The Merry King Chai Yuguan is my birth father.

174
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
You work for him.

175
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,850
I'm naturally pleased to help.

176
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
Master Lianhua, please rest assured.

177
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,120
We will serve with utmost loyalty

178
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,040
to welcome the Merry King into the pass.

179
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Who's talking?

180
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,340
Someone's coming.

181
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,240
Both masters, please leave first.

182
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,840
Thank you.

183
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,920
Stop!

184
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,640
Wang Lianhua!

185
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
Stop right there!

186
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,840
Heroine Qiqi.

187
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,640
Have you come to hold me accountable?

188
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,640
Wang Lianhua!
