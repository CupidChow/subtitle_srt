1
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,760
Greetings, Master Shen.

2
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Feifei.

3
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,000
Master Shen.

4
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,160
Please.

5
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,600
Feifei.

6
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,840
Nephew.

7
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,480
I think you've mistaken her for someone else.

8
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,120
This beauty of mine and Bai Feifei

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
do look somewhat alike.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,530
But Bai Feifei is already dead.

11
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,960
Miss Murou

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,319
is a beauty I found in Jiangnan.

13
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,680
We will be married in a few days.

14
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,640
You should change how you address her

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,039
and call her your aunt.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,840
Miss Murou,

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,940
would you please remove your veil

18
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,480
so I may see your face?

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,240
Nephew,

20
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,680
don't push your luck.

21
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,320
How about this:

22
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,180
Why don't you stay here at my Kuaihuo Palace?

23
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,039
In five days, at our wedding,

24
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,600
you will be able to see

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,880
Miss Murou's true face.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,720
I'm feeling rather tired today.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,979
I'll take my leave now.

28
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,010
What did you say?

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,800
The lady who's going to marry the Pleasure King,

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,920
Miss Muruo,

31
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,090
is actually Bai Feifei.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,180
I saw it with my own eyes today.

33
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,400
Her appearance may have changed,

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
but those eyes...

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,120
Those eyes.

36
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,240
No one else

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,700
could have eyes like hers.

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,579
How can you be certain it's her

39
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,410
just by looking at her eyes?

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Exactly.

41
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,920
Feifei is gone.

42
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,500
We saw it with our own eyes.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,280
That's exactly what I can't figure out.

44
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,400
Maybe

45
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
she's still alive.

46
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,890
You must be missing her too much

47
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,560
and seeing things.

48
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,120
Shen,

49
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,480
don't forget.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,640
We came to Kuaihuo Palace

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,960
specifically to avenge Feifei.

52
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,720
Perhaps this Mu Rou

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,820
is part of Chai Yuguan's plot.

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,240
If it is a plot,

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
then Chai Yuguan has already succeeded for the most part.

56
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,210
What do you mean?

57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,880
Can't you see?

58
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,410
Just one simple meeting

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,240
and you're already thrown off balance.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,680
I am not.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,800
If you weren't,

62
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,880
you would have already confronted Chai Yuguan

63
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,360
in the main hall.

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,410
But because of your doubts,

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,079
you were concerned about her safety

66
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:35,400
and didn't make a move.

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,280
Am I wrong?

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,840
The night is deep, the dew is thick.

69
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,770
What brings you here, Master Shen?

70
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,500
Could you please announce

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,920
that I have urgent business

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,380
and wish to see Miss Murou?

73
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,200
On her wedding day,

74
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,520
you'll see her naturally.

75
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,120
Please go home, Master Shen.

76
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,320
If we wait until that day,

77
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,100
I'm afraid it will be too late.

78
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,640
Nothing will be too late.

79
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,280
Qiqi.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,640
Brother Shen, if you really want to see her,

81
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,960
we can just fight our way in.

82
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,360
You dare to cause trouble at Kuaihuo Palace?

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
I dare to do anything.

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,720
Wang Lianhua.

85
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,320
These things you taught me

86
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,680
are indeed quite useful.

87
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,480
Qiqi.

88
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,700
Do you know you've caused big trouble today?

89
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,880
That's exactly what I'm good at.

90
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,360
Shen.

91
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,800
Since I've decided to come with you,

92
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,400
I've put life and death behind me.

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,330
So you don't need to worry about me.

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,920
If Murong is Feifei,

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
it's not just you.

96
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,159
I must bring her back too.

97
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,440
Qiqi.

98
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,240
Why have you all come

99
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,400
so late at night?

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
Miss Murou,

101
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,620
excuse our intrusion.

102
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,050
The three of us need to confirm something.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,320
That's why we've disturbed you.

104
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,450
If she's not Feifei,

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,840
and we act rashly,

106
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,900
wouldn't we harm an innocent person?

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,640
Why is my house so lively today?

108
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,720
It's you three again.

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,530
I never expected

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,800
you three

111
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,920
would be so concerned about

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
my bride-to-be.

113
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,680
Murou,

114
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
turn around.

115
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes.

116
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,720
Come.

117
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,480
Come closer

118
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,450
so they can see you clearly.

119
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,159
So they can finally

120
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,800
give up this idea.

121
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Master Shen

122
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,720
Are you satisfied now?

123
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,440
Brother Shen.

124
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,460
I knew she couldn't be Feifei.

125
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,260
She just resembles her somewhat.

126
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,280
People who look alike in this world

127
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,240
are many.

128
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,360
Although she's not the one I'm looking for,

129
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,240
however,

130
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,060
she is truly a rare beauty.

131
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,200
I

132
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,490
am quite satisfied.

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
Why does it sound like

134
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,880
you're interested in me,

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,159
a beautiful woman?

136
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,780
This flower already has an owner.

137
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,500
What's the point of pursuing?

138
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,000
My dear nephew, are you

139
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,960
jealous because of her?

140
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,980
The Pleasure King found such a good match

141
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,560
precisely to make me jealous, didn't he?

142
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,360
Shen Lang, oh Shen Lang.

143
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,040
As of today,

144
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,000
your Three Heavenly Techniques have been perfected.

145
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,840
With your power,

146
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,440
no one can stand against you.

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,680
If

148
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,840
heaven

149
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,160
forced me to choose between you and her,

150
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
only one,

151
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,600
I would choose you.

152
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,320
What do you mean by this, Your Highness?

153
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,600
Today, these three people

154
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,480
knocked out my maid,

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,800
trespassed into my chamber,

156
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,240
and committed a grave offense.

157
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,440
My lord doesn't plan to avenge me at all.

158
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,560
My beauty.

159
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Why should we stoop to their level?

160
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,120
Calm down.

161
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
My worthy nephew.

162
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,540
He hasn't submitted to me yet.

163
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,020
It's only a matter of time.

164
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,730
Let's wait a bit longer.

165
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,400
Everyone.

166
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,440
If there's nothing else,

167
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,600
you may take your leave now.

168
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:03,920
Go.

169
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,720
Let's go.

170
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,840
Come on.

171
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,520
Beauty.

172
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,560
Do you know why I've been desperately looking for you?

173
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,280
I know Bai Feifei is dead.

174
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,680
Shen Lang won't let this go.

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,600
Now I see

176
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,960
that your face is really

177
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,039
quite useful.

178
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,960
Your Highness.

179
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
I admire Your Highness's commanding presence.

180
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,280
Even though I've suffered such humiliation today,

181
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,960
I'm still willing to serve Your Highness.

182
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,540
I treat you this way

183
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,820
because I hope that in the future,

184
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,440
you won't betray me.

185
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,240
It would be a waste to kill Shen Lang.

186
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,960
And my lady is willing to be with me.

187
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
In the future,

188
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,320
the greatest hero and beauty

189
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
will both belong to me.

190
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,600
How could I ever betray you?

191
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,440
Until our wedding day,

192
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,500
there are only five days left.

193
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,720
During these days,

194
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,770
I'll be waiting for good news from Your Highness.

195
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,280
I raise this cup

196
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,000
to wish Your Highness

197
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,680
supremacy in the martial world.

198
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,480
Good.

199
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,400
I have now mastered

200
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,320
the Invincible Manual to its highest level.

201
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,650
If Shen Lang still refuses to submit to me,

202
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
then in five days,

203
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,280
it will be his death day.

204
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,360
Brother Shen,

205
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,660
I think you've lost your mind.

206
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,540
How could you mistake Miss Mu Rou for Feifei?

207
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,240
Brother Shen,

208
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,720
if she were really Feifei,

209
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,680
how could she knowingly

210
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,000
be the biological daughter of the Happy King

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,600
and still agree to marry him?

212
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,720
She must be completely disappointed in me.

213
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,620
I can only resort to this desperate measure now.

214
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Brother Lianhua,

215
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,200
you're skilled in the art of disguise.

216
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,530
They might notice something suspicious.

217
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,440
That face fits perfectly to the bone structure.

218
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,840
It's not a disguise mask.

219
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,240
That day at Kuaihuo Forest,

220
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,700
we saw it with our own eyes.

221
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,120
Feifei died at the hands of the Kuaihuo King,

222
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,440
right in front of us.

223
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,220
The most urgent matter now

224
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,800
is that we need to carefully plan

225
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,400
when to make our move against the Kuaihuo King.

226
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,010
Let's wait a bit longer.

227
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,080
Even if there's only a one in ten thousand chance she's Feifei,

228
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,140
I don't want her to be in danger again.

229
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,000
Brother Shen.

230
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,400
You're here.

231
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,600
The incense you prepared

232
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,960
is colorless and odorless.

233
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,690
Chai Yuguan hasn't noticed it.

234
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,440
Very good.

235
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Here's the dosage for later.

236
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,680
Are the red candles I requested

237
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,680
all prepared?

238
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,520
I've already put the soul-stealing powder in the red candles

239
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,720
and bribed the supplier at Kuaihuo Palace.

240
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,080
Soon.

241
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,560
Zhan Qiming will disguise himself as a porter

242
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,090
and deliver them together.

243
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,400
This soul-breaking incense,

244
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,240
though it won't take effect immediately,

245
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
its potency will accumulate in his body.

246
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
On the wedding day,

247
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,800
when combined with the soul-stealing powder in the red candles,

248
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,680
Chai Yuguan's blood flow will reverse

249
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,340
and his tendons will rupture.

250
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,810
When burning this incense,

251
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,520
remember to hold your breath

252
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,740
to avoid being affected along with Chai Yuguan.

253
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,200
Don't worry.

254
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,440
The silver needles in acupoints

255
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,720
to change your appearance

256
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,080
may fool Chai Yuguan,

257
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,450
but they don't seem to fool him.

258
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,600
He's not well.

259
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
If you knew that,

260
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,540
you shouldn't have brought him here.

261
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,040
I just can't understand

262
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,440
what method you used

263
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,210
to make Chai Yuguan agree to marry you.

264
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:54,960
Do you know

265
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,040
Chai Yuguan's sworn enemy beyond the pass?

266
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,080
Known as 'Jade Thief of Lantian,'

267
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,570
the immensely wealthy Bu Gongzhi.

268
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,520
That's right,

269
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I killed him.

270
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,480
The vast fortune he amassed beyond the pass

271
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
has now become my dowry.

272
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,640
I see.

273
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,120
I fear no man in this world

274
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,480
would refuse your marriage proposal.

275
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,080
Chai Yuguan is no exception.

276
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,640
But poor Shen Lang.

277
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,740
I used to despise lovesick fools,

278
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,170
just like my mother,

279
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,600
trapped by love

280
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,180
and regretting it her whole life.

281
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,280
But Shen Lang isn't Chai Yuguan.

282
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,320
He has genuine feelings, willing to die for you

283
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,120
and the courage to live with you.

284
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,840
I can see his sincerity.

285
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,490
If one pursues love in life,

286
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,210
perhaps it's not so clever.

287
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,120
But if one doesn't seek it...

288
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,820
There will be regrets.

289
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,780
You should at least go see him.

290
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,440
You

291
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,960
brought a sedative, didn't you?

292
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,600
Feifei.

293
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,680
You're back.

294
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,120
I'm back.

295
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,240
I've missed you so much.

296
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,880
I've missed you too.
