1
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,730
Who do you think you are?

2
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,160
Qiqi.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,560
He's not Shen Lang.

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,040
Miss Bai.

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,440
Why won't you accept the truth?

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,170
Of course I am Shen Lang.

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,520
It's just that I, Shen Lang, don't love Miss Bai.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,320
After all, there's Miss Qiqi,

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,080
such a ravishing lady from a noble family.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,760
How could I possibly fall in love with someone like Miss Bai,

11
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,000
a woman of unknown origin?

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,560
Feifei.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,720
What are you saying?

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,440
I'm certainly saying

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,000
that I love only you.

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,960
I knew something was off about the way you're speaking today.

17
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,320
You're not Shen at all,

18
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,160
Qiqi.

19
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,480
I've been found out after all.

20
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
Wang Lianhua.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,220
Don't you understand yet?

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,320
Your feelings for him

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,210
are only hurting yourself.

24
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,840
Aren't you afraid the poison will take effect?

25
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,039
Do you really think I stayed with you

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,360
because of the poison you gave me?

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,090
Don't be anxious, miss.

28
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,920
You two have deep feelings for Shen Lang.

29
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,240
Today, I'm going to do you a favor.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,040
I'll let you see clearly

31
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,960
what your dear Shen Lang truly feels.

32
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,440
Let them go.

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,079
Release them.

34
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,240
The big brother of these two lovely ladies.

35
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,800
Hero Shen has arrived.

36
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,640
Hero Shen.

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
These two ladies.

38
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,860
Have been waiting for you for so long.

39
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,560
Seeing us.

40
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,160
Are you surprised?

41
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,240
Wang Lianhua.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,440
Since you first appeared at Ghost Cave Sect,

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,280
I knew you had ulterior motives.

44
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,320
For what?

45
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
It's about this Invincible Manual again.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,360
I didn't expose you

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,960
because I thought it wasn't necessary.

48
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,620
I'm giving you one chance now.

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Let them go.

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,360
I hate that arrogant attitude of yours.

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,560
Who needs chances from you?

52
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:22,079
Now both of them are in my hands.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,280
It's you

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,480
who should kneel down

55
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,880
and beg me for a chance.

56
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,210
This is the Heart-Eating Powder I bought at a high price.

57
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,400
Just a sprinkle on the face

58
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
will burn the entire face

59
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,370
ruining their beauty forever.

60
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,760
Look at these two ladies' beautiful faces.

61
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,040
Who do you think

62
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,440
deserves to have this thrown in their face?

63
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,200
The Invincible Manual.

64
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,360
I'll give it to you.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,730
Just let them go.

66
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,200
It seems

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
compared to the Invincible Manual,

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,279
you care more about Miss Feifei.

69
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
Then what if

70
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,720
we compare her with Miss Qiqi?

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
What exactly do you want?

72
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,360
One Invincible Manual

73
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,120
If I let you save two lives,

74
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,640
wouldn't I be making a losing deal?

75
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,050
Today, Hero Shen can only save one person.

76
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,080
Choose.

77
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,720
Wang Lianhua,

78
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,080
why are you being so childish?

79
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,760
I told you to choose,

80
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,240
so choose.

81
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,480
One is the innocent young lady from Zhongzhou.

82
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,760
The other

83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
is a mysterious, ruthless enchantress.

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,880
I'm curious to see

85
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,570
who the great hero Shen Lang

86
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,840
will choose.

87
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,160
Choose now.

88
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,000
I can choose.

89
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,760
But before I do,

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,440
I have some questions for Bai Feifei.

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,640
After I get answers, I'll be able to make my choice.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,520
I'm only asking Feifei.

93
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,640
If I choose to save Qiqi today,

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,080
would you be upset?

95
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,480
That is Master Shen's choice.

96
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,040
I wouldn't.

97
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,280
You truly don't care at all?

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,440
Why should I care?

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,640
Are you sure about that?

100
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,000
Of course I am.

101
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,320
Then don't blame me.

102
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,040
Master Shen who promised to protect me completely,

103
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
has turned cold so quickly.

104
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,080
I said I would follow you to the ends of the earth with my life.

105
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,600
I believed you when you said it.

106
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,960
My heart is sincere toward you.

107
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,800
You know that.

108
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,280
Do you not believe it or not want to believe it?

109
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,080
How sincere is Master Shen?

110
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,680
Take out your heart and we'll see.

111
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,240
I dare to show it. Do you dare to look?

112
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,680
Then show me.

113
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,200
Everyone shut up!

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
Wang Lianhua,

115
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,840
you bastard!

116
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,170
I can't believe I considered you a friend.

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,650
Alright, stop fighting, Qiqi.

118
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,600
If I didn't give you this chance,

119
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,520
how would you see your beloved Shen for who he really is?

120
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,250
Just look at who he saved first.

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,720
Since ancient times, the martial world has only been about self-interest.

122
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,880
Where is there room for genuine feelings?

123
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,740
Without this carefully orchestrated show of mine,

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,090
if I hadn't forced this either-or choice,

125
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,560
I couldn't have given you all this precious gift of truth.

126
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,080
What bullshit gift?

127
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,610
You just want the Invincible Treasure Guide, don't you?

128
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,400
I refuse to give it to you.

129
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,880
Feifei!

130
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,840
Feifei!

131
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,360
Feifei!

132
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,810
Plum Blossom Darts from Weiwu Escort Agency.

133
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,720
I'll handle this.

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,500
She's in your care now.

135
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,640
Remember what you promised Feifei.

136
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,000
Or I won't let you off.

137
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,120
Stop right there.

138
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,820
Young Master Wang.

139
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,320
I know you want the Invincible Mirror.

140
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
Why don't we join forces?

141
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,000
We could share it.

142
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
Join forces with you?

143
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,840
Who do you think you are?

144
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
If you refuse the easy way, you'll have to take the hard way.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,530
Then I might as well kill you

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,039
and take the Invincible Mirror afterward.

147
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,880
Die!

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,799
Stop!

149
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,380
Don't move.

150
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,160
Everyone,

151
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,920
I am the daughter of Zhu Baiwan, the richest man in Zhongzhou.

152
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,980
My name is Zhu Qiqi.

153
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,040
Being here today

154
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,100
and meeting all of you from Weiwu Escort Agency is fate.

155
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
If you would show mercy

156
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,130
and release this young man,

157
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,920
with this token of mine,

158
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,000
you can go to any Zhu family bank

159
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,940
and withdraw 10 taels of gold.

160
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,640
Yes, yes.

161
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
I can vouch for her.

162
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,120
She is Zhu Qiqi.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,400
Her family is extremely wealthy,

164
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,440
as you all know.

165
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,040
Forget about 10 taels of gold,

166
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,970
even 100 taels would be no problem.

167
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,560
Besides,

168
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,960
just five li from here,

169
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,420
there's a Zhu family bank.

170
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,210
You can get the gold by dawn.

171
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,610
Alright,

172
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,800
I'll make the decision.

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,400
100 taels.

174
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,600
Go get it quickly.

175
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,010
Is this for real?

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
100 taels of gold!

177
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,760
Young master,

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,000
I think we might as well take it.

179
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,500
We can always seize the Invincible Treasure Mirror later.

180
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,020
Yes, young master,

181
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,480
how can we refuse gold

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,940
that's being handed to us?

183
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,800
Good.

184
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,380
Then it's settled.

185
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,730
Why are you here?

186
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,760
I asked Brother Shen to take Bai Feifei

187
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,360
to recover from their injuries.

188
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,440
As for me,

189
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,640
I'm obviously here to keep an eye on you.

190
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,120
So you won't try any more tricks to harm us.

191
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Why don't you use your soul-consuming powder on them?

192
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,100
What soul-consuming powder are you talking about?

193
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,160
Dragon beard candy.

194
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,000
Want some?

195
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,780
I'll pass on the candy.

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
These 100 taels of gold,

197
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,800
half for you,

198
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,720
half for me.

199
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,640
What are you surprised about?

200
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,000
Your life isn't even worth 50 taels.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,600
Fine then.

202
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,000
You can stay here.

203
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,730
I'm leaving.

204
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,160
My life

205
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,620
is certainly not as valuable as Miss Qiqi's.

206
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,100
How about this:

207
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,400
you take 90%, I take 10%.

208
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,260
What do you say?

209
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,160
That works.

210
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,050
Give it to me now.

211
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,540
This is worth 10 taels, right?

212
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,560
The quality is just average.

213
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,640
It's top quality.

214
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,080
These individual pieces

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:38,960
aren't worth much.

216
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,840
Fine.

217
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,440
Take it all.

218
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,340
Satisfied now?

219
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,720
That's all I have.

220
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,600
Really nothing left?

221
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,800
Don't believe me? Search for yourself.

222
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,180
Never mind.

223
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,210
I'll reluctantly forgive you.

224
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Wait.
