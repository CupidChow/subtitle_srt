1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:25,640
I have wronged you,

2
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,120
but all along this journey,

3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,280
I've protected and sheltered you

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,240
because my feelings are genuine.

5
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,620
Special Envoy Fan.

6
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,160
I've never heard

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,240
that the young palace master had a fondness for drinking.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,570
How is it after one visit to Yunmeng Manor,

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,130
she's now drinking like there's no tomorrow?

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,220
She's already had three bottles now.

11
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,900
Don't disturb her.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,280
You may go now.

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,120
Since you're here,

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,880
come in.

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,120
Didn't I tell you

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,490
that if we met again,

17
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,840
I would take your life?

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,960
Qiqi asked me

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,900
if you cut all ties with me,

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,120
could I bear it?

21
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,720
These days,

22
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,180
I've been thinking about this question too.

23
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,960
Whether sober or drunk,

24
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,300
my answer is always that I cannot.

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,720
You can't let go.

26
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,560
What does that have to do with me?

27
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,400
Feifei.

28
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,540
I know you hate me for lying to you.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,760
But even before I knew your identity,

30
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,600
when we first met here,

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,320
I was already drawn to you uncontrollably.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,320
There were countless moments

33
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,980
when I wanted to tell you the truth about who I am.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
But I didn't dare.

35
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,280
I didn't have the courage

36
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,520
to destroy

37
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,960
the precious happiness we found together.

38
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,800
Happiness?

39
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,120
Since ten years ago...

40
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,600
The moment my mother died,

41
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,440
there was no more happiness

42
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,120
in my life.

43
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,960
Then what about the feelings

44
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,100
between us? Don't they matter at all?

45
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,000
Feelings?

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,360
Shen Lang.

47
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,600
I did love you once.

48
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,480
But now

49
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,680
I wish you were dead.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,640
I can't kill you right now,

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,800
but don't push me.

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,240
Feifei.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,840
I wonder if you remember

54
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,980
I once traded this wooden hairpin

55
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,280
for a promise from you.

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,020
Let this be our pledge.

57
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,920
If you ever sneak away again,

58
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,680
you'll grant me one wish.

59
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,660
What do you say?

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,760
If that promise still holds...

61
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,980
The Bai Feifei who made that promise is dead.

62
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,500
Only the Master of Ghost Palace remains.

63
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,440
I don't care if you're Bai Feifei

64
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,100
or the Master of Ghost Palace.

65
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,040
In this lifetime,

66
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,160
I've already committed myself to you alone.

67
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,880
I don't care how you treat me.

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,400
The fact that you are my wife

69
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,960
will never change.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
Stop telling me

71
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,409
those meaningless fantasies.

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,880
I've spared you once,

73
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,680
twice,

74
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,360
but there won't be a third time.

75
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,520
Fan Wujiu.

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
See him out.

77
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,770
Master Shen,

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,760
please.

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,560
Master Shen.

80
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,560
Feifei wants to take responsibility for you.

81
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
I want to be with you

82
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,640
through life and death.

83
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,800
To the ends of the earth,

84
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,400
I'll follow you with my life.

85
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,490
Don't even think about leaving me behind.

86
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,720
Our paths were never meant to cross.

87
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,780
The path you choose

88
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
is the one I'll protect you on.

89
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,800
Since you've followed all the way here,

90
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,000
why not step forward?

91
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,490
Only the one who tied the knot can untie it.

92
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,320
I'm not who he needs right now.

93
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
It's the same for Shen,

94
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Feifei and Wang Lianhua.

95
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,540
Everything happening now

96
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
was caused by one person.

97
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,520
Miss Qiqi,

98
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,880
you're talking about Chai Yuguan, right?

99
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,600
If we can capture Chai Yuguan, the mastermind,

100
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,480
they

101
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,440
might all be safe.

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,000
Chai Yuguan's bounty notice

103
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,200
has been out for days.

104
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
Everyone in the martial world knows

105
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,880
he's the Happy King from beyond the pass.

106
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,010
And because of this,

107
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,680
everyone is hesitant

108
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,520
and no one dares to accept the challenge.

109
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,680
But the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

110
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,210
has been making some moves,

111
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,320
seemingly

112
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,970
deliberately opposing us.

113
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,210
What are they doing?

114
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,800
The two masters of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect,

115
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger,

116
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,400
have sent out notices

117
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,800
inviting martial artists

118
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,120
to Yuebin Tower in three days

119
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
for a Heroes' Banquet.

120
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,360
Heroes' Banquet?

121
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,720
They say

122
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,000
it's to discuss

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,040
welcoming the Happy King into the pass.

124
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,700
Renyi Manor puts out a bounty,

125
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,480
yet the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect wants to welcome him.

126
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,200
They're clearly opposing Renyi Manor.

127
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Master Cold,

128
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,820
gather our people.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,960
In three days,

130
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,840
we'll go to Yuebin Tower

131
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,480
to meet Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger.

132
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,690
Alright.

133
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,400
Heroes' Banquet.

134
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,440
Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger have set rules:

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,440
for men,

136
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,600
five taels of silver per person.

137
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
And they charge money.

138
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
What about women?

139
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,360
Women enter for free.

140
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,560
Anyone interested

141
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,760
is welcome to attend.

142
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,240
Interesting.

143
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,659
If I bring people from Yunmeng Manor,

144
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,090
wouldn't I only need to pay for one person?

145
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,039
Young master,

146
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,370
do you really want to go?

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,800
But Chai Yuguan

148
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,880
is our enemy.

149
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,680
Those who attend

150
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,900
will all be their supporters.

151
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,920
Besides, the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect is doing this

152
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,520
just to provoke Renyi Manor.

153
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,120
Miss Qiqi

154
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,460
will surely go as well.

155
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,560
When that happens,

156
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,960
whose side will you take?

157
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
They can stir up trouble.

158
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,020
We'll just watch the show.

159
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,240
No matter the outcome,

160
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,000
for our Yunmeng Manor,

161
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
it's all beneficial.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,480
Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger

163
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,880
aren't skilled fighters.

164
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
If their heroes' banquet

165
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,520
gains influence,

166
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
we can kill them

167
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,480
and take their place.

168
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,840
Then we'll lead the way

169
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,800
to welcome the Merry King into the pass.

170
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,200
Kill quickly afterward.

171
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,680
If it doesn't amount to anything,

172
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
at least we can have some fun, right?

173
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
Since you believe

174
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,720
that the two masters of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

175
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,180
aren't skilled fighters,

176
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
why not just capture them

177
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,160
and extract the information directly?

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,890
Then we wouldn't need to attend

179
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
that Heroes' Banquet.

180
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,680
You want to go there

181
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,520
but in truth,

182
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,060
you're worried about Miss Qiqi, aren't you?

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,330
Women in this world come in all varieties,

184
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,240
but broadly speaking,

185
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,800
there are only two types.

186
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,540
One type is like my mother.

187
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Full of schemes and calculations,

188
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,440
yet in front of others,

189
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,970
they always pretend to be innocent and naive.

190
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
They can fool all men in the world.

191
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,050
The other type is like Zhu Qiqi.

192
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,730
Knowing nothing at all,

193
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,100
yet still pretending to be a female hero.

194
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,170
Always taking responsibility upon herself,

195
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,010
ending up completely wounded.

196
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,320
But these two types of women

197
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
are equally deserving of love.

198
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,800
Pity that the men they encounter

199
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,880
are never any good.

200
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,160
Sir, you've just

201
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
included yourself in that criticism.

202
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,650
I never thought of myself as a good person.

203
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Those attending the Heroes' Banquet, line up here to pay.

204
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,280
The Heroes' Banquet costs 5 taels of silver.

205
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,160
Those two old demons from the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

206
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
are truly greedy.

207
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,560
Fool.

208
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,040
Everyone paying these 5 taels to enter

209
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,500
is actually placing a bet.

210
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,520
A bet?

211
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,090
Betting on what?

212
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,760
If the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

213
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,360
truly has Chai Yuguan's support,

214
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
once he enters the pass,

215
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,640
those attending this Heroes' Banquet today

216
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,560
will become great ministers under the Merry King.

217
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,720
From then on, in the martial world,

218
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,380
they'll command great power.

219
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,440
Miss,

220
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,960
you're quite strapping.

221
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,040
How rude!

222
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,370
How dare you talk about a young lady like that?

223
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,600
So vulgar.

224
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,560
Enter.

225
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,840
Ridiculous.

226
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,680
Sister, wait for me!

227
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,200
To save these 5 taels of silver,

228
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
it wasn't easy for me.

229
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,020
Let go of me!

230
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:42,980
Sister!

231
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,840
There are so many men here.

232
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,840
I'm scared.

233
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,600
I feared that my sister wouldn't acknowledge our kinship

234
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,960
and would refuse to recognize me as her brother.

235
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,490
So naturally I had to pretend to be her sister.

236
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,960
We are blood relatives after all.

237
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,920
If we take action,

238
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,520
we should stand united against others.

239
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,240
My dear sister.

240
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,280
You've known who he was all along

241
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,280
but refused to tell me.

242
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,080
You wanted to use me to kill him.

243
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,640
Sooner or later,

244
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,440
I would have told you anyway.

245
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
You should be thanking me.

246
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,080
Now that you know the truth,

247
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,040
don't you want to kill him yourself?

248
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
Are you saying that because of love,

249
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,240
you can ignore your mother's murder?

250
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,660
You can't bear to hurt him.

251
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,040
Who says I won't kill him?

252
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,160
Then let me help you, sister.

253
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,240
This is the secret technique of my Yunmeng Manor.

254
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,040
Get out!

255
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,700
The two masters of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect have arrived.

256
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,520
Greetings to both sect leaders.

257
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,280
Everyone,

258
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I have arranged this heroes' banquet today

259
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,800
to discuss with all of you

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,240
about welcoming our martial arts supreme leader, the Happy King, into the pass.

261
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,900
Therefore,

262
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
everyone who has come to this banquet today

263
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,440
intends to join our Happy King.

264
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,480
Does anyone have any objections?

265
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,840
No.

266
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,080
No objections.

267
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,720
Master Shen.

268
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
Renyi Manor has posted a notice to capture the Merry King.

269
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,700
Why have you come to our heroes' banquet?

270
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,040
It seems Brother Shen knows which way the wind blows.

271
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,300
Nowadays, Renyi Manor

272
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,810
is simply overestimating its abilities.

273
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,000
Everyone.

274
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,160
Renyi Manor opposing the Merry King

275
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,090
means opposing all of us heroes present here.

276
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,440
Don't you all agree?

277
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,400
That's right.

278
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,240
Our Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect

279
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,100
will soon welcome the Merry King.

280
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,960
If you all are willing to help,

281
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,360
I would be most grateful.

282
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,760
Today, with this cup of sake,

283
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,760
I toast to you all.

284
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,480
Both masters are welcoming the Merry King.

285
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,200
The purpose is to support the Merry King

286
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,520
to rule the martial arts world of the Central Plains.

287
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,440
Our young hero Shen,

288
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,680
why aren't you willing to raise your cup?

289
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,340
Could it be that in your heart,

290
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,480
you have other thoughts?

291
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,240
As this young lady said,

292
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,680
I

293
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,360
indeed have some other ideas.

294
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,840
What?

295
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,360
Shen,

296
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,130
are you unwilling to submit to the King of Joy?

297
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,360
This Shen

298
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,840
has close ties with Renyi Manor.

299
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,960
Coming to this Heroes' Banquet today,

300
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,560
he must be here as a spy.

301
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,120
Make sure to remember everyone here clearly.

302
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,360
Soon we'll all be on their wanted list.

303
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,000
Sister,

304
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm scared.

305
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,440
Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger,

306
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,280
you have half an hour to come out and confess your crimes.
