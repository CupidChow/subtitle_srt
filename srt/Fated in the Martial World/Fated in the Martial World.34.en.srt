1
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,040
Bai Feifei

2
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,280
This feeling

3
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,300
isn't from drinking too much.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,890
Chai Yuguan,

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,440
today's auspicious date

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,920
will be your death day.

7
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,140
How can this be?

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,490
My energy is flowing backward.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,080
Something's wrong with these red candles.

10
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,760
Now you realize?

11
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,200
Too late.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,930
Everyone, did you see that?

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,020
The Pleasure King Chai Yuguan

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,400
disregards all moral principles

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,599
and wants to marry his own daughter.

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,860
This is the martial arts leader you all respect.

17
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,560
No wonder the Pleasure King wanted to recruit Master Shen.

18
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,960
He was using the title of Jiuzhou King

19
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,400
to commit incest and immorality.

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,000
Such behavior

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,280
is no different from that of beasts!

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
That's right!

23
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,759
You opportunistic cowards

24
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:36,600
shut up!

25
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,840
Bai Feifei.

26
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,759
You went to great lengths to disguise yourself to kill me,

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,060
you even went so far

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,880
as to wound Shen Lang to gain my trust.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,920
How vicious you are!

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,000
You not only want my life,

31
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,200
but also want to make me a laughingstock of the martial world.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,720
I've achieved my purpose.

33
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,040
Today

34
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,720
is the day you die.

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,560
Run! They're fighting!

36
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,200
Impossible!

37
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,200
I prepared the incense and red candles myself.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
There couldn't be a mistake.

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,240
Good son.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,780
Your poison was quite clever.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,340
But you're still too inexperienced.

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,800
If an ordinary person were poisoned by this,

43
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,720
their blood would flow backward

44
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,120
and they would die from severed meridians.

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,960
But I've been beyond the pass

46
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,120
living among venomous creatures for years,

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,640
and I'm now immune to all poisons.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,240
This poison is lethal to ordinary people,

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,720
but for me

50
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,240
it's the best tonic.

51
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,440
I'm just curious

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,280
what disguise technique

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,400
could fool me so completely.

54
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,480
It seems you all

55
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,520
have improved since our battle at Kuaihuo Forest,

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,400
indeed made significant progress.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
But

58
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,360
it's still not enough.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,800
Shen Lang.

60
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,000
It's me.

61
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
Since she chose to hide it from you,

62
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
her mind is made up.

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,560
She asked you to take me away.

64
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,000
That's right.

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,400
It was me.

66
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,330
I was afraid Qiqi couldn't convince you to leave.

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,920
So I came to check.

68
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,970
You know I definitely won't want to leave.

69
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,600
Does it hurt?

70
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,480
Sometimes

71
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,680
a little pain can stimulate the nerves.

72
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,540
Shouldn't you know that best?

73
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,920
A wounded beast

74
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,840
is more dangerous than usual.

75
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,610
Even at a time like this,

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,660
you still try to make me laugh.

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,020
As long as one is alive,

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,320
one can laugh.

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,960
As long as we can still laugh,

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,320
we should laugh more.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,200
I believe this time we

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,080
will have the last laugh.

83
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,200
You're right.

84
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,480
We

85
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,180
will definitely have the last laugh.

86
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
But this time you must listen to me.

87
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,360
You have to leave.

88
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,720
I don't want you to witness

89
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,120
me marrying Chai Yuguan.

90
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,840
And I don't want you

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,570
to lose your life because of me.

92
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,240
Trust me.

93
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,080
After tomorrow,

94
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,490
I will surely come find you.

95
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,280
Let's go.

96
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
After we parted at the cabin,

97
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,370
you made me wait for you for 10 days.

98
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,080
In Kuaihuo Palace, you pretended to be Murou

99
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,940
and acted like you didn't know me.

100
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,360
This time,

101
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,400
I'm not going to trust you again.

102
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
Besides,

103
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,260
in Kuaihuo Forest,

104
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,130
I've already lost you once.

105
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,760
I don't want you to risk your life again.

106
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,600
But I'm very worried.

107
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,890
You're injured now.

108
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,960
You're no match for Chai Yuguan.

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
I've mastered the Three Moves of Tianjue.

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,680
Combined with your plan,

111
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,600
I'm confident

112
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,360
I can kill Chai Yuguan.

113
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,460
To give you,

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,800
my father,

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,760
and the martial arts world justice.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,840
I believe in you.

117
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,000
Shen Lang

118
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,340
Since you've already pledged loyalty to me,

119
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,640
why are you still mingling with them?

120
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,360
Your Shen family has always stood for chivalry,

121
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,800
how could they produce

122
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
such a treacherous creature like you?

123
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,600
Throughout history,

124
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,080
who defines chivalry?

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,409
What is righteousness?

126
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
Who can make the final judgment?

127
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
But after what happened last time,

128
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,960
I now understand.

129
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,600
If I can't even protect those behind me,

130
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,010
how can I speak of greater righteousness?

131
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,040
Protecting the lives I cherish,

132
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,760
doing what must be done,

133
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,040
fearless even in the face of death.

134
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,440
This

135
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,600
is my righteousness.

136
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,800
Then we'll see if you have what it takes.

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,880
Shen Lang,

138
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,000
for these intangible things,

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,679
you can't even protect

140
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,880
the woman you love most.

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
How does that feel?

142
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,560
Feifei!

143
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,920
Guards!

144
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,640
Wind Riders!

145
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,040
Where are my Wind Riders?

146
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,980
Be careful!

147
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,800
I've heard his Wind Riders

148
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
are all fierce warriors.

149
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,400
What's there to fear?

150
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,560
Worst case, we'll fight our way out together.

151
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,020
If we die, we die together.

152
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:04,840
Lord Cold.

153
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,120
Master.

154
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,400
The Wind Riders have all been eliminated.

155
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,200
Excellent.

156
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,810
Impossible.

157
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,560
I've already mastered the Invincible Manual.

158
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,080
That's impossible.

159
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
You've only learned

160
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,460
the first half of the Invincible Manual.

161
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,740
Little did you know

162
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,680
there's still one more page.

163
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,600
This last page...

164
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,040
See for yourself.

165
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,360
Disperse your power

166
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,560
and pure yang bloodline.

167
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,800
You tricked me!

168
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,280
You destroy my Ghost Palace today,

169
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,600
but you will surely meet a terrible end.

170
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,080
Forget about me.

171
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,650
Forget about the Ghost Palace.

172
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,240
Just survive.

173
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,720
Stay alive.

174
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,840
I refuse to accept this.

175
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,800
How could I possibly lose to you?

176
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,620
It wasn't me who defeated you.

177
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,600
It was everyone here today.

178
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,290
Are you really leaving?

179
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,080
All these years,

180
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,240
I've lived only for revenge.

181
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,040
And I was prepared to die for it.

182
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,760
Now that I can live,

183
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,280
For me,

184
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,610
it's like being reborn.

185
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,400
I want to see the vast rivers,

186
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,280
live freely,

187
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,490
and truly experience life.

188
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,360
Will you join her, Brother Shen?

189
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,280
Of course.

190
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,970
I'll take your hand,

191
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,400
For this lifetime,

192
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,860
we'll journey through this world together.

193
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,020
What about you?

194
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,810
What are your plans now?

195
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,280
I'm going to Renyi Manor.

196
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
I came to the martial world

197
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,080
to fight for justice.

198
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,440
Now I realize

199
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,180
there's strength in numbers.

200
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,370
Master Leng San has invited me,

201
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,360
and I'm interested in becoming the master of Renyi Manor.

202
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,290
In the future, I'll post bounties,

203
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,280
won't I become

204
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,880
the greatest heroine in the martial world?

205
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,140
I have a drinking buddy

206
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,080
called Xiongmao'er.

207
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,560
He's a rare genius that appears once in a thousand years.

208
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,040
He's already accepted my request

209
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,600
to wait for you at Renyi Manor.

210
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,480
If you encounter any trouble,

211
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,410
he'll certainly help you solve it.

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,640
With me around,

213
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,360
why would Qiqi need anyone else's help?

214
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,820
It's precisely because you're there

215
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,770
that I need to find someone to help!

216
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,520
Who knows what kind of trouble

217
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Brother Lianhua will cause next?

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
Brother Shen, you can rest assured.

219
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,500
I plan to compile all my knowledge

220
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,240
into a book.

221
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,570
It will be called

222
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,780
'Lianhua's Treasure Guide.'

223
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,020
'Lianhua's Treasure Guide'?

224
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,320
The 'Invincible Guide'

225
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,120
caused turmoil in the martial world for ten years.

226
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
My 'Lianhua's Treasure Guide'

227
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,120
might also make people

228
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,680
fight to the death.

229
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,200
But I've already

230
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
found an owner for it.

231
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,240
Who?

232
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,600
Certainly not someone from

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,520
the martial world's ruffians.

234
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,850
He's a young gentleman from the Li family.

235
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,800
I imagine he could earn

236
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
the title of third-ranked scholar.

237
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
It's time

238
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,560
to say goodbye.

239
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:58,960
Brother Shen.

240
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,640
Feifei.

241
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,770
When we meet again someday,

242
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,820
I'll surely make you look at me with new eyes.

243
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,680
May we each strive on our own paths.

244
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,720
Though thousands of miles apart,

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,980
we share the same wind.

246
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,570
Mountains high and roads long,

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,720
we part ways here.

248
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,380
[Wang Lianhua]

249
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,760
I won't die.

250
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Just for you and our friends.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,120
I won't die either.

252
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,040
You

253
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,170
and all of you

254
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,680
are not my concerns.

255
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,320
I hope that one day

256
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,480
we can drink and sing together again

257
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,360
and roam the world freely.

258
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,320
That day will never come.

259
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:49,960
It will.

260
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,220
I will make that day come true.

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,120
This journey is dangerous.

262
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,850
I will protect you with my life.

263
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,800
Brother Shen.

264
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,120
Feifei.

265
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,850
What exactly are you doing?

266
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,010
I'm in love with you.

267
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,130
Do you know that?

268
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,560
Our paths were never meant to cross.

269
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,490
The path you take

270
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,840
is the path I will protect you on.

271
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,360
To the ends of the earth,

272
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,800
I will follow you with my life.

273
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,440
Don't even think about leaving me behind.
