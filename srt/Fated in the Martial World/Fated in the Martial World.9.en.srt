1
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,960
I knew you would come.

2
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,280
I knew it too.

3
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,840
I can't fool you.

4
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,520
This Invincible Manual.

5
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,290
Take it back to Renyi Manor to complete your mission.

6
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,540
Our journey ends here.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,210
Our fate is over.

8
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,520
From now on,

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,539
we'll have nothing to do with each other.

10
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,920
Feifei.

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,360
I want to ask you something.

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,400
Don't ask.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,460
I have nothing to tell you.

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,460
What do you think I'm going to ask?

15
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,380
Who was that mysterious person you met at night?

16
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,960
Why did you

17
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,680
drug Master Li?

18
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,360
Why did you use me as bait to kill Tie Huahe?

19
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,080
Or why do you

20
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,850
know the Ghost Palace's Wandering Soul Needles?

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,539
You already know everything.

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,740
Ghost Seven-Orifice Powder.

23
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,960
Master.

24
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,240
Brother Lianhua, this prescription is truly miraculous.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,440
May I take a look at it?

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
I'm not concerned about these matters yet.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,040
I only have one question for you.

28
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,280
I hope you

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,740
will answer honestly.

30
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,800
Go ahead.

31
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,160
You knew using the Soul Wandering Needle would expose your identity,

32
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,360
so why did you save me?

33
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,850
Because you still have value to me.

34
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,320
Is that truly what you think?

35
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,920
From the beginning, I was using you as bait.

36
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,640
So what?

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,720
You've been in danger multiple times because of my deception.

38
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,640
So what?

39
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,960
What exactly do you want?

40
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,440
Actually, you've already grown to care for me,

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,640
worrying about my safety, haven't you?

42
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,940
There's only an abyss ahead of me.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,850
Then I'll fall into it with you.

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,240
The entire martial arts world will be against me.

45
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,360
So what?

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,079
I will carve a bloody path for you.

47
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,530
I will never have feelings for you.

48
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,280
Parting ways

49
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,320
is your wisest choice.

50
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,400
From the moment I met you,

51
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,840
wisdom has abandoned me.

52
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,610
You saved and protected me before.

53
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,290
I'll repay you with my life.

54
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,519
Consider my debt to you paid.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
From now on,

56
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,420
mountains high and roads far,

57
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,940
we owe each other nothing.

58
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,280
Silly girl,

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,570
you still don't understand

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,680
what love truly is.

61
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,800
To the ends of the earth,

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,400
I'll follow you with my life.

63
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,240
Don't think you can get rid of me.

64
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,800
Shen.

65
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,080
What are you doing in Baifei's room?

66
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,810
Didn't I tell you two to stay away from each other?

67
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,490
Whatever you want to do,

68
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,840
I will do it with you.

69
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,690
If there's an abyss ahead of me,

70
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,620
then we'll fall together.

71
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,200
But the entire martial arts world will be against me.

72
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,600
I will carve a bloody path for you.

73
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,100
Are you insane?

74
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,240
Have you all gone mad?

75
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,890
To the ends of the earth,

76
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,440
I'll follow you with my life.

77
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,280
With my life.

78
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
Such heartfelt devotion.

79
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,520
I really want to see

80
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,050
how you'll follow each other with your lives.

81
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,240
You jerk, Shen.

82
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,040
You only care about finding Feifei.

83
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,920
Go ahead.

84
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
Go find her.

85
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,360
Just go.

86
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,240
Find her.

87
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,960
You may be angry,

88
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
but don't take it out on the flowers.

89
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,600
Shen.

90
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,440
Weren't you looking for Feifei?

91
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,770
Why are you here with me?

92
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,960
Miss Qiqi, you're so charming and lively.

93
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,720
How could I bear to upset you?

94
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,679
Shen,

95
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,560
why are you acting so strange today?

96
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,800
Perhaps

97
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,060
it's because I've had a brush with death.

98
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,040
Many things

99
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,000
suddenly became clear to me.

100
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,640
Actually,

101
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,620
the most important person

102
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,520
has been by my side all along.

103
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,340
The person you're talking about,

104
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,960
is it me?

105
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
Who else

106
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,940
could it be but you?

107
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,480
But what about Feifei?

108
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,320
Won't she be upset?

109
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,320
Let me be clear.

110
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Multiple wives are not acceptable.

111
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,800
But Feifei is like my sister,

112
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
so I should have a good talk with her.

113
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,780
To spare her feelings.

114
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,800
Why don't

115
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,600
we find someone for her?

116
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,560
Who would be suitable?

117
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Wang Lianhua

118
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,840
seems to like Feifei at first sight.

119
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,640
That's suitable.

120
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,400
No, no.

121
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,060
Wang Lianhua won't do.

122
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,080
His personality is too similar to Feifei's.

123
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,160
These two similar people together

124
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
would inevitably fight.

125
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,720
I should

126
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,880
tell Father

127
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,620
to find someone reliable.

128
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,040
I'll send someone with a message to Father right away.

129
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,400
Shen.

130
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,880
At a time like this,

131
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,480
don't mention anyone else.

132
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,200
What is Bai Feifei to me?

133
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,520
In my eyes,

134
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,760
she can't compare to you at all.

135
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,040
Shen,

136
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,800
you're speaking so strangely today.

137
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,600
I'm glad that I'm in your heart,

138
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,730
that makes me happy.

139
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,480
But talking about Feifei like that

140
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,840
makes me a bit upset.

141
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
All right.

142
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,640
I won't mention her anymore.

143
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,520
Don't be angry,

144
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,240
okay?

145
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,840
Stay away from her.

146
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,320
Feifei.

147
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,480
You're here.

148
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,840
Miss Bai.

149
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,040
What's wrong?

150
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
She's jealous.

151
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Jealous of whom?

152
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,170
Who do you think you are?

153
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,640
Qiqi.

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,920
He's not Shen Lang.
