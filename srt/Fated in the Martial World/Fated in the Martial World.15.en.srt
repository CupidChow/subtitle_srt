1
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,560
Arresting people is one thing,

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,840
becoming sworn sisters is another.

3
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,280
Besides, you said before that you didn't know your birthday.

4
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,880
So today is not only for our sisterhood ceremony,

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,940
but also to celebrate your birthday.

6
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,200
You know about this too.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,240
She's been preparing for days,

8
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,240
there's no escaping today.

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,960
Haven't you noticed?

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,040
Ever since that day

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,200
when you were humiliated on this street,

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,560
now along this street,

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,480
whether homes or shops,

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,810
all have new owners.

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,480
The wealth of Fugui Manor

16
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,720
has truly opened my eyes.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,520
Trust me,

18
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,960
you must celebrate your birthday today.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,960
Otherwise, who knows

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,160
what bigger commotion she might cause.

21
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
You look like

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,400
you're just enjoying the show.

23
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
How could that be?

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,340
I was born with this smiling face.

25
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,519
It sounds like

26
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,600
you're not happy about this, Wang Lianhua.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,320
Miss Zhu is so generous to her sworn sister,

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,570
but that day cost me quite a bit of silver and gold.

29
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,740
It's not that I'm unhappy,

30
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
it's just that I

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,720
regret not being a woman like Miss Feifei.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,960
I cannot receive

33
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,360
Miss Zhu's special favor.

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,480
Feifei.

35
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,200
May I borrow your dagger?

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,480
At your service.

37
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,520
If that's the case,

38
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,160
why don't you become a woman today,

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,200
and I'll become sworn sisters with you too. How about that?

40
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,479
Just kidding.

41
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,560
Come here, Tangyuan.

42
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,740
Say to your sister,

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,800
happy birthday, Sister.

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,720
What's wrong?

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,120
Don't you recognize her?

46
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
This is the little girl you saved

47
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,940
that day on the street.

48
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,000
Miss,

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
thank you for saving me that day.

50
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,800
Happy birthday.

51
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,560
Happy birthday.

52
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,480
I've prepared a gift for you.

53
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,440
Happy birthday, Sister.

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,200
Thank you.

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,320
Happy birthday.

56
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,320
Happy birthday.

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,120
Thank you.

58
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,400
Happy birthday.

59
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,720
Happy birthday.

60
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,600
Though you don't remember them tonight,

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,720
they all still remember you.

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,920
I never thought

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,800
my birthday could be celebrated like this.

64
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,860
It's rare to see you smile so happily.

65
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,300
It seems my gift was well-chosen.

66
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
If you like it,

67
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,460
for every birthday in the future,

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,680
I'll celebrate with you just like this.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,680
Good,

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,480
every year.

71
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
I promise.

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,079
Look at how easily pleased you are.

73
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,120
There isn't even a proper theater troupe here,

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,780
and you're satisfied with these little things.

75
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,800
You have some nerve.

76
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,400
Where's your gift?

77
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,560
Didn't you trick me out of all my money?

78
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,360
How could I afford to prepare a gift?

79
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,160
I don't care.

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,560
Today you

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,720
must get my sister

82
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,120
a decent gift.

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,360
Buy it now.

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
But where can I buy one?

85
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,520
There are so many things on this street.

86
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,320
You better pick something nice.

87
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,640
I've been careless.

88
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,490
I didn't even prepare a birthday gift for you.

89
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,600
You've already given me a great gift.

90
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,560
That day when Master Leng insisted on arresting me.

91
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,000
If you hadn't protected me,

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,920
I would have been wrongfully accused.

93
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,640
Today you specifically brought Master Leng here

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,560
just to

95
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,800
protect my reputation and safety.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,930
Someone as clever as you, Miss Feifei,

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,659
nothing escapes your notice.

98
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,360
Thank you.

99
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,120
If you're thanking me,

100
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
do you have a token of gratitude?

101
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,920
A token?

102
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,320
Are you satisfied, Shen?

103
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,500
Not satisfied.

104
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,620
Sister, I throw you a birthday party,

105
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,080
and you steal from me,

106
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,160
taking my Shen away!

107
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,080
Even if I kissed him,

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,210
he's still your Shen, isn't he?

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,840
He is himself,

110
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,100
and I am myself.

111
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,970
What nonsense are you talking?

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,200
When you like someone,

113
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,560
of course you want to be close to them

114
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
and make them yours!

115
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Well in that case,

116
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,640
I like you too,

117
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,500
so what if I want to be close to you?

118
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,320
Bai Feifei, you're driving me crazy!

119
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,159
Tell me,

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,520
why did you kiss Shen?

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,960
I kissed him because I wanted to.

122
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,960
No reason needed.

123
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
Feifei.

124
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,480
One person

125
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
shouldn't casually kiss another person.

126
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,600
If you kiss someone,

127
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,330
you must take responsibility.

128
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,820
Shen, are you saying I should take responsibility for you?

129
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,400
Well,

130
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,280
that's not impossible.

131
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,640
Of course not!

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,360
If a kiss means taking responsibility,

133
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,420
then I'll take that responsibility.

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,280
Qiqi,

135
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,480
don't be ridiculous!

136
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,880
Shen, don't run away!

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,920
Brother Shen, why are you running?

138
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,520
Qiqi, I was just joking!

139
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,520
Shen,

140
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,960
you always tease me.

141
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,240
What are you thinking about?

142
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm thinking...

143
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,559
Maybe I shouldn't be so close to Shen.

144
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
It's not your fault.

145
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,040
It's just that when it comes to feelings,

146
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,500
you haven't awakened yet.

147
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,760
That kiss, for you,

148
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,720
was just natural affection,

149
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,960
an instinct.

150
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,840
Just like when you're hungry,

151
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,900
you eat something,

152
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,180
or drink tea when you're thirsty.

153
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,720
But for Shen Lang,

154
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,440
it's something else,

155
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,970
a romantic feeling you don't yet understand.

156
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,730
If Shen expects me to take responsibility like that,

157
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,600
how can I possibly handle it?

158
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,010
Where are you going?

159
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,280
I'm going to tell Shen

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,930
that from now on,

161
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,940
I won't be so close to him anymore.

162
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,440
Shen, don't run away!

163
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,400
Shen!

164
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,540
Did you hurt yourself?

165
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,410
I told you I was just joking.

166
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
Why are you crying?

167
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,840
But I wasn't joking.

168
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,840
Shen.

169
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,810
I may not be as clever as you all,

170
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,320
but I can see it clearly.

171
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,880
You like Bai Feifei.

172
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,800
When you like someone,

173
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
you want to see them,

174
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,890
you want to be with them.

175
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,040
All this time,

176
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,680
that's how I've felt about you.

177
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
But now,

178
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,440
in your eyes and heart,

179
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,640
there's only Feifei.

180
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
I don't blame you,

181
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
and I don't blame Feifei either.

182
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,480
But I'm right here.

183
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,410
Please look at me too, will you?

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:01,800
Qiqi.

185
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,860
If feelings could be controlled,

186
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
there wouldn't be

187
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,490
so many people troubled by love in this world.

188
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
Shen.

189
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,280
Master Shen.

190
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,100
Master Cold requests your presence at Renyi Manor.

191
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
What does Master Cold want with you?

192
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,360
It's time

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,500
to return the Invincible Mirror.

194
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,680
[Journey to the Ghost Cave]

195
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,880
The Invincible Manual we took

196
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,440
from Tie Huahe.

197
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,720
Now that the Invincible Manual has been recovered,

198
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,680
the late Master's spirit

199
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,280
can finally rest in peace.

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,320
However,

201
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,320
the Beggar Sect has been quite active lately.

202
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,520
I suspect Zhan Qiming's actions

203
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,380
were directed by the Beggar Sect.

204
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,240
Jin Buhuan,

205
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,480
why did Master Cold

206
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,800
ask me to come here?

207
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,680
Everyone in the martial world knows that our Renyi Manor intends

208
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,880
to nominate you as the new Manor Master.

209
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,960
The Beggar Sect instructed Zhan Qiming to act this way

210
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,560
because they want to compete

211
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,720
with you for the position of Manor Master.

212
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,600
After all,

213
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,680
I'm the one who brought

214
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,480
all this trouble to Master Shen.

215
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,200
This position of manor lord,

216
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,600
I never wanted it anyway.

217
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,320
However,

218
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
we truly cannot let it fall

219
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,300
into the hands of those villains.

220
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,400
Don't worry, Uncle Leng.

221
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,880
Since they're coming after me,

222
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,540
I have my own ways to handle it.

223
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,560
I just feel sorry for

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,480
that girl who was falsely accused of being the Ghost Palace witch.

225
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,440
Master Shen,

226
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
you should protect her well.

227
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,280
That girl has her own plans.

228
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,490
Someone I can't even figure out

229
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,120
doesn't need my concern.

230
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,360
Brother, you look tired.

231
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,240
Have some wine to refresh yourself.

232
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,840
Sure.

233
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,160
Still no confession after all this time?

234
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,400
He's very stubborn.

235
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,040
Zhan Qiming.

236
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,760
Who's behind this?

237
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,640
Tell us the truth.

238
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,240
Wang Lianhua.

239
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,040
I'm here to rescue you.

240
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,840
Greetings to both gang leaders.

241
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
I've messed up this time.

242
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,960
I have failed you.

243
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,880
I willingly accept punishment.

244
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,480
Please rise quickly.

245
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,930
You've already done very well.

246
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,440
Now everyone in the martial world knows

247
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,560
that Bai Feifei is the witch from Ghost Palace.

248
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,440
Shen Lang helped her steal the Invincible Mirror

249
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,680
endangering everyone.

250
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,410
Shen Lang no longer deserves to be the Manor Lord.

251
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
My plan has succeeded.

252
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,480
But they already know

253
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,240
that I was impersonating the Ghost Palace witch.

254
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,300
It doesn't matter.

255
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,460
Without evidence,

256
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,480
who would believe them?

257
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
Indeed.

258
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,200
Then later,

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,100
if you help me enter the Manor Lord election,

260
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,370
if Cold San confronts me directly,

261
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,880
how should I explain myself?

262
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
About that,

263
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,240
you don't need to worry.

264
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,940
I'll make sure Old Cold

265
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,640
takes his testimony to the grave.

266
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,280
Right.

267
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,240
You don't need to worry about it.

268
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Look.

269
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,380
Now there's no one to testify against us.

270
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,640
You all!

271
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,780
Dead men tell no tales.

272
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,720
Fool!

273
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,800
With your limited intelligence,

274
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,640
you couldn't even disguise yourself as a witch without being discovered.

275
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,570
Yet you still want to be Manor Lord?

276
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,840
It's time to light

277
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,880
that final fire.
