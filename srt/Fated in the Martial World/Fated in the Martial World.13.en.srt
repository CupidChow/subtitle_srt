1
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,080
Welcome, gentlemen.

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,940
Please come in.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,160
Have you heard, brother?

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,520
The annual meeting of Renyi Manor is about to begin.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,400
Yes.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
This year, Manor Lord Li Changqing passed away.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,640
The Ghost Cave Sect also failed to seize the Invincible Treasure.

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,880
Shen Lang turned their world upside down.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,360
Who knows what changes

10
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,040
will happen at this year's meeting.

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,320
The Yunmeng Fairy has lived in seclusion at Yunmeng Manor for years.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,840
She rarely involves herself in martial world affairs now.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,680
I believe

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,240
the position of Renyi Manor's lord

15
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,160
will likely go to

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,090
Master Shen as the rumors suggest.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,530
What would you four like to eat?

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,380
Today's special, please.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,880
Please wait a moment.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,560
Brother Shen.

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,680
If you became the master of Renyi Manor

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,080
that would be wonderful.

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,880
In the future,

24
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,099
our Fugui Manor could form an alliance with Renyi Manor

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,400
and join forces.

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,080
Wouldn't that be a powerful combination

27
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
with no rivals left?

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,320
Keep your voice down.

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,039
Why should I lower my voice?

30
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,800
It shows that your kung fu is excellent

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,260
and you have great reputation and prestige.

32
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Sometimes

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,120
having prestige isn't necessarily a good thing.

34
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,080
Indeed,

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,680
it can be the worst thing possible.

36
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,600
Here we go again,

37
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,090
saying things I don't understand.

38
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,440
Some may think it's a bad thing,

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,280
but I think it's a good thing.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,039
If Brother Shen doesn't want the position,

41
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,280
I'd like to take it.

42
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Young Hero Shen is so noble and virtuous.

43
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Why not give this position to me?

44
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,640
If you want to be the master,

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,840
it's not impossible.

46
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,000
But it seems

47
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,479
we'd need to change the name.

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,479
Change it to what?

49
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
The 'Absolutely Not Righteous'

50
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,440
Manor.

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,800
Or it could be called

52
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,920
the 'Never Righteous Manor.'

53
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,240
What's going on?

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,440
You can't even do your job properly.

56
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,479
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:09,960
How can you be so clumsy? Get out.

58
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,160
I didn't mean to, sir.

59
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,840
Be more careful next time.

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,440
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,920
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,079
This one is nice.

63
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,810
I'll take it.

64
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,280
No!

65
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,440
It's her.

66
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,400
That woman from Phantom Palace

67
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,730
who kidnapped the girl in broad daylight.

68
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
The kidnapped girls from the city

69
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,440
must be here at Yuebin House.

70
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,240
Shen.

71
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
Let's split up and search.

72
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,760
I refuse to believe

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,360
we can't catch that witch from Phantom Palace.

74
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,640
Everyone be careful.

75
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,280
Okay.

76
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,800
It's the witch.

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,280
The one who kidnapped us.

78
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,920
It's her.

79
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,720
Arrest this witch from Phantom Palace.

80
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,970
It wasn't me.

81
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,240
It's this witch.

82
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
It's her.

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,520
We have witnesses and evidence.

84
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,180
Bai Feifei.

85
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,400
You can't escape now.

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,320
Surrender yourself.

87
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,920
Don't touch her.

88
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,640
Let go.

89
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,760
Trust me.

90
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,400
I won't let you be wrongfully accused.

91
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,130
I don't care.

92
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,120
But I do.

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,400
What happened to your mother ten years ago

94
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
I will never let it happen again.

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,720
Trust me.

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,200
That's her.

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
We were captured

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,720
and we all saw the demon woman's face.

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,600
Master Cold,

100
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,640
Renyi Manor must bring us justice!

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,720
Please help us!

102
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,800
Please get up,

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,800
all of you.

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,520
I

105
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,520
will definitely bring you justice.

106
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,800
Are you absolutely certain?

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,250
That demon woman

108
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,560
looks exactly like me.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,200
It was you.

110
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
We couldn't be mistaken.

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,090
Master Cold,

112
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,960
these past few days,

113
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,720
Miss Bai has been with me the entire time.

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
I can guarantee

115
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,770
that the abduction of women in town

116
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,580
was absolutely not her doing.

117
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760
That day at Renyi Manor,

118
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,440
when the old master passed away,

119
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,160
this woman misled everyone

120
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
that you killed Master Li.

121
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,080
I found it suspicious back then.

122
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,100
Today I must advise you, young hero Shen,

123
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,730
don't be deceived by this demon woman.

124
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:18,880
You!

125
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,120
Thank you for your advice, Master Cold.

126
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,600
However, the label of 'evil woman'

127
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
shouldn't be applied carelessly.

128
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,660
Otherwise,

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,800
we might wrongly accuse the innocent

130
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,460
and cause a terrible mistake.

131
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,440
Besides,

132
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
since Master Cold has come here,

133
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
it must be because he received some information.

134
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,240
Where did this information come from,

135
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
and has it been verified?

136
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,880
Third Master Cold.

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,540
Stop wasting words with them.

138
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,480
Take this evil woman back to Renyi Manor

139
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,840
and torture her severely.

140
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,770
I don't believe she won't confess.

141
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,140
I'd like to see who dares to touch her.

142
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,400
Anyone who touches her today

143
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,500
is making an enemy of Fugui Manor.

144
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
Bring her up.

145
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,440
Miss.

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,600
Miss.

147
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,040
Thank you for saving my daughter.

148
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,360
Tangyuan told me everything.

149
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,840
After I was kidnapped that day,

150
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,960
you saved her.

151
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,680
I'm deeply grateful for your kindness.

152
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,840
We saw it with our own eyes.

153
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,960
She's the one who captured us.

154
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,360
Yes, she's the one who brought us here.

155
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,460
She's the one who captured us.

156
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,320
It really was her.

157
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:37,840
It was her.

158
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,680
It's her.

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
It's definitely her.

160
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,440
Yes, that's her for sure.

161
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,680
You're all sticking to your own stories.

162
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,140
How am I supposed to judge?

163
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,680
What do you want then?

164
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,560
Shen Lang.

165
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,440
Master Leng went against everyone's opinion

166
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
to clear your name

167
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,760
and recommend you as the new master of Renyi Manor.

168
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,200
How dare you be so ungrateful

169
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:57,680
siding with this vixen.

170
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Silence!

171
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,160
For this woman with ulterior motives.

172
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,880
Why bother with this?

173
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,860
You don't understand her.

174
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,010
Don't jump to conclusions.

175
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,120
Fine.

176
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,880
Then let's take her back to Renyi Manor

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,720
and find out the truth.

178
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,160
Mr. Leng.

179
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,640
You should know

180
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,240
that everyone here combined

181
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,320
is no match for me.

182
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,000
I know.

183
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
Even if I risk my life,

184
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,020
I could at most break one of your arms.

185
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,880
We've been friends.

186
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,010
I'll let you break my other arm too.

187
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
No!

188
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,770
You're willing to risk your life to protect Master Shen.

189
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,040
I can no longer compare you

190
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,520
with that witch from Phantom Palace.

191
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,320
The Renyi Manor meeting is approaching.

192
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,720
We must first investigate the matter of the Phantom Palace witch.

193
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,960
Before that,

194
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,040
Miss Bai,

195
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,760
please remain in the city

196
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,440
and do not leave.

197
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,010
This is clearly treating her like a criminal.

198
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,039
Feifei, don't worry.

199
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,600
I'll send a message to my father right away.

200
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,320
I don't believe

201
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,919
they can keep us in this city.

202
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,560
No.

203
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,210
I'm not leaving.

204
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,360
I want to stay

205
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,680
and uncover the truth.

206
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,920
She's the witch from Phantom Palace.

207
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,600
Last night, Renyi Manor forbade her from leaving the city.

208
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,260
Look, Master Leng even sent people to watch her.

209
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Ten years ago,

210
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,680
Bai Jing, the female demon from Phantom Palace,

211
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,960
killed Lord Shen Tianjun of the Nine Provinces.

212
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,000
I can't believe that even though Phantom Palace is gone,

213
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,960
she still dares to come out and cause trouble.

214
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,560
Who says she's the witch from Phantom Palace?

215
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,520
You're making false accusations.

216
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,160
I'll tear your mouths apart for this.

217
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,400
The evidence is irrefutable.

218
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,080
It's all under Renyi Manor's custody now.

219
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,940
Yet you still dare to commit evil.

220
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,280
Kill the witch from Phantom Palace!

221
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,160
Kill the witch from Phantom Palace!

222
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,880
Shut up!

223
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,000
What nonsense are you talking?

224
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,240
Kill the witch from Phantom Palace!

225
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,280
Kill her!

226
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,480
Don't push me too far.

227
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,480
Feifei.

228
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Aren't you angry?

229
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Of course I am.

230
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,320
Then why don't you beat them up?

231
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:57,960
They're obviously

232
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:00,480
just ordinary people with no martial skills.

233
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
If I were to fight them

234
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,360
in broad daylight,

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,960
this 'demon woman' title

236
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,690
would never be removed from me.

237
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,280
Someone once died with such an unjust accusation.

238
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I must endure.

239
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,260
Endure until I find the mastermind behind all this.

240
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,680
Wang Lianhua, do you even know how to practice?

241
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,760
We agreed that only I can hit you,

242
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,680
and you can't hit me back.

243
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,740
Do you understand?

244
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,520
Miss Qiqi,

245
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,200
you're being too unfair.

246
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
Well then,

247
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
maybe the spices my father sells to your family

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,970
should increase by 30%.

249
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,000
And I'll tell your mother

250
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,080
that you owe me money

251
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,000
and she needs to pay it back.

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,860
How about that?

253
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,160
Wait...

254
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,290
Can you practice or not?

255
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:01,920
This is...

256
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,780
Just answer me.

257
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
I can.

258
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,600
Are you okay?

259
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,640
It hurts.

260
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,480
You're faking it.

261
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,920
Trying to trick me.

262
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,560
It really hurts.

263
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,360
You're lying.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,520
Who made you angry today

265
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,850
that you're so furious?

266
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,560
I'm not angry.

267
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,040
Why would I be upset with those people from Renyi Manor?

268
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,560
They've been following Feifei and me all day,

269
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,960
and I didn't even fight back.

270
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,690
I've been extremely generous.

271
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,480
These people

272
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,480
are bullies who prey on the weak.

273
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,600
They're just picking on Feifei because she has no one to rely on.

274
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,480
This

275
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
is just how the martial world works.

276
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
I don't care about this damn martial world.

277
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
I have my own rules.

278
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,000
I want to become sworn sisters with Feifei.
