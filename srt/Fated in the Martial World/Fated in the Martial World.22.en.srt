1
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,120
Wang Lianhua.

2
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,500
Today is the seventh day already.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,520
If we don't find a way to rescue Brother Shen and Feifei soon,

4
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,320
they'll truly lose their lives.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,680
There are plenty of men in the world.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,940
Why do you keep thinking about Shen Lang?

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,360
He doesn't even like you.

8
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
Do you understand?

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,160
He doesn't like you.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,560
He would rather die with Bai Feifei

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,120
than ever like you.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,810
You're bullying me.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,250
You know I can't bear to hear these things.

14
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,720
Yet you deliberately poke at my wounds.

15
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,440
I hate you.

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,880
If you truly hate me,

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,960
you should marry me.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,200
That's complete nonsense.

19
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,660
Because you only have one way to deal with me.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,680
And that way

21
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,560
is to marry me.

22
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,760
After you marry me,

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,880
you can torment me for life.

24
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,660
Make me earn money for you,

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
be your slave,

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,560
and whenever things don't go your way,

27
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,890
you can throw tantrums and boss me around.

28
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,960
You see?

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,680
Besides marrying me,

30
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,360
what other way do you have

31
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,960
to vent your anger like this?

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
Though I hate you,

33
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,560
I don't want to take it out on you.

34
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,360
Wang Lianhua,

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,140
that day outside the hall,

36
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
I saw your mother hit you.

37
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
And I thought,

38
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,700
I never want to take my anger out on you again.

39
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:18,120
You also want to save Brother Shen and Feifei,

40
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,720
don't you?

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,640
That day when I snuck out and your mother caught me,

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,880
you said those things to save me,

43
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,060
didn't you?

44
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,800
I just don't understand.

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,680
Why?

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,200
You clearly care about us,

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,160
yet you always pretend to be the villain.

48
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,560
But I know.

49
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,680
You're not a bad person.

50
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,160
You truly consider us friends.

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,120
Friends...

52
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,120
For revenge, my mother

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,840
taught me martial arts techniques from all major sects since I was little.

54
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,120
I practiced every day

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
and had no friends at all.

56
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,650
When I was bored,

57
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,520
I would play with martial arts manuals and poisoned weapons

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,760
as if they were toys.

59
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,079
When I was 13,

60
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,620
there was only one time

61
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,280
when I secretly left the manor

62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,400
and made a good friend.

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,400
But the second time I went to see him,

64
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,880
I watched helplessly as

65
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,600
my mother killed him.

66
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:53,120
Friends...

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
So, Zhu Qiqi,

68
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,890
don't consider me your friend.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
Do you understand?

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,480
Wang Lianhua,

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,040
I won't die.

72
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,690
Just so you can still have a friend.

73
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,480
I won't die either.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,170
Inside your clothes

75
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,480
is a map of the underground chambers of Yunmeng Manor.

76
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
When did you put it there?

77
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
I didn't even notice.

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,400
You're awake.

79
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,200
Husband.

80
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,810
My poison...

81
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,500
It's cured.

82
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,320
Husband.

83
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,320
Did we survive?

84
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Yes, we did.

85
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,480
Now we can go fishing together at my waterfall.

86
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,760
But...

87
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
How was the poison cured?

88
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,640
Do you remember the inner energy I used that day?

89
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,840
That's the technique my father left me.

90
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,080
This technique

91
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,280
is balanced and harmonious,

92
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,960
combining both strength and gentleness.

93
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,090
When practicing it,

94
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,400
it feels like standing in bright sunshine.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,600
But why haven't I seen you use it before?

96
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,000
Feifei,

97
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,560
there's something

98
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,760
I've wanted to tell you for a long time.

99
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,620
Since we've survived this ordeal

100
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,360
and become husband and wife,

101
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,560
I feel I must tell you something.

102
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
Actually,

103
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,520
my father...

104
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,280
What's happening?

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,920
Shen!

106
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,000
Feifei!

107
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,960
Qiqi!

108
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:50,840
Qiqi!

109
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,560
Shen!

110
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,480
Feifei!

111
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,250
Thank goodness!

112
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:00,090
Thank goodness you're both alive!

113
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,120
You nearly scared me to death!

114
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm so glad I didn't arrive too late.

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,520
How did you get in here?

116
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,850
Wang Lianhua helped me.

117
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,900
The Yunmeng Fairy is absolutely insane.

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,160
Thank you both.

119
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,800
I won't be modest this time.

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,280
I'll accept your thanks.

121
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,640
At least my efforts weren't wasted.

122
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,560
Isn't this your hair ribbon?

123
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,380
Why is it tied around both your hands?

124
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,000
We.

125
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,200
Qiqi.

126
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,640
I have some good news to tell you.

127
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,540
I don't want to hear it.

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,560
What a joke.

129
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,200
We're trapped in this underground palace,

130
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,860
not knowing if we'll survive,

131
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,440
and you two still have the mood for romance.

132
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,400
It's precisely because we don't know if we'll live or die

133
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,000
that we should...

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
Stop talking.

135
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,480
You've been trapped for so many days

136
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,960
and must have suffered greatly.

137
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,980
I'm glad you're all right.

138
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,450
Wang Lianhua has prepared a carriage.

139
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
Come with me quickly.

140
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,450
This way.

141
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,720
Watch out!

142
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,440
So the Three Styles of Heavenly Extinction

143
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,160
truly has the legendary

144
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,490
secret internal martial arts technique.

145
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
No wonder you survived

146
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
after being hit by my Heavenly Cloud Five-Flower Palm.

147
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,020
We're all still alive,

148
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,890
much to your disappointment, Madam Wang.

149
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,480
Bai Feifei.

150
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,440
Are you really going to abandon

151
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
your hatred for the sake of a man?

152
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,290
Ridiculous!

153
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:14,680
My enemies

154
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,160
must die.

155
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,570
But my loved ones

156
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,160
I will protect.

157
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm not like you, Madam Wang,

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,260
who disowns all family

159
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,640
and treats your own son as a tool.

160
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,520
Being my son

161
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,840
means obeying my commands

162
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,700
and fulfilling my wishes.

163
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,080
Born for my grand plans,

164
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,840
dying for my vengeance!

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,520
Wang Lianhua is a person,

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,640
with flesh, blood and feelings.

167
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,560
He is not a tool.

168
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,160
As his friend,

169
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,860
I won't let him live like this.

170
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,400
Friend?

171
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,360
Friend...

172
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Friend.

173
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,160
You think you can

174
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,680
make him defy me?

175
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,440
Everything he does

176
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,720
is his reason for living.

177
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,540
No one can change that.

178
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,560
For this,

179
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,240
he will fight against the entire martial arts world,

180
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,520
including you,

181
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,940
these so-called friends.

182
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,010
If I want to leave today,

183
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I'm afraid Mrs. Wang cannot stop me.

184
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,800
Today I'll show you all

185
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,720
that only my son Wang Lianhua

186
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,160
is capable of avenging against that monster Chai Yuguan.

187
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,280
Mother.

188
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
Mother.

189
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,060
Mother.

190
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,160
My son.

191
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,800
Don't trust

192
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,880
anyone.

193
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,560
Love you.

194
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,840
Wake up, Mother.

195
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,360
I'll listen to you.

196
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,460
I won't make friends anymore.

197
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,360
I'll never lie to you again.

198
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,400
Please wake up.

199
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,900
I'll kill Chai Yuguan for you.

200
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,800
Let me avenge you, okay?

201
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
I'll avenge you.

202
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,520
I'll do everything you say.

203
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Mother,

204
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,000
don't leave your child behind.

205
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,320
Mother.

206
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,440
Shen Lang.

207
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
It's you.

208
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,040
You killed my mother.

209
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm going to kill you.

210
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,280
No.

211
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:25,960
Don't.

212
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,000
Let go.

213
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,240
This all happened because of me.

214
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,410
If you have any resentment,

215
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,760
take it out on me.

216
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,440
Spare me your fake sympathy.

217
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,480
In front of Bai Feifei,

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,140
haven't you acted enough?

219
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,570
What do you mean?

220
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,600
I'm saying he deceived you.

221
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,720
He's a liar.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,280
The one who killed your mother at Youling Palace ten years ago.

223
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:57,920
Wang Lianhua.

224
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,480
Go on.

225
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm saying the one who killed your mother...

226
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,120
is...

227
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
What he said

228
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,680
is true.

229
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,880
Feifei.

230
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,500
Don't call me by that name.

231
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,120
You are the son of

232
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,210
Shen Tianjun, the King of Jiuzhou.

233
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,480
I...

234
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
So 10 years ago,

235
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,000
you were the one who killed my mother.

236
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,720
I wanted to tell you.

237
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,880
Then tell me,

238
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
why did you lie to me?

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,160
I trusted you so much.

240
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,680
In the whole world,

241
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
you were the person I trusted most.

242
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,720
Do you know that?

243
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,700
So all that time you helped me,

244
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,440
protected me,

245
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,360
was it all because of guilt?

246
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,840
I do feel guilty toward you,

247
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,560
but all this time,

248
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,480
I protected you

249
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,280
because of my sincere feelings for you.

250
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,680
Kill him,

251
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
and you can avenge your mother.

252
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,120
Kill him,

253
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,240
and Chai Yuguan will be your only remaining enemy.

254
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,800
Go ahead.

255
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,120
No.
