1
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,040
Just a dead person.

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,250
I don't care who you are.

3
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,240
You don't care about me,

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,640
but don't you care about your brother Shen?

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,580
Then I'll send a message far and wide.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,920
Let everyone in the Miasma Forest know

7
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,600
who you really are.

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,320
If he finds out,

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,860
he can just kill me.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,000
What a calculating girl you are.

11
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,200
Feifei.

12
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,120
Feifei.

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,760
You're no match for Shen Lang.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,960
I can help you get out.

15
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,170
Shut your mouth.

16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,640
I will not only keep your secret,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,260
but also give you a wonderful gift later.

18
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,800
Release her now,

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,520
or I'll kill you.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,240
Bastard!

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,720
You took my gold

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,180
and dare to cause trouble!

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,680
Who are you really?

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,000
I am your destined one, miss.

25
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,090
Master Shen has two beautiful ladies accompanying him.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,800
What great fortune.

27
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,320
What exactly do you want?

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,580
Since the Invincible Mirror isn't here,

29
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,680
I'll take my leave now.

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,450
Would you mind escorting me, miss?

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,560
Brother Shen.

32
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,400
What should we do now?

33
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,040
Feifei's skills are better than his.

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,500
She must have her own plan.

35
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,960
Let's wait and see what happens.

36
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,440
Interesting.

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,380
You're afraid of Shen Lang discovering your identity.

38
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,560
What's that to you?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,680
From love comes anxiety.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,480
From love comes fear.

41
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,760
The deepest fear in your heart,

42
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,960
what exactly is it?

43
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,970
Why don't you see for yourself?

44
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:18,280
Kill her.

45
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,490
What's this?

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,240
Miss Feifei can't bring herself to kill me?

47
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,490
What did you do to me?

48
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,480
Just a soul-capturing dream technique.

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,480
It helps you see the true fear in your heart.

50
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,120
My childhood self.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
Impossible.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,560
That's right.

53
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,920
You fear

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,280
that child thrown among the dead,

55
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,440
who dared not make a sound.

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,880
Mother.

57
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,440
You watched helplessly as your mother was killed,

58
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,080
too frightened to even move.

59
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,680
So what you hate most

60
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,480
is actually yourself.

61
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,040
No.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,080
Hating your own weakness,

63
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,920
hating your own cowardice.

64
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,700
Hating myself for trembling in fear,

65
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,640
like a useless thing.

66
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,100
You're talking nonsense!

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,120
I'm grown up now.

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I'll make you all pay,

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,600
for my mother,

70
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,280
for the Ghost Palace.

71
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,370
With your lives.

72
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,120
I'll kill you!

73
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,400
Kill you!

74
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
I will kill you!

75
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,960
Kill you!

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,480
Die!

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,200
I'll kill you all.

78
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:07,120
Mother.

79
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,020
Feifei.

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm going to kill you.

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Shen is here.

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,200
Feifei.

83
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,840
Feifei, listen to me.

84
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,400
Kill you.

85
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,200
Feifei.

86
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,120
Kill you.

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,180
Calm down, Feifei.

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,680
Feifei.

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,240
I'm Shen.

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,160
Feifei.

91
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,040
I'll kill you all.

92
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,500
Feifei.

93
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,720
Feifei.

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,260
It's all right.

95
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
It's over now.

96
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,920
Shen...

97
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,680
Shen.

98
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,450
Young master, what makes you so happy?

99
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,640
Have you found the Invincible Mirror?

100
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,080
The Invincible Mirror hasn't been found yet.

101
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,880
However,

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,440
I have found

103
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,880
my half-sister.

104
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,120
Sister?

105
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,040
That old man Chai Yuguan

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,400
had a daughter with the master of Ghost Palace.

107
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,280
She's actually still alive?

108
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,640
Not only is she alive,

109
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,500
but she's also like me,

110
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,400
blessed with good looks.

111
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,640
Young master,

112
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,000
what should we do next?

113
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,680
The Invincible Mirror,

114
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,210
should we still look for it?

115
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,280
Of course we will.

116
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,440
With my sister

117
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,880
and that Shen Lang,

118
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,300
with those two around,

119
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,040
the entire martial world will become much more interesting.

120
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,600
You're awake.

121
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,210
Do you remember who I am?

122
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,919
Brother Shen.

123
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,200
What happened?

124
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,679
That old Jin.

125
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,400
I don't know which martial arts sect he's from,

126
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,460
but he drugged you.

127
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,200
Luckily, we found you in time.

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,200
Otherwise, you would've...

129
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,680
This?

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,640
You bit me.

131
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,240
And also,

132
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,880
the blood on my clothes is from you.

133
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,520
And my cloak...

134
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,920
you tore it all to pieces.

135
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,200
I,

136
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,080
your Brother Shen, don't earn bounties easily.

137
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,680
You'll have to pay me back.

138
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,600
Forget it.

139
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
I'm just kidding.

140
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,090
You don't need to pay for it.

141
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,730
Does it hurt?

142
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,020
No, it doesn't.

143
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,640
That despicable old man!

144
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,760
He took my money

145
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,960
and dared to trick me.

146
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,400
Feifei.

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,120
What?

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,090
Why are you two sitting so close together?

149
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,770
Bai Feifei, that's enough!

150
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,930
I've been tolerating you for too long.

151
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm still standing right here.

152
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
Are you treating me like I'm invisible?

153
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
Don't take advantage of being injured

154
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,770
to get close to my brother Shen.

155
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,740
I'll go find you something to eat.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,160
I was talking to her!

157
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,560
Why are you running away?

158
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,760
That old Jin

159
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,400
is truly despicable.

160
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,120
Shen,

161
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,480
what should we do now?

162
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,400
Go to Ghost Cave Sect.

163
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,760
After I chased away that old Jin,

164
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,720
I found this map on the ground.

165
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,960
I believe

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,760
it must have fallen from him.

167
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,280
I guess he's a disciple from another sect

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,720
looking for the Invincible Manual.

169
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,840
He found us first,

170
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
discovered we don't have it,

171
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,220
and his next step must be the Ghost Cave Sect.

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,360
Shen, you found my map,

173
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,400
why say it came from old Jin?

174
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,960
But Shen,

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,920
if this map fell from old Jin,

176
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,000
aren't you afraid it might be another trap?

177
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
What is fear?

178
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,800
I made a hundred-day promise after the Renyi Manor incident.

179
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,760
If I were hesitant

180
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,920
and afraid of traps,

181
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,700
why would I go to such lengths to prove my innocence?

182
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,840
Feifei,

183
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,210
don't you agree?

184
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Your innocence

185
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,760
seems quite important to you, Shen.

186
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,440
Though I'm just a man with mediocre skills

187
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,840
making a living in the martial world,

188
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,320
I cannot allow my name to be smeared

189
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,780
without clearing myself.

190
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,490
So regardless of what the truth is,

191
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,600
I will get to the bottom of this.

192
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,560
What on earth are you two talking about?

193
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:06,960
Shen,

194
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,040
the trap you're referring to

195
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,240
seems different from what I meant.

196
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,520
And what's all this about innocence?

197
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,680
Are you saying

198
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,650
someone has been plotting against you all along?

199
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,980
If that's the case,

200
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,300
we'll leave tomorrow.

201
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,920
With me, Zhu Qiqi, here,

202
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,560
I'd like to see

203
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,020
what they dare to do to you.

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,700
As expected from the brave Miss Qiqi.

205
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,120
That puts my mind at ease.

206
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,880
In that case,

207
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:36,920
let's stay here

208
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,720
and drink for three days and nights.

209
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
Once Feifei has recovered from her injuries,

210
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,480
we'll set off immediately.
