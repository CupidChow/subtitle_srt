1
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,120
I didn't expect these people to be so shortsighted

2
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,520
to be bought off with just 100 taels of gold.

3
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,120
It seems

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,690
it's definitely the Weiwu Escort Agency.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,680
Over these years,

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,080
small gangs like theirs

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,760
are finding it harder and harder to survive in the jianghu.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,600
You think everyone's like you,

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,400
Wang Lianhua?

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,280
Growing up in Yunmeng Manor,

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,480
never wanting for food or clothes.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,340
With nothing in your head but martial arts manuals.

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,400
Those people do all these things

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,360
simply to survive.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,520
I hate it when you're like this,

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,320
always lecturing people.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,360
Stop wandering the jianghu.

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,160
Go back to being a schoolmaster.

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
But why would they

20
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,940
want to steal the Invincible Manual?

21
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,800
Either

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
they mistakenly believe the Invincible Manual

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,000
can help them revive their gang,

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,160
or

25
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,280
they're being manipulated by someone else.

26
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,410
Forced into these jianghu conflicts.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,720
Who hasn't stumbled into the jianghu by accident?

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,050
Isn't there one lying in the side room?

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,240
Feifei.

30
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Brother Shen.

31
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,640
What did you

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,920
say to Feifei in the forest today?

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,440
'To the ends of the earth,

34
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,100
I'll follow you with my life.'

35
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,240
No matter what,

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,160
we still need to hurry

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,920
and return the Invincible Manual to Renyi Manor.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,840
Otherwise,

39
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,729
we'll be trapped in this conflict with no way out.

40
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
Why are you avoiding Miss Qiqi's question?

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,650
Young Hero Shen.

42
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,680
Either make things clear,

43
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,680
or if Miss Qiqi

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,800
can't accept it,

45
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,810
we might as well have a farewell dinner today.

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,280
Farewell dinner?

47
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
I think you'll be the first to leave.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080
Brother Shen and I were getting along just fine.

49
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,920
It's all your fault for deliberately,

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,120
deliberately trying to drive us apart.

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,120
Now you want to abandon Feifei too.

52
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,880
Split up?

53
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,180
Fine, let's split up then.

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,600
[Revenge not yet taken]

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,440
Do you want to repeat your mother's mistakes,

56
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
ruined by a man?

57
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,840
Brother Shen.

58
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,840
In today's jianghu, there are only interests.

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,770
Where are true friends to be found?

60
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,810
You still don't understand

61
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,800
what love truly is.

62
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,800
Sir.

63
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,720
Sir.

64
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,520
Come in.

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,480
Please enjoy today's tea.

66
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,000
Wait.

67
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,200
Those people who were traveling with me,

68
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,260
have you seen them?

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,400
They seem to be arguing downstairs.

70
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,130
Something about splitting up.

71
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
What's wrong?

72
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,720
I guess they're afraid of danger.

73
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
There are rumors everywhere

74
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,160
that the Witch of Ghost Palace and the Invincible Mirror have reappeared here.

75
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,600
They say masters from all major sects

76
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,360
are already on their way here.

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm afraid in just a few days,

78
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,860
there will be another bloodbath.

79
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
The Witch of Ghost Palace...

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,160
How did the news leak out?

81
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,440
So many masters coming after me.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,860
What about Qiqi and Brother Shen?

83
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,360
You lost, Shen.

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,920
This wine is mine now.

85
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:08,000
You all knew I was planning to leave on my own?

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Of course.

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,520
What else?

88
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,920
Obviously.

89
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,850
Your horse-riding posture

90
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,180
still needs some work.

91
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,600
Here,

92
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,460
let me show you.

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,080
What are you doing?

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,960
You said my riding was wrong,

95
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,360
so I'll ride you instead.

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,640
Miss Qiqi,

97
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,600
you're a rare beauty

98
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,400
with many talents.

99
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,880
You can't even flatter properly.

100
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,240
What rare beauty?

101
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,250
I'm clearly a heroine among women.

102
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,560
Try again.

103
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, yes, yes.

104
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,880
Miss Qiqi is so valiant,

105
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,920
a heroine among women,

106
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,240
truly a Mulan among flowers,

107
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,770
and a phoenix among people.

108
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,000
That sounds pretty good.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,080
Those two are quite a pair of rivals.

110
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
Give me something that rhymes.

111
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,730
Something that rhymes?

112
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,890
Then I need to think carefully.

113
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,080
That day Wang Lianhua made me choose between the two.

114
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,410
If I had chosen Zhu Qiqi,

115
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
would you truly not have been upset?

116
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,040
No, I wouldn't.

117
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,680
You truly won't care at all?

118
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,560
Not at all.

119
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,650
Then why did you say I'm heartless?

120
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,890
Brother Shen seems affectionate,

121
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,600
but what if it's just empty words?

122
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
What does that have to do with being heartless?

123
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,440
That day in the forest,

124
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,920
I promised to follow you with my life.

125
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,600
You didn't believe me,

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,680
and you even argued with me.

127
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,140
Between us, who's really the heartless one?

128
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,730
That's only because

129
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
I could tell you were just putting on an act

130
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,080
to mislead Wang Lianhua.

131
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,360
You're getting better at talking back.

132
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,680
I learned it all from you.

133
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,200
Is there nothing good about me

134
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,659
that you could learn from?

135
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,280
All this time,

136
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,640
what has Brother Shen taught Feifei?

137
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,280
Whatever

138
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,010
Feifei has learned.

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
I never taught you

140
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
to leave without saying goodbye,

141
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,800
always trying to sneak away from me.

142
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,040
Because

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,080
everyone's talking about the Ghost Palace witch,

144
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,240
attracting all the major martial arts sects.

145
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,160
When that happens,

146
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,560
another fierce battle will be inevitable.

147
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,640
I'm scared.

148
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,920
You're afraid

149
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,080
that even with my skills, I can hardly protect you anymore.

150
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,409
It's not what you think.

151
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,159
I'm actually afraid for you.

152
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,680
You don't need to worry, Feifei.

153
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,610
I, your brother,

154
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
will make sure to protect myself

155
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,800
until I can guarantee your absolute safety.

156
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,659
So don't worry.

157
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,740
You're just afraid I'm in danger because of you.

158
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,840
But you need to understand

159
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,930
that there's not just one Shen Lang in this world.

160
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
And there's only one

161
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,080
Bai Feifei.

162
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,850
Let this be our promise.

163
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,760
If you leave quietly again,

164
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,440
you must promise me one thing.

165
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,300
What do you say?

166
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
Unfortunately, our paths are different.

167
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,290
The path you take

168
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,720
is the path I will protect you on.

169
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,400
It's just that

170
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,490
you haven't seen the Ghost Palace from ten years ago.

171
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,920
If you had seen it,

172
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,280
you probably wouldn't want to walk the same path as me.

173
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,560
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

174
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,760
We don't need to rush.

175
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,570
Let's rest here for a while.

176
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Where's Shen and the others?

177
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,920
They went ahead to get some wine.

178
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,690
The witch from Youling Palace!

179
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,360
Run!

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,130
The witch from Youling Palace!

181
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,020
Feifei,

182
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
let's join forces

183
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,020
and kill this witch from Youling Palace.

184
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,420
Just the two of you?

185
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,500
You really don't take my Youling Palace seriously.

186
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,320
Who are you?

187
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,560
Feifei,

188
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,160
are you scared out of your mind?

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,560
The witch from Youling Palace,

190
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,690
who else could it be?

191
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,640
What?

192
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,320
Have the youngsters in the martial world

193
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,450
already forgotten my Youling Palace?

194
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,280
Fine.

195
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,810
Today I'll make you remember it again.

196
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,880
The Phantom Palace was destroyed decades ago

197
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,320
and had vanished without a trace.

198
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,240
Now you've returned to cause chaos in the martial world.

199
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,900
What exactly is your purpose?

200
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,000
Of course, it's to work with Master Shen

201
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,400
to retrieve my Phantom Palace's Invincible Treasure.

202
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,520
Shen Lang has joined forces with the Phantom Palace.

203
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm grateful for Master Shen's help.

204
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Nonsense!

205
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,640
Brother Shen would never ally with the Phantom Palace.

206
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,400
You witch!

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
This is a setup!

208
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,280
Qiqi!

209
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:04,930
Let's go.

210
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,240
What's wrong?

211
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:09,980
I twisted my ankle.

212
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,800
Ouch! Take it easy.

213
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
It's just a minor injury.

214
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
If I go any slower, it'll heal by itself.

215
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,760
Is it really that bad?

216
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,220
You're making such a face.

217
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,920
Weiwu Escort Agency.

218
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Brother Shen.

219
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,740
You have no idea

220
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,160
how wicked that witch from Youling Palace is.

221
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,560
If it weren't for Feifei,

222
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,280
I would have lost my life.

223
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,560
Then you should really thank

224
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,220
that Phantom Palace witch for saving your life.

225
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,720
No, wait.

226
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,340
For sparing your life.

227
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,920
I heard that the one who ambushed us last time,

228
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,480
Zhan Qiming from Weiwu Escort Agency,

229
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
disappeared after taking our gold.

230
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,360
It must be related to that Phantom Palace witch.

231
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,160
Brother Shen,

232
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,760
you must kill that witch.

233
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,400
Careful.

234
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,320
Young Master.

235
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,160
We've investigated thoroughly.

236
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,560
The Weiwu Escort Agency was bewitched

237
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,960
into attacking you.

238
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
And the person behind this

239
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,800
has been spreading rumors that

240
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,720
the witch of Youling Palace has been reborn.

241
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,240
Then,

242
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,080
she disguised herself as someone from Youling Palace

243
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,800
and caused trouble everywhere.

244
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,560
The purpose

245
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,640
was to frame

246
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,500
Youling Palace and Shen Lang.

247
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,500
Could it be that

248
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,250
your identity as the master of Youling Palace has been exposed?

249
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,280
That's unlikely.

250
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,420
If someone truly knew I was Bai Jing's daughter,

251
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,600
they would have secretly plotted to eliminate me.

252
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,200
Making such a public show of impersonating me

253
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,930
must serve some other purpose.

254
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,000
The same old framing tactics again.

255
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:52,760
Back then,

256
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,280
your father Chai Yuguan conspired with the five major sects

257
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,600
under the pretext of eliminating the witch

258
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,060
to attack Youling Palace.

259
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,240
They caused everyone at Youling Palace

260
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,360
to die unjustly.

261
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,960
That's right.

262
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,640
It was Chai Yuguan who wanted to kill Shen Tianjun.

263
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,300
My mother was merely bewitched by him

264
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,720
and used as a pawn.

265
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,160
Yet she was labeled as a witch

266
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,040
and became someone who threatened their martial world.

267
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,520
It's utterly ridiculous.

268
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,680
But what is the witch's purpose

269
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,760
after all?

270
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,770
Let's wait for her to make a move first.

271
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,370
I'll go investigate the Weiwu Escort Agency.

272
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,920
Feifei is still injured.

273
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,320
Where could she go alone?

274
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,760
She's carrying the Invincible Mirror.

275
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm worried she'll get into trouble.

276
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,800
Shen, you still don't understand Miss Feifei.

277
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,920
Is it possible

278
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,280
that she's deliberately looking for trouble?

279
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
Weiwu Escort Agency.

280
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,720
Oh no!

281
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,440
Brother Shen,

282
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,570
where are you going?

283
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,060
Take good care of Qiqi.

284
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,320
I heard you've made a fortune recently.

285
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
Why didn't you tell your brothers about it?

286
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,170
Here's the deal.

287
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,410
Hand over the money like good boys.

288
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,280
From now on, your Weiwu Escort Agency

289
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,640
will be under our Beggar Clan's protection.

290
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,520
That's right.

291
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,410
Hand it over.

292
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,160
Otherwise,

293
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,080
you're not treating us like brothers,

294
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,140
and don't blame us for getting rough.

295
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,080
You...

296
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,410
You've gone too far!

297
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,200
Old fool.

298
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,400
You're dead.

299
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,440
I'll fight you to the end!

300
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,080
Get out!

301
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,920
Or else

302
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,880
you die.
