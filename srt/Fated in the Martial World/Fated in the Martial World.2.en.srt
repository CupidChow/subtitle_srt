1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,960
Hand it over.

2
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,280
How dare you!

3
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,360
Where did this young upstart come from?

4
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,400
You must be Shen Lang.

5
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,160
Although you're an old acquaintance of Master Li,

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,560
when all is said and done,

7
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
you're just a young man with no martial arts affiliation.

8
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,840
We, the Five Great Sects, are discussing important matters here.

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,570
What right do you have to speak?

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,840
Indeed, as you elders have said.

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,130
But what if the item you all want is right here with me?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
I am a disciple from the Renyi Manor branch,

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,440
Bai Feifei.

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,490
Invincible Mirror.

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,600
Here.

16
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,600
Invincible Mirror.

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,320
Invincible Mirror.

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,660
You are all righteous heroes of the martial arts world.

19
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,600
If you harass a severely injured lady here,

20
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,330
that wouldn't be honorable, would it?

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,759
Shen Lang.

22
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,240
Quickly take Miss Bai

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,370
and follow me to the inner residence to treat her wounds.

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,169
We can't let them leave just like this.

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,840
I've already treated her with acupuncture.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,000
Although her injuries aren't fully stable,

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,329
she's out of danger now.

28
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,300
She still has a high fever though.

29
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,800
Give her this medicine.

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,860
Within three days,

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,329
she will fully recover.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
Thank you, Master.

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,160
Between us,

34
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
no need for formalities.

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,840
I

36
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,240
will take my leave now.

37
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,840
Keep the treasure mirror safely sealed.

38
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,440
The slightest carelessness

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,530
could cost countless lives again.

40
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,290
Master Li asked me to bring you this medicine.

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,160
Help me up.

42
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't be afraid, miss.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,530
I put medicine in the water.

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,640
I'm not on the list.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I can't help you earn money for wine.

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,240
The martial world is so dangerous.

47
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,840
Why don't you guard against treacherous hearts?

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,440
Aren't you afraid of danger?

49
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,320
I am the danger.

50
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,400
Young hero,

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,200
perhaps you should keep your distance.

52
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Fine.

53
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,880
When you've recovered,

54
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,920
I'd like to see

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,370
just how dangerous you really are.

56
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,490
Then you'd better watch out for your life.

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Please leave now.

58
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
The big show at Renyi Manor

59
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,920
is about to begin.

60
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,770
Ghost Seven-Aperture Powder.

61
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,340
So Master Li knows about this.

62
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,260
You're from the Ghost Palace.

63
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,360
That's right.

64
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,360
I am Bai Jing's daughter,

65
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,760
Bai Feifei.

66
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,240
Ten years ago, the five major sects besieged the Ghost Palace.

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,900
You were there too, Master Li.

68
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,520
Tell me,

69
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,900
where is the person

70
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,920
who killed my mother now?

71
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,760
Fate is cruel.

72
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
Master Li.

73
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,040
Master.

74
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Shen.

75
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,780
What are you doing?

76
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
Shen Lang,

77
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,220
why did you kill Master Li?

78
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,840
Master Li

79
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,320
wasn't killed by me.

80
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,120
Your word alone isn't enough.

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,760
There's a witness in this room.

82
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,800
Miss Bai,

83
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,920
you saw it with your own eyes.

84
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,780
Don't be afraid, miss.

85
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,040
No need to be timid.

86
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
We're all here.

87
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,080
Tell us everything you saw.

88
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,540
I refuse to believe

89
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,159
that Shen Lang could kill someone

90
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,240
and get away with it.

91
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,040
That's right.

92
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Everyone,

93
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,080
I didn't see Shen killing anyone.

94
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,600
I only saw him

95
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,120
channeling his energy to help the Master.

96
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,450
When I entered the room.

97
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,560
Master Li

98
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,480
is already dead.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,300
Everyone, listen.

100
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,200
Isn't it obvious?

101
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,800
Shen Lang killed Master Li.

102
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,520
You, Shen Lang, have evil intentions.

103
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,650
You killed Master Li

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,300
to keep the Invincible Manual for yourself.

105
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,840
Shen Lang,

106
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,000
hand over the Invincible Manual now!

107
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,120
Hand it over!

108
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,960
Hand it over!

109
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Attack together!

110
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,320
Once Shen Lang is arrested,

111
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,760
we'll find the Invincible Manual.

112
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,440
Get him!

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,840
Come on!

114
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,440
Enough!

115
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,460
Our master's body is barely cold,

116
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,800
the truth hasn't been uncovered yet,

117
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,880
and you want to fight in our Renyi Manor?

118
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,960
Master Li,

119
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,740
I promise I'll help you uncover the truth

120
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,620
and avenge this wrong.

121
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,320
Give me one hundred days.

122
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
The death of Master Li

123
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,520
and the whereabouts of the Invincible Mirror.

124
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,920
I will definitely investigate until the truth comes to light

125
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,320
and give the martial world an explanation.

126
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,360
If I fail to do so,

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,799
Uncle Leng,

128
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,620
you may then put my name on Renyi Manor's wanted list

129
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,760
and let the martial world deal with me as they see fit.

130
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,919
These are Shen Lang's own words.

131
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:43,960
Yes.

132
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,560
He said this himself.

133
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,520
Miss,

134
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,520
will you come with me?

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,410
Why are you inviting me to join you?

136
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,170
You like to be a witness.

137
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,400
This time,

138
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,480
please be my witness as well.

139
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,040
Everyone, rest assured.

140
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,720
With Miss Bai here,

141
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,240
I

142
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,330
won't be able to escape.

143
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
Now Shen Lang

144
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,920
has become the one accused of killing Renyi Manor's master

145
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,880
and stealing the Invincible Mirror, a thorn in the martial world's side.

146
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,360
This journey is dangerous,

147
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,420
so I must trouble you to accompany me.

148
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,660
If that's the case,

149
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,220
perhaps we should part ways here.

150
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,120
I brought you here.

151
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
You brought the Invincible Mirror.

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,040
I killed Master Li.

153
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,200
And the Invincible Mirror is lost.

154
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,280
In their eyes,

155
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,240
both of us are implicated.

156
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,720
If I leave,

157
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,120
they'll tear you apart.

158
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,480
Therefore,

159
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,960
I must ask you to come with me.

160
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,040
I promise to protect you.

161
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,480
You can barely protect yourself,

162
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,280
yet you claim you can protect me?

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,960
I always keep my word.

164
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,520
Taking lives earns bounty.

165
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,920
But protecting me

166
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,400
won't earn you money for wine.

167
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,200
The bounty?

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,360
I don't need it.

169
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,760
As for wine,

170
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,920
I can bring my own.

171
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
On this journey,

172
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,400
I have wine.

173
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,480
Do you have stories to share?

174
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,160
I do have stories,

175
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,210
but I'm afraid you won't dare to hear them.

176
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,240
Where should we look?

177
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,600
Let's go to Luoyang Flower Market.

178
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,840
Information flows freely there,

179
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,240
we might find some clues.

180
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
Rumors are spreading in the martial world

181
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,920
that you got the Invincible Mirror after Li Changqing's death.

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,880
Along the way,

183
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,820
many will come after the Invincible Mirror.

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,720
What comes will come.

185
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm curious to see

186
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,290
how they plan to take it from me.

187
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,720
Look.

188
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,240
Here they come.

189
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,340
Hand over the Wudi Mirror.

190
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,880
My fellow heroes,

191
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,080
just a moment please.

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
The Wudi Mirror?

193
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Let me look for it.

194
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,120
Where did I put it?

195
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,960
Just a second.

196
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,200
Found it!

197
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
I'm here.

198
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
You dare trick me?

199
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Who sent you?

200
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,640
Assassins.

201
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,760
These assassins are pitiful souls.

202
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,880
Either they're children taken after their families were slaughtered,

203
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,320
or martial artists whose families are held hostage.

204
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,200
The jianghu

205
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,210
is truly rotten to the core.

206
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,440
This is the famous

207
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
Luoyang Flower Market everyone talks about.

208
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,730
It seems this is your first visit here.

209
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
All intelligence in the jianghu comes from this place.

210
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,090
Its reputation is well-deserved.

211
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,420
Bamboo pinwheels.

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Take a look, miss.

213
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Did you never play

214
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,180
with pinwheels as a child?

215
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,920
We're being watched.

216
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,320
Young Master Shen, you brought me to parade around the flower market.

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,600
Was this deliberate?

218
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,340
You're quite perceptive.

219
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,560
Everyone believes I possess the Invincible Manual now.

220
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,200
A treasure that brings trouble to its owner.

221
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,000
What's wrong?

222
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,300
Are you scared?

223
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,180
I'm not afraid.

224
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,290
They're not here for me anyway.

225
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,080
You've picked up some bad habits from me.

226
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,880
You've learned to be sarcastic.

227
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,160
I have much more to learn from you.

228
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,600
Besides sarcasm,

229
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,410
there are other things too.

230
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,520
Don't worry.

231
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,680
The flower market has rules.

232
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,120
Only information can be exchanged here.

233
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,320
No fighting allowed.

234
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,240
Just ignore these flies.

235
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,320
But if you really want to get information,

236
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,650
we should visit the flower market tavern.

237
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,000
Alright.

238
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,160
Brother Shen,

239
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,120
you go ahead to the tavern first.

240
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,570
I'd like to look around here a bit more.

241
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,480
By yourself?

242
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,610
Will you be okay?

243
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,050
I've always been alone.

244
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,760
Little girl,

245
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,420
hand over the Invincible Mirror now.

246
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,480
We

247
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,140
won't give you a hard time.

248
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,360
Stop!
