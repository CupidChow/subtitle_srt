1
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,240
Fei'er.

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,480
Your father Chai Yuguan, in order to obtain the Invincible Mirror,

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,400
betrayed me.

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,960
He even conspired with the Five Great Sects

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,360
to attack the Ghost Palace.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,090
Tonight I cannot escape death.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,880
I only want you to be safe

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
and survive.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,880
Stay alive.

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,720
Palace Master, Chai Yuguan has led his men up here.

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,520
We can't hold them back anymore.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,040
Bai Jing, the witch of Ghost Palace,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,520
murdered the King of Jiuzhou.

14
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,200
Her crimes are unforgivable!

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,920
Everyone has the right to kill you,

16
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,560
surrender now!

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,560
Bai Jing,

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,490
after all these years of marriage,

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,400
though you are my wife,

20
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,040
I cannot shield you.

21
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,640
I've invited heroes from the five great sects

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,080
to rise up against you.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,480
To carry out heaven's justice

24
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
and comfort my brother's spirit in heaven.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,570
Kill the witch and avenge the King of Jiuzhou!

26
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,680
Kill her!

27
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,720
I am the witch.

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,520
Aren't you all harboring your own sinister intentions?

29
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,200
Today,

30
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,560
you destroy my Ghost Palace.

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,330
But someday,

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,520
you will surely meet a terrible end.

33
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,320
It seems

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,120
you refuse to hand over

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
the Invincible Mirror.

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,120
Then so be it.

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,120
Do it now.

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,320
This person is the murderer.

39
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,600
Kill her.

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,320
Avenge your father.

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,560
Kill her.

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,080
Kill her.

43
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,640
Kill her.

44
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,440
Stay alive.

45
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,080
Stay alive.

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
By order of our sect,

47
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
all followers of the Ghost Palace

48
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,920
must be executed without exception.

49
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,720
There are more over there. After them!

50
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,850
Leave no survivors.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,800
Mother.

52
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,560
Mother.

53
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,960
Mother.

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,880
After the fall of the Ghost Palace,

55
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,640
the martial world fell into new conflicts.

56
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
The internal strife continued.

57
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,040
The Righteous Manor emerged

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,120
and became a powerful alliance leader.

59
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,700
Its branch was built on the former site of the Ghost Palace.

60
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,600
To demonstrate fairness in the Central Plains martial world,

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,000
the Righteous Manor erected this monument

62
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,500
to record the history of the Ghost Palace

63
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
for all martial heroes to witness.

64
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,320
Mother.

65
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,040
I've been hiding in the Righteous Manor branch for years,

66
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,900
never forgetting our blood feud.

67
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,240
Today,

68
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,220
watch as your daughter

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,480
uses the Invincible Mirror

70
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,240
to turn the martial world upside down.

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,080
I'll make this hypocritical martial world

72
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,920
accompany you in death.

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,810
Junior sister, hand over the Invincible Mirror.

74
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,040
Kill!

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,280
Master, save me!

76
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,040
I found the Invincible Manual in the library.

77
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,920
Second Uncle not only wants to steal it,

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,560
but also wants to kill me to silence me.

79
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,440
Li Tianchou!

80
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,200
Bai Feifei!

81
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,880
You trespassed into the library,

82
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,540
found the Invincible Manual,

83
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,020
hand it over immediately!

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,560
I didn't trespass.

85
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,760
This is the token Master gave me.

86
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,880
He ordered me to retrieve the Invincible Manual.

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,640
You ungrateful disciple!

88
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,280
How dare you frame your master!

89
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,720
I'll kill you right now!

90
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,850
To cleanse our sect!

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,040
Don't even think about silencing her!

92
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,800
So you've known the whereabouts of the Invincible Manual all along.

93
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
Senior Brother!

94
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,200
You openly had the Master order strict guarding of the library,

95
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,120
while secretly sending Bai Feifei to steal it.

96
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,240
The thief is the guardian himself.

97
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
What a performance you've put on!

98
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,060
Third Junior Brother!

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,920
Are you trying to rebel?

100
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,280
Die!

101
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,500
Once the Invincible Manual appears,

102
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,040
righteousness

103
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,880
becomes worthless.

104
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,280
Traitor! Where do you think you're going?

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,680
Submit to your death now!

106
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,760
Traitor!

107
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,820
Hand over the Invincible Mirror now!

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,200
Why should I?

109
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,560
The Invincible Mirror belongs to my Youling Palace.

110
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,520
Youling Palace?

111
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,010
Someone is still alive from there?

112
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm alive

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,220
so I can settle the score with you all.

114
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,680
You dare?

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
The master's expert has arrived.

116
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,000
Prepare to die.

117
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,490
That's exactly who I've been waiting for.

118
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,440
Canglang Sword.

119
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,640
Shen Lang.

120
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,600
So you're the one sent by Master Li.

121
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
That's right.

122
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,220
It's me.

123
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
Master Li ordered me to investigate what happened

124
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,360
and retrieve the Invincible Mirror.

125
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,960
Shen Lang.

126
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
The Invincible Mirror is with that witch.

127
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Kill her quickly!

128
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,400
Get the mirror

129
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
so I can personally present it to Master Li.

130
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,640
Master.

131
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,890
For the Invincible Mirror,

132
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,360
you've already killed many of our fellow disciples.

133
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,290
Please stop now.

134
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,840
You witch!

135
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,180
How dare you speak such nonsense!

136
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll kill you myself!

137
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,810
Hemostatic powder.

138
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,120
Your wounds are severe.

139
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,450
Take this to treat them.

140
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,280
Help me.

141
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,760
Have you seen enough?

142
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,240
Miss,

143
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,440
you seem to have suffered many injuries since childhood.

144
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,800
Surviving is enough.

145
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,410
You've been hunted down and ended up here.

146
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You must have suffered a great deal.

147
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,720
Before you came to Renyi Manor,

148
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
where was your home?

149
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,920
No home.

150
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,120
No family.

151
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,600
No attachments.

152
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,520
I'm the same.

153
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,010
Lost my family when I was young.

154
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,410
If I want a drink worth 1 tael today,

155
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,280
I kill someone worth 1 tael.

156
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,120
If I want a drink worth 10 taels tomorrow,

157
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,160
I kill someone worth 10 taels.

158
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,420
Today's fine wine,

159
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
why don't you try some?

160
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,000
Renyi Manor posts bounties for killing outlaws.

161
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,930
All these years wandering the martial world,

162
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,360
I've relied on

163
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,440
those bounty rewards.

164
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,360
Master Shen, you've finally returned.

165
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,520
The Manor Lord and the Five Schools have been waiting for you.

166
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,250
Master Shen,

167
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,810
please come to the hall.

168
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,160
Now that the Invincible Manual has reappeared in the martial world,

169
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,960
it has caused bloodshed at the Renyi Manor branch.

170
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,280
It's extremely dangerous.

171
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,560
We of the Beggar Clan are willing to take the lead

172
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,620
and guard it for generations to come.

173
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,680
There's no need for the Beggar Clan to trouble themselves.

174
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,840
The Invincible Manual should be kept

175
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,240
in our Qinyang Ghost Cave for safekeeping.

176
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,800
It's safer there.

177
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,930
This Invincible Manual

178
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,600
was found by disciples from my Renyi Manor branch.

179
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,520
So there's no need for you all to worry about it.

180
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,640
What do you mean by that, Chief Li?

181
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,680
Could it be

182
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,480
you want to keep it for yourself?

183
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,210
How dare you!

184
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,560
I have my own plans for this Invincible Manual.

185
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,000
Since things have come to this point,

186
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,260
what's the point of further discussion?

187
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,800
Li Changqing,

188
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,080
hand over the Invincible Mirror now!

189
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,810
Hand it over!

190
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,320
