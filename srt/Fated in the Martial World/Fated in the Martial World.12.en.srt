1
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,400
Feifei

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,960
please don't get hurt.

3
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
Line up properly.

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,400
I'm coming!

5
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm here!

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,240
I see you!

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,640
Don't run!

8
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,660
I'm going to catch you!

9
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,200
Just wait!

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,800
Don't run away!

11
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,490
I'm coming to catch you all!

12
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,519
Wait there!

13
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,520
Running so fast!

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,880
Brother Shen.

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,330
Your smile just now was beautiful.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,000
Miss Bai,

17
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,479
is this your friend?

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,000
Your friend is our friend.

19
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,160
We're just about to eat.

20
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,280
Come join us.

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Miss Bai saved our lives,

22
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,400
and Master Shen is Miss Bai's friend.

23
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,400
Today, having these two heroes

24
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,720
visit our Weiwu Escort Agency

25
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,000
is our greatest honor.

26
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Come,

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,810
let's all raise our glasses

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,530
and toast to our two guests.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,680
To our guests!

30
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,140
Cheers!

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,260
You're still injured.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,640
Drink less, please.

33
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Feifei.

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,040
You wear thorns and armor,

35
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,480
filled with hatred and anger.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,520
But I know

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,460
the softness in your bones

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,290
and the kindness in your heart.

39
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,540
Maybe I'm just deceiving you about all this.

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,940
You are indeed good at deceiving others,

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,290
but you can't necessarily fool me.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,140
Those who know and love you

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,200
naturally have the ability to discern.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,960
But no matter what,

45
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm still a demon woman with a blood feud.

46
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,120
I have

47
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,760
deceived you.

48
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm willing to be deceived.

49
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,540
If you're going to deceive me,

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,170
might as well go all the way.

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,520
Give me a chance

52
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,650
to get to know this demon woman better.

53
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Alright?

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,280
I want to eat this.

55
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,640
How can we eat without money?

56
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Wang Lianhua,

57
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,380
Brother Shen told you to take good care of me.

58
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,200
You're taking such good care of me.

59
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,860
Not only did you sell my horse,

60
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,360
but you're also making me walk all this way.

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,690
My feet are hurting from all this walking.

62
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,100
Let me tell you, Wang Lianhua,

63
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,560
I'm not walking anymore.

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,640
All our valuable belongings

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,370
were given to that Zhan Qiming.

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,440
If we hadn't sold the horses

67
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,640
for travel expenses,

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,200
how could we have made it to this city?

69
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,520
I don't care.

70
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,560
I'm hungry and I want to eat.

71
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
Eat what?

72
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,960
Didn't you want to be a female hero?

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,880
Recently in the city,

74
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,480
that witch from the Ghost Palace has kidnapped many women.

75
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,480
There are reports

76
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,680
that they often appear at Yuebin Tower.

77
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,920
We should investigate this right away.

78
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,400
I want to be a female hero,

79
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,800
not an immortal.

80
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,740
Even heroes get hungry, okay?

81
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,920
You want your Brother Shen

82
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,120
to think you're impressive, don't you?

83
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,640
So what if I do?

84
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,560
What if your Brother Shen returns

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,000
and finds out you've captured that witch from Phantom Palace,

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
what then?

87
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,360
What then?

88
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,850
Just think about it.

89
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,840
Shen Lang, who ranks first on Renyi Manor's bounty list,

90
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,600
couldn't catch someone

91
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,760
but you did.

92
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,040
After this, everyone in the martial world,

93
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,320
including your Brother Shen,

94
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,240
will see you

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,680
as someone extraordinary, Zhu Qiqi.

96
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,000
You make a good point.

97
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
You're not hungry anymore, miss?

98
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I'll eat when we get to Yuebin Tower.

99
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,840
We've been away for days.

100
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,280
Brother Lianhua and Qiqi

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,810
must be worried sick by now.

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Qiqi is straightforward and innocent.

103
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,320
My identity...

104
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,320
I promised

105
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,380
not to meddle in others' affairs.

106
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Thank you, Shen.

107
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,080
However,

108
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,960
that fake enchantress is causing such a commotion

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,920
wreaking havoc and framing you.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,440
Who could it be?

111
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,680
What would you like for dinner?

112
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,010
Mom will make it for you.

113
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,600
Red date soup.

114
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,720
This is nice.

115
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,240
Take it.

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,840
Tangyuan.

117
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,520
Tangyuan.

118
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,040
Mom!

119
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,480
Stop!

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,560
Stop, you witch!

121
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,400
Mom!

122
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,000
Tangyuan!

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,560
You again.

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,420
So persistent.

125
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,240
Kill them!

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,840
Feifei! Brother Shen!

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,800
Mom!

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,800
Nobody move!

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,330
Or I'll kill this child.

130
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,080
Step back!

131
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,460
Everyone back off!

132
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,440
Step back!

133
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,920
Move away!

134
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,520
Brother Shen, Feifei!

135
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,280
Where have you been these days?

136
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,800
Feifei wanted to find a place

137
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,760
to work at sunrise and rest at sunset.

138
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,440
I

139
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,520
took her to find a paradise away from the world.

140
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,960
Paradise?

141
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,799
Did you find it?

142
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,320
I want to see it too.

143
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
You have no idea

144
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,850
how hard I've been working these days.

145
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,200
That witch from the Ghost Palace

146
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,320
is very cunning.

147
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,400
In just a few days,

148
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,800
dozens of women have gone missing in the city.

149
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,720
Several times,

150
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,680
I was so close to catching her.

151
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,960
If you two hadn't interfered today,

152
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,570
I would have definitely caught her by now.

153
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,440
So it seems

154
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,000
Feifei and I returned

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,060
only to get in the way of Heroine Qiqi.

156
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
That's right!

157
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,120
Don't even mention it.

158
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,400
Catching criminals

159
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,660
is life-risking work.

160
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,480
But our Heroine Qiqi here

161
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,760
instead of risking her life,

162
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,220
has spent quite a fortune.

163
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,200
These days, she's been trying to catch that witch

164
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,640
and has overturned who knows how many vendor stalls.

165
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,720
Just the money paid to compensate those small merchants,

166
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,050
if converted to a bounty

167
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,760
and posted at Renyi Manor,

168
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,520
that witch would probably

169
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,840
have been caught by now.

170
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,400
Mind your own business.

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,360
I'm not short of money.

172
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
Shen told you to take good care of me,

173
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,560
but you let me go hungry.

174
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,890
I haven't settled that score with you yet.

175
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,250
Where is that witch now?

176
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,800
And those abducted women,

177
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,080
where are they being held?

178
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,280
Do you have any leads?

179
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,800
No.

180
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,740
That must have been hard work for you.

181
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,640
Speaking of clues,

182
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,760
I do have something.

183
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,240
I've been investigating secretly

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
and found that Yuebin House has recently purchased

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,800
twice as many supplies as usual.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,080
News can be covered up,

187
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,880
tracks can be erased,

188
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,280
but as long as people are alive,

189
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,640
they must eat.

190
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,200
You suspect...

191
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,000
That's right.

192
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,000
I suspect the abducted women

193
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
are all being held at Yuebin House.

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,640
We've seen at the Ghost Cult

195
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,800
that practicing the Invincible Manual

196
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,480
requires many human sacrifices.

197
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,920
What are we waiting for? We must save them!

198
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,960
Let's storm Yuebin House!

199
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,600
That witch is very cunning.

200
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,680
Don't alert her to our plans.

201
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,920
We should find an opportunity

202
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,520
to investigate first.

203
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,840
Then let's

204
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,320
eat well before we go.
