1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,280
Shen.

2
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,320
Shen.

3
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,240
Stop practicing.

4
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,600
You've barely eaten or drunk anything

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,060
and have been training non-stop for a month.

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,000
If you keep pushing yourself like this,

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,860
your body won't be able to take it.

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm fine.

9
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,760
Shen.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,520
If you're upset,

11
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,640
just cry it out or yell it out.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,160
Why torture yourself like this?

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,320
It's nothing.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,090
Kung fu requires practice.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,200
Brother Shen.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,400
He's pretending nothing happened,

17
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,920
why hurt him more?

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,530
Mind your own business.

19
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,840
These are what I've been working on,

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,700
some poisons and hidden weapons.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
Disguise techniques would be best,

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,720
but you can't learn that quickly,

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,280
better to study these little gadgets instead.

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,560
This is knockout powder,

25
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,440
just a fingernail-sized amount

26
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,920
can knock out a bull.

27
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,600
And this is Soul-Destroying Powder,

28
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,039
it can strip enemies of their inner power within 7 days.

29
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,000
And these sleeve darts,

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,240
they're the hardest to detect.

31
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,240
No matter the distance,

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,100
they can be used against enemies.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,560
I don't want your things.

34
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,840
Wang Lianhua.

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,640
Stop pretending to be nice to me.

36
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,880
Although Feifei died at Chai Yuguan's hands,

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,010
at the root of it all,

38
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,650
you're the one to blame.

39
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,360
No matter what you do,

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,720
I will never forgive you,

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,449
nor will I ever trust you again.

42
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,440
Take your things and go.

43
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
I don't care if you believe me or not,

44
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,720
but Chai Yuguan has already taken control of Zhongzhou.

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,680
This man is cunning and treacherous,

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,280
and shows no loyalty to anyone.

47
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,940
I can't let you get hurt again.

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,420
Cunning and treacherous.

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,440
Heartless.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,860
You're quite similar to Chai Yuguan in this regard.

51
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,920
You truly are his worthy son.

52
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,920
My lineage

53
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,000
is not something I could choose.

54
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,600
Let's not talk about this anymore.

55
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,920
You must learn about these poisons

56
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,480
and practice using hidden weapons.

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,800
No! No!

58
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,880
I said no!

59
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,720
Why are you so annoying?

60
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
If you refuse to learn,

61
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,120
I'll poison your dear Shen.

62
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,360
Brother Lianhua.

63
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,160
Brother Shen.

64
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,360
Let me give you some advice.

65
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,820
Instead of pestering her,

66
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,079
you'd be better off focusing

67
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:46,280
on finding Chai Yuguan's whereabouts.

68
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,079
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,810
I misjudged the situation.

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,800
I thought that with Fan Wujiu dead,

71
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,200
I could gain Chai Yuguan's trust.

72
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,060
But I was wrong.

73
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,160
She said she would never trust me again.

74
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,050
She shouldn't trust me.

75
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,540
But I trust you.

76
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,240
Didn't you just say

77
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
that you put poison in the wine?

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
No, I didn't.

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,880
At the end of the day,

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,560
I failed to protect her.

81
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,760
Chai Yuguan might be right.

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,280
I could never let go of my martial code of honor.

83
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,340
These principles of right and wrong,

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,409
to atone for my sins,

85
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,020
I impulsively crippled my own martial arts.

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,840
And for a moment of satisfaction,

87
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,720
I deceived myself

88
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,780
and avoided the truth that Chai Yuguan was an impostor.

89
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,090
In the end, I could only watch helplessly as she died before my eyes.

90
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
It was my fault.

91
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,840
You...

92
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,860
You don't blame me?

93
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,900
I know your intentions toward her were good,

94
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,720
just as they are now with Qiqi.

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Although it's only been a short month,

96
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,020
Chai Yuguan has already grown rapidly in power.

97
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,440
Now except for Ghost Palace and Renyi Manor,

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,880
from Mongolia in the north

99
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,280
to Huaiyang in the south,

100
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
almost all martial arts sects in Central Plains

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,560
have submitted to Chai Yuguan.

102
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:52,600
Now rumors are spreading throughout the jianghu

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,360
that Chai Yuguan has found himself a beauty

104
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,159
named Mu Rou.

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,000
He will hold a grand wedding ceremony.

106
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,560
Under the pretext of his wedding,

107
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
he's inviting all martial arts heroes

108
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
to Kuaihuo Palace.

109
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,240
His true intention is to use his wedding day

110
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,560
to claim supremacy in the jianghu

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,200
and become the leader of the martial arts world.

112
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,240
Shen, don't drink that!

113
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
It might be poisoned.

114
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,160
Wang Lianhua, what are you doing?

115
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,890
Wasn't killing Feifei enough?

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,840
Qiqi.

117
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,200
You misunderstood.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,040
You know what kind of person Lianhua is.

119
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,200
Don't you?

120
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,880
Besides,

121
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,210
if Feifei were still alive,

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,360
with her personality,

123
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,820
she would definitely confront Chai Yuguan.

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,400
Lianhua,

125
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,880
since you say you're prepared,

126
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,640
what's your plan?

127
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,220
On Chai Yuguan's wedding day,

128
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
we'll disguise ourselves

129
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,770
and sneak into Kuaihuo Palace.

130
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Brother Lianhua.

131
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,600
I know your disguise skills are excellent.

132
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,680
But this time,

133
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,800
I don't want to take shortcuts.

134
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,440
Otherwise we

135
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,640
would be no different from Chai Yuguan.

136
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,460
Since we've decided to seek revenge,

137
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,840
let's do it openly

138
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,280
and defeat him fair and square.

139
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
This is knockout powder.

140
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,090
This is Xiaohun powder.

141
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:12,920
This

142
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,640
is Liuhe powder.

143
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:15,880
This is

144
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,210
Heding Hong poison.

145
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
And this one.

146
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,720
All of these,

147
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,360
you need to remember them all.

148
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,290
And this one too.

149
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,560
Careful.

150
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,640
Here.

151
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,440
This is my special creation.

152
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
Though it's small,

153
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,640
hide it in your clothes.

154
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,770
Just press it gently

155
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,010
and it will kill your enemy instantly.

156
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,720
This arrow is poisoned.

157
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,200
Wang Lianhua, stop playing dead and get up.

158
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
Get up!

159
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,640
Wang Lianhua!

160
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,460
These are all poisons.

161
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,800
Is there an antidote?

162
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,520
Antidote!

163
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,440
Antidote!

164
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Wang Lianhua, you tricked me again!

165
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,180
At least I know that in your heart,

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,120
you still care about me.

167
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,920
I should poison you instead.

168
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,240
It's done.

169
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,600
Brother Shen.

170
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,610
What's done?

171
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,560
The Three Moves of Tianjue.

172
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,960
You've been obsessed for a month

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
just to practice the Three Celestial Techniques.

174
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,240
You knew all along and didn't tell me.

175
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,600
You scared me to death.

176
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,800
I thought

177
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,560
you were suicidal.

178
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,160
How could I be?

179
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,600
I always thought

180
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
the Three Celestial Techniques were just internal energy methods.

181
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,880
Now I finally understand

182
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,640
that the sword techniques

183
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,160
were hidden in the mantras my father taught me as a child.

184
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I believe Feifei is somehow

185
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,730
guiding me from beyond.

186
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,690
In the past, Jiuzhou King Shen Tianjun

187
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,440
dominated the martial arts world

188
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,840
with these supremely powerful Three Celestial Techniques.

189
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,840
Brother Shen, though your training is just beginning,

190
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,370
with our combined strength

191
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,970
we might be able to kill the Pleasure King.

192
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,840
We leave tomorrow.

193
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,320
To the Pleasure Palace.

194
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,930
My ambition knew no bounds.

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,880
I always thought those smarter than me

196
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
weren't as skilled in martial arts.

197
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,800
And those with better martial arts weren't as clever as me.

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,280
So no matter who it was,

199
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,970
I never took anyone seriously.

200
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,000
Including Chai Yuguan.

201
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,800
So,

202
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,520
you are simply

203
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,580
getting what you deserve.

204
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,560
You're right.

205
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,720
I was too clever for my own good,

206
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,960
with all my scheming.

207
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,220
As a result, I not only caused my mother's death,

208
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,040
but also Feifei's.

209
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Qiqi.

210
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,020
I don't ask for your forgiveness,

211
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,740
I only ask that you take care of yourself.

212
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,520
Now all I worry about

213
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,480
is you.

214
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,960
Just take care of yourself.

215
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,120
You've always known

216
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,680
that Shen Lang only has Bai Feifei in his heart.

217
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,960
All this time,

218
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,080
you've still followed and helped him without hesitation.

219
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,410
You even extended your love to Bai Feifei.

220
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
Is it really worth it?

221
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,480
You're wrong.

222
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,360
My feelings for Feifei aren't just because of him.

223
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,800
She's my sister.

224
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,080
She saved me once. I owe her.

225
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,120
As for whether it's worth it,

226
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,280
if I think it is, that's enough.

227
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,880
It's no one else's business.

228
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,140
It concerns me.

229
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
I envy Shen Lang.

230
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
Shen Lang is fortunate to be loved

231
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,180
by a woman as passionate as fire like you.

232
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Truly fortunate.

233
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,880
I envy him.

234
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:48,880
Then,

235
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
can you help me?

236
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,480
Please protect him completely.

237
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,840
My sword, oh my sword.

238
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,560
Tomorrow,

239
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,040
please don't fail me.

240
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,480
Congratulations on the wedding of the Merry King.

241
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,280
This cup of wedding wine.

242
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,740
Let's drink to this first.

243
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,120
Cheers.

244
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,640
Let's drink.

245
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,040
The King of Joy has unified Central Plains.

246
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,840
He will soon reign supreme in the martial arts world.

247
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
To marry such a hero as yourself,

248
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,760
I wonder what kind of beauty

249
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,960
your bride must be.

250
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,400
A true beauty isn't about looks,

251
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,880
but about charm.

252
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,560
As for this supreme charm,

253
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,680
ordinary people simply cannot appreciate it.

254
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,720
We've traveled from afar

255
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,900
to congratulate you on your wedding.

256
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,450
May we request the bride to come out

257
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,000
so we can have a look at her?

258
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,280
This supreme beauty,

259
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:28,960
this exceptional charm,

260
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,000
we certainly don't understand it.

261
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,640
But

262
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
we could at least share in your good fortune.

263
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Indeed.

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,640
What you all don't know is

265
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,000
Miss Murou has a clever mind

266
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,880
and a stubborn personality.

267
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,040
If you wish to see our lady,

268
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,600
you must follow her rules.

269
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,600
For any request,

270
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,040
you must ask in person.

271
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,100
The lady is behind the curtain

272
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
and expresses her will by beating the drum.

273
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,120
One beat means yes.

274
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,700
If there are two beats,

275
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,760
then I'm afraid

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,060
you should forget about it entirely.

277
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,600
Even this maid is so cold and distant,

278
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,260
let alone Miss Muruo herself.

279
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
Quite lively here.

280
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,080
But as long as I'm here today,

281
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
everyone present

282
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
won't be drinking any wedding wine.

283
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,160
This lady won't need to get married.

284
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,280
This wedding

285
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,730
should be canceled.

286
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,060
Let's have a funeral instead.

287
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,320
Qiqi.

288
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,600
No, I'm worried.

289
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,600
Brother Shen has just accomplished his mission.

290
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,200
And Chai Yuguan is treacherous and cunning.

291
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,320
Let's rush in together.

292
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,040
Trust him.

293
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,040
His martial arts are now on par with Chai Yuguan's.

294
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,570
If we go in together, we'll only distract him.

295
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,760
Better to wait outside

296
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,420
and act when the time is right.

297
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,960
If Shen Lang comes out,

298
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
then all will be well.

299
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,400
If it were Chai Yuguan,

300
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,770
truly worthy of being Shen Tianjun's son.

301
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,170
Learning the Three Celestial Techniques in just one month.

302
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,760
At the next Ghost Festival,

303
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,680
I must tell him this good news

304
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,320
to comfort my brother's spirit in heaven.

305
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,580
At least my father has a grave.

306
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,880
But do you remember your own daughter,

307
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,640
slaughtered by you in the wilderness,

308
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,440
her remains nowhere to be found?

309
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,360
She was just a girl,

310
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,880
merely an accessory.

311
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,480
Why should a real man care about such trivial matters?

312
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,280
Trivial matters?

313
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,440
Isn't it so?

314
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,560
You're still young.

315
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,400
There are plenty of beauties in this world.

316
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,320
Right now, behind this curtain,

317
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,380
isn't there one sitting right there?

318
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,040
With your skills,

319
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,560
if you're willing to join my ranks,

320
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,400
we could address each other as uncle and nephew.

321
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,280
Rule the martial world.

322
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
King of Pleasure.

323
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,920
Perhaps I was born

324
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,920
just to oppose you.

325
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,320
Rather than ruling the martial world,

326
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,240
I'd prefer to take your life.

327
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,360
Master Shen.

328
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,440
Master Shen has quite a temper.

329
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,240
It seems Master Shen's anger

330
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,600
can only be cooled by a beauty like me.

331
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Why don't we

332
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,200
invite Miss Murou to pour wine for Master Shen

333
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,960
and ease my burden?
