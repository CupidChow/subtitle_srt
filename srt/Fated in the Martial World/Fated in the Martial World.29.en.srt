1
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,240
As expected of the highest martial arts manual,

2
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,850
the Invincible Mirror,

3
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,240
truly formidable.

4
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,200
My lord has searched for the Invincible Mirror for years.

5
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,080
Congratulations,

6
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,880
your wish has finally come true.

7
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,480
Chai Yuguan!

8
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,039
Come out now!

9
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,530
What a coincidence.

10
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,840
Chai Yuguan.

11
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,960
The Invincible Mirror...

12
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,520
I've mastered it quite well.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,280
I used people from your estate as test subjects.

14
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,120
We're all family,

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,560
you won't blame your father,

16
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,360
will you?

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,320
I helped you. I supported you.

18
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,200
You're nothing but a treacherous scum.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
Treacherous.

20
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
You deceived Bai Feifei,

21
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,680
so why must you demand

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,400
that I keep my promises?

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,120
Today I'll kill you, you heartless,

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,680
family-betraying beast.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,760
I thought you were smart,

26
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,120
but you're just another useless fool.

27
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,520
Those who oppose me

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,560
have only one path - death.

29
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:41,920
Chai Yuguan.

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,480
You've spent your life doing evil and causing havoc in the martial world.

31
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,280
Today

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
is your day of reckoning.

33
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,480
Such children.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,120
So disrespectful.

35
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,960
Truly absurd.

36
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,320
They say practicing this technique greatly increases one's power.

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,200
It's certainly true.

38
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,240
But I'm curious.

39
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,860
Why don't you practice it?

40
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,320
If you had practiced,

41
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,600
perhaps you could have lasted a few more moves against me.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,240
Looking at your face that resembles Bai Jing so much

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
makes me hesitate to kill you.

44
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,600
I truly feel a bit reluctant.

45
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,410
However, right now,

46
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,920
if you call me father just once,

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,480
I might spare your life.

48
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,560
Never.

49
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,560
Since your martial skills are so profound,

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,520
why don't you

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,920
become my medicine vessel instead?

52
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,760
Those who practice the Invincible Manual

53
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,920
if they inhale the extreme yin energy from my Ghost Palace people,

54
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,480
will suffer from conflicting ice and fire energies within,

55
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,880
their inner power will dissipate,

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,000
essentially burning themselves from within.

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,560
Why does it have no effect on him?

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,960
Let her go.

59
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,440
Brother Shen.

60
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,760
You.

61
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't move.

62
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Wang Lianhua.

63
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,240
You bastard, let me go!

64
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,880
You've lost all your power now.

65
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,159
You're no match for him.

66
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:45,960
Don't worry about me. Just go!

67
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
I told you before.

68
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,240
I'll stay with you, in life or death.

69
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,800
Brother Shen.

70
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,120
Wang Lianhua.

71
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,080
A bunch of foolish people who don't know their limits.

72
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Go now!

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,290
If we leave, we leave together.

74
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,880
Lovers' affection

75
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,080
and tragic separation.

76
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,280
What a touching drama.

77
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,200
Shen Lang.

78
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
You want justice

79
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,090
and righteousness.

80
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,280
For these intangible ideals,

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,040
you can't even protect the woman you love most.

82
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,720
How does that feel?

83
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
I beg you,

84
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,400
let her go.

85
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Don't

86
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,640
beg him.

87
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,560
She is my wife.

88
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,360
Release her.

89
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,360
Chai Yuguan.

90
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,640
You killed my mother

91
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,360
and slaughtered everyone at Ghost Palace.

92
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,620
If I don't avenge this,

93
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,620
I'm not worthy to be human.

94
00:07:59,159 --> 00:07:59,960
Since

95
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,840
there's no way out,

96
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,000
I will

97
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,810
take you with me.

98
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,960
This is...

99
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,360
Feifei!

100
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,320
You dare to defy your bloodline and oppose me.

101
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,039
Do you know the consequences?

102
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,080
No!

103
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
No, Feifei!

104
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,400
Shen Lang.

105
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
Live on.

106
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,680
No, Feifei!

107
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,160
Feifei!

108
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
Feifei!

109
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,930
I never expected my daughter to be so unyielding.

110
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,880
What a pity.

111
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,640
She trusted the wrong person.

112
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
Chai Yuguan.

113
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
I'm going to kill you.

114
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Your father wanted to kill me too when he found out I deceived him.

115
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,400
But now

116
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
I'm still alive and well, aren't I?

117
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,040
Shen Lang.

118
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
If you weren't bound by your so-called principles,

119
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,570
perhaps my daughter would still be alive.

120
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,960
The one who killed her wasn't me.

121
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,000
It was you.

122
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,120
Chai Yuguan.

123
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,680
Brother Shen.

124
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,520
If you want to kill me,

125
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,720
wait until the next life.

126
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,040
Feifei.

127
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,520
If I'm destined to die,

128
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,330
then that's my fate.

129
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,560
Brother Shen, you don't need to save me.

130
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
Perhaps

131
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,160
saving you

132
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,480
is also my destiny.

133
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,720
Does it hurt?

134
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,800
No, it doesn't.

135
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,320
I won't be the master of the Ghost Palace anymore.

136
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,400
You don't have to be Shen Lang the hero anymore.

137
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,000
We'll settle down here

138
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,380
and live in anonymity.

139
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,140
Make this place

140
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,320
here

141
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,640
and over there

142
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,960
into what we've always imagined.

143
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,200
A gift.

144
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,280
Are you pleased with it, Shen?

145
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
If you're willing, miss,

146
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,240
would you sign this marriage certificate?

147
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,040
Shen.

148
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,930
I want to take responsibility for you.

149
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,560
I want to be with you

150
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
through life and death.

151
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,970
Heaven is our matchmaker, earth our betrothal gift.

152
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,200
From now on,

153
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,960
you are my wife.

154
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,760
From now on,

155
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,280
you are my husband.
