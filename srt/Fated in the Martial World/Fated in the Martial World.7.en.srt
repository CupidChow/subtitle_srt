1
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,440
Shen Lang

2
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,320
I have succeeded

3
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,240
with just one person missing.

4
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,960
Tie Huahe

5
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,800
Hand over the Invincible Mirror

6
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,400
and come with me to Renyi Manor to face justice.

7
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:43,840
What justice?

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,920
From today

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,960
I am the law.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160
My power from the Invincible Mirror

11
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,490
has reached 70 percent.

12
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,600
I've been waiting for you to be my medicine

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,320
to lend me your strength.

14
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,860
Who do you think you are

15
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,240
to want my brother Shen's life?

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:00,600
Qiqi

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,360
Qiqi

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
Let her go.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,640
Fine.

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,200
As you wish.

21
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:13,960
Qiqi

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,160
Get out of here!

23
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,440
Tie Huahe has gone mad.

24
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,880
His inner power is immeasurable.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,009
All of us together are no match for him.

26
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,039
If we stay any longer, we'll all die here.

27
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,680
Go now!

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,640
Qiqi!

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
What are you waiting for?

30
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,800
Go!

31
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,680
Hurry!

32
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,020
I can't hold out much longer with my inner power.

33
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,600
Hurry!

34
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
It's too late.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,360
Tie Huahe has gone mad.

36
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,120
Your revenge remains unfulfilled.

37
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,980
Are you going to die for Shen Lang?

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,980
What about avenging your mother?

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,210
Why are you standing there? Go!

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,220
What are you doing?

41
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,920
You still want to save him?

42
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,520
You still think all this time

43
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,980
Shen Lang has been helping you for no reason?

44
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,640
He's been suspicious of your identity for a long time.

45
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't believe you don't know.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,760
After I chased away that old Jin,

47
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,840
I found this map.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,300
What do you mean by afraid?

49
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,720
When I was at Renyi Manor,

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,320
I made a hundred-day promise.

51
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,040
If I were afraid of traps,

52
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,120
why would I go to such lengths

53
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,460
to prove my innocence?

54
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:35,760
Feifei,

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,090
don't you agree?

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,440
If I'm destined to die,

57
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,850
then that's my fate.

58
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,160
Perhaps

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,520
saving you

60
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,520
is my destiny too.

61
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,320
Take her away.

62
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,360
The Invincible Mirror is still in that old demon's hands.

63
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,090
Going back is clearly suicide.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,080
Think about what matters more: avenging your mother

65
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,440
or that guy Shen Lang.

66
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Keep talking,

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,680
and you'll never get the antidote from me.

68
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,279
Sister, I'm still poisoned.

69
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,839
If you lose your life,

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,660
who will give me the antidote?

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,330
Whether you live depends on your own fate.

72
00:04:59,440 --> 00:04:59,960
Feifei.

73
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
It's useless.

74
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
He's gone mad,

75
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,860
his body is invulnerable.

76
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,660
Go quickly.

77
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,920
Don't worry about me.

78
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:13,800
Feifei,

79
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,160
what are you doing?

80
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,440
Brother Shen.

81
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,240
Brother Shen.

82
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,880
You only know that the Invincible Manual is a divine martial art.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,840
But you don't know that during practice,

84
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,040
if one absorbs extreme yin blood energy,

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,970
it causes internal energy to clash like ice and fire.

86
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,920
It's like self-immolation.

87
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,160
Extreme yin blood.

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,880
Who

89
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,040
are you?

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,200
Youling Palace.

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,020
I am Bai Feifei, daughter of Bai Jing.

92
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,520
Brother Shen!

93
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,400
Brother Shen!

94
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,720
Help us!

95
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,200
The underground palace suddenly collapsed.

96
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,360
Tie Huahe must have activated the self-destruct mechanism.

97
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,200
Brother Shen!

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,680
Brother Shen!

99
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,840
Are they still inside?

100
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,570
I don't know.

101
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,360
But there should be another entrance here.

102
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,280
Brother Shen!

103
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,760
Wait for me!

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Wait for me! Don't die!

105
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Impossible. The mechanism should be here.

106
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,800
Don't die!

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,000
Wait for me.

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,360
I'm coming to save you.

109
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,280
You can't die.

110
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,040
You two can't die together.

111
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,200
I'm the one who should live and die with Brother Shen.

112
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,600
Qiqi!

113
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Here!

114
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,960
I found the entrance mechanism.

115
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,620
Brother Shen can be saved now.

116
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,600
Yes.

117
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,280
The entrance is right below.

118
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,940
I've already called for help.

119
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,720
You're awake.

120
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,100
Where is Brother Shen?

121
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,440
Next door.

122
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,490
I'm afraid he doesn't have many days left.

123
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,440
Brother Shen,

124
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,920
how are you?

125
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,040
The Iron Crane Palm technique is poisonous.

126
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,000
The cold poison in Master Shen's body

127
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,330
has already penetrated his vital organs.

128
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,480
Even if I have to

129
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
spend all the wealth of Fugui Manor,

130
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,280
I will save him.

131
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,360
This cold poison is extremely serious

132
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,960
and cannot be treated by ordinary physicians.

133
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,320
Stop keeping us in suspense.

134
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,040
Do you have any solution?

135
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,600
I've heard of the Wandering Soul Needle technique from Youling Palace

136
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,520
which can guide the needle into acupoints,

137
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,800
protect the heart meridian,

138
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
and then use inner strength to drive it out,

139
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,410
possibly forcing the cold poison out.

140
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,090
Youling Palace?

141
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,640
Ten years ago,

142
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,050
all major martial arts sects, in the name of justice,

143
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,290
completely wiped out Youling Palace.

144
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,720
Where else can we find people from the Phantom Palace?
