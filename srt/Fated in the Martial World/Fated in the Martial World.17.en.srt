1
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,890
Hand over the Invincible Mirror to me now.

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:20,900
Otherwise,

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,080
you won't leave Renyi Manor alive.

4
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,720
If I want to leave today,

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,800
no one can stop me.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:35,640
You!

7
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,380
How dare you burn the Invincible Mirror!

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,520
I've set my bait.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,960
Chai Yuguan,

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,400
how long can you keep hiding?

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,400
Jin Buhuan is dead.

12
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,210
My Phantom Palace's revenge is complete.

13
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,319
Now the Invincible Mirror has been destroyed as well.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,920
I

15
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,200
am the only one who has read it all.

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,920
So what if I'm the master of Ghost Palace?

17
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,880
Kill me,

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,280
don't you want the Invincible Mirror anymore?

19
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,900
The martial world is about to be turned upside down.

20
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,160
Brother Lianhua, you have the nerve to follow us here,

21
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,560
making jokes with us.

22
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,840
Indeed.

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,560
I admit,

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,890
I was the one who switched Zhan Qiming.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,259
But didn't you know that already?

26
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,960
Otherwise why would you save him

27
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
and bring him to Renyi Manor?

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
The schemes of your Yunmeng Manor

29
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,580
are truly vicious.

30
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Taking away Zhan Qiming leaves no witness,

31
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,760
making Renyi Manor and Jin Buhuan slaughter each other,

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,360
while you reap the benefits.

33
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,520
Brother Shen,

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,520
you're being too biased.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,160
I admit I set up this trap on my mother's orders,

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,820
but you've already broken it.

37
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,000
And the one who ultimately caused all this bloodshed

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,800
isn't me.

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,920
Isn't there someone more ruthless than me?

40
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
What's wrong?

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,730
You can't bear to blame her?

42
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,680
That's right.

43
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,490
I wanted to kill these people for revenge.

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,220
Those who killed my mother

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,210
and destroyed my Ghost Palace -

46
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,700
don't they deserve to die?

47
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,079
But your intentions,

48
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
I've known them for quite some time.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,240
You've known all along, Brother Shen?

50
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,840
Of course. Who couldn't guess her intentions?

51
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,900
But your tactic today of using others

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,680
to do your dirty work truly impresses me.

53
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,340
So you knew about it all along.

54
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,040
I was the only one left in the dark.

55
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,560
Bai Feifei.

56
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,920
I became sworn sisters with you.

57
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,650
Yet you never told me the truth.

58
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,180
You must explain yourself today.

59
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,040
Just as you said.

60
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,060
I am the Ghost Palace Witch they speak of.

61
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,920
And after today,

62
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,720
Those who are after the Invincible Mirror

63
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,040
and other martial artists

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,570
will all become my enemies.

65
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,000
So you,

66
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,920
and all of you,

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
had better part ways with me.

68
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,079
I refuse.

69
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,920
You once used me as bait

70
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,380
with no regard for my life.

71
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,640
Now that there's danger,

72
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,770
you want me to leave.

73
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,120
Does this mean

74
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,440
you've started to care about me?

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,610
Young Palace Mistress.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,330
Young Palace Mistress.

77
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,880
Zhan Qiming was deceived

78
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,820
and has greatly offended you.

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,320
Would the Young Palace Mistress

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,600
honor us with a visit to the Weiwu Escort Agency?

81
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,880
My father has some items

82
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,440
he wanted me to pass on to you.

83
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,040
All right.

84
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,290
Young Master

85
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,850
please accept this.

86
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
What is this?

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,800
Ten years ago,

88
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,520
the old master was deceived by Chai Yuguan

89
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,650
and went to the Ghost Palace with them.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,360
The old master thought

91
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,000
he was only seeking justice

92
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,400
for Master Shen Tianjun.

93
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,480
But they

94
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,800
slaughtered everyone in the Ghost Palace

95
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
to fight for the Invincible Mirror.

96
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,400
After he returned,

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,200
he was consumed with guilt

98
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,820
and his hair turned white overnight.

99
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,280
Shortly after,

100
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,960
he passed away.

101
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,720
In the end,

102
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,400
he only left his last wish on the back of this token.

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,340
Remember, descendants of Weiwu Escort Agency:

104
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,800
To atone for my sins,

105
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,600
if you ever meet descendants of the Ghost Palace,

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,640
you must give them all our property

107
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,610
without keeping anything.

108
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,380
Zhan Yingsong, with tears of gratitude.

109
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
[Illegible text]

110
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,159
[Partial text]

111
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,360
My Zhan family

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,170
owes a debt to the Ghost Palace.

113
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,640
And the Young Master has shown kindness to our family.

114
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,280
From now on,

115
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,960
my Weiwu Escort Agency

116
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,810
will be at your service, Young Master.

117
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,370
Weiwu Escort Agency...

118
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,020
I don't want it.

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,400
Not a single thread of it.

120
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,120
But...

121
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,020
However, I'd like to keep this token.

122
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,720
Do you all see?

123
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,020
Do you all understand now?

124
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,000
My mother

125
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,800
was wronged.

126
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,000
The wronged souls who died tragically in the Ghost Palace

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,680
were also betrayed.

128
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,180
The justice from ten years ago

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,640
I've finally won it for them.

130
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,080
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

131
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,400
Zhan Qiming.

132
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,360
Everything about your Weiwu Escort Agency is good

133
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,490
except for this wine

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,060
which is terrible.

135
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,640
Take this.

136
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
What's this?

137
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,200
Fugui Manor's trading posts are all over Zhongzhou.

138
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,320
Take my token and go to them,

139
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,050
they'll supply you with goods.

140
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,240
So next time I come,

141
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
there will be good wine to drink.

142
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,560
Fugui Manor has always kept their supply channels to themselves.

143
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,960
I never expected Miss Qiqi to be so generous

144
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
to simply give this to Weiwu Escort Agency.

145
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,040
So what?

146
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
I can't stand those

147
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
who bully others with their power.

148
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,280
They saw that Weiwu had no one in charge

149
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,480
and came to bully you.

150
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,960
I want to show them that

151
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,680
even the smallest person

152
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,090
shouldn't be underestimated by them.

153
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,570
Zhan Qiming.

154
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,960
I believe in you.

155
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
In the future,

156
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,920
when Weiwu's flags are all over Zhongzhou,

157
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,840
let's see who dares to disrespect you.

158
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,600
Well said.

159
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,240
I drink to you, Miss Qiqi.

160
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,480
Here's to Weiwu Escort Agency's flags

161
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,799
spreading throughout Zhongzhou.

162
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,600
Thank you all.

163
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,960
Come on, bottoms up.

164
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,600
We've been drinking from day to night.

165
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,860
I still need to get some good wine myself.

166
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,640
Come out.

167
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,080
Ranxiang pays her respects to you, sir.

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,170
The counterfeit goods from Renyi Manor today

169
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,320
were your doing.

170
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,840
My intention was to make the Beggar Clan and Renyi Manor

171
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,500
fight until both were damaged

172
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,920
and lose public support.

173
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,360
The position of Renyi Manor's master

174
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
would naturally fall into my hands.

175
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,160
I calculated every step carefully,

176
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,880
but I missed two people.

177
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,760
Shen Lang

178
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,200
and Bai Feifei.

179
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,960
I never expected

180
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,120
that Shen Lang would rescue Zhan Qiming

181
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,600
from Jin Buhuan.

182
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,160
Even less did I expect that my sister

183
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,960
would openly expose her identity.

184
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
These two have completely disrupted my plans.

185
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,560
If she only wanted revenge, that would be fine.

186
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,000
But if she wants to protect Shen Lang...

187
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,520
Sir.

188
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,880
The lady doesn't care about what happens to them.

189
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,000
What the lady cares about

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,460
is the Invincible Mirror.

191
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,880
Tell the lady

192
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,720
I will bring it back for her sooner or later.

193
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,680
The lady has no patience to wait any longer.

194
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,540
The lady orders

195
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,040
to bring Bai Feifei immediately

196
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,300
back to Yunmeng Manor.

197
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,440
Just let me finish this drink first.

198
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,330
Wang Lianhua is taking forever to bring the wine.

199
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,200
People might think

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,930
he got drunk in secret and fell asleep somewhere.

201
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,540
Miss Zhu is dissatisfied with Weiwu Escort Agency's wine.

202
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,600
I had to select it carefully.

203
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,120
As for you three now,

204
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,560
one is a rising star in the martial arts world

205
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,690
Young Master Shen who will likely take over Renyi Manor.

206
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,440
One is the daughter of Zhongzhou's wealthiest family.

207
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,840
And one is the young mistress of Ghost Palace.

208
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,440
I, humble Wang Lianhua,

209
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
dare not offend

210
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,400
any of you.

211
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,160
What a silver tongue.

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,520
I wonder how your tongue would taste

213
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,610
if I cut it off to go with my wine.

214
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,840
Ignore him. I'll drink with you.

215
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,280
Cheers.

216
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,340
I won't drink with a little liar like you.

217
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
You still haven't explained

218
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
what you were hiding from me before.

219
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
Actually,

220
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,520
you're the smartest one.

221
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,090
You figured it out before anyone else.

222
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,600
When?

223
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,680
When you suspected my identity,

224
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,420
didn't you slip me a sleeping potion?

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,520
I'll drug you

226
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,980
and tear off that sheep's clothing of yours.

227
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,240
Forget it.

228
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,080
I don't care if you're the young mistress of Ghost Palace.

229
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:04,940
No matter what,

230
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,880
you're still my sworn sister, Zhu Qiqi.

231
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,120
The wine is good and the moon is full today.

232
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,320
Perfect time for a confession session.

233
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,080
If you don't mind

234
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,720
Feifei being the young mistress of Ghost Palace,

235
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,650
then I won't hide anything either.

236
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:34,640
Everyone,

237
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,580
I'm not actually that kind-hearted.

238
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,740
I've wanted to capture Feifei

239
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,240
and take her back to Yunmeng Manor for a long time.

240
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,770
I also wanted to ruin Shen Lang's reputation.

241
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,160
My mother said this would help

242
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,240
me become the leader of the martial arts world.

243
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,000
Wang Lianhua, how can you be so wicked?

244
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,660
The Yunmeng Fairy is Chai Yuguan's second wife.

245
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,960
Brother Lianhua and Feifei

246
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,440
are half-siblings.

247
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,840
However,

248
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,480
the Yunmeng Fairy hates Bai Jing.

249
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,290
If she knew Feifei is Bai Jing's daughter,

250
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,260
she would never let her go easily.

251
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,320
That's right.

252
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,160
That was

253
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,300
my reason from the beginning.

254
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,320
And here I thought

255
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,680
you were just a little bad,

256
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,410
but you're actually terrible!

257
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,240
If I'm so bad, why are you drinking my wine?

258
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,360
I specifically poisoned your drink,

259
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
to kill you, you ungrateful wretch.

260
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,040
Today is confession day.

261
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,640
Since you're willing to confess,

262
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,300
let's let bygones be bygones.

263
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,040
Drink up!

264
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,120
Sister.

265
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,380
I also have something bad to confess.

266
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,120
I was angry with Shen and Feifei before.

267
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,040
I felt jealous seeing you two together.

268
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,640
I even had some terrible thoughts.

269
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,810
Actually, that time in the Ghost Cave,

270
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,280
when Shen and I went to find you,

271
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,240
I deliberately slowed down,

272
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,090
thinking to myself,

273
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,360
if we arrived a bit later,

274
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,640
maybe you would...

275
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,260
If you weren't around,

276
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,080
Shen would like me instead.

277
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,690
But you still came, didn't you?

278
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,160
Later I realized,

279
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,760
after all,

280
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:09,840
you not only saved me,

281
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,900
but your personality also suits me well.

282
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
So I never thought that way again.

283
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,050
Even when on the street,

284
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,280
you were close with Shen,

285
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,200
I never blamed you again.

286
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,200
After today,

287
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:35,980
let bygones

288
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
be bygones.

289
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,450
Let bygones be bygones.

290
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,200
Brother Shen,

291
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,730
don't you have anything to say?

292
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,600
I

293
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,520
am just a wanderer in this vast jianghu,

294
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,580
a drifter that can be found anywhere.

295
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,690
Nothing worth mentioning.

296
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,080
I happen to know about

297
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,280
your other identity.
