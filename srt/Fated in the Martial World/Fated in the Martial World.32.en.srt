1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,960
Don't move.

2
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,840
Oh, it's Miss Zhu.

3
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,120
Miss Murou,

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,360
it really is you.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,840
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,960
Did Chai Yuguan

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,760
send you to harm my brother Shen?

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,120
Don't worry, Miss Zhu.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Your brother Shen is fine.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,840
If you don't believe me,

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,700
you can go in and see for yourself.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,260
I've already checked.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,560
You drugged my brother Shen.

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,160
Sister Qiqi has made quite some progress.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,440
Who are you calling sister?

16
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,300
Stop pretending to be close to me.

17
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,090
Why aren't you afraid or running away?

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,640
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,120
Miss Zhu has always been known to save people,

20
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,160
not harm me.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,440
I came to tell you

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,900
this place isn't safe to stay.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,820
You should leave as soon as possible.

24
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,250
*Could she be

25
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,920
Is she really

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
The red candles have been delivered.

27
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,770
We used Qixin Hall's connections.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,120
You should follow the Qixin Hall attendant

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,050
and leave first.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,259
To avoid arousing suspicion.

31
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Qiqi.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,620
You're looking for me?

33
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,120
Yes.

34
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,280
I want to ask you something.

35
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,940
Do you remember how many times you've lied to me?

36
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Many times.

37
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,620
Will you lie to me again in the future?

38
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,079
In the future,

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
I definitely won't lie.

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,450
So you're still lying to me now.

41
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Do you remember

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,500
the day when Feifei found out you lied to her?

43
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,040
How heartbroken was she?

44
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,640
I remember.

45
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,160
She abandoned all of us that time.

46
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,480
So you also want

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,440
me to be like Feifei

48
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,480
and abandon all of you?

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
In this world,

50
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,480
I don't have many people left that I care about.

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,079
Then tell me the truth.

52
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,400
Miss Murou

53
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
is Bai Feifei,

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,840
isn't she?

55
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,440
If you don't tell me,

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,360
I'm leaving.

57
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,280
Fine.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,730
Since you don't trust me either

59
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,500
and think I'll cause trouble,

60
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,000
then I'll just stay away from all of you.

61
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,440
Qiqi.

62
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,250
That's not what I meant.

63
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,240
Then tell me the truth.

64
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Promise me first.

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,960
I won't tell Brother Shen.

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,520
Miss Murou...

67
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,930
is actually Bai Feifei.

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
Okay.

69
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,580
That day at Kuaihuo Forest...

70
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,000
That day at Kuaihuo Forest...

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,660
It was a necessary deception.

72
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,000
Yunmeng Manor was brutally massacred.

73
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:21,140
Shen Lang has also lost all his martial arts skills.

74
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,160
The two of us

75
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,200
are no match for Chai Yuguan.

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,600
There's one more option.

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,140
It's also our last resort.

78
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,840
Since Chai Yuguan

79
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,960
has already practiced the Invincible Manual,

80
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
then we just need to find a way

81
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,240
to make him inhale the extreme yin energy from my Ghost Palace.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,720
It will cause his inner power to clash like ice and fire,

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,760
essentially self-immolation.

84
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:41,680
You mean

85
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,360
to fight to the death?

86
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,090
To become his medicine vessel.

87
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,840
No way.

88
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,680
I said this is our last resort.

89
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,760
This device will explode under strong pressure

90
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,290
and produce a bright flash.

91
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,960
If anything goes wrong,

92
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,820
detonating it can save your life.

93
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,840
Don't forget,

94
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,570
Shen Lang is still waiting for you.

95
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,020
Chai Yuguan fell into the trap

96
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,820
and turned Feifei into his medicine vessel.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,720
But unexpectedly,

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
her extreme yin energy

99
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,240
had no effect on Chai Yuguan at all.

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
I guess it must be because

101
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,440
Shen Lang used the pure yang energy from his Heavenly Extinction technique

102
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
to detoxify her in the underground palace.

103
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,520
So that day, Feifei

104
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,400
didn't die from her body exploding.

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,320
Instead,

106
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,770
she deliberately triggered your hidden weapon.

107
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,940
And then everything happened as you saw.

108
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,300
Feifei faked her death to escape,

109
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,560
and when she contacted me again,

110
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,120
she was already Chai Yuguan's fiancée.

111
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,360
So I had no choice but to keep it from you

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,620
and help her secretly.

113
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,920
Trust me.

114
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,520
All of this

115
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,520
will come to an end

116
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,780
on Chai Yuguan's wedding day.

117
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,440
But

118
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
whether it's changing her appearance with acupuncture

119
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,240
or the poison in the red candles,

120
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,200
if she's discovered,

121
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,680
she'll be in grave danger.

122
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,300
If I don't help her,

123
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,040
even if it means fighting to the death,

124
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,770
she would still do this anyway.

125
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,890
Things have come to this point.

126
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,780
We have no way to turn back now.

127
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
You always say I'm willful,

128
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
but she's actually more stubborn than I am.

129
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,760
Why does she always insist

130
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,980
on risking her life alone?

131
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,080
I knew it.

132
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,960
I knew it was you.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Feifei.

134
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,400
Feifei.

135
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,960
Since you have your plans and intentions,

136
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,020
I wish you success in achieving them.

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,240
Master Shen.

138
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,920
Are you saying

139
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
that Shen Lang has

140
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,960
Mu Rou's fragrance on him?

141
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,159
I always accompany my lady,

142
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,640
and I'm very familiar

143
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,960
with this fragrance.

144
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,559
I couldn't possibly be mistaken.

145
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,400
Unless they were alone together,

146
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,080
otherwise,

147
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,500
such a strong scent wouldn't remain.

148
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,280
Shen Lang, oh Shen Lang.

149
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,120
How dare you!

150
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,300
Please calm down, Your Highness.

151
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,240
Not bad.

152
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,200
This gives me leverage over him.

153
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,960
Congratulations, Your Highness.

154
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,620
The Invincible Treasure will soon be complete.

155
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
Congratulations to you too, my beauty.

156
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,080
You'll soon marry a good man.

157
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,160
Are these

158
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
red candles from Qixin Hall?

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,930
They're for our wedding tomorrow.

160
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,960
I don't know where they're from.

161
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,320
I just like the carved patterns on them.

162
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
They're not refined enough.

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,920
Not worthy of you.

164
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,890
As the woman of King Kuaihuo

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,040
you deserve better.

166
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,840
I'll have them all replaced tomorrow.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,640
Wait.

168
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,160
What?

169
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,080
Replacing the candles will take time.

170
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
Why bother with such trivial matters

171
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,570
and risk missing the auspicious time?

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,600
Besides,

173
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,680
I like the simplicity of these candles.

174
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,240
If you like them,

175
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,120
then

176
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,280
I'll do as you wish.

177
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
However,

178
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,920
there is someone

179
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
I need you

180
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,400
to eliminate for me.

181
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,320
With the wedding approaching,

182
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,920
if we move against Shen Lang,

183
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,720
I fear Kuaihuo Palace

184
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,220
will be thrown into chaos.

185
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,040
As expected of the woman I've chosen,

186
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,960
you've immediately guessed my intentions.

187
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,080
But do you know

188
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
how Shen Tianjun died back then?

189
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,040
People in the martial world say

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,040
he was killed by the former master

191
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,700
of Ghost Palace, Bai Jing.

192
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Then do you know

193
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,740
why Bai Jing wanted to kill Shen Tianjun?

194
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,320
For me.

195
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Back then, Shen Tianjun's Three Ultimate Techniques

196
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,800
were unrivaled.

197
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,320
No one in the martial arts world could harm him,

198
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,840
except his beloved Bai Jing.

199
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,600
But Bai Jing

200
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,840
was also my woman.

201
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,560
So I asked Bai Jing to kill Shen Tianjun,

202
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,480
and she naturally agreed.

203
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,400
How could anyone compare to the former master of Youling Palace,

204
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,440
the Ghost Palace?

205
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,280
No need to be modest.

206
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,560
You look like her.

207
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,520
But smarter than her.

208
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,960
Since you could kill Bu Gongzhi for me,

209
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,480
why can't you follow Bai Jing's example

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,560
and kill Shen Lang for me?

211
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,800
This Shen Lang

212
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,200
refuses to submit to me.

213
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,440
And toward you,

214
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,920
he remains obstinate.

215
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,880
If you want to be the woman of the Happy King,

216
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,520
prove your loyalty.

217
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,680
Kill him.

218
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,360
You'll be the irreplaceable Lady of the Alliance.

219
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,920
The entire martial arts world

220
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,920
will be at your command.

221
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,840
I've already arranged a meeting

222
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,440
with Shen Lang in the backyard using your name.

223
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,440
By the time,

224
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,250
he should be arriving soon.

225
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,210
Thank you for your trouble.

226
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,730
Master Shen, aren't you going to ask me

227
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,240
why I invited you here so late at night?

228
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,560
Miss Murou,

229
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,080
are you really not Bai Feifei?

230
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,400
This Bai Feifei,

231
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,920
who exactly is she?

232
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,200
Why do you

233
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,920
mention her all the time?

234
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,040
She

235
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,920
what kind of girl is she exactly?

236
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,920
That she makes you

237
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,480
so lovesick.

238
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,640
She's a very beautiful girl.

239
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,650
And quite intelligent too.

240
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,210
Her martial arts skills are exceptional.

241
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,240
Things others cannot do,

242
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,520
or dare not do,

243
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
she can accomplish them all.

244
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,920
When we first met,

245
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,770
she was unable to protect herself,

246
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,300
a disciple of Renyi Manor covered in wounds.

247
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,760
Later on,

248
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,440
she became my wife.

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Your feelings run deep, young hero.

250
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,840
That young lady called Feifei,

251
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
to have met you

252
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,040
and known you,

253
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,090
she must have been very happy in this life.

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,660
Her life was full of hardship,

255
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,440
and quite lonely too.

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,320
What I regret most is

257
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,650
making a ten-day promise with her.

258
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,300
She told me to wait for her,

259
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,200
but she never came back after that.

260
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,840
She put herself in danger

261
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,400
and left me alone to live in pain.

262
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,760
Tell me,

263
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,720
isn't she a little liar?

264
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,880
No matter what,

265
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,340
you must find a way to go on living.

266
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,920
Just like I am now.

267
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,840
I will kill you.

268
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,480
So you really want to kill me.

269
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,880
Coming to Kuaihuo Palace

270
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,380
is seeking your own death.

271
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,440
Now I'm certain

272
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,520
you're not Bai Feifei at all.

273
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,120
Because my wife

274
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,800
never tells me the truth,

275
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,920
but every word you say is honest.

276
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,200
If you refuse to submit to the King of Kuaihuo,

277
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,240
you can only die.
