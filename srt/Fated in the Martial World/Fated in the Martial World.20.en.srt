1
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:18,280
Shen.

2
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,050
You can't go beyond the border.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,440
Feifei.

4
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,880
The current King of Happiness

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
is no longer the Chai Yuguan of the past.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,640
If you go there like this,

7
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,600
you're just going to your death, do you know that?

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,720
Revenge must be taken.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,960
At least this way you

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,050
won't have to bear the burden of revenge anymore.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,200
Do you remember when we visited the flower market together?

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,800
I liked how you were that day.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,600
And I hope from now on,

14
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,290
you'll always be like that.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,050
Don't worry.

16
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,480
I, your Shen,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,010
have always been lucky.

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,290
Perhaps my Three Ultimate Techniques

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,720
will be the perfect counter against him.

20
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,080
But regardless of whether this journey succeeds or fails,

21
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,480
I absolutely cannot let you take this risk.

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,840
Wait for me to return.

23
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,080
Shen.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,240
Why do you only mention our visit to the flower market

25
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,000
but not

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,500
that night on the long street?

27
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,080
After that day,

28
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,640
you asked me to take responsibility for you.

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
I once thought

30
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,440
that seeking revenge alone,

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,039
I couldn't even be responsible for myself,

32
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,700
so how could I take care of you?

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,480
Since I left

34
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,760
a mark on your neck,

35
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,009
I've only wanted to be close to you.

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,039
Back then, I didn't understand

37
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,680
why whenever a woman approached you,

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,080
I would always get angry.

39
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,000
Now I understand.

40
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,690
Since I understand now,

41
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,520
how can I let you face danger alone?

42
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,440
Shen.

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
Feifei wants to be responsible for you.

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
Feifei wants to

45
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,160
be with you through life and death.

46
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,759
Feifei.

47
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,919
Be careful!

48
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:12,760
Feifei!

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,240
Feifei!

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,160
Your mother and I both fell victim to men.

51
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,880
Yet you learn nothing from it.

52
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,480
Still so stubborn and blind.

53
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,560
Then I'll

54
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,640
have to send you to die with them.

55
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,960
Shen!

56
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,720
What have you done with Shen and Feifei?

57
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,360
Since you came together,

58
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,800
why don't

59
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,800
I send you to join them?

60
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,800
Take her away.

61
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,200
Wang Lianhua!

62
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,890
If anything happens to Shen and Feifei...

63
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,680
Miss Zhu has deep feelings for Shen Lang.

64
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,360
My child,

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
you're breaking up a loving couple!

66
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,760
The Zhu family has enormous wealth.

67
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,680
They will certainly become

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,360
our greatest ally against Chai Yuguan.

69
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Zhu Qiqi is nothing to fear.

70
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,120
I'll have someone keep an eye on her.

71
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
The Invincible Mirror is what matters most right now.

72
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,050
I'll go find Bai Feifei at once.

73
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,880
Stop.

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
Do you remember

75
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,760
why I must have the Invincible Mirror?

76
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,090
Of course I haven't forgotten.

77
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
It's to kill Chai Yuguan.

78
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,200
Exactly.

79
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Everything I've done

80
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
has been to kill him.

81
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,960
I swear.

82
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,040
I'll make him beg for life

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,320
but find no release in death.

84
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,400
That Bai Feifei keeps opposing me at every turn.

85
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,079
Not only does she refuse to give me the Invincible Mirror,

86
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,410
she also stops Shen Lang

87
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,100
from finding Chai Yuguan.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,920
So I had no choice but to put them in the underground palace

89
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,760
to be a doomed couple.

90
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
What's wrong, my son?

91
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,560
Everyone knows Shen Lang has a chivalrous heart.

92
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,640
Compared to him,

93
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,170
you've always been overshadowed.

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,000
Today,

95
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,820
I've helped you get rid of him.

96
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,600
Aren't you happy?

97
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,440
Of course I am happy.

98
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,360
Find a way

99
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,620
to get me the underground palace blueprint.

100
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
Young Master.

101
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Your wife's Cloudy Five-Flower Palm technique

102
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,280
contains poison

103
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,200
and there is simply no antidote.

104
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,840
The poison will flow with her internal energy,

105
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,320
entering her bloodstream and body,

106
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,120
causing her meridians to burst and resulting in death.

107
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,000
Bai Feifei

108
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,800
likely won't survive more than seven days.

109
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,610
That poison in the palm,

110
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
though it's the coldest of poisons,

111
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,040
if someone else

112
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,420
forcibly uses the most potent yang energy to detoxify her,

113
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,280
it's not entirely impossible.

114
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,440
But that's only a one in ten thousand chance.

115
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,320
If it fails,

116
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,620
both people will die from the poison.

117
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Young Master.

118
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,360
Are you worried about them?

119
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
Ranxiang.

120
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,900
If I hadn't become friends with them,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,240
would they have avoided this trouble?

122
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
Young master.

123
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,240
These matters

124
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,360
are none of your concern.

125
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
Now all I can protect

126
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,280
is only her.

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Where is Qiqi?

128
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Wang Lianhua!

129
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,040
Let me out!

130
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,760
Wang Lianhua,

131
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,320
your mother captured Brother Shen and Bai Feifei,

132
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
yet you locked me up here.

133
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,280
When I get out,

134
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,940
I'll slap your face until it looks like a pig's head.

135
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,730
Miss Zhu, please don't be so angry.

136
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Look what I've prepared for you.

137
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
Toads from the North Sea.

138
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,940
Pearls from the South Sea.

139
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,440
And from the capital city,

140
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,400
a diamond-patterned bronze mirror made by the famous craftsman Wang Fangzhai.

141
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,060
And rose water from Jiangnan.

142
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,640
These are all treasures that martial artists

143
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
would do anything

144
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,280
to get their hands on.

145
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,080
Each worth its weight in gold.

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
Since you've just arrived at Yunmeng Manor,

147
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,320
all these

148
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,010
are my welcome gifts to you.

149
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,370
I don't want any of this!

150
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,159
Get out!

151
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,380
What would I do with these things?

152
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,360
I want to find Shen and Fei Fei.

153
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,560
Shen.

154
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,480
Whatever Shen and Fei Fei could give you before,

155
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,610
I, Wang Lianhua, can give you the same.

156
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,880
From now on,

157
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
even without Shen Lang,

158
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,760
throughout the martial arts world and beyond,

159
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,040
I can get you anything you desire.

160
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,400
Why do you insist on caring about their fate?

161
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,800
My patience has its limits.

162
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,040
You and your mother,

163
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,520
what have you done to Shen and Fei Fei?

164
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,560
If anything happens to Shen,

165
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,680
I will never forgive you.

166
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,520
Shen Lang won't survive.

167
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,360
I'm in a great mood.

168
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,090
I wanted to celebrate with you,

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,000
but all you care about is your dear Shen Lang.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,120
Why?

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,640
Wang Lianhua, let me go!

172
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,960
Let me leave!

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,960
Wang Lianhua!

174
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,960
I've been trying to protect you.

175
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,200
Why must you be so ungrateful like those two?

176
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,220
So you can still feel pain.

177
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,520
Do you know?

178
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
The Thirteen Demons once terrorized the martial world.

179
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,640
And the Yunmeng Fairy

180
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,840
was one of them, known as the Palm Demon.

181
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,560
The Heavenly Cloud Five-Flower Palm

182
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,220
is her most deadly technique.

183
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,760
I know.

184
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,680
Then do you also know

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,840
once the poison enters your meridians,

186
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,440
the victim won't survive more than seven days?

187
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,280
I know.

188
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,090
If you knew everything,

189
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,559
why did you take that blow for me?

190
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,480
Because

191
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,240
I promised I would take care of you.

192
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,440
I, Bai Feifei,

193
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,040
keep my word.

194
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,760
Shen.

195
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,840
I'll help detoxify you.

196
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,280
But there's no cure for this poison.

197
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,960
I know.

198
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,680
If you force your inner energy to drive out the poison,

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,320
I'm afraid you'll...

200
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
I know that too.

201
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,760
Shen,

202
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,300
you'll die doing this.

203
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,400
If you're gone,

204
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,520
how could I live happily alone?

205
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,720
I'm sorry.

206
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
It's all my fault.

207
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,360
You're awake.

208
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
Shen.

209
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,280
I was just exploring the underground palace

210
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,640
trying to find an exit.

211
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,560
But all passages here are blocked by stone doors.

212
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Getting out won't be easy.

213
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,360
This underground palace is quite large.

214
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,000
Finding a way out

215
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,120
must be extremely difficult.

216
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Indeed.

217
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,320
Brother Shen.

218
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,200
It's nothing.

219
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Maybe there's too much dust in here.

220
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,960
I'm getting a bit hungry.

221
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,020
I'll go find something for you to eat.

222
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,040
Feifei.

223
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,960
Remember to call me if you need anything.

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,420
You're not alone anymore.

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,360
Understand?

226
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,720
Are you smiling?

227
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,880
I just suddenly remembered

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,040
when you were badly injured and bedridden,

229
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,720
I wanted to take care of you

230
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,560
but ended up bringing you a pot of scalding hot water.

231
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,360
What's wrong?

232
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
That's when I secretly decided

233
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,810
I must improve my martial arts skills.

234
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,600
Otherwise,

235
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,730
if I get injured again, I'd have to let you take care of me.

236
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
However,

237
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,880
it seems my martial arts

238
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,740
might still not be strong enough.

239
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,160
Fortunately,

240
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,120
we still have seven days.

241
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,040
Seven days?

242
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,520
In those seven days,

243
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,210
there are quite a few things

244
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,360
we could do.

245
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,360
Like what?

246
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,880
For example...

247
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,680
I said I won't eat.

248
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,930
Tell Wang Lianhua to see me.

249
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,340
Where is he?

250
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,760
Miss Qiqi,

251
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,920
you've been on a hunger strike for days.

252
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
If the master learns I haven't been taking good care of you,

253
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,720
he will surely blame me.

254
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,380
You've locked me in this room,

255
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,840
clearly wanting me dead.

256
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,760
What am I to you?

257
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,420
A prisoner?

258
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,000
Besides,

259
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,840
your Yunmeng Manor is known for using poison.

260
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,160
Who knows if you've

261
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,640
put something in this food?

262
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,320
The master considers you an honored guest.

263
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,650
How could he poison you?

264
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,450
Miss Qiqi, you're really overthinking this.

265
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,160
If you want me to believe you,

266
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,160
fine.

267
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,600
You eat it.

268
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,160
Test it for poison for me.

269
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,250
These are all yours too.

270
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,280
Trying to challenge me.
