1
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,040
Sir.

2
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,680
As you instructed,

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,480
Miss Qiqi

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,660
has been released.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,680
What about Madam?

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,840
Madam only knows

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,520
that I was drugged by Miss Qiqi.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,080
She would never suspect it was your doing.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,520
What about the underground palace map?

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,880
Miss Qiqi took it along with her clothes.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,360
I hope she finds it

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,020
and successfully rescues those two.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,720
Let me go!

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:44,840
Qiqi.

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,520
Let me go!

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,560
Qiqi.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,200
You can't even keep an eye on one person.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,840
Ranxiang.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,420
How are you serving the young master?

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,120
I told Ranxiang

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,940
to let Qiqi escape on purpose.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,520
Shen Lang and Bai Feifei refuse to cooperate with you, Mother.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,850
Keeping her is useless.

24
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,440
We might as well use Qiqi to spread the news.

25
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,039
Martial artists from all over

26
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,840
will surely flock here for the Invincible Manual.

27
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,490
Then we'll set a deadly trap

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,039
and force them to submit.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,010
Since Qiqi is a sacrificial piece,

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,960
we should find a way to make good use of her.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,920
Our revenge

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,840
will not be disrupted.

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,360
Wang Lianhua.

34
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,009
You truly are the worthy son of me, the Cloud Dream Fairy.

35
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,120
That's all because of

36
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,080
your excellent guidance, Mother.

37
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,200
That's right.

38
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
I've raised an unfilial son.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,720
Mother, please don't.

40
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,960
You, Wang Lianhua!

41
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,330
You'd deceive your own mother for a woman?

42
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,090
You think I can't see that you like her?

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,800
But does she even like you?

44
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,600
The deeper Miss Zhu loves Shen Lang,

45
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,780
the deeper she'll hate you later.

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,200
What's the use of your feelings for her?

47
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,900
This love and hate,

48
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,930
what's the difference anyway?

49
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,220
When a woman hates you,

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,400
she wishes to tear you to pieces.

51
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,100
When she loves you,

52
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,760
she still wishes to crush you.

53
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,620
Eat your flesh.

54
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,200
In both cases,

55
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,800
it's unbearable.

56
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,320
A man who can make a woman neither hate him

57
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
nor love him

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,160
is truly a clever man.

59
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,040
Well said.

60
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,170
Gold and silver are easy to obtain.

61
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,800
Whether it's love or hate,

62
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,600
a woman's true heart

63
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,120
is the most precious thing.

64
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,970
Since you've made up your mind,

65
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,260
I'll leave Miss Zhu

66
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,480
to you for now.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,680
Qiqi.

68
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,690
Are you okay?

69
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,620
Don't touch me.

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,160
Let me see.

71
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
Stay away from me.

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
Just go.

73
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,520
That day on the street, you kissed me for the first time.

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,200
I was secretly happy then.

75
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:29,090
Thinking you finally had feelings for me.

76
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,840
But soon after, you became hot and cold with me.

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,860
Now you want to escape,

78
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,770
but there's nowhere to run.

79
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,280
If I had known we would end up like this today.

80
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,610
I wouldn't have kissed you.

81
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,900
Since you already did.

82
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,570
Does that mean, as you said,

83
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,079
I need to take responsibility?

84
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,740
Then, miss,

85
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,970
could you be a bit more generous

86
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,480
and fulfill one wish of mine?

87
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,380
Since we met last year,

88
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,440
my heart has been filled with admiration for you.

89
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,700
Today we faced danger,

90
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,570
yet we didn't part ways.

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,240
I am Shen Lang

92
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,360
presenting this blank marriage contract.

93
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,420
I only wish that you

94
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,740
would join your life with mine

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,780
and grow old together with me.

96
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,279
Would you be willing to accept?

97
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,480
What is this?

98
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,640
Heaven is our matchmaker

99
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,960
and earth our betrothal gift.

100
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,120
If you are willing,

101
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
would you please sign

102
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,400
this marriage contract?

103
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,800
Once signed, there's no turning back.

104
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,460
No regrets.

105
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,120
From now on

106
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,760
you are my wife.

107
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,760
From now on

108
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
you are my husband.

109
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,900
I never thought about marriage vows before.

110
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,240
Even if I did,

111
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,320
I never imagined this moment

112
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,180
would be so humble and desperate.

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,220
For such an important life event,

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,480
I've truly wronged you.

115
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,480
Husband, do you remember this hair ribbon?

116
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,410
That day, in the pristine snow,

117
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,490
this ribbon floated toward me.

118
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
I felt then

119
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,410
that this object

120
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,240
shouldn't have appeared there.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,360
Just as you

122
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,460
shouldn't have appeared at Renyi Manor.

123
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,960
You, Bai Feifei,

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,920
shouldn't have let hatred

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,520
stain your hands with blood.

126
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,100
But it was this touch of red

127
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,640
that brought us together.

128
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,159
Then let it

129
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,960
bind us even closer.

130
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,740
With this as proof.

131
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,440
If we survive this calamity,

132
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,760
the proper wedding ceremony

133
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,920
I will surely provide for you someday.

134
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,400
This object means to me

135
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,299
more than anything else in the world.

136
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,260
Feifei.

137
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,560
Feifei.

138
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,640
Husband.

139
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,480
I'm a bit tired.

140
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,680
You're tired?

141
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,720
If you're tired, let's rest.

142
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,360
Rest.

143
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,600
Tomorrow

144
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,960
will be our last day.

145
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,120
It doesn't matter.

146
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,490
Don't be afraid.

147
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
Living together,

148
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,490
dying together,

149
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
is the best ending I could imagine.

150
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,100
I'll stay with you.

151
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,600
My only regret

152
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,160
is that

153
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,800
we couldn't visit our paradise.

154
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,520
There,

155
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,720
we would have our small field.

156
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,080
Two horses.

157
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,800
Three cows

158
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,100
and four chickens.

159
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,240
And that little house you built for me.

160
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,360
On top of that house,

161
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,320
as you requested,

162
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,020
I've hung windmills everywhere.

163
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,740
My husband,

164
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,560
is the wind blowing?

165
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
Yes, it is.

166
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
Then you must hold my hand tight.

167
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,240
Let's

168
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,840
go to the rooftop and take a look.

169
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,040
When we get there,

170
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,080
you'll see

171
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,840
those windmills spinning round and round on the roof.

172
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,320
Round and round.

173
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,660
Feifei.

174
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,280
Feifei.

175
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,400
Feifei.

176
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,580
We were poisoned at almost the same time.

177
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,080
Why is her poisoning more severe than mine?

178
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,970
Could it be related to my Tianjue Three-Form technique?

179
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Feifei.
