1
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:17,280
Brother Shen.

2
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,140
You must go now.

3
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,130
If we leave, we leave together.

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:27,920
I have promised

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,040
to protect you.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,040
If I leave you at this moment,

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,000
wouldn't I just gain the reputation of being heartless?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,240
At a time like this,

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,370
you still have the mood to joke around.

10
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,160
Brother Shen.

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,520
Brother Shen.

12
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:08,960
Feifei.

13
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,400
Save him quickly.

14
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:13,640
Feifei.

15
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,680
Feifei.

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Help him quickly.

17
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,840
Bai Feifei, wake up.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,880
Feifei.

19
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,479
Brother Shen.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,880
Brother Shen.

21
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,759
Brother Shen.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Shen.

23
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,840
The doctor has examined him.

24
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,440
His life is not in danger.

25
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't worry.

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,280
Fortunately, Shen has profound inner strength.

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,039
After a few more days of recovery,

28
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,199
he'll wake up soon.

29
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,300
Thank you for saving our lives, Qiqi.

30
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,280
Please don't say that.

31
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,040
If I hadn't drugged you,

32
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,100
you wouldn't have been captured by the Ghost Cave Sect.

33
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,520
Actually,

34
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,600
it's my fault.

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
I don't blame you.

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
I know.

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
You risked your life to save me last night.

38
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,420
How could you blame me?

39
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
Feifei,

40
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,360
I accept you as my sister.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,770
The Renyi Manor branch is gone.

42
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,760
From now on, I, Zhu Qiqi, will be your sister.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,620
Fugui Manor will be your support.

44
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
If anyone bullies you in the future,

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,240
it's the same as bullying me.

46
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,840
I always keep my word.

47
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,530
Brother Shen is finally awake.

48
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,820
Qiqi and I have been taking turns looking after him.

49
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
What's wrong?

50
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,380
Let me do it.

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,560
Here.

52
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,209
Are you alright?

53
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,240
This injury of mine

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,460
brings me a strange kind of pleasure.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,240
Pleasure?

56
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,520
If I hadn't been injured,

57
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,250
how would I receive such attentive care from you?

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,730
You were injured because of me.

59
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,890
Taking care of you is the least I can do.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
Since I promised

61
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,800
to protect you,

62
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,040
I must fulfill that promise.

63
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,720
Fortunately, I didn't

64
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,380
break my promise in that fire.

65
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,600
It's not about promises.

66
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,360
If I'm destined to die,

67
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,840
then that's my fate.

68
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
You don't need to save me.

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,520
Perhaps

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,600
saving you

71
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,600
is my destiny too.

72
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Uncle Wujiu.

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,490
Send someone to deliver this to Tie Huahe.

74
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,880
The Invincible Manual

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,930
has been with you all along.

76
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,200
That's right.

77
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,040
I am the daughter of Bai Jing,

78
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,080
Bai Feifei.

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,060
Where is the person who killed my mother now?

80
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,800
Fate is cruel.

81
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,680
Master Li.

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,040
Miss.

83
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,920
I, Li, beg for your forgiveness.

84
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,040
Master Li.

85
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,720
Also, please draw me

86
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,780
a map of Guiku Sect.

87
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Why?

88
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,660
Because whoever has this Invincible Manual

89
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,080
is the one who killed Li Changqing.

90
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,100
If Tie Huahe gets this,

91
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
he'll become a target for everyone.

92
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,280
Aren't we being

93
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,560
a bit hasty with this plan?

94
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,840
You originally wanted to use Shen Lang as bait.

95
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,040
Is it because he saved you

96
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,440
that you're protecting him now?

97
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,080
I'm not.

98
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,400
I'm luring him there

99
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,490
just to watch them destroy each other.

100
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,600
I thought

101
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
you were reluctant to use Shen Lang as bait.

102
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,290
He's just a piece on my chessboard.

103
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
It doesn't matter where I place him.

104
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,200
Good.

105
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,820
I'll spread the news about Tie Huahe right away.

106
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,440
Young master,

107
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
are you going out?

108
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,180
I'm going to join the excitement in the jianghu.

109
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Where is Shen Lang?

110
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,159
I am Shen Lang,

111
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,480
what can I do for you?

112
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I heard Shen Lang is going to Qinyang Ghost Cave

113
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
to confront Tie Huahe.

114
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,280
I'm here to help, of course.

115
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,000
Does this still count?

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,160
Yes, is it still valid?

117
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,480
Tie Huahe from the Ghost Cave of Qinyang

118
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,520
is known for his despicable behavior

119
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
and bullying women and children.

120
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,800
Now

121
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
Shen Lang sincerely invites all heroes

122
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
to join forces

123
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,530
to capture Tie Huahe

124
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,040
and restore peace to the martial world.

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,920
Reward.

126
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,240
Jin Wuliang

127
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,560
Sponsor

128
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,600
Fugui Manor

129
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,400
Qiqi

130
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,920
That's me.

131
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,039
May I ask, Miss Zhu,

132
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,559
why should I go to the Qinyang Ghost Cave?

133
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,799
I spent five taels of gold for information

134
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:42,880
that the Invincible Mirror is there.

135
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
Speak any louder

136
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,000
and your five taels of gold will be wasted.

137
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,240
Brother Shen,

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,450
we need to leave right away.

139
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,400
If Tie Huahe really has the Invincible Mirror,

140
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
then we'll surely find out who killed Master Li,

141
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
and you'll be cleared of suspicion.

142
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,690
According to my recent intelligence,

143
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,720
the Qinyang Ghost Cave is full of traps,

144
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,980
extremely dangerous,

145
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,040
and we need someone who knows the route well

146
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,840
to have any chance of getting in.

147
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,960
Um,

148
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,720
Old Jin.

149
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,580
Mr. Jin.

150
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,250
He knows the way.

151
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
Rest assured, everyone.

152
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,880
We take your money

153
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,640
and solve your problems.

154
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,570
Since we've taken Miss Zhu's gold,

155
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,640
we brothers

156
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,240
will definitely

157
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,520
bring back that bastard Tie Huahe's head for you.

158
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,840
Right, brothers?

159
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,400
That's right.

160
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
We'll head south immediately

161
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,520
and arrive in no time.

162
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,480
South?

163
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,220
Uncle Wujiu's map clearly shows we should go north.

164
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,240
Are you sure it's south?

165
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Of course.

166
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,200
Don't tell me

167
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,580
you know the way better, miss?

168
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,320
Brother Shen, let's just give it a try.

169
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,080
If it doesn't work out, we haven't lost anything anyway.

170
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
There's no loss.

171
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,970
With so many people,

172
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,920
how much gold would that be?

173
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,050
That's nothing compared to you, Shen.

174
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,920
Come on, Shen.

175
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,320
Feifei.

176
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,720
Shen, let's just give it a try.

177
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's go check it out.

178
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,080
Okay.

179
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,330
Then we'll leave tomorrow.

180
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,000
Fine then.

181
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,520
Let's see what this old Jin

182
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,800
is really up to.

183
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,610
Playing ugly is such hard work.

184
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,660
Once we pass through this forest,

185
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,380
we'll reach the Qinyang Ghost Cave hideout.

186
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,600
This is clearly the opposite direction of Qinyang Ghost Cave.

187
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,200
We're getting further away.

188
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,060
I feel something strange about this forest.

189
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,320
Both of you, be careful.

190
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,960
This way.

191
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,480
What's wrong?

192
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,540
I twisted my ankle.

193
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,680
My foot is hurt.

194
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
How could you be so careless?

195
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,280
Let me see.

196
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,840
I'll help you find a place to rest.

197
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,840
What's wrong?

198
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,260
Can you still walk?

199
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
If you really can't,

200
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,880
I can carry you on my back.

201
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,160
It's miasma.

202
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,960
Everyone be careful.

203
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,420
This miasma is poisonous.

204
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
Go check on Qiqi quickly.

205
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,520
Wait for me here.

206
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,580
Don't move around.

207
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,120
Brother Shen.

208
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,200
Brother Shen.

209
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,680
Brother Shen.

210
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,160
Qiqi.

211
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,920
Shen.

212
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,160
Don't be afraid.

213
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,690
I've sealed your nostrils.

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,530
You've only just realized?

215
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,320
Too late.

216
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,360
Once this miasma enters your lungs,

217
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,320
in two hours,

218
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,720
you'll bleed from all orifices and die.

219
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:43,880
Shen Lang,

220
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,840
hand over the Invincible Mirror

221
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,240
and I'll spare your life.

222
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,920
You have two hours to decide,

223
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,440
or prepare to die.

224
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,240
Shen,

225
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,250
that old Jin is a bad person.

226
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
Enough. Don't worry about that now.

227
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720
Quickly sit down and regulate your breathing.

228
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,980
He can't do anything to us while I'm here.

229
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,600
Interesting.

230
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,400
How did you find me?

231
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,520
I followed your scent.

232
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,010
Wandering Soul Needle.

233
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Qianli Incense.

234
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,800
So you're Bai Jing's.

235
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,960
Don't be so hasty.

236
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,760
We have a connection.

237
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,160
If you knew who I am,

238
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,600
you might not want to kill me.

239
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,050
Just another dead body.

240
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,130
I don't care who you are.

241
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,120
You may not care about me,

242
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,320
but don't you care about your dear Shen?

243
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,260
Then I'll send a message far and wide.

244
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Let everyone in the Miasma Forest know.

245
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,480
Who are you?

246
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,200
If he finds out,

247
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,520
just kill him.
