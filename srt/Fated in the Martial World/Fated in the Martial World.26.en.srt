1
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,560
Stop!

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,360
Wang Lianhua!

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,690
I said stop right there!

4
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,800
Lady Qiqi.

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,680
Have you come to confront me?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,840
Wang Lianhua.

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,480
How have you been lately?

8
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,860
Whether I'm well or not

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,050
is none of your concern.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,600
I've told you before,

11
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840
you are my friend.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,960
Once I've decided this,

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,890
it won't change.

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,770
How could you not be my concern?

15
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,020
Since we parted at Yunmeng Manor,

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,840
I no longer need friends.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,600
I don't care whether you need them or not.

18
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,960
Don't argue with me.

19
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,930
I may not be very clever,

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,600
but I can tell sincerity from pretense.

21
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,720
Before I met you all,

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,860
I was the daughter of Fugui Manor.

23
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,120
Everyone who was nice to me

24
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,880
only wanted my father's money

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
and to get something from me.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,720
But you're different.

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,610
You're kind to me

28
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,539
and expect nothing in return.

29
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:27,520
Whenever you have good food or drinks,

30
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,520
or something fun,

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
you always think of sharing with me.

32
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:31,880
Just like

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,600
how you'd treat a childhood friend.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,440
I just released

35
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,570
the person you worked hard to capture.

36
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,880
Are you still willing to trust me?

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,759
I do.

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,759
Wang Lianhua,

39
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,560
I know

40
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,340
you're pretending to be a bad person.

41
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,759
It's all because

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,820
you're afraid of getting hurt when you open your heart.

43
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,200
Don't worry,

44
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,960
I will prove to you with my actions.

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
My feelings for you,

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,810
and yours for me,

47
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,280
are the same.

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,160
Don't flatter yourself.

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
Thinking you understand me so well.

50
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Sometimes I don't even understand myself.

51
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,520
No matter what, I still consider you my friend.

52
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,320
I told you

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,380
even if only because you still have a friend.

54
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
I won't die.

55
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,760
I've grown up now.

56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,760
I can do things for you

57
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,650
for all of you

58
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,800
by myself.

59
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,960
You're doing well now.

60
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,090
You really look like a heroine now.

61
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,680
But I feared most that you would grow up.

62
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,040
Because once you grow up,

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
you'll have many more troubles.

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,480
You

65
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,960
all of you

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,800
have never been my trouble.

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,420
I'm looking forward to the day

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,960
when we can drink and sing together again,

69
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,520
roaming freely through the jianghu.

70
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
That day will never come.

71
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,520
It will.

72
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,360
I'll make that day happen.

73
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,000
If you're not going to arrest me,

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,280
I should go back to rest.

75
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,440
Go ahead.

76
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,320
I need to go catch those two scoundrels

77
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,440
from the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect.

78
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,900
Every time you let them go,

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,200
I'll catch them once.

80
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,560
If you let them go twice,

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,880
I'll catch them twice.

82
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,890
Being able to meet you like this

83
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,640
isn't so bad.

84
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,680
Don't waste your effort.

85
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,079
A captured dog,

86
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,960
once released,

87
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,800
will return to its master.

88
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,010
If they have any connection with Chai Yuguan,

89
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,290
Renyi Manor can just have someone watch them.

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,440
I knew you were helping me.

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,300
I just think you're too stupid

92
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
and I'm worried for you.

93
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,160
Wang Lianhua,

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,760
we'll meet again.

95
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,600
Quickly, go inform the master

96
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,000
that a letter has arrived from Renyi Manor.

97
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,080
Young master.

98
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,250
Miss Qiqi's letter.

99
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,840
Let's go!

100
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,300
Have you heard?

101
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,120
Renyi Manor

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,000
has captured the Pleasure King.

103
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,760
When?

104
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,200
Just a few days ago.

105
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,280
What did you just say?

106
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,920
You don't know yet, Mr. Shen?

107
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
Lady Qiqi deliberately

108
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,240
let the two masters of the

109
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect escape.

110
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
Then she followed the trail

111
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,960
and captured

112
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,960
Chai Yuguan from beyond the border.

113
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,560
Now she's sending out invitations to all heroes.

114
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,360
inviting everyone to Renyi Manor

115
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,290
to put Chai Yuguan on trial.

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,080
Everyone,

117
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,560
it's been a long time.

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,600
Chai Yuguan

119
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,420
has really been captured.

120
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,890
Thanks to Wang Lianhua.

121
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,040
If he hadn't taught me

122
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,080
to let those two masters of the Mandarin Duck and Butterfly Sect go,

123
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,880
we might never have found Chai Yuguan's whereabouts.

124
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,140
Let me make this clear.

125
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,920
I'm not doing this to help anyone.

126
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,580
Chai Yuguan is also an enemy of my Yunmeng Manor.

127
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,540
You all go in first.

128
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,160
I'll bring the prisoner.

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,530
I'll go with you.

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,760
According to the Yunmeng Fairy,

131
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,000
after the battle at Mount Heng

132
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,600
and the raid on Ghost Palace,

133
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,880
Chai Yuguan fled beyond the border with hundreds of martial arts manuals to train.

134
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,280
How could this self-proclaimed king

135
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,600
be captured so easily by Renyi Manor?

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,330
Something's not right.

137
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,120
Qiqi,

138
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,720
are you sure the one you caught

139
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,980
is really Chai Yuguan?

140
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,159
After the heroes' banquet at Yuebin Tower,

141
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,040
Wang Lianhua sneaked into Renyi Manor

142
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,970
and freed Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger.

143
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,480
Master Cold and I secretly followed them with our people

144
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:01,520
and finally caught him at an inn on the outskirts of town.

145
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,360
Jin Diezi and Chi Yanger -

146
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,810
how could you possibly be their match?

147
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,480
I also thought it would be a tough fight.

148
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
But somehow,

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,480
these two suddenly lost all their inner power

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,810
and were killed on the spot by Master Leng.

151
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,080
Times have indeed changed.

152
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,020
I'd like to toast the two masters.

153
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,200
The Seven-Day Immortal Wine.

154
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,680
It can make someone lose all their inner power within seven days.

155
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,360
I believe

156
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,740
this must be Wang Lianhua's doing again.

157
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
That's right.

158
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,280
Setting the tiger free

159
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,360
and then following the trail to find Chai Yuguan

160
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,040
was also Wang Lianhua's idea.

161
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,400
Shen.

162
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,520
What is it?

163
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
You should drink less in the future.

164
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,820
You look like yourself today,

165
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,250
like the Shen I know.

166
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,090
Alright.

167
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,280
Thank you for your hard work these days,

168
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,480
Lady Qiqi.

169
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,600
It was nothing.

170
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,480
Let's go see Chai Yuguan.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,840
Mr. Leng.

172
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,840
Mr. Leng, can you confirm

173
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,280
that we've really captured Chai Yuguan?

174
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,080
During the battle at Mount Heng,

175
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,940
I briefly saw him when I accompanied the old master.

176
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,580
It should be him, no doubt.

177
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,980
Congratulations.

178
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,080
Your Ghost Palace's great vendetta

179
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,880
has finally been avenged today.

180
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,600
Today,

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,320
Renyi Manor has invited everyone here.

182
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,049
It's to put Chai Yuguan on trial

183
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,120
to clarify what happened at Hengshan

184
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,000
and the five major sects'

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,440
attack on the Ghost Palace.

186
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,700
But whatever the truth may be.

187
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,240
Miss Bai.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,080
I have one request.

189
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,560
Since you've chosen to take over Ghost Palace,

190
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,360
please

191
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,040
keep your distance from Young Master Shen.

192
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,080
You'll only bring him harm.

193
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,050
Master Leng.

194
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,380
Instead of bothering her,

195
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,010
you should talk some sense into Shen Lang.

196
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,490
My Ghost Palace and Chai Yuguan

197
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,360
have a blood feud.

198
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,620
Thank you all from Renyi Manor

199
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,170
for capturing this person.

200
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,960
Today I borrow this place

201
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,480
to settle old scores.

202
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,840
In the future,

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,200
my Ghost Palace will be at Renyi Manor's service

204
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,920
whenever you need us.

205
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,880
But if Mr. Cold

206
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,280
has any issues with me personally,

207
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,320
I advise you,

208
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:34,880
today

209
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
you'd better keep them to yourself.

210
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,220
Otherwise,

211
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,960
I wouldn't mind before killing Chai Yuguan

212
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,480
finding someone foolish to test my blade on.

213
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,440
Bai Feifei!

214
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,050
I'd like to see who dares touch her.

215
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,640
Chai Yuguan has arrived.

216
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,720
It seems

217
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,620
you refuse to hand over

218
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,570
the Invincible Mirror.

219
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,040
Then let's

220
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,080
fight.

221
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
Chai Yuguan.

222
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,680
Feifei,

223
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,360
I sense he's not a master.

224
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
Is he really Chai Yuguan?

225
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,240
How could his skills be so ordinary?

226
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:50,840
Stay calm.

227
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,460
Let's question him first.

228
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,840
Chai Yuguan,

229
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,080
tell us the truth about what happened at Mount Heng.

230
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,640
Speak up now.

231
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,760
What are you talking about, Master Cold?

232
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,720
I don't understand.

233
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,920
If you won't admit it,

234
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,620
I'll say it for you.

235
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,200
At Mount Heng,

236
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,120
you conspired with the Yunmeng Fairy

237
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,180
to murder many martial arts masters.

238
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
Before they died,

239
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,090
you stole their martial arts manuals.

240
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,780
Then you used my mother

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,520
to kill the Nine Provinces King Shen Tianjun,

242
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,480
and gathered the five major sects to attack my Ghost Palace.

243
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,340
On the surface,

244
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,240
you want justice for Shen Tianjun.

245
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,240
But in reality,

246
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,480
you want to force my mother

247
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
to hand over the last martial arts manual.

248
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,210
And that book

249
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,960
is what we now know as

250
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,020
the Invincible Treasure.

251
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,810
Chai Yuguan,

252
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,860
won't you confess to your crimes?

253
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,240
You claim I did it,

254
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,900
but do you have any witnesses?

255
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,240
Any evidence?

256
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,640
No one survived the Hengshan incident.

257
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,800
And everyone died in the Ghost Palace battle.

258
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,840
With just your word,

259
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,560
you want to pin all the blame

260
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,440
on me, your father.

261
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,720
I'm innocent!

262
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,960
Chai Yuguan.

263
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you trying to twist the facts?

264
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,280
My dear son.

265
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,160
At the battle of Hengshan,

266
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,560
I lost my dear friend.

267
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,160
In the battle at Ghost Palace, I lost my beloved wife.

268
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,480
I took the alias 'Happy King'

269
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,240
and lived in seclusion beyond the border, training diligently for years.

270
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
What wrong have I done?

271
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,720
And now in the martial world of Zhongzhou,

272
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,800
Tie Huahe,

273
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,440
Jin Buhuan, Huang Yurong,

274
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,520
and even Li Changqing, the master of Renyi Manor,

275
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,180
all these martial arts elders

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,450
have died one by one at the hands of my unfilial daughter.

277
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,610
Why don't you go after her instead?

278
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,680
Why are you fixated on me?

279
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,290
What did you say?

280
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,960
You're saying the old manor master

281
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,690
died at the hands of Bai Feifei?

282
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,180
As far as I know,

283
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,400
after Shen Tianjun's death, his young son Shen Yue

284
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,440
gave his vast fortune to Li Changqing,

285
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
which is how Renyi Manor came to be.

286
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,240
And my unfilial daughter,

287
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,480
wanting to find information about Shen Yue,

288
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,920
went to Renyi Manor first.

289
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,040
But the old manor master

290
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,840
mysteriously died at that time.

291
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
If not her, then who could it be?

292
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,880
Am I right,

293
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,120
my daughter?

294
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,400
Bai Feifei.

295
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,610
Did the old manor lord really die by your hand?

296
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
That's right.

297
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,840
I killed Li Changqing.

298
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,280
Today,

299
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,100
it will be the same.

300
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,380
No matter if this Chai Yuguan is real or fake,

301
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,600
today I

302
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,200
want to tell the entire Zhongzhou.

303
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,080
I, Bai Feifei.

304
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,960
I must kill Chai Yuguan.

305
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,400
Stop her!

306
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,320
Master Li reversed his blood flow

307
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,520
and took his own life.

308
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
It had nothing to do with Bai Feifei.

309
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,880
How could she not be involved?

310
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,800
When all is said and done,

311
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,930
it was because of me.

312
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,720
Master Leng,

313
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,840
to be honest,

314
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,200
my real name is Shen Yue,

315
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,600
son of Shen Tianjun.

316
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Master Li's death

317
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,320
was to help conceal my identity.

318
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,000
Tell me

319
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,680
where the person who killed my mother

320
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,640
is now.

321
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
Fate is cruel,

322
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,800
Master Li.

323
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,320
Miss.

324
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,480
I beg for your forgiveness.

325
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,120
Young Hero Shen.

326
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,320
So it seems

327
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,980
there's a deep blood feud between your parents.

328
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,320
If you insist on protecting this witch today,

329
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,040
you'll be opposing the entire righteous martial arts world

330
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,240
and all the prestigious sects!

331
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,200
Righteous martial arts world?

332
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,330
Prestigious sects?

333
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,250
When all is said and done, we are merely

334
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,400
a group of mediocre people barking at shadows.

335
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,530
Grudges and righteousness

336
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,600
may be important in the martial world,

337
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,080
but for me,

338
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,900
the bond before my eyes

339
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,360
is priceless.

340
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,400
The current master of Ghost Palace, Bai Feifei,

341
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,880
is my wife.

342
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,090
I will not allow anyone to trouble her.

343
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,000
Young Hero Shen,

344
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,560
when the old master passed away,

345
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,000
you made a hundred-day promise.

346
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,290
Now that the truth is revealed,

347
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,960
what about your promise?

348
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,440
On the day I made that promise,

349
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
I did not know.

350
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,560
The Invincible Mirror originally belonged to Ghost Palace.

351
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,890
Now it has returned to Bai Feifei's hands,

352
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,800
it has simply returned to its rightful owner.

353
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,440
I have indeed broken my promise

354
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,760
and cannot escape blame.

355
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,840
But if someone must be held accountable,

356
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,440
I alone will bear the responsibility.

357
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,040
Shen Lang,

358
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
we've already cut ties completely.

359
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,560
My affairs

360
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,130
have nothing to do with you.

361
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,200
You may not acknowledge me,

362
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,330
that's your choice.

363
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,800
But my not failing you

364
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,720
is my choice.

365
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,180
I have long had no expectations in this life,

366
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,160
but you alone

367
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
I cannot let go.

368
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,060
It was your appearance

369
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,170
that brought change to my life.

370
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,000
So no matter what terrible troubles you cause,

371
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,800
I am willing to bear them for you.

372
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,480
Shen Lang,

373
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,359
you cannot bear this burden.

374
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,410
I, Shen Lang,

375
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,370
am willing to give up my martial arts today

376
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,090
and apologize to Master Li.

377
