1
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,080
This huge Yunmeng Manor

2
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,050
has no guards at all.

3
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,250
It seems we were overthinking.

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,760
Don't let your guard down.

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,800
We should still be careful.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,880
If we're any more cautious,

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,680
Brother Shen might not survive.

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to rush in

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,640
and see what Wang Lianhua

10
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,320
is really plotting.

11
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,220
Young Master Shen, have you made your decision?

12
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,220
Let's wait and see.

13
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:51,680
Mrs. Wang,

14
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,920
do you really

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
want to marry me?

16
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,290
Of course it's true.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,519
Do you truly promise me?

18
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,880
Marriage is a serious matter

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,480
and cannot be taken lightly.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,120
I have one more question for you.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Madam, now

22
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,840
you can do anything you want with me.

23
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,360
Let alone just asking a question.

24
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,970
Young Master Shen agreed so quickly just now.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,760
I'd like to know why.

26
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,720
Of course,

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,600
I want Wang Lianhua to accept me as her father.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,759
Besides,

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,240
you are a stunning beauty,

30
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,250
I can't help but admire you.

31
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,960
Have you seen enough?

32
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,520
If you have,

33
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,920
come pour some wine for your father.

34
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,280
Just the two of us drinking and enjoying ourselves in here

35
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,080
isn't much fun.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,000
Why don't we

37
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,960
invite those two ladies

38
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,840
waiting outside

39
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,200
to join us?

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,329
Please, have a seat.

41
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
Thank you for your invitation, Mrs. Wang.

42
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,690
I, Bai Feifei, pay my respects.

43
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,480
Brother Lianhua,

44
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,400
why don't you take a seat?

45
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Why are you still calling him Brother Lianhua?

46
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,480
Aren't you going to change how you address him?

47
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,340
What should I call him?

48
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,320
Though the wedding hasn't taken place yet,

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
you should call him Uncle.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Hua'er,

51
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,880
hurry up

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,370
and pour some wine for your Uncle Shen.

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,480
I was just joking.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,040
Marriage is a serious matter

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,570
and not to be taken lightly.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,400
That's what you just said.

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,000
I must congratulate you.

58
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,920
A happy marriage.

59
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,840
And blessed with a son.

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,680
Double happiness.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,079
Greetings, Uncle Shen.

62
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,010
We won't be drinking this wine.

63
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,880
We're here to take someone back.

64
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,680
Why are you pulling me?

65
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,440
We'll settle

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
our scores later.

67
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,130
Since everyone is here now.

68
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,760
Why don't

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,779
we discuss something important?

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,440
When should I

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,400
marry Young Master Shen?

72
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
How about three days from now?

73
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,080
No way.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,800
But I can't wait

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,760
to call you father.

76
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,170
You can call me that now,

77
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,000
but not after three days.

78
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,720
You'll have to wait.

79
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
How long must I wait?

80
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,170
Until your husband is dead.

81
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,600
Miss Bai truly understands me.

82
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,360
I asked my son to invite

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,960
Miss Bai originally,

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,130
but he brought Young Master Shen instead.

85
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,120
My jokes with Shen today

86
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,360
were to force you to come out.

87
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,180
So we can discuss together

88
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,260
how to eliminate Chai Yuguan.

89
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
I...

90
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,760
What if I refuse to cooperate?

91
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:01,960
How did I get here?

92
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,610
Who's there?

93
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,160
Is that you, Mother?

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,360
Mother?

95
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Brother Shen.

96
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,560
Feifei.

97
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,520
Feifei.

98
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,720
Kill him.

99
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,210
Why should I kill Brother Shen?

100
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
You are the young mistress of the Ghost Palace.

101
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,800
Your mission is revenge.

102
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,720
This man

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,600
is your biggest obstacle.

104
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Kill him.

105
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,280
No.

106
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,840
I cannot kill Brother Shen.

107
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,920
Why can't you

108
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,080
live on, Feifei?

109
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,040
Just for this man

110
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,640
you're willing to forget

111
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,240
the blood feud of our Phantom Palace?

112
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,920
If you let him into your heart,

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,760
he must die.

114
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,440
Soul-bewitching Dream Manipulation Technique.

115
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,600
Feifei, wake up!

116
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,560
Feifei!

117
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,640
Feifei!

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,040
It's me, Shen.

119
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
Brother Shen?

120
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:43,440
No!

121
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,560
No!

122
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,960
You're not my mother.

123
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
Who are you?

124
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,220
Of course I'm not your mother.

125
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,400
But I know

126
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,240
who

127
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,600
killed your mother.

128
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,760
Enough.

129
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,720
What exactly do you want?

130
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,280
Madam Wang.

131
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,120
I want...

132
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I want you to kill Chai Yuguan.

133
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,480
Yunmeng Fairy.

134
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
You set a trap to lure us here.

135
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,040
You must know where Chai Yuguan is.

136
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,000
Do you two know about

137
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,140
the Happy King beyond the border?

138
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,600
The one who rules beyond the border,

139
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
who commands the Four Emissaries of Wine, Lust, Wealth, and Power,

140
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,280
and the 36 Swift Riders?

141
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,340
Madam Wang.

142
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
Are you suggesting that...

143
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,760
That's right.

144
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,320
The Happy King

145
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
is Chai Yuguan.

146
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,419
This has nothing to do with you, Shen.

147
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,640
If anyone is going to kill Chai Yuguan,

148
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,500
it should be me.

149
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
No.

150
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,920
Chai Yuguan's power is unfathomable.

151
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,400
All of us together are no match for him.

152
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,530
It would be suicide.

153
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,560
Then I'll go.

154
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,620
My grudge with Chai Yuguan

155
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,560
has nothing to do with you.

156
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
If you go,

157
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,720
you'll be walking to your death.

158
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,210
And wouldn't you be doing the same?

159
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,880
No.

160
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,490
Absolutely not.

161
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,620
Feifei!

162
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,720
Feifei!

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
Shut up.

164
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Master Shen is so tender with women.

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,560
Now

166
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,720
I'm actually quite envious of

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,880
that Miss Bai.

168
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,480
In this world, the people you hate most

169
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,200
are Chai Yuguan and Bai Jing.

170
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,800
How could you possibly

171
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,560
let her daughter off so easily?

172
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,680
You knew very well that Bai Feifei

173
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,280
was no match for Chai Yuguan.

174
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,450
Yet you forced her to seek revenge.

175
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
To put it bluntly,

176
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,410
you just wanted to find a way

177
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,740
to eliminate the two people you hate most in this world.

178
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Indeed.

179
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,360
Nothing can be hidden from Master Shen.

180
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
Since I've made you a promise,

181
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,200
I will certainly keep it.

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,520
I hope madam will also keep her word

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,290
and stop making things difficult for her.

184
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,000
Of course.

185
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,200
Before I leave,

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,060
I want to see her one more time.

187
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
Don't cause any trouble.

188
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,920
Be quick about it.

189
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,400
Otherwise,

190
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
don't blame me for being merciless.

191
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,480
How could you let her escape?

192
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
You let Zhu Qiqi get away.

193
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,600
Quick, search over there!

194
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
I'll check that side.

195
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,720
She's not here.

196
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,800
Not here either.

197
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,100
Nothing on my side.

198
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,280
Where am I?

199
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,540
Where is Brother Shen and the others?

200
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Child.

201
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,040
Do you know how heartbroken your mother is?

202
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,680
Why are you and Bai Feifei

203
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,210
both children of that scoundrel Chai Yuguan?

204
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,890
Yet she is smarter than you,

205
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,240
more determined than you,

206
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,440
more clever than you.

207
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Tell me,

208
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,720
why is that?

209
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,240
Why is this so?

210
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,010
In response to you, Mother,

211
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,720
I am incompetent.

212
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,840
Why are you incompetent?

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,600
Why are you so incompetent?

214
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh, flower.

215
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
I'm truly heartbroken.

216
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,480
Why?

217
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,320
Tell me why you're so incompetent.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,160
Tell me why you're so incompetent.

219
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,480
So that's it.

220
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
This is

221
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,080
the real Wang Lianhua.

222
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,680
I really wonder how he grew up.

223
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,040
When will she wake up?

224
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
The master said

225
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,680
Young Master Shen,

226
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,960
the moment you depart for the outer regions,

227
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,160
she will be released.

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,800
I understand.

229
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
You may leave.

230
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,200
Brother Shen,

231
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,240
don't go!

232
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,720
You can't.

233
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
You mustn't go.

234
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,120
Brother Shen!

235
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,640
Shen

236
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,680
you can't go.

237
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,760
You can't go.

238
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,360
It's fine.

239
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,400
You can't go.

240
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,520
You can't.

241
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,520
Shen

242
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,600
don't leave.

243
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,440
Sister.

244
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,400
Where is Shen?

245
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,280
He left.

246
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,820
Where did he go?

247
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,320
He went beyond the pass

248
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,450
to find Chai Yuguan.

249
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,760
Bai Feifei

250
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,880
Shen Lang went beyond the border to seek revenge for you.

251
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,280
It was all his own choice.

252
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,370
You once used him to kill Tie Huahe.

253
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,360
Why can't you use him again to kill Chai Yuguan?

254
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,520
You once said

255
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,620
that I don't understand romantic feelings.

256
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,040
That day when I saw him chatting happily with your mother,

257
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,640
although I knew it wasn't what it seemed,

258
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,040
I was still angry inside.

259
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,640
I think

260
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,220
I finally understand now.

261
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,650
And since I understand,

262
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
I feel I shouldn't

263
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,480
use him as a pawn anymore.

264
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,000
I hope someday

265
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,240
you won't regret the choice you made today.
