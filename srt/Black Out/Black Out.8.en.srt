"Of Course" song, start!

00:00:28,882 --> 00:00:30,340
Shoot!

6
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,237
- What?
- Byeong-mu, Byeong-mu!

7
00:00:34,363 --> 00:00:36,042
Hey, Byeong-mu!

8
00:00:38,036 --> 00:00:39,908
Goh Jeong-woo!

9
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,455
Byeong-mu!

10
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,937
Nice!

11
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,334
Jeong-woo!

00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,540
Jeong-woo!

13
00:01:06,186 --> 00:01:09,167
Hey, this is really good ginseng liquor.

14
00:01:09,191 --> 00:01:10,158
Did you dig this up yourself?

15
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:11,295
Don't be so mean.

16
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,320
Yeah, sorry.

17
00:01:12,344 --> 00:01:13,935
Our CSAT is coming up,
so we have to drink the good stuff.

18
00:01:13,935 --> 00:01:15,748
Wouldn't it be better to study instead?

19
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:17,335
- Aren't you being a bit mean?
- Yeah, sorry.

20
00:01:17,335 --> 00:01:19,506
Ta-da!

21
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,392
Are you holding a ritual?

22
00:01:20,416 --> 00:01:21,505
Aren't you being a bit mean?

23
00:01:21,505 --> 00:01:23,443
Geon-oh's going to bring
some killer whiskey.

24
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:24,508
Who's Geon-oh?

25
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:25,655
That cop pig's son.

26
00:01:25,655 --> 00:01:26,888
Oh, him.

BLACK OUT - DEATH TO SNOW WHITE

28
00:01:52,894 --> 00:01:53,826
Look at this bastard.

JEONG-SIK
<i>Pardon?</i>

30
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:55,464
<i>What did you say, sir?</i>

31
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:57,150
No, I wasn't saying that to you.

32
00:01:57,174 --> 00:01:58,276
- Jeong-sik.
- <i>Yes.</i>

33
00:01:58,276 --> 00:01:59,913
That Byeong-mu bastard's a total snake.

34
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:00,612
<i>What?</i>

35
00:02:00,612 --> 00:02:04,854
So head to the hospital right now
with Chang-wook.

36
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:06,149
And keep this call on.

37
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:07,091
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

38
00:02:07,115 --> 00:02:08,234
I'll be right there.

39
00:02:09,434 --> 00:02:11,708
Damn it. I wish I could ram into him.

40
00:02:17,424 --> 00:02:19,355
Darn it.

41
00:02:27,076 --> 00:02:28,622
You give up?

42
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,371
You bastard.

43
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:01,864
Darn it.

44
00:03:01,888 --> 00:03:03,190
You...

45
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:05,314
You bastard, you bastard!

46
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,565
Come here.

47
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,215
Come here, damn it!

48
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,903
Oh, that hurts.

49
00:03:27,201 --> 00:03:28,730
Oh, my eye.

50
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:30,700
Damn it!

51
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,168
You jerk!

52
00:03:38,362 --> 00:03:40,328
Just answer my questions.

53
00:03:40,525 --> 00:03:42,567
Why did you kill Bo-yeong?

54
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,711
I don't know what you've heard
or from who...

55
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:46,433
But Jeong-woo, I...

56
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:51,269
I know you were with Bo-yeong that day
in the warehouse.

57
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:54,382
Do you have proof? Huh?

58
00:03:54,406 --> 00:03:55,985
Bo-yeong's phone.

59
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:57,716
Her underwear...

60
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:00,708
I found everything.

61
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,445
Why did you kill Bo-yeong?

62
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:05,669
No...

63
00:04:05,693 --> 00:04:07,437
No, no.

64
00:04:07,437 --> 00:04:09,420
Why did you kill Bo-yeong?
Tell me, you son of a bitch!

65
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:10,824
No!

66
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:12,731
It's all because of you.

67
00:04:12,732 --> 00:04:14,939
Because of you, it's all because of you!

68
00:04:17,603 --> 00:04:18,273
What?

69
00:04:18,297 --> 00:04:21,718
If we had just gotten drunk
at your house that day...

70
00:04:21,742 --> 00:04:23,833
None of this would have happened.

71
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:36,126
Min-su, you're not that kind of person.

72
00:04:36,751 --> 00:04:38,056
Right?

73
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,421
You wouldn't do that.

74
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,948
Jeong-woo...

75
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:48,242
Tell me everything
that happened that day,

76
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:49,851
who you were with...

77
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:51,030
Without leaving anything out.

78
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:53,344
Or I'll kill you today.

79
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:55,168
Jeong-woo, Jeong-woo, Jeong-woo...

80
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,941
Byeong-mu.

81
00:05:04,402 --> 00:05:06,592
Hey! Stop looking at your phone.

82
00:05:06,616 --> 00:05:08,861
- You don't even have a boyfriend.
- You've never had a boyfriend.

83
00:05:09,706 --> 00:05:12,573
I'll date you starting today. Okay?

84
00:05:12,597 --> 00:05:14,127
Get lost.

85
00:05:14,924 --> 00:05:16,268
Moron.

86
00:05:16,292 --> 00:05:18,204
Hey, what's wrong with me?

87
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:20,342
When I go downtown,
the girls line up for me.

88
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:21,425
What a joke.

89
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:22,497
You think you're Goh Jeong-woo?

90
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:23,691
Darn...

91
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,236
Do you have some problems at home?

92
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,311
Mind your own business.

93
00:05:28,335 --> 00:05:30,442
Did your dad drink again?

94
00:05:33,629 --> 00:05:35,877
Hey, Bo-yeong.
Now that I look at you,

95
00:05:35,901 --> 00:05:37,998
you look exactly like your mom.

96
00:05:38,022 --> 00:05:41,554
Get lost, you look just like your dad,
you freaking pig.

97
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:44,832
Hey, he's just concerned for you.
Why are you overreacting?

98
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:45,876
Worry about yourself.

99
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,396
This is why your mom abandoned you
and ran away!

100
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:52,147
Hey, hey, hey!

101
00:05:52,171 --> 00:05:53,177
Hey, wait, wait.

102
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:54,983
Shim Bo-yeong! You crossed the line.

103
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:55,939
Hey, Byeong-mu.

104
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,079
Hey, let's play a game instead.

105
00:05:57,103 --> 00:05:58,681
Let go of me. Hey.

106
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:01,577
You like Goh Jeong-woo, don't you?

107
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,656
You think he'll even look at you?

108
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,342
Would he even look your way
when he has Da-eun?

109
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:08,825
Hey.

110
00:06:08,987 --> 00:06:10,357
Then what about you?

111
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:12,965
Do you think Jeong-woo
considers you two friends?

112
00:06:12,989 --> 00:06:15,875
Don't you know you're just his lackeys?

113
00:06:15,899 --> 00:06:19,079
You're Jeong-woo's lackeys!
The entire school knows it!

114
00:06:19,103 --> 00:06:21,078
You're just lackeys!

115
00:06:21,961 --> 00:06:23,339
Hey, say that again.

116
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,443
- Say that again.
- You're a lackey, you bastard!

117
00:06:26,588 --> 00:06:27,969
Stop.

118
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:30,746
- Say that again.
- Stop.

119
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,376
Stop!

120
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,191
Stop!

121
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,740
I was just trying to stop Byeong-mu.
I really couldn't do anything about it.

122
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,104
Please save me!

123
00:06:53,128 --> 00:06:54,645
- That bastard.
- Please save me!

124
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,351
I can't swim!

125
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,145
- Save me!
- You're not going to die.

126
00:06:58,755 --> 00:07:00,647
It's not even that deep. Geez.

127
00:07:00,924 --> 00:07:01,674
Darn.

128
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:04,288
Hey, save me!

129
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,819
I really need to quit being a cop.

130
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:10,588
It was all fabricated!
It's fake!

131
00:07:10,835 --> 00:07:12,221
Fabricated?

132
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,876
Did you just say it's fake?

133
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:21,331
DNA doesn't lie,

134
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,742
Darn.

135
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:26,721
You call yourselves friends?

136
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,455
No, no.
No, no.

137
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,651
- Who killed her?
- No, no.

138
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:35,455
Bo-yeong ended up like that, but...

139
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:36,676
Who killed her?

140
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,159
But it wasn't us! It wasn't us.

141
00:07:39,183 --> 00:07:40,758
It wasn't us...

142
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,849
Jeong-woo, it's not true.

143
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:44,112
Shin Min-su!

144
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:45,851
Hey, please save me!

145
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,230
Please save me,
this murderer is trying to kill me.

146
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,653
- Please save me...
- <i>Hey, Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

147
00:07:49,653 --> 00:07:50,305
- Save me.
- Goh Jeong-woo, listen.

148
00:07:50,305 --> 00:07:53,151
<i>I've caught Yang Byeong-mu,</i>
<i>so don't do anything.</i>

149
00:07:53,329 --> 00:07:55,765
Don't cause trouble, okay?

150
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,372
Detective, I didn't kill them.

151
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,714
<i>I know, I know.</i>

152
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,193
<i>Goh Jeong-woo, I know.</i>
<i>So calm down, okay?</i>

153
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:09,728
I didn't kill them...

154
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:18,862
First off, I am going to hire a lawyer.

155
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:20,421
I'm not going to settle.

156
00:08:21,836 --> 00:08:23,705
Please call my dad.

157
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,299
Mr. Shin Min-su.

158
00:08:26,323 --> 00:08:28,434
You are under arrest
for aggravated rape, murder...

159
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,550
- ...and unlawful disposal of a body.
- No, I...

160
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,437
You have the right to an attorney and
you have the right to remain silent...

161
00:08:32,437 --> 00:08:34,639
He tried to kill me!

162
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,822
- You can tell us at the station.
- I don't know about Bo-yeong!

163
00:08:36,846 --> 00:08:38,146
Stay still, you punk!

164
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,515
Let's discuss this at the station.

165
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:42,089
Why would I kill Shim Bo-yeong?

166
00:08:42,113 --> 00:08:44,132
- Hey, come on! Let's just go.
- Call my dad, please.

167
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,162
- Call my dad, please.
- Come on, let's go.

168
00:08:46,186 --> 00:08:48,270
Call my dad, please!

169
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,851
Stop resisting. Come on.

170
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:23,604
What do we do?

171
00:09:32,463 --> 00:09:35,807
Jeong-woo, I'll stay by your side

172
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:39,119
...until the very end.

173
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:52,310
I have to go now.

174
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,833
What a joke.

175
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:14,533
You're nothing but lackeys.

176
00:10:18,003 --> 00:10:21,408
You're not even real men.

177
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:24,561
<i>Hyeon Geon-oh.</i>

178
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,345
<i>Why did you do it?</i>
<i>Why did you do it, why did you do it!</i>

179
00:10:30,716 --> 00:10:32,123
Bo-yeong...

180
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:33,971
Bo-yeong...

181
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:37,770
Alcohol.

182
00:10:37,794 --> 00:10:39,940
Please get me some alcohol.

183
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,359
Wait, Hyeon Geon-oh.

184
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:43,644
Your alcohol withdrawals
are really severe right now.

185
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:45,469
You need to go to the hospital.

186
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:47,850
You need to get some sleep.

187
00:10:47,874 --> 00:10:50,220
Bring me some alcohol.

188
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:52,462
Hyeon Geon-oh...

189
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:59,294
Bo-yeong...

190
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:05,001
Bo-yeong,
I didn't mean for it to happen. Bo-yeong...

191
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,045
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:08,336
- Hyeon Geon-oh, are you okay?
- Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong...

193
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,713
Hyeon Geon...

194
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,797
Hyeon Geon-oh!

195
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,311
Hyeon Geon-oh!

196
00:11:20,852 --> 00:11:22,383
Hey, Hyeon Geon-oh.

197
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,603
My scooter...

198
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:26,174
Hyeon Geon-oh!

199
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,198
What is this?

200
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:33,848
I don't know how Team Head Noh
found Shim Bo-yeong's phone, but...

201
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:35,922
There was a video on it.

202
00:11:42,216 --> 00:11:44,482
And this is the DNA test result...

203
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:47,046
...from the victim's underwear
that was found.

204
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,913
Underwear?

205
00:11:47,937 --> 00:11:50,088
Yes, he somehow found that as well.

206
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,548
TEST SUBJECTS:
SHIN MIN-SU, GOH JEONG-WOO,

207
00:11:54,573 --> 00:11:55,667
HYEON GEON-OH, YANG BYEONG-MU

208
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:01,114
<i>Hello!</i>

209
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,866
<i>Why isn't anyone reacting?</i>

210
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,202
<i>Hey, hey, hey! It's a video.</i>

211
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,127
<i>Hi!</i>

212
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,622
<i>Yeah!</i>

213
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:12,507
<i>Hey, Geon-oh.</i>

214
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,605
Excuse me, you have to pay first...

215
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:26,889
<i>Hey, hey, hey, Geon-oh, Geon-oh.</i>

216
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:27,844
<i>Yeah?</i>

217
00:12:27,868 --> 00:12:30,544
<i>- The most...</i>
<i>- The most...</i>

218
00:12:30,568 --> 00:12:32,771
<i>- Expensive...</i>
<i>- Expensive...</i>

219
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:35,127
<i>- One in your house. Go bring it.</i>
<i>- One in my house.</i>

220
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,424
<i>Okay!</i>

221
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:39,895
<i>I'll bring you the most</i>
<i>expensive alcohol. Just wait.</i>

222
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:41,921
<i>Good.</i>

223
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:44,257
<i>- Bring us something good.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

224
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:45,682
<i>Hurry back.</i>

225
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:57,602
But the DNA test results say only
Byeong-mu and Shin Min-su...

226
00:12:57,626 --> 00:12:59,442
...are a match.

227
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:01,813
This just doesn't make any sense.

228
00:13:01,837 --> 00:13:04,371
I think they confused it
with Goh Jeong-woo's DNA.

229
00:13:04,395 --> 00:13:06,254
You take the National Forensic Service
for a joke?

230
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:07,795
You think they'd make such a mistake?

231
00:13:08,825 --> 00:13:10,581
No, but...

232
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:13,771
After this video,
Goh Jeong-woo went to the warehouse...

233
00:13:13,795 --> 00:13:16,214
...Goh Jeong-woo, Hyeon Geon-oh and killed
Park Da-eun are not matches and Shim Bo-yeong.

234
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:18,081
Shin Min-su, Yang Byeong-mu
So it should show...

235
00:13:18,082 --> 00:13:19,578
...are matches Goh Jeong-woo's DNA.

236
00:13:20,045 --> 00:13:22,138
- But it didn't...
- Keep it down for a minute!

237
00:13:23,382 --> 00:13:24,750
So then.

238
00:13:26,412 --> 00:13:30,161
Geon-oh's DNA wasn't found
on the underwear, right?

239
00:13:30,185 --> 00:13:32,384
Of course not.

240
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:36,268
Why did he even bother
to check for Geon-oh's DNA?

241
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:37,669
Good.

242
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:58,854
- Please wait for a minute.
- Okay.

243
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,613
I've searched everywhere he could be
but he doesn't seem to be around here.

244
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:05,133
I should've stopped him
from getting out. I'm sorry.

245
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,458
Thank you for your effort.

246
00:14:06,482 --> 00:14:08,050
So he took your scooter?

247
00:14:09,272 --> 00:14:11,653
Then he must've gone downtown.

248
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:14,594
- I'll go look for him.
- Wait, let's go together.

249
00:14:14,618 --> 00:14:16,140
Since this feels like my fault...

250
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,738
Wait! Wait!

251
00:14:37,508 --> 00:14:39,079
Why was Min-su arrested?

252
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,702
What did our Min-su do wrong!

253
00:14:40,703 --> 00:14:42,407
It's nothing, just go inside.

254
00:14:42,408 --> 00:14:43,615
It's not nothing.

255
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:44,948
This is about Min-su, I need to know.

256
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,587
Darn it, you don't know anything!

257
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,072
Geez!

258
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,321
It'll become more difficult if you go.

259
00:14:51,345 --> 00:14:53,398
So just wait at home.

260
00:14:58,703 --> 00:15:01,014
Make sure everyone stays quiet
and doesn't let any rumors spread.

261
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:02,025
Yes, sir.

262
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,814
Mister! Mister!

263
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:06,090
I mean, Chief. Chief!

264
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:08,752
Please, please save me.
Please.

265
00:15:08,776 --> 00:15:10,417
It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

266
00:15:10,441 --> 00:15:11,677
Something's gone wrong.

267
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,017
Please?

268
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:14,539
You know, right?

269
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:18,740
Hey, Byeong-mu is family!

270
00:15:18,764 --> 00:15:22,666
Why did you go overboard
and arrest him like this?

271
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,145
You can just interview him as a witness!

272
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:26,660
Section Chief,
don't you see this?

273
00:15:26,701 --> 00:15:28,727
He tried to kill me.

274
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:30,625
What? Did you get a little cut?

275
00:15:30,649 --> 00:15:32,499
Then go to the hospital.
I'll question him.

276
00:15:32,523 --> 00:15:34,694
No, I'll take care of it.
Hey, stop putting on a show and get up.

277
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,105
Get up!

278
00:15:36,484 --> 00:15:38,856
- Look here, you bastard...
- Section Chief Kim.

279
00:15:40,062 --> 00:15:43,739
There was more than enough reason
for the arrest.

280
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:47,861
Byeong-mu...

281
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:51,230
...aren't you old enough to keep
your work and private life separate?

282
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:52,414
Huh?

283
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,691
I saw it too.

284
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:58,213
The video in the victim's phone
and the Forensic results.

285
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,236
That's more than enough.

286
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:03,583
So you're giving me permission
to do a thorough investigation?

287
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:04,808
"Thorough"?

288
00:16:05,157 --> 00:16:06,995
How else would you conduct
this investigation?

289
00:16:08,222 --> 00:16:11,194
Team Head Noh, Section Chief Kim.
Listen up.

290
00:16:12,032 --> 00:16:13,758
Detective Yang is family.

291
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:15,583
But right now, he's a suspect.

292
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,877
I don't want people to suggest
that we went easy on him.

293
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:21,588
So stick to the evidence
and follow proper protocols...

294
00:16:21,628 --> 00:16:23,041
...and investigate this thoroughly.

295
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,523
I understand, sir.

296
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,108
Dry off or you'll catch a cold.

297
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,275
Mister...

298
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,211
Mister! Chief!

299
00:16:32,235 --> 00:16:34,475
Get over here, you bastard.
Move.

300
00:16:43,812 --> 00:16:45,240
Be careful.

301
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:57,729
When was the last time
you saw the victim, Shim Bo-yeong?

302
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:04,193
November 19, 2013.

303
00:17:04,217 --> 00:17:05,659
You drank with Shim Bo-yeong,
Shin Min-su...

304
00:17:05,683 --> 00:17:08,177
...and Hyeon Geon-oh
at the warehouse, right?

305
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:15,152
After 10 p.m., Hyeon Geon-oh
left the warehouse to get more alcohol.

306
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:18,231
You stayed behind with Shin Min-su
and sexually assaulted...

307
00:17:19,452 --> 00:17:20,807
...Shim Bo-yeong, right?

308
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:23,368
Why did you do it?

309
00:17:30,022 --> 00:17:31,087
Hey...

310
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,617
Why did you do it?

311
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,773
That despicable bastard.

312
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:42,550
How dare he plead the Fifth?

313
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,107
Geon-oh could've ruined his life
because he made bad friends.

314
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:56,247
Are you going to keep remaining silent?

315
00:17:56,999 --> 00:17:59,352
You were a detective only an hour ago.

316
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:01,647
So you must know that remaining silent
puts you at a disadvantage.

317
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,021
Team Head...

318
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:05,877
I...

319
00:18:06,989 --> 00:18:10,190
I lived off cheap microwave dinners
and instant noodles...

320
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,500
...at Noryangjin to pass the police exam.

321
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,533
I've worked so hard to live a good life.

322
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,979
I haven't slept more than 6 hours
a night since that day.

323
00:18:23,003 --> 00:18:25,700
I worked really hard to prepare
for my promotions.

324
00:18:26,701 --> 00:18:28,813
I exercised every day after work.

325
00:18:29,065 --> 00:18:31,577
Do you know how much effort
I put in to become a detective?

326
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,873
If you really wanted to be a detective,
you should've followed the law first.

327
00:18:34,933 --> 00:18:38,668
You sex offenders always
give the same story. Always.

328
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:41,164
What makes your story so important?

329
00:18:41,188 --> 00:18:44,273
Who cares if your life
has been filled with ups and downs?

330
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:46,405
You rapist scumbag.

331
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:54,380
When was the last time
you saw the victim, Shim Bo-young?

332
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,327
Yang Byeong-mu, when was it?

333
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:17,911
Did you have someone tail me?

334
00:19:19,914 --> 00:19:21,881
That's not what's important here.

335
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:27,870
I only visited Su-oh with her
because she's a good friend of his.

336
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:29,309
It's nothing.

337
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,587
I don't think so.

338
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:33,207
There must be a reason
you went together.

339
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:36,480
All things have a result,
which means they have a cause.

340
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:42,350
It was because of Su-oh.

341
00:19:42,374 --> 00:19:46,014
He wouldn't talk to me,
even though I'm his physician.

342
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:48,276
But he talks to her...

343
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,413
...and opens up to her.

344
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:02,253
I don't know.

345
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:04,335
Something still bothers me.

346
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:07,012
Ever since that murderer, Goh Jeong-woo,
was released.

347
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,519
You've been getting strange messages.

348
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:12,724
And various incidents
seem to keep occurring.

349
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:19,058
From now on, tell me everything,
no matter how trivial.

350
00:20:19,175 --> 00:20:21,156
Tell me and wait.

351
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,291
Got that?

352
00:20:28,108 --> 00:20:30,370
I want to hear your answer.

353
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:35,786
There's no need for that.

354
00:20:35,918 --> 00:20:37,900
You know I always obey you.

355
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,628
Don't forget.

356
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,973
What I always say.

357
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:44,229
Okay.

358
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:50,026
Hey, Shin Min-su.

359
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:52,407
When was the last time
you saw the victim, Shim Bo-young?

360
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,060
I don't know. I don't remember.

361
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,170
<i>How many times are you going to</i>
<i>say the same thing?</i>

362
00:20:59,194 --> 00:21:00,653
<i>I guess...</i>

363
00:21:00,924 --> 00:21:02,908
<i>I won't be going home tonight.</i>

364
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,147
<i>That night at 9:09 p.m.</i>

365
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:08,237
You were drinking with Yang Byeong-mu
in the warehouse.

366
00:21:08,261 --> 00:21:10,704
It's all in Shim Bo-yeong's phone.

367
00:21:10,845 --> 00:21:12,338
So don't even think about lying.

368
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,568
Tell me the truth.

369
00:21:13,592 --> 00:21:16,044
I really don't know anything!

370
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:17,517
I don't know, I don't know.

371
00:21:17,575 --> 00:21:19,842
Please, call my dad. Please?

372
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:21,773
<i>Please call my dad.</i>

373
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,441
Sir, someone is here to see you.

374
00:21:28,946 --> 00:21:30,640
Gu-tak, Gu-tak!

375
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,924
Don't do this.
The chief isn't here right now.

376
00:21:32,948 --> 00:21:34,433
If you have something to say,
please tell me.

377
00:21:34,457 --> 00:21:36,800
Hey, move aside,
do you even know who we are?

378
00:21:36,824 --> 00:21:38,450
Hurry up and get Hyeon Gu-tak.

379
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:39,978
To tell you about us...

380
00:21:40,002 --> 00:21:42,554
We're your chief's seniors.
His seniors.

381
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:43,827
- Gu-tak!
- Oh, come one.

382
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:45,487
- Hey, Gu-tak!
- What are you doing here?

383
00:21:45,511 --> 00:21:46,876
- Hyeon Gu-tak!
- Wait...

384
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,095
Section Chief Kim.

385
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,735
Gu-tak...

386
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,758
Everyone, get back to work.

387
00:21:55,782 --> 00:21:57,082
Yes, sir.

388
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:00,983
- Let's go inside.
- Sure.

389
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:11,577
Please have a seat.

390
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:14,821
What a life you've got.

391
00:22:14,845 --> 00:22:16,092
When will you release our boys?

392
00:22:16,116 --> 00:22:17,700
I said to sit down!

393
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:25,990
You did feed them, right?

394
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:29,047
They should be having
a nice meal at home.

395
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:37,668
They can't get out.

396
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:38,713
What?

397
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:40,643
They'll probably go from the holding cell
to the detention center.

398
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,775
They may even end up in prison.

399
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:49,146
Wait, what are you saying?

400
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,012
Huh?

401
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:53,566
Who cares about these results?
You need to let our boys go!

402
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,267
Please read that carefully
before you talk.

403
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,807
Why isn't Geon-oh in here?

404
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,450
How did he get out of this?

405
00:23:07,474 --> 00:23:10,760
If they're going down,
I'm taking you with us.

406
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:13,211
You think we'll stay quiet about this?

407
00:23:13,235 --> 00:23:14,768
You should stay quiet.

408
00:23:16,239 --> 00:23:18,098
If you go around spouting nonsense,

409
00:23:18,122 --> 00:23:20,873
they could end up with 10-to 20-year
sentences instead of being not guilty.

410
00:23:23,514 --> 00:23:24,939
Oh, no.

411
00:23:27,004 --> 00:23:29,295
I didn't pull Geon-oh out.

412
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:35,320
<i>- The most expensive one.</i>
<i>- Most expensive.</i>

413
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:36,967
<i>Okay!</i>

414
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:39,217
<i>I'll bring you the most</i>
<i>expensive alcohol. Just wait.</i>

415
00:23:39,241 --> 00:23:40,603
<i>Yeah.</i>

416
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,163
<i>Bring us something good.</i>

417
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,110
Hurry up.

418
00:23:44,134 --> 00:23:48,244
If this was found in Bo-yeong's phone...

419
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:52,364
...does that make Geon-oh innocent?

420
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,587
Your son, Geon-oh, was there too!

421
00:23:59,445 --> 00:24:01,073
My Geon-oh...

422
00:24:01,395 --> 00:24:03,773
...went home to get more alcohol.

423
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,329
Okay?

424
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,896
Don't you get it?

425
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:10,367
Geon-oh went home to get alcohol,
and fell asleep.

426
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:12,109
This is the evidence.

427
00:24:16,706 --> 00:24:18,628
Damn it!

428
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:21,694
Hey, get up.

429
00:24:21,747 --> 00:24:23,000
Get up!

430
00:24:23,024 --> 00:24:24,470
What are you doing?

431
00:24:24,682 --> 00:24:26,085
Chu-ho...

432
00:24:26,217 --> 00:24:30,960
The only person that can
save Byeong-mu is...

433
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:34,059
...Chief Hyeon.

434
00:24:34,083 --> 00:24:35,340
- Hey!
- Gu-tak...

435
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:37,474
Are you really going to be like this?

436
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:39,292
Are you serious? Damn it.

437
00:24:39,316 --> 00:24:41,051
Damn this!

438
00:24:42,411 --> 00:24:44,581
I'm going out there right now...

439
00:24:44,605 --> 00:24:46,872
...to expose everything, you bastard!

440
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,795
Chu-ho, if you leave right now,

441
00:24:49,836 --> 00:24:51,542
you won't get another chance.

442
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:56,172
That's right.

443
00:24:56,705 --> 00:24:58,496
Go out there and talk all you want.

444
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:01,131
Who do you think will believe you?

445
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,566
This is the Mucheon Police Station.

446
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,180
Everyone here is my family.

447
00:25:10,613 --> 00:25:12,426
Gosh, Chu-ho.

448
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,960
I'm doing my best right now.

449
00:25:21,229 --> 00:25:22,566
Okay.

450
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:24,882
Leave then.

451
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:26,971
Do whatever you want.

452
00:25:27,687 --> 00:25:31,387
You will get to witness how Min-su...

453
00:25:31,411 --> 00:25:33,702
...slowly deteriorates in prison.

454
00:25:34,961 --> 00:25:36,373
Do as you wish.

455
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:06,704
My son...

456
00:26:08,632 --> 00:26:10,548
How can I get him out?

457
00:26:15,635 --> 00:26:17,643
I'll do whatever you tell me to.

458
00:26:26,887 --> 00:26:28,683
Gosh.

459
00:26:33,275 --> 00:26:35,094
Darn it, my scooter.

460
00:26:36,786 --> 00:26:38,933
- What...
- Move aside.

461
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:41,936
Thank you.

462
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:44,709
Darn it.

463
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,287
Just a moment.

464
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:50,696
I only bought this recently...

465
00:26:51,102 --> 00:26:53,308
Why would he take this?

466
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:55,878
Is there any damage?

467
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:00,611
Ha Seol...

468
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,494
I think he bought alcohol here.

469
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,683
I'll look around a little longer.

470
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:32,175
You piece of trash.

471
00:27:34,151 --> 00:27:36,480
You coward.

472
00:27:40,049 --> 00:27:41,585
<i>Geon-oh...</i>

473
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,454
<i>Hyeon Geon-oh...</i>

474
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:47,145
<i>Geon-oh...</i>

475
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:53,327
<i>Geon-oh.</i>

476
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:54,980
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

477
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:56,876
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

478
00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:00,489
<i>Why did you do it, Hyeon Geon-oh?</i>

479
00:28:07,392 --> 00:28:10,518
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

480
00:28:16,459 --> 00:28:17,749
Come in.

481
00:28:27,383 --> 00:28:30,563
Is this enough for lunch?

482
00:28:43,257 --> 00:28:45,129
Please have a seat.

483
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:49,216
- Sit down.
- Yes, sir.

484
00:28:54,156 --> 00:28:56,852
I'd like to hear your opinion.

485
00:28:57,292 --> 00:28:58,399
Huh?

486
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,606
Is there a problem?

487
00:29:03,481 --> 00:29:06,367
When you look at that video
and the DNA analysis results,

488
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,331
it's clear that Byeong-mu and Min-su...

489
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:11,516
...sexually assaulted Shim Bo-young, right?

490
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:14,612
Yes.

491
00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:18,921
Then does that mean...

492
00:29:20,187 --> 00:29:22,709
...they also killed Shim Bo-young?

493
00:29:25,452 --> 00:29:29,600
Did we possibly screw up
the investigation back then?

494
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,357
No.

495
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:43,311
Goh Jeong-woo killed her.

496
00:29:48,591 --> 00:29:51,152
As I mentioned last night,

497
00:29:51,176 --> 00:29:52,464
that video...

498
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:54,469
...was recorded by Shim Bo-yeong herself...

499
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:56,856
...when she was still alive.

500
00:29:57,218 --> 00:29:58,437
Right.

501
00:29:58,461 --> 00:30:03,156
After that, Geon-oh went back home
and fell asleep.

502
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:08,404
Shin Min-su and Yang Byeong-mu raped her.

503
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:12,177
- Stop.
- Then they probably ran away in fear.

504
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:14,262
After that...

505
00:30:14,456 --> 00:30:18,977
Goh Jeong-woo entered the warehouse
while intoxicated.

506
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:24,414
And as Shim Bo-yeong couldn't leave
from the shock of the assault...

507
00:30:28,214 --> 00:30:29,514
Right.

508
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:31,469
Then what if...

509
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:37,093
...Goh Jeong-woo entered the warehouse
with Park Da-eun?

510
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:44,872
Yes, that's right.

511
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:49,669
Then the three had a quarrel.

512
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:53,641
And Goh Jeong-woo murdered...

513
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:55,909
...Shim Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun.

514
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:03,116
That's it.

515
00:31:04,437 --> 00:31:06,815
But we don't have
any conclusive evidence.

516
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:11,247
Of course, I know how sharp
your instincts still are.

517
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:13,824
They haven't changed in 10 years.

518
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:16,962
Plus Goh Jeong-woo
has already served his sentence.

519
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,503
This situation is so...

520
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:25,698
There's no valid reason
to reopen this case.

521
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:27,295
- That's the case, right?
- Yes.

522
00:31:27,319 --> 00:31:31,096
So what exactly can we prove with that?

523
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:35,141
Yang Byeong-mu...

524
00:31:36,101 --> 00:31:38,946
...can just be charged with sexual assault.

525
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:41,413
Right.

526
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:45,522
But the statute of limitations
on sexual assault is complicated.

527
00:31:45,546 --> 00:31:49,622
We'll have to review the law
and speak with his lawyers as well.

528
00:31:50,434 --> 00:31:51,163
Yes.

529
00:31:51,187 --> 00:31:53,087
Anyway, I understand what you're saying.

530
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:00,269
But...

531
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,251
How did Geon-oh get that evidence?

532
00:32:05,474 --> 00:32:09,196
And where has he been
keeping it all this time?

533
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,134
Geon-oh is sick.

534
00:32:16,158 --> 00:32:17,590
What? How...

535
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:21,158
But even if he's sick, he should be
interviewed as a witness, right?

536
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:24,117
I'll go and get Geon-oh.

537
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:27,277
If anything happens,
contact me right away.

538
00:32:27,301 --> 00:32:30,083
But you should eat first...

539
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:37,735
Geon-oh...

540
00:32:37,911 --> 00:32:39,067
Don't worry, okay?

541
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:42,609
Even if I have to sell everything I own,

542
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,276
I'll get you out of here.

543
00:32:44,674 --> 00:32:46,017
Really?

544
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:48,316
Then I won't have to go to prison?

545
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,994
Of course not.
Why would you even mention prison?

546
00:32:52,803 --> 00:32:54,228
Look...

547
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,655
...how much have you told them?

548
00:32:59,184 --> 00:33:00,592
Well...

549
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,591
Just what I did to Bo-yeong...

550
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:13,189
Let me out!

551
00:33:13,213 --> 00:33:14,916
Hey, Yang Byeong-mu!

552
00:33:15,522 --> 00:33:17,576
If you keep that up,
I'll put you in handcuffs.

553
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,176
Sit quietly.

554
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,863
Do you think that makes any sense?

555
00:33:25,368 --> 00:33:26,898
What do you want me to do?

556
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,277
What you did...

557
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:34,681
Confess to it.

558
00:33:35,673 --> 00:33:37,723
What you did to Bo-yeong.

559
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,516
Just that. Only that.

560
00:33:42,035 --> 00:33:43,463
Gu-tak agreed to...

561
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:48,414
...find the best lawyer for you.

562
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:51,563
I don't want to.

563
00:33:55,173 --> 00:33:58,088
Just do as Chief Hyeon says.

564
00:33:58,112 --> 00:33:59,534
I said no.

565
00:34:00,035 --> 00:34:01,682
I don't want to.

566
00:34:03,013 --> 00:34:04,768
Gu-tak...

567
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:09,506
...is the most powerful person I know.

568
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,642
And he's the most successful.

569
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,547
Of all the numbers I have in my phone,

570
00:34:16,723 --> 00:34:20,210
Gu-tak is the most successful person.

571
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:24,009
He's the only one
we can rely on right now.

572
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:27,629
All of our lives are on the line.

573
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,349
Do you understand that?

574
00:34:32,438 --> 00:34:34,834
What will you do
if I just expose everything?

575
00:34:41,436 --> 00:34:45,756
You'll end up in there for longer.

576
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:50,548
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:51,783 --> 00:34:55,113
I'm sorry for being a bad father...

578
00:34:55,137 --> 00:34:56,740
- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be sorry, Dad?

579
00:34:56,764 --> 00:34:58,289
You have no reason to be sorry.

580
00:34:58,313 --> 00:34:59,375
I'm sorry.

581
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,953
Why should you be sorry, Dad?

582
00:35:09,543 --> 00:35:11,110
Geon-oh!

583
00:35:27,374 --> 00:35:28,487
CONGRESSWOMAN YE YEONG-SIL

584
00:35:36,038 --> 00:35:37,405
Yes, Congresswoman.

585
00:35:38,016 --> 00:35:39,600
Yes, it's been a while.

586
00:35:41,652 --> 00:35:43,022
Right now?

587
00:35:43,982 --> 00:35:45,696
I'm a bit busy...

588
00:35:46,127 --> 00:35:47,643
No, it's fine.

589
00:35:48,134 --> 00:35:49,365
Yes, I'll be right there.

590
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,289
Okay. I'll meet you there.

591
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,566
But Congresswoman,

592
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,822
you have an appointment
with the mayor today.

593
00:35:58,394 --> 00:36:00,261
It won't take long.

594
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,123
I'll finish up quickly and head there.

595
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,720
Okay.

596
00:36:05,781 --> 00:36:07,493
Fried Snacks Who ordered this?

597
00:36:07,517 --> 00:36:09,110
Me, me, me.

598
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,915
The twisted donuts are on the house.

599
00:36:15,991 --> 00:36:17,409
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

600
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:19,331
- Yes.
- Thanks.

601
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:20,565
Wow, Goh Jeong-woo.

602
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:21,925
Hey, do it for me too.

603
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,120
- I'll do it for you.
- Looks so good.

604
00:36:33,703 --> 00:36:35,140
Eat up.

605
00:36:36,558 --> 00:36:37,966
Bo-yeong...

606
00:36:39,361 --> 00:36:40,935
Bo-yeong!

607
00:36:40,959 --> 00:36:42,273
Bo-yeong.

608
00:36:42,297 --> 00:36:43,730
Bo-yeong, Shim Bo-yeong.

609
00:36:43,754 --> 00:36:45,122
Bo-yeong.

610
00:36:45,334 --> 00:36:47,987
I'm sorry. Bo-yeong...

611
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:49,184
Bo-yeong, I'm so sorry.

612
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,969
Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong.

613
00:36:51,993 --> 00:36:53,803
- Bo-yeong, I'm sorry.
- What's wrong with this guy?

614
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,882
- Bo-yeong, I'm sorry.
- What's going on here?

615
00:36:55,906 --> 00:36:56,717
Let's leave.

616
00:36:56,741 --> 00:36:58,603
- We're leaving.
- I'm sorry, Bo-yeong.

617
00:36:58,627 --> 00:36:59,570
Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong...

618
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:02,574
Why are you causing trouble
at my restaurant?

619
00:37:18,187 --> 00:37:21,643
What a psycho.
Who on earth is Bo-yeong?

620
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,936
Geon-oh.

621
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,096
I'll take you home. Let's go.

622
00:37:42,739 --> 00:37:44,589
Don't you hate me?

623
00:37:45,303 --> 00:37:47,531
I have to confess everything.

624
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:51,130
But I'm not doing anything
but running away...

625
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:55,008
Just hit me!

626
00:37:55,636 --> 00:37:57,369
Stop.

627
00:37:58,119 --> 00:37:59,669
Geon-oh.

628
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,277
Just say what you want to say.

629
00:38:03,366 --> 00:38:06,285
There are things you've been hiding
all this time.

630
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:09,196
Don't think about anyone else.
Just do it for yourself.

631
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,596
Jeong-woo...

632
00:38:26,052 --> 00:38:27,329
Please...

633
00:38:28,929 --> 00:38:31,351
Come to the police station with me.

634
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,371
My client deeply regrets
the irresponsible actions...

635
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:40,278
...of his youth.

636
00:38:40,302 --> 00:38:43,356
He was close with the deceased
since long ago...

637
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:47,349
My client deeply regrets
the irresponsible actions...

638
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:50,040
...of his youth, though belatedly.

639
00:38:50,354 --> 00:38:53,217
He was close with the deceased
since long ago...

640
00:38:59,225 --> 00:39:00,674
Jeong-woo.

641
00:39:02,414 --> 00:39:04,301
After I confess everything...

642
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:08,876
I'll finally be able
to sleep peacefully, right?

643
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:17,300
I miss Bo-yeong.

644
00:39:19,666 --> 00:39:20,980
Me too.

645
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:30,883
Byeong-mu will be charged
without indictment, right?

646
00:39:30,974 --> 00:39:33,075
We don't even have much evidence.

647
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:36,916
Do you really think that?

648
00:39:36,982 --> 00:39:38,443
Are you taking Byeong-mu's side?

649
00:39:38,467 --> 00:39:40,752
What do you mean?

650
00:39:40,776 --> 00:39:42,481
What do you take us for?

651
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,825
Look.
The error with the timeline of...

652
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,654
...when the body was disposed of
and when the murder occurred.

653
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:50,083
And Goh Jeong-woo
wasn't with Shim Bo-yeong.

654
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,842
Byeong-mu and Shin Min-su were.

655
00:39:52,414 --> 00:39:54,430
On top of that, it took
less than 3 months...

656
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:55,920
...from the arrest to the end of the trial.

657
00:39:55,944 --> 00:39:57,204
Nothing adds up.

658
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,255
Am I the only one who thinks that?

659
00:39:59,612 --> 00:40:01,092
What doesn't add up?

660
00:40:01,116 --> 00:40:02,432
Huh?

661
00:40:02,885 --> 00:40:07,206
Geon-oh will arrive soon
for his witness interview.

662
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,429
Hear him out and wrap this up, okay?

663
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:11,430
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

664
00:40:13,464 --> 00:40:14,851
He's here.

665
00:40:15,303 --> 00:40:16,477
Geon-oh!

666
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:17,999
Didn't you run into your father?

667
00:40:18,023 --> 00:40:19,949
He went to pick you up.

668
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:24,669
Why are you here?

669
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:27,807
I came to turn myself in.

670
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:30,796
Geon-oh!

671
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,550
I'll tell you everything.

672
00:40:44,196 --> 00:40:47,976
You're here to turn yourself in
and not here for a witness interview?

673
00:40:50,945 --> 00:40:54,488
You do understand
what you're saying, right?

674
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:56,217
10 years ago,

675
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,239
I was in the warehouse too.

676
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:00,563
Darn.

677
00:41:03,443 --> 00:41:04,525
Chief!

678
00:41:04,549 --> 00:41:06,320
Geon-oh says he's here
to turn himself in...

679
00:41:06,344 --> 00:41:08,164
...instead of for a witness interview!

680
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:10,832
Yes.

681
00:41:22,535 --> 00:41:23,568
- Chief?
- Hi.

682
00:41:23,592 --> 00:41:25,809
I just got here.
Were you going somewhere?

683
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,024
Oh, Congresswoman...

684
00:41:27,048 --> 00:41:28,855
There's an urgent case I need to
attend to back at the station...

685
00:41:28,879 --> 00:41:30,296
Sit down.

686
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:35,930
It's been 11 years since I've been here.

687
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:38,122
This place isn't really to my taste.

688
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,076
Back then, this was...

689
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,980
...Chief Lee Jae-sik's
favorite restaurant, right?

690
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,051
Yes, that's correct.

691
00:41:44,075 --> 00:41:46,390
He went to the Northern Police Agency.

692
00:41:46,414 --> 00:41:50,089
But for some reason he seems unable
to be promoted past superintendent.

693
00:41:51,997 --> 00:41:54,839
I wonder if it's because of taste...

694
00:41:55,816 --> 00:41:59,369
Or because he doesn't recognize
what's most important.

695
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:01,882
I see.

696
00:42:02,143 --> 00:42:06,510
There's too much talk about
Mucheon these days, Police Chief.

697
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,760
Yes, I understand your concern...

698
00:42:09,784 --> 00:42:12,491
...with the governor elections coming up.

699
00:42:12,624 --> 00:42:14,306
It's only because we found
the victim's body...

700
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,881
...after 11 years of searching.

701
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:17,461
That's what the noise is about.

702
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:19,530
It's not always a bad thing...

703
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:21,738
...that there's a lot of talk.

704
00:42:21,977 --> 00:42:23,628
So please don't worry.

705
00:42:24,821 --> 00:42:27,211
You never disappoint me.

706
00:42:27,729 --> 00:42:29,386
Shall we eat now?

707
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,724
Oh, no.

708
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,909
I need to conclude this case
as soon as possible.

709
00:42:35,448 --> 00:42:37,318
I'll do my best to quietly
close this case...

710
00:42:37,342 --> 00:42:40,281
...so that you don't have to
concern yourself about it.

711
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:53,719
<i>Chu-ho,</i>

712
00:42:53,743 --> 00:42:54,814
<i>where are you right now?</i>

713
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:55,629
Where else?

714
00:42:55,653 --> 00:42:57,328
At the restaurant in front of
the police station.

715
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:58,488
Is it Gu-tak?

716
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:01,823
Ask him when our boys are
being released.

717
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:03,601
Okay then, listen carefully.

718
00:43:03,987 --> 00:43:06,240
Run to the police station right now and...

719
00:43:06,264 --> 00:43:09,126
...demand to see Team Head Noh.

720
00:43:09,342 --> 00:43:11,214
Wait, what? What did you say?

721
00:43:11,238 --> 00:43:14,352
Just find Team Head Noh, no matter what...

722
00:43:14,723 --> 00:43:16,263
...and buy time until I get there.

723
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:17,660
<i>Chu-ho,</i>

724
00:43:17,684 --> 00:43:20,674
if you mess this up,
Byeong-mu and Min-su are in for a hard time.

725
00:43:24,148 --> 00:43:25,660
What's he saying?

726
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:33,000
Yes, Section Chief Kim. It's me.

727
00:43:33,287 --> 00:43:34,587
Yes.

728
00:43:35,229 --> 00:43:37,589
So when Shim Bo-yeong was murdered,

729
00:43:37,894 --> 00:43:39,874
who was there?

730
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:43,232
Bo-yeong.

731
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:45,768
- Bo-yeong.
- Hey! Hey, you punk!

732
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,880
What the heck are you doing?

733
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,646
What's your problem?

734
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,086
Hurry up and get out there
and sort this out.

735
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:54,209
What do you mean?

736
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:57,706
They're going crazy out there
looking for you.

737
00:43:57,930 --> 00:43:59,998
- You punk.
- Who is?

738
00:44:00,022 --> 00:44:00,860
Just go out there and look.

739
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,783
Do I have to sit here
and explain everything?

740
00:44:02,807 --> 00:44:03,851
Get out there right now!

741
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,843
No, wait...

742
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:06,143
What on earth are you doing?

743
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,789
- I'm questioning...
- Get out here, you punk!

744
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,867
What on earth are you doing? Geez.

745
00:44:12,138 --> 00:44:14,556
Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong...

746
00:44:14,592 --> 00:44:17,178
Where's Team Head Noh? Huh?
Bring him out!

747
00:44:17,202 --> 00:44:20,677
Team Head Noh Sang-cheol!
Team Head Noh!

748
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,416
What did you take to be
so full of energy?

749
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,145
You can't be doing this here.

750
00:44:27,169 --> 00:44:28,908
You met our lawyers ages ago.

751
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:30,962
How much longer will you keep
our boys locked up?

752
00:44:30,986 --> 00:44:32,719
When will they be released?

753
00:44:32,743 --> 00:44:35,313
They'll go home as soon
as the investigation is over.

754
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:36,618
So please keep it down.

755
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:39,244
How can we keep it down
when it involves our sons?

756
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:40,611
Why you...

757
00:44:40,896 --> 00:44:42,240
Isn't that Jeong-woo over there?

758
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:43,636
Hey, guys.

759
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:49,114
Look at this shameless punk.

760
00:44:49,138 --> 00:44:50,009
Why are you here?

761
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:52,931
It's Min-su and Byeong-mu
who are shameless!

762
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:57,418
After what they did to Bo-yeong,
they achieved all of their dreams.

763
00:44:57,523 --> 00:45:00,018
How did they live the past 10 years
like nothing happened?

764
00:45:00,059 --> 00:45:01,573
Then what about me?

765
00:45:02,385 --> 00:45:03,245
What about my life?

766
00:45:03,269 --> 00:45:05,677
How dare you glare at your elders,
you insolent punk...

767
00:45:05,701 --> 00:45:07,787
Hey, stop that!

768
00:45:08,193 --> 00:45:09,736
Please, just stop!

769
00:45:09,784 --> 00:45:10,838
Just go back home.

770
00:45:10,862 --> 00:45:14,320
You know that Byeong-mu
would never do such a thing.

771
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:16,492
It was just a mistake.

772
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:19,616
Min-su doesn't belong here.

773
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,807
He only messed up a bit
because he hung out with Byeong-mu...

774
00:45:21,808 --> 00:45:23,624
...when he was a kid.

775
00:45:23,648 --> 00:45:25,589
But he's such a good boy.

776
00:45:25,613 --> 00:45:26,895
Why else...

777
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:29,376
...would he have become a nurse
to help the sick?

778
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,696
My Byeong-mu cannot stand injustice!

779
00:45:32,697 --> 00:45:34,960
That's why he became a police officer.

780
00:45:34,984 --> 00:45:36,533
Look.

781
00:45:36,732 --> 00:45:40,094
You need to recognize that the victim
was precious to her parents too.

782
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,857
Just come back tomorrow.

783
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:44,463
What are you guys waiting for?
Hurry up and escort them out.

784
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:46,432
- Yes, sir.
- You, come with me.

785
00:45:46,456 --> 00:45:47,681
You punk... Darn it.

786
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:49,734
Please return home.

787
00:45:51,704 --> 00:45:53,341
You look dazed.

788
00:45:54,369 --> 00:45:56,192
Thank you for your help.

789
00:45:56,252 --> 00:45:58,371
Cut your nonsense and go home
and get some sleep.

790
00:45:58,395 --> 00:45:59,695
Detective...

791
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:01,765
...please let me speak with Byeong-mu.

792
00:46:03,036 --> 00:46:05,330
Stop talking nonsense.

793
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:07,990
I have to see Byeong-mu
and ask him something.

794
00:46:08,014 --> 00:46:09,665
Do you really think I'd let you see him...

795
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,207
...just because you
want to ask him something?

796
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:13,966
Huh?

797
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:15,919
I know it's difficult.

798
00:46:16,874 --> 00:46:18,830
But I only need a minute.

799
00:46:19,265 --> 00:46:20,710
Please.

800
00:46:22,054 --> 00:46:24,936
What the hell do you think you're doing?

801
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,724
- What are you doing?
- Hit me, hit me right now.

802
00:46:26,748 --> 00:46:29,122
Move back, move back. Back, back.

803
00:46:29,794 --> 00:46:31,346
- Hey, what the heck?
- How dare you whisper to me?

804
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,687
- You punk!
- I said don't whisper.

805
00:46:32,688 --> 00:46:34,490
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

806
00:46:34,514 --> 00:46:36,242
- Hey.
- Wait. See that?

807
00:46:36,436 --> 00:46:37,346
Did you see that?

808
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,284
You dare hit a police officer?

809
00:46:39,308 --> 00:46:41,443
- See that?
- What?

810
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:42,772
- Hey.
- Stop whispering.

811
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:44,069
What did you say, you bastard?

812
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,079
This is an obstruction of duty
and assault!

813
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,241
Hey, let go of him.

814
00:46:47,265 --> 00:46:48,924
You think I can't go to prison twice?

815
00:46:48,948 --> 00:46:50,299
I don't care about going back.

816
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:52,152
- Come with me, you punk.
- I'm sorry.

817
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:53,756
- Are you okay, sir?
- I'm sorry.

818
00:46:58,864 --> 00:47:01,252
This punk has no respect
for a detective...

819
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,502
Why you little...

820
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,535
What the...

821
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,245
Feel like you're back home?

822
00:47:07,796 --> 00:47:09,096
Huh?

823
00:47:09,366 --> 00:47:10,523
Just two hours.

824
00:47:10,584 --> 00:47:11,649
Come here.

825
00:47:22,008 --> 00:47:23,742
Are you kidding me?

826
00:47:23,766 --> 00:47:25,137
Hey.

827
00:47:25,161 --> 00:47:26,362
Be quiet.

828
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:32,890
Damn it.

829
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,751
Sit down.

830
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:36,548
If you hit me here,

831
00:47:36,572 --> 00:47:39,169
you won't be out for days
instead of hours.

832
00:47:39,193 --> 00:47:40,951
Think of your mom.

833
00:47:43,647 --> 00:47:45,612
You pretty much know everything.

834
00:47:45,636 --> 00:47:47,326
What more do you want?

835
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:49,035
Oh.

836
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,802
Did you come here to see
how you ruined my life?

837
00:47:52,075 --> 00:47:53,950
This is all your fault.

838
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:55,896
Why'd you come in here? Dammit.

839
00:48:03,178 --> 00:48:04,549
Byeong-mu.

840
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:07,075
Don't you feel sorry to Bo-yeong?

841
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:08,863
Hey, hey!

842
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,739
You selfish bastard.

843
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:13,882
You want to keep pretending to be
the good guy even in this situation?

844
00:48:19,327 --> 00:48:21,100
Why did we end up like this?

845
00:48:21,124 --> 00:48:22,789
It's all because of you.

846
00:48:23,489 --> 00:48:26,159
Acting all good, acting all cool.

847
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:28,731
You've always been so annoying.

848
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,197
Smart, athletic...

849
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:35,647
...from a rich family with good parents.

850
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:38,957
You were just different
from the moment you were born.

851
00:48:41,571 --> 00:48:43,258
When I was making a fool of myself...

852
00:48:43,282 --> 00:48:45,396
...kicking that soccer ball
with worn-out shoes...

853
00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:49,606
You had new soccer cleats for soccer,
new basketball shoes for basketball.

854
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,021
"Hey, Byeong-mu.

855
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,180
Didn't your dad buy you new shoes
for sports day?"

856
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:58,981
The starting line was different
for you and me!

857
00:49:00,156 --> 00:49:02,177
No matter how hard I tried,

858
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:03,793
I was nothing but your lackey.

859
00:49:03,817 --> 00:49:06,083
Yeah. Your lackey.

860
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:09,560
A lackey that just followed you around
hoping to get some ice cream.

861
00:49:09,584 --> 00:49:11,548
Okay, let's just say that was the case.

862
00:49:11,643 --> 00:49:13,366
Let's say I was annoying...

863
00:49:14,426 --> 00:49:16,682
...and despicable as you say.

864
00:49:16,706 --> 00:49:18,217
However...

865
00:49:19,338 --> 00:49:21,147
...Bo-yeong wasn't like that.

866
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:26,619
Bo-yeong was just a friend.

867
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,883
Byeong-mu...

868
00:49:34,206 --> 00:49:36,162
...you liked Bo-yeong, didn't you?

869
00:49:36,952 --> 00:49:38,309
So why did you do it?

870
00:49:44,141 --> 00:49:46,256
She was in the same situation as me...

871
00:49:47,116 --> 00:49:48,968
...but she took your side.

872
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:51,508
It's all because of you.

873
00:49:52,995 --> 00:49:54,396
Hey!

874
00:50:03,057 --> 00:50:04,837
Just promise me one thing.

875
00:50:04,861 --> 00:50:06,636
Do not lay a hand on Byeong-mu.

876
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,009
The moment you lay even a finger on him...

877
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,476
...we're back to square one.

878
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:16,209
Who drove that day?

879
00:50:17,537 --> 00:50:19,422
It can't have been you or Min-su.

880
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,655
- It must've been you.
- You know it wasn't.

881
00:50:24,679 --> 00:50:26,408
You know it wasn't me.

882
00:50:28,183 --> 00:50:30,083
Does any of this change anything?

883
00:50:34,127 --> 00:50:37,576
Let me give you
one final piece of advice.

884
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:42,185
Just don't do anything, okay?

885
00:50:42,801 --> 00:50:47,422
Just don't do a freaking thing.

886
00:50:52,872 --> 00:50:54,643
Are you worried for me?

887
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,421
Don't be.

888
00:51:00,614 --> 00:51:02,550
Just worry about yourself.

889
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:22,231
Damn it.

890
00:51:24,324 --> 00:51:25,708
- <i>Team Leader Noh.</i>
- Yes?

891
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:28,748
<i>Geon-oh said he was hungry,</i>
<i>so I took him out for some food.</i>

892
00:51:28,749 --> 00:51:29,558
What?

893
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:31,360
<i>I'll bring him back soon.</i>

894
00:51:31,577 --> 00:51:33,126
Wait, sir...

895
00:51:36,781 --> 00:51:39,155
Damn it!

896
00:51:47,192 --> 00:51:48,449
Detective Choi!

897
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:49,836
Park my car.

898
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:01,174
Hyeon Geon-oh!

899
00:52:26,235 --> 00:52:27,776
What would you confess?

900
00:52:30,032 --> 00:52:31,358
Geon-oh.

901
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:33,076
Father...

902
00:52:34,759 --> 00:52:37,278
I'm going to confess everything.

903
00:52:39,016 --> 00:52:41,166
I can't live like this anymore.

904
00:52:52,101 --> 00:52:53,509
Father...

905
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:58,809
...did you see Jeong-woo's face?

906
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:03,307
We're the ones who did that to him.

907
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:05,516
Geon-oh.

908
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,526
Please!

909
00:53:11,127 --> 00:53:15,042
Can't you just let this go?

910
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:18,682
Just for Su-oh's sake?

911
00:53:20,896 --> 00:53:23,269
No matter what you say,

912
00:53:25,073 --> 00:53:27,182
I'm going to confess.

913
00:53:53,187 --> 00:53:55,122
Su-oh! Su-oh!

914
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:57,270
Su-oh, it's your brother.

915
00:53:57,294 --> 00:53:58,343
Say something.

916
00:53:58,367 --> 00:53:59,781
<i>Su-oh, Hyeon Su-o.</i>

917
00:53:59,805 --> 00:54:01,562
<i>Su-oh, are you okay?</i>

918
00:54:02,253 --> 00:54:04,513
<i>Su-oh.</i>

919
00:54:05,578 --> 00:54:06,878
Su-oh...

920
00:54:09,568 --> 00:54:10,968
Su-oh!

921
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,621
Su-oh, Hyeon Su-oh.

922
00:54:12,645 --> 00:54:13,671
Su-oh, are you okay?

923
00:54:13,695 --> 00:54:15,916
- <i>It's time for him to take his medicine and go to sleep.</i>
- Su-oh...

924
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:18,319
Su-oh... Su-oh...

925
00:54:19,615 --> 00:54:23,744
Who will take care of Su-oh from now on?

926
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,505
What about your life?

927
00:55:00,806 --> 00:55:03,540
Come inside.
It's okay, it's okay.

928
00:55:04,808 --> 00:55:06,902
I just got him some food, that's all.

929
00:55:06,926 --> 00:55:08,569
He was hungry. What else could I do?

930
00:55:09,314 --> 00:55:11,255
Geon-oh is a witness, so take it easy.

931
00:55:12,346 --> 00:55:15,601
Did I take too much of your time,
Team Head Noh?

932
00:55:15,625 --> 00:55:17,024
Not at all, sir.

933
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:29,550
I'll begin.

934
00:55:43,189 --> 00:55:46,345
Where was the last place you saw
the victim, Shim Bo-yeong?

935
00:55:48,221 --> 00:55:49,210
In the warehouse.

936
00:55:49,234 --> 00:55:52,525
What time was it when you last saw her?

937
00:55:52,549 --> 00:55:55,082
I don't remember exactly...

938
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:58,113
...but it was late at night.

939
00:55:58,137 --> 00:55:59,618
What happened...

940
00:55:59,948 --> 00:56:01,984
...in the warehouse that day?

941
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,858
We were drinking.

942
00:56:05,388 --> 00:56:07,449
Then when we ran out,

943
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:12,388
I went home to get more alcohol
then returned to the warehouse.

944
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:16,149
When I got back to the warehouse.

945
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:21,889
The warehouse...

946
00:56:22,557 --> 00:56:24,284
I returned to the warehouse, but...

947
00:56:26,101 --> 00:56:28,061
Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong.

948
00:56:28,978 --> 00:56:30,678
I returned to the warehouse, but...

949
00:56:31,023 --> 00:56:32,497
Hyeon Geon-oh.

950
00:56:32,997 --> 00:56:34,105
Hey, Hyeon Geon-oh.

951
00:56:34,129 --> 00:56:35,588
The warehouse...

952
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,845
- The warehouse...
- What about us?

953
00:56:39,207 --> 00:56:41,605
<i>Who will take care of Su-oh from now on?</i>

954
00:56:41,629 --> 00:56:42,948
<i>Su-oh, are you okay?</i>

955
00:56:42,972 --> 00:56:47,556
Even if everyone else falls apart,
so long as you feel at peace, right?

956
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:49,744
When I...

957
00:56:52,216 --> 00:56:55,389
When I returned to the warehouse...

958
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:13,329
...no one was there.

959
00:57:15,704 --> 00:57:19,172
There was a pool of blood on the ground.

960
00:57:19,196 --> 00:57:23,936
And I only saw Bo-yeong's bag
and underwear.

961
00:57:24,402 --> 00:57:29,282
I was shocked, so I picked them up
and went home.

962
00:57:36,283 --> 00:57:37,702
Hyeon Geon-oh.

963
00:57:37,744 --> 00:57:39,043
Get a grip.

964
00:57:39,067 --> 00:57:41,235
You came here to turn yourself in.

965
00:57:41,337 --> 00:57:44,072
I just told you everything truthfully.

966
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:46,503
Chief,

967
00:57:46,527 --> 00:57:49,522
Geon-oh doesn't know
much about witness interviews,

968
00:57:49,596 --> 00:57:52,166
so that's why he said
he wanted to confess.

969
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:05,305
You really are friends with
Yang Byeong-mu and Shin Min-su.

970
00:58:05,329 --> 00:58:07,855
You're a scumbag just like them!

971
00:58:08,146 --> 00:58:10,575
What happened at the warehouse
that night?

972
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:12,273
Who killed Shim Bo-yeong?

973
00:58:12,297 --> 00:58:14,535
Hey!
Who killed Shim Bo-yeong?

974
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:18,554
Hyeon Geon-oh...

975
00:58:21,392 --> 00:58:22,907
...look me in the eyes.

976
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,086
Hey.

977
00:58:27,451 --> 00:58:28,877
Let's stop this.

978
00:58:28,901 --> 00:58:30,219
Yes, sir. Yes, yes.

979
00:58:30,243 --> 00:58:33,082
Who are you trying to protect?

980
00:58:36,626 --> 00:58:38,223
I think this is over.

981
00:58:38,383 --> 00:58:39,777
Good job.

982
00:58:39,801 --> 00:58:42,842
Yes, good job. Let's go.

983
00:58:53,165 --> 00:58:54,670
Good work.

984
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:06,337
Good work?

985
00:59:10,395 --> 00:59:13,466
<i>The number you are calling is busy,</i>
<i>please call again later...</i>

986
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:16,580
What is going on?

987
00:59:17,381 --> 00:59:18,406
What is it?

988
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,756
The restaurant's been closed all day.

989
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:22,649
And they won't pick up.

990
00:59:24,517 --> 00:59:26,005
Is that them?

991
00:59:36,381 --> 00:59:37,672
She's from the soju poster.

992
00:59:37,696 --> 00:59:39,002
Oh, my goodness.

993
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:40,976
I heard you were
classmates with Bo-yeong.

994
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,630
It must be true.

995
00:59:42,654 --> 00:59:45,415
I know you're famous,

996
00:59:45,439 --> 00:59:47,664
but what brings you here
so late at night?

997
00:59:47,688 --> 00:59:50,524
I should've visited you sooner.
I'm really sorry.

998
00:59:50,998 --> 00:59:54,062
There's something
I must talk to you about.

999
00:59:54,195 --> 00:59:56,462
There's something you don't know.

1000
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:02,205
It concerns Byeong-mu and Min-su.

1001
01:00:04,957 --> 01:00:06,441
Goh Jeong-woo, come out.

1002
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,214
Come out quickly.

1003
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,680
Byeong-mu...

1004
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:11,042
...just you wait.

1005
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:17,035
I'll get to the bottom of this.

1006
01:00:23,062 --> 01:00:25,336
Hyeon Geon-oh refused to testify.

1007
01:00:30,113 --> 01:00:31,462
Geon-oh...

1008
01:00:32,889 --> 01:00:35,603
...why are you here?

1009
01:00:35,627 --> 01:00:37,223
I told them everything.

1010
01:00:38,494 --> 01:00:40,345
You didn't turn yourself in?

1011
01:00:41,176 --> 01:00:43,128
- Hyeon Geon-oh.
- Let go!

1012
01:00:45,084 --> 01:00:46,328
Hyeon Geon-oh!

1013
01:00:50,961 --> 01:00:52,319
- Oh, no.
- I think he got hit by the car.

1014
01:00:52,343 --> 01:00:53,866
- Oh, no.
- Jeong-woo...

1015
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:55,397
- Someone call an ambulance.
- Hurry.

1016
01:00:55,421 --> 01:00:57,004
Call an ambulance.

1017
01:01:13,508 --> 01:01:14,949
Where are you?

1018
01:01:14,973 --> 01:01:16,326
<i>Father,</i>

1019
01:01:16,496 --> 01:01:18,490
<i>I'm in Jeong-woo's warehouse.</i>

1020
01:01:18,514 --> 01:01:19,860
Geon-oh.

1021
01:01:20,258 --> 01:01:21,606
Geon-oh.

1022
01:01:22,381 --> 01:01:23,797
Damn it.

1023
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,486
Geon-oh...

1024
01:02:42,094 --> 01:02:46,674
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

1025
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:48,864
<i>Geon-oh is dead.</i>

1026
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:50,015
<i>Geon-oh is dead?</i>

1027
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:51,950
<i>Why did Geon-oh die?</i>

1028
01:02:51,974 --> 01:02:55,156
<i>Bo-yeong is already dead,</i>
<i>the kids might get off without being charged.</i>

1029
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,646
<i>How does that make sense?</i>
<i>He's definitely hiding something.</i>

1030
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:59,974
<i>Tell me what I don't know.</i>

1031
01:02:59,998 --> 01:03:02,334
<i>I thought you already knew everything.</i>

1032
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:05,885
<i>You have to be on full alert</i>
<i>from here on.</i>

1033
01:03:05,909 --> 01:03:09,979
<i>If their child killed someone,</i>
<i>what would a parent do?</i>

1034
01:03:10,373 --> 01:03:13,237
<i>We need direct evidence.</i>

1035
01:03:13,655 --> 01:03:15,490
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

1036
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,828
<i>Don't let your guard down.</i>
