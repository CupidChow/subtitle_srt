Hey!

00:00:39,026 --> 00:00:40,427
Hmm?

7
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,843
Where's Mucheon Garden?

8
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:52,176
Have some spicy rice cakes.

<i>So come home.</i>
<i>Let's work this out together.</i>

14
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,658
I guess you're scared because
I got mad.

Hey!

18
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:44,628
Wake up!

19
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,819
Wake up!

20
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,889
Wake up!

21
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:14,776
Wake up!

22
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,177
Hey!

23
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,948
Is anyone there?

24
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:19,372
Wake up!

25
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,049
Hey...

26
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:28,073
Tell me where Da-eun is!

27
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:30,301
You need to tell me before you die!

28
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:32,898
Why is everyone...

29
00:03:33,452 --> 00:03:36,018
...dying without saying anything?

30
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:40,260
Wake up!

31
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,605
- Put your hands up!
- Where is Da-eun?

32
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:42,669
Get away from him!

33
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,137
Lower your guns! Lower them.

34
00:03:45,287 --> 00:03:47,105
Who are you?

35
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:48,842
I'm from Mucheon Police Station.
I'm Team Head Noh Sang-cheol.

36
00:03:48,842 --> 00:03:50,198
Lower your guns.

37
00:04:20,534 --> 00:04:21,968
Hey, drink some water.

38
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,450
Drink.

39
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:33,218
You contacted Park Hyeong-sik directly?

40
00:04:35,932 --> 00:04:37,332
Jeong-woo,

41
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,199
I understand how you feel.
I totally get it 100%.

42
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:44,538
But when Park Hyeong-sik
arranged to meet you,

43
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:47,036
he had sent a suicide note via text...

44
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,738
...to Ye Yeong-sil and journalists.

45
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:50,859
What?

46
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,247
But doesn't this seem too scripted?

47
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:55,258
The dead can't speak.

48
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,093
But they do have their last words.

49
00:04:58,859 --> 00:04:59,938
Autopsy.

50
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,667
Great work.

51
00:05:23,768 --> 00:05:26,278
How can I thank you?

52
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:27,679
Governor,

53
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,054
I don't know what title is the best...

54
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,426
...or how to advance my career.

55
00:05:33,329 --> 00:05:35,178
If I can just be given the opportunity...

56
00:05:35,415 --> 00:05:37,698
...to work as a police public servant
until my retirement,

57
00:05:38,045 --> 00:05:39,498
I'll do my absolute best.

58
00:05:39,874 --> 00:05:41,787
There are no positions in Suwon.

59
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,698
But I can promise you the position of
chief of investigations in Uijeongbu.

60
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,565
That's after you become
the superintendent general first.

61
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:52,452
Looks like I'll have to work
a bit harder.

62
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:56,629
Thank you.

63
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:04,772
Oh, gosh.

64
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:07,291
Gosh.

65
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:11,298
Huh?

66
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:13,429
Oh, my goodness!

67
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,803
<i>We've just received news</i>
<i>that the director...</i>

68
00:06:15,804 --> 00:06:17,759
<i>...of Mucheon Sarang Hospital,</i>
<i>Park Hyeong-sik, has passed away.</i>

69
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,526
Just leave that to the police
and get treated.

70
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:21,630
Geez.

71
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:24,878
His hand is a mess right now.
Can he get some treatment?

72
00:06:24,902 --> 00:06:28,598
It's too late right now.
You need to head to the emergency ward.

73
00:06:28,926 --> 00:06:31,730
Oh, aren't you Ms. Jeong Geum-hee's son?

74
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,417
Yes.

75
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:34,554
You should head to her room right now.

76
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:36,082
She's...

77
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:39,809
<i>Amidst the shock and sadness,</i>

78
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,040
<i>we've confirmed</i>
<i>she temporarily suspended...</i>

79
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,856
<i>...her campaign activities.</i>

80
00:06:48,163 --> 00:06:49,669
What happened?

81
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:51,492
Here spasms are too irregular...

82
00:06:51,492 --> 00:06:54,218
...to say that they're
temporary for the moment.

83
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:57,294
We'll need to watch over her for now.

84
00:06:57,294 --> 00:06:59,884
But I think you can look forward
to her waking up.

85
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,481
Thank you.

86
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,675
Okay, take care.

87
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:40,220
Though you made the wrong choice,

88
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:45,005
I don't want to resent
the difficult choice you made, honey,

89
00:07:46,562 --> 00:07:49,590
after a long period
of suffering and reflection.

90
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:55,477
Is it okay to add "honey" in there?

91
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,019
"My husband" sounds too distant.

92
00:07:58,487 --> 00:08:00,497
And saying just "you"
doesn't sound emotional enough.

93
00:08:00,498 --> 00:08:02,742
I think it's okay to add more
of your personal feelings...

94
00:08:02,742 --> 00:08:04,283
...in the speech today.

95
00:08:04,307 --> 00:08:06,399
Okay then. That part in the middle.

96
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:09,783
"I'm to blame for not being
able to convince you otherwise."

97
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:12,663
Let's just edit that part.

98
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:14,191
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:18,258
I think it's good that I listened to you
and didn't go out to say it myself.

100
00:08:20,572 --> 00:08:23,386
You should hurry.
Lots of journalists are waiting outside.

101
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:42,555
What is it?

102
00:08:43,587 --> 00:08:45,022
What?

103
00:08:52,752 --> 00:08:54,419
Okay. Where is it?

104
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,592
What do you mean by that?

105
00:09:00,616 --> 00:09:02,316
You said you were at the scene.

106
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,937
<i>Yes. But there's something</i>
<i>that's really suspicious.</i>

107
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:06,336
Return to the station immediately.

108
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,760
Yes, Chief.

109
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,500
It's the police chief!

110
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,996
When did you start investigating
Director Park Hyeong-sik?

111
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,410
You said there was
no evidence at the time.

112
00:09:31,411 --> 00:09:32,517
What was the key piece of evidence?

113
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,375
Reports say that Choi Na-gyeom
witnessed the murder.

114
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,242
Will you be questioning her again?

115
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:39,839
Please step down first.

116
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,022
I'll take questions one at a time.

117
00:09:48,022 --> 00:09:51,232
Are you admitting to your negligence
as the investigator in charge...

118
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,876
...at the time of the incident?

119
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,303
Well, I am closely monitoring
the situation...

120
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,105
...and I'm doing my best.

121
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:57,652
Next?

122
00:09:57,653 --> 00:10:00,433
You were very close, not only
with the victims but the culprits...

123
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,397
- ...of this incident...
- Very close?

124
00:10:06,654 --> 00:10:08,054
Yes, that's correct.

125
00:10:08,824 --> 00:10:11,838
I've lived my entire life here,
so they were very close to me.

126
00:10:12,006 --> 00:10:16,368
So are you asking if I went
easy on them because,

127
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:19,012
I was acquainted with them
and turned a blind eye?

128
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:20,756
If that is indeed what you are asking,

129
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:23,657
let me ask you this.

130
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:27,451
If that was how I carried out
the investigation,

131
00:10:27,475 --> 00:10:30,248
how could my best friend's son,

132
00:10:30,272 --> 00:10:32,934
who was like a son to me,

133
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:37,191
have suffered such injustice?

134
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,862
Don't you agree?

135
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:44,094
Look, I'm not avoiding your questions.

136
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,572
But this investigation is ongoing,

137
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:49,262
so for at least a few days...

138
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:52,663
No, just a few hours...

139
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:54,014
Let's not focus on my mistakes...

140
00:10:54,015 --> 00:10:57,361
...but allow the deceased
to depart in peace.

141
00:10:58,538 --> 00:10:59,241
That is all.

142
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,846
Is this connected to
Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil?

143
00:11:00,846 --> 00:11:02,246
Let's end it here.

144
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,266
What did Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil say?

145
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:05,540
Thank you.

146
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:06,633
Chief!

147
00:11:06,657 --> 00:11:08,057
Geez.

148
00:11:08,904 --> 00:11:12,917
- What about the investigation?
- Chief Hyun, had nothing to say.

149
00:11:14,717 --> 00:11:18,557
- Then what about this?
- Oh my.

150
00:11:29,337 --> 00:11:31,094
Why was Goh Jeong-woo there?

151
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,164
Huh?

152
00:11:33,266 --> 00:11:36,498
How did he get there before you?
Please explain.

153
00:11:36,522 --> 00:11:40,581
Jeong-woo arranged to meet
Director Park at the rest area.

154
00:11:42,622 --> 00:11:44,538
And when Jeong-woo arrived,

155
00:11:44,577 --> 00:11:47,607
Director Park was already dead.

156
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:06,361
What do you think?

157
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:18,419
So Park Hyeong-sik
didn't commit suicide?

158
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:21,295
There might be something else?

159
00:12:21,296 --> 00:12:23,778
So we must conduct an autopsy.

160
00:12:24,273 --> 00:12:26,099
- That way...
- We need the autopsy.

161
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,616
Yeah, an autopsy might
reveal something more.

162
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,565
I'll get going then.

163
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,023
It's Chief Hyeon Gu-tak.

164
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,007
Should I pick up?

165
00:13:08,405 --> 00:13:11,038
I'm surprised
you're calling me directly.

166
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:13,480
I don't know what words
of comfort to offer.

167
00:13:13,504 --> 00:13:14,904
Thank you.

168
00:13:17,138 --> 00:13:19,605
We were on the same boat
until you abandoned it.

169
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,486
But I need to ask you for one favor.

170
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:23,938
Congresswoman, I didn't abandon ship.

171
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,020
It's just that the boat I trusted
changed course without warning.

172
00:13:28,134 --> 00:13:29,534
Chief,

173
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:34,107
you're being a bit too blunt
to a recent widow.

174
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:37,308
My apologies.

175
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:38,735
Enough of that.

176
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,698
They say he had severe depression...

177
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:45,453
...and was using some medication.

178
00:13:46,001 --> 00:13:48,121
<i>He died alone and in a pitiful way.</i>

179
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:51,711
Please allow me
to remember him in peace.

180
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,851
I understand what you mean.

181
00:13:54,819 --> 00:13:57,660
Once again, my deepest condolences.

182
00:13:57,975 --> 00:13:59,380
Yes.

183
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:35,590
PLAQUE OF APPRECIATION
MUCHEON POLICE CHIEF HYEON GU-TAK

184
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:37,065
PRESENTED BY CONGRESSWOMAN
YE YEONG-SIL ON OCT. 2, 2017

185
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:07,200
MUCHEON SARANG HOSPITAL

186
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:19,095
Mom.

187
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,180
Mom?

188
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:31,444
Mom, can you see me?

189
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,885
It's me, Jeong-woo.

190
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,874
Are you able to breathe comfortably?

191
00:15:46,227 --> 00:15:48,112
Fortunately, there seem
to be no aftereffects...

192
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,645
...from the traumatic subdural hemorrhage.

193
00:15:49,646 --> 00:15:52,439
And it seems her cognitive abilities
have returned.

194
00:15:52,463 --> 00:15:54,018
It must've been hard for her,

195
00:15:54,068 --> 00:15:56,197
but it seems
she endured it well on her own.

196
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:59,609
However, she has suffered
significant muscle loss,

197
00:16:00,191 --> 00:16:02,953
so she'll need lots of
physical rehabilitation.

198
00:16:02,954 --> 00:16:04,178
A whole lot.

199
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:05,479
Thank you.

200
00:16:05,479 --> 00:16:06,902
All the best.

201
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:23,360
Your face is...

202
00:16:24,621 --> 00:16:26,907
...quite haggard.

203
00:16:39,446 --> 00:16:41,174
Mom.

204
00:16:57,029 --> 00:16:58,685
Did you find it?

205
00:16:59,794 --> 00:17:01,707
They're reopening my case.

206
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:05,486
I found Bo-yeong.

207
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,198
But I haven't found Da-eun yet.

208
00:17:08,858 --> 00:17:10,908
I think I'll be able to find her soon.

209
00:17:13,556 --> 00:17:15,800
Who did it?

210
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,084
You've worked so hard.

211
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,020
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

212
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:48,917
Choi Na-gyeom,

213
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,317
you will be transferred
to the detention center.

214
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:53,574
And the advertisers
will claim penalties.

215
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:56,392
- The reporters...
- Call Jeong-woo for me.

216
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:02,946
Please call Jeong-woo.

217
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,747
Please?

218
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:09,977
I said to call Jeong-woo!

219
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:13,561
Please call Jeong-woo!

220
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,654
Even now...

221
00:18:15,654 --> 00:18:17,937
Jeong-woo!

222
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:37,554
- Wrap it up.
- Yes.

223
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:44,193
This is our last move, Congresswoman.

224
00:18:44,193 --> 00:18:48,274
Candidate No. 3, to be the next
governor of Gyeonggi-do!

225
00:18:48,275 --> 00:18:49,358
Let's go.

226
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:52,129
Introducing Ye Yeong-sil!

227
00:18:52,130 --> 00:19:00,068
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

228
00:19:00,068 --> 00:19:09,722
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

229
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:17,229
CENTER OF UNITY AND COOPERATION
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

230
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,670
Su-oh.

231
00:20:00,382 --> 00:20:03,735
STAY STRONG, YE YEONG-SIL

232
00:20:07,731 --> 00:20:08,963
Last night,

233
00:20:08,964 --> 00:20:11,616
I stood alone on this stage.

234
00:20:12,155 --> 00:20:14,135
Wondering whether to withdraw
my candidacy,

235
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,858
and how to face my respected citizens
here today.

236
00:20:20,943 --> 00:20:23,148
I wanted to give up everything.

237
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:25,050
- No, you can't.
- No, you can't.

238
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:28,879
When my husband of many years
texted me his suicide note,

239
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,623
the sorrow and despair
of possibly losing him...

240
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:36,191
But before all those feelings,

241
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,537
what came first for me
was the fear and responsibility...

242
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:43,082
...that the truth of what happened
11 years ago might not be revealed...

243
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:46,338
...because of my husband's wrongful choice.

244
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,033
Some things changed.

245
00:20:55,184 --> 00:20:57,172
Jeong-woo's back.

246
00:20:59,393 --> 00:21:01,192
I'm going to tell Jeong-woo...

247
00:21:01,754 --> 00:21:05,185
...about everyone who harassed you.

248
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:11,649
I will protect you until the very end.

249
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:17,332
So don't worry about anything.

250
00:21:19,326 --> 00:21:21,089
And stay here.

251
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:28,927
I will protect you no matter what.

252
00:21:31,715 --> 00:21:33,243
Su-oh.

253
00:21:35,885 --> 00:21:37,285
Hyeon Su-oh.

254
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:47,053
Su-oh! Are you in there?

255
00:21:55,452 --> 00:21:56,852
Open this door.

256
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,991
What is this place?

257
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,589
As a member of the National Assembly
for this region,

258
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,721
who should have monitored the
incompetent and inhumane investigation...

259
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,975
...carried out by the police 11 years ago,

260
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:28,608
I bear infinite responsibility.

261
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,704
If I had criticized...

262
00:22:30,765 --> 00:22:32,769
...the police's wrongdoing.

263
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,771
And strived for justice,

264
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:38,326
my husband would have seen me...

265
00:22:38,327 --> 00:22:42,238
...and built up the courage
to confess his crimes.

266
00:22:43,542 --> 00:22:45,857
So do not forgive me.

267
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:53,748
What's this place?

268
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:03,367
Please don't hurt Da-eun.

269
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:23,954
Da-eun?

270
00:23:35,084 --> 00:23:36,891
Stop!

271
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,317
Let go!

272
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,671
Why is Da-eun here?

273
00:23:49,672 --> 00:23:50,754
Are you crazy?

274
00:23:50,755 --> 00:23:53,377
Why are you doing this?
What's going on?

275
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:56,695
Su-oh.

276
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,234
Tell me everything.

277
00:23:59,258 --> 00:24:02,433
What are you saying?
What are you talking about?

278
00:24:02,658 --> 00:24:04,159
Let go of me!

279
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:06,843
What's wrong with you?

280
00:24:06,843 --> 00:24:08,670
Stop hurting her!

281
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,298
Stop hurting...

282
00:24:10,322 --> 00:24:11,554
Su-oh!

283
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:12,541
Su-oh!

284
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:13,940
Su-oh!

285
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,601
DIAL

286
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,572
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

287
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,334
<i>Why is Park Da-eun's body here?</i>

288
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,436
<i>I worked so hard to cover it up.</i>

289
00:25:12,998 --> 00:25:14,582
<i>So why?</i>

290
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:19,339
With the promise I kept...

291
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,358
Seeing the citizens of Mucheon
who are living...

292
00:25:22,358 --> 00:25:24,841
...a safe and prosperous life...

293
00:25:24,842 --> 00:25:27,703
...from the western shore
all the way to the northern edge,

294
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:30,614
I promised that you would
live good lives.

295
00:25:30,614 --> 00:25:33,485
So regardless of whether
I would be stoned or cursed,

296
00:25:33,486 --> 00:25:35,881
I knew I had to keep that promise...

297
00:25:35,881 --> 00:25:38,547
...for your futures...

298
00:25:38,923 --> 00:25:44,260
- Don't cry! Don't cry!
- Don't cry! Don't cry!

299
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:47,391
Don't cry! Don't cry!

300
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,965
What do you want to say?

301
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:06,382
I lost my father too.

302
00:26:07,582 --> 00:26:10,594
Maybe that's why I don't care anymore.

303
00:26:11,566 --> 00:26:14,296
Or perhaps I finally do care.

304
00:26:15,077 --> 00:26:16,931
I don't know exactly what the reason is.

305
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:20,475
But there's one thing you don't know.

306
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,723
I called you to tell you that.

307
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:29,642
The chief.

308
00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:31,767
Geon-oh's father...

309
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:36,213
...told the three of us to go
to Geon-oh's house.

310
00:26:39,315 --> 00:26:42,377
It wasn't just my father and
Byeong-mu's father who were there.

311
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,160
Hyeon Gu-tak...

312
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:45,482
...is the one that ordered everything.

313
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:48,102
We just did as we were told.

314
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:51,634
He told us what to do
during the police questioning.

315
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:54,412
He's who sent us off to military service
as soon as you were imprisoned.

316
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:57,150
And when your father's assets
were being sorted,

317
00:26:57,483 --> 00:26:59,976
he's the one that schemed
and divided everything.

318
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:03,588
It was all...

319
00:27:05,131 --> 00:27:07,299
Hyeon Gu-tak's doing.

320
00:27:07,704 --> 00:27:12,008
He was the one who told me
to pin everything on Byeong-mu.

321
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,155
I will sacrifice myself...

322
00:27:30,156 --> 00:27:32,427
...for the good of our community.

323
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,644
For the prosperity of the community,

324
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:39,009
I will become a governor
who sacrifices herself!

325
00:27:39,435 --> 00:27:45,257
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

326
00:27:45,257 --> 00:27:51,071
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

327
00:27:51,071 --> 00:27:56,907
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

328
00:27:56,907 --> 00:28:03,048
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

329
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:09,648
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

330
00:28:09,648 --> 00:28:14,529
Ye Yeong-sil!
Ye Yeong-sil! Ye Yeong-sil!

331
00:28:14,553 --> 00:28:16,220
MUCHEON GARDEN

332
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:20,516
<i>It wasn't just my father and</i>
<i>Byeong-mu's father who were there.</i>

333
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,315
<i>Hyeon Gu-tak...</i>

334
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:23,729
<i>...is the one that ordered everything.</i>

335
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,214
<i>We just did as we were told.</i>

336
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:30,916
I'll get off here.

337
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:37,650
- Jeong-woo, Jeong-woo.
- Su-oh.

338
00:28:38,453 --> 00:28:39,853
Jeong-woo.

339
00:28:40,117 --> 00:28:41,533
Jeong-woo.

340
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:43,567
Jeong-woo, please help me.

341
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,743
What's wrong? What happened?

342
00:28:46,744 --> 00:28:48,223
Da-eun.

343
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,891
- Da-eun...
- Su-oh.

344
00:28:50,892 --> 00:28:53,151
- Why are you talking about Da-eun?
- Please save Da-eun, Jeong-woo...

345
00:28:53,152 --> 00:28:55,815
- Come to your senses...
- Please rescue Da-eun, Jeong-woo.

346
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:03,285
Where is Da-eun?

347
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:04,997
My house...

348
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:07,785
Your father's at home, right?

349
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:09,242
Yeah.

350
00:29:27,272 --> 00:29:28,737
Uncle!

351
00:29:30,075 --> 00:29:31,623
What are you doing?

352
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,199
Jeong-woo.

353
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:40,270
Is that Da-eun?

354
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,567
Jeong-woo.

355
00:30:08,357 --> 00:30:11,080
You know that Su-oh is sick.

356
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:13,175
You feel sorry for him too.

357
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:18,633
After I lost Geon-oh...

358
00:30:19,503 --> 00:30:22,357
I can't let Su-oh be taken too.

359
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:24,432
So listen to me carefully.

360
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,977
If you and I just pretend
we didn't see anything,

361
00:30:27,978 --> 00:30:29,914
everything will be alright.

362
00:30:30,383 --> 00:30:31,952
Let's do that.

363
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:36,166
You and I will cremate Da-eun.

364
00:30:37,196 --> 00:30:39,210
You knew all along.

365
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:44,160
That I didn't kill Bo-yeong or Da-eun.

366
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:48,316
You knew everything!

367
00:30:50,568 --> 00:30:52,483
But how could you do this to me?

368
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,861
How could you do this to my family?

369
00:30:56,862 --> 00:30:59,563
I don't know what you've heard,
but it's not like that.

370
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:01,324
Min-su told me everything.

371
00:31:02,188 --> 00:31:04,494
He said you were the mastermind
behind everything.

372
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:19,031
At first, I didn't intend for things
to turn out like this.

373
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:22,921
And it wasn't all me either.

374
00:31:23,677 --> 00:31:27,290
Geon-oh was there on the day
of that incident.

375
00:31:27,673 --> 00:31:29,743
And I thought Geon-oh did it.

376
00:31:31,438 --> 00:31:32,871
That's the truth.

377
00:31:35,063 --> 00:31:36,667
I'm his father.

378
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,770
So I had to protect him.

379
00:31:40,578 --> 00:31:43,839
I can do anything to protect Geon-oh.

380
00:31:46,408 --> 00:31:48,940
But then Da-eun suddenly disappeared.

381
00:31:49,252 --> 00:31:53,379
And if you were the culprit...
If you had killed Da-eun...

382
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,913
Everything would be resolved.

383
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:14,462
That's all there is to it.

384
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:18,691
If I have anything
to apologize to you for...

385
00:32:19,229 --> 00:32:21,349
...It's that for the past 10 years,

386
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:26,642
I really hoped you were
the one who killed Da-eun.

387
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:29,081
For that, I am sorry.

388
00:32:33,149 --> 00:32:35,433
Aren't you sorry to my family?

389
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,872
My dad believed you...

390
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:42,519
...and was convinced that his son
was a murderer.

391
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:44,506
My mom had her world taken from her...

392
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:47,765
...and had to endure torment
for 10 long years!

393
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,814
Didn't you ever feel sorry for them?

394
00:32:50,108 --> 00:32:52,588
Tell me! Didn't you?

395
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:55,827
As if you'd be sorry...

396
00:33:01,143 --> 00:33:03,395
Let's just end this already.

397
00:33:12,744 --> 00:33:14,429
Uncle...

398
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:47,450
Don't come in here!

399
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:51,426
- Da-eun! Da-eun! Da-eun!
- No!

400
00:33:51,772 --> 00:33:53,690
- Da-eun! Da-eun!
- Su-oh!

401
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:57,512
- Da-eun! Da-eun!
- Su-oh!

402
00:34:03,513 --> 00:34:04,979
Da-eun...

403
00:34:09,137 --> 00:34:10,537
Da-eun...

404
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:22,426
Damn it!
Why does it have to be like this.

405
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,202
<i>Gu-tak,</i>

406
00:34:53,226 --> 00:34:57,238
<i>we killed Bo-yeong.</i>

407
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,129
<i>Chang-su,</i>

408
00:35:03,153 --> 00:35:06,539
<i>I've always envied you.</i>

409
00:35:07,044 --> 00:35:10,512
<i>Maybe I've lived my whole life</i>
<i>chasing after your shadow.</i>

410
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:13,929
<i>That day,</i>

411
00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:16,665
<i>I wanted to protect</i>
<i>my troublesome son...</i>

412
00:35:17,205 --> 00:35:18,523
<i>Actually, no...</i>

413
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:21,123
<i>I just wanted to protect myself.</i>

414
00:35:21,893 --> 00:35:24,929
SIGNING OF THE COOPERATION CONTRACT

415
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:27,279
<i>And so I made choices</i>
<i>that I shouldn't have.</i>

416
00:35:27,729 --> 00:35:31,814
<i>I ruined Jeong-woo's life</i>
<i>and caused your death.</i>

417
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,502
<i>Chang-su, don't forgive me.</i>

418
00:35:37,191 --> 00:35:39,305
<i>This was my choice.</i>

419
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:42,309
<i>I will now carry all my sins...</i>

420
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,204
<i>...and join you there.</i>

421
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,698
Open the door!

422
00:36:11,457 --> 00:36:12,914
Hyeon Gu-tak!

423
00:36:19,287 --> 00:36:20,779
Chief Hyeon!

424
00:36:21,105 --> 00:36:22,648
Open the door!

425
00:36:22,649 --> 00:36:24,471
You can't die!

426
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:30,538
You don't even deserve to die.

427
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:34,538
Stay alive and face your punishment.

428
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:36,676
Shit!

429
00:36:47,407 --> 00:36:48,664
There she is!

430
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:52,617
<i>Actress Choi Na-gyeom, who was charged</i>
<i>with kidnapping and attempted murder,</i>

<i>destruction of evidence...</i>

432
00:36:55,458 --> 00:36:57,516
<i>...in two murder cases 11 years ago.</i>

433
00:36:57,517 --> 00:36:58,186
Out of the way, please!

434
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:01,669
Please get out of the way.

435
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,948
- Just a minute.
- Please move.

436
00:37:03,949 --> 00:37:05,232
Someone will get hurt!

437
00:37:05,233 --> 00:37:06,995
- Out of the way, please.
- Out of the way.

438
00:37:06,995 --> 00:37:08,819
Please get out of the way.

439
00:37:09,082 --> 00:37:10,567
You'll cause an injury.

440
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,234
<i>Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil</i>

<i>...under arrest after losing in...</i>

445
00:37:20,834 --> 00:37:23,083
<i>the director of Sarang Hospital,</i>
<i>committed suicide.</i>

446
00:37:50,443 --> 00:37:53,093
Prepare my second speech.

447
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,873
Yes, ma'am.

448
00:37:58,404 --> 00:38:00,192
Thank you for everything.

449
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:22,215
Hey!

450
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:24,091
Get rid of this too.

451
00:38:53,301 --> 00:38:54,708
Team Head Noh,

452
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:58,580
if I had conducted the investigation
driven by personal feelings,

453
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:00,660
I would have no reason to be
in this position right now.

454
00:39:00,661 --> 00:39:03,117
If our investigation was
insufficient back then,

455
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:05,256
I could face disciplinary action now.

456
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:06,876
But we can't have anyone
that was wronged.

457
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,605
And above all,
finding the truth is important.

458
00:39:09,606 --> 00:39:11,159
Maybe I...

459
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,805
...was a very diligent lab rat.

460
00:39:20,807 --> 00:39:25,730
KOREA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE

461
00:39:26,375 --> 00:39:27,779
Hi.

462
00:39:32,788 --> 00:39:34,440
You're returning to school?

463
00:39:34,464 --> 00:39:35,273
Yes.

464
00:39:35,297 --> 00:39:36,957
Have you reflected
a lot on your actions?

465
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:38,163
Yes,

466
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,220
I did a lot of proper reflection.

467
00:39:40,244 --> 00:39:41,424
That's a relief.

468
00:39:41,448 --> 00:39:45,607
I'm going to let this slide
because of the late Professor Ha.

469
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,184
When's Professor Yun getting here?

470
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:52,881
Tell me when
Professor Yun is getting here!

471
00:39:52,882 --> 00:39:54,218
Sorry?

472
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:00,163
You moron!

473
00:40:00,273 --> 00:40:02,689
You said he had an aortic rupture?

474
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:03,763
Huh?

475
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,072
Yes, sir...

476
00:40:05,072 --> 00:40:07,237
This isn't an easy operation.

477
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,638
Break the news to the family.

478
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:09,460
Huh?

479
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:13,173
But... Wasn't this an appendectomy?

480
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:16,548
Can't you do anything right?

481
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:17,319
I'm sorry, sir.

482
00:40:17,319 --> 00:40:19,547
Just wrap this up
and take a few days off.

483
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:24,074
Mr. Ju Won, time of death, 4:20 p.m.

484
00:40:26,229 --> 00:40:29,243
We discovered an undiscovered
abdominal aortic rupture during surgery.

485
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:30,758
We really did everything we could
to save him.

486
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:34,813
But you said it was an appendectomy!

487
00:40:34,814 --> 00:40:37,965
That's because he complained
of abdominal pain...

488
00:40:37,965 --> 00:40:40,213
He's the one who thought
his appendix had ruptured.

489
00:40:40,214 --> 00:40:42,036
We only discovered what was really wrong
with him during the emergency surgery.

490
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:44,487
That's why we couldn't tell you
beforehand.

491
00:40:44,584 --> 00:40:46,074
Our medical staff really did their best.

492
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:48,387
Oh, Father!

493
00:40:48,816 --> 00:40:52,414
How could this happen? Father!

494
00:40:53,903 --> 00:40:56,619
I think my grandfather would be
really ashamed...

495
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,450
...that he chose a bad apprentice.

496
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:02,865
I met the victim's family before
I came here.

497
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:06,821
And I'm going to meet their lawyer
in two days.

498
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:10,882
You have no fear, do you?

499
00:41:11,004 --> 00:41:14,871
Have you even thought about
how this will affect your future?

500
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:18,066
I'm sure I won't even be able to
get training at a university hospital.

501
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:22,137
And it's very likely that I won't get
to choose the major I wanted to.

502
00:41:22,138 --> 00:41:24,640
I guess with one phone call from you,

503
00:41:24,641 --> 00:41:27,431
no university hospital will welcome me.

504
00:41:27,432 --> 00:41:28,856
So you know.

505
00:41:28,857 --> 00:41:33,096
But at least I won't lose my pride
about my profession.

506
00:41:33,607 --> 00:41:35,473
Isn't that good enough?

507
00:41:44,244 --> 00:41:46,480
Why are you frowning?

508
00:41:46,481 --> 00:41:49,128
Let's stop here for today, Mom.
Don't overdo it.

509
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,446
Jeong-woo.

510
00:41:58,842 --> 00:42:02,755
I don't like Mucheon anymore.

511
00:42:07,126 --> 00:42:10,622
Let's sort everything out and leave.

512
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:14,012
I'm sure your dad would want that too.

513
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:29,993
Jeong-woo.

514
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,468
Both you and I...

515
00:42:36,669 --> 00:42:39,204
...may never be able to forget this.

516
00:42:42,085 --> 00:42:44,523
But we have to endure and live on.

517
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:53,938
That's good to hear.

518
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,445
Hello!

519
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,030
Attorney Park!

520
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,462
Long time no see! Huh?

521
00:42:58,462 --> 00:42:59,974
Get out of my way.

522
00:43:00,267 --> 00:43:01,998
It's nice to meet you.

523
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,666
I'm Park Hyeon-geun.

524
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:08,094
I've already reviewed all the case files
and additional evidence materials,

525
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,028
and I've submitted requests for meetings...

526
00:43:10,029 --> 00:43:11,925
...with the suspects in prison.

527
00:43:11,926 --> 00:43:13,346
Thank you.

528
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:17,362
I respect him more than
any other little brother in the world.

529
00:43:17,363 --> 00:43:19,739
I'm not your little brother!

530
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,721
We're high school classmates.

531
00:43:23,557 --> 00:43:25,274
What was the detective like
in high school?

532
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:27,385
Gosh, even worse than now!

533
00:43:27,386 --> 00:43:30,814
He's become a lot more normal now.

534
00:43:31,569 --> 00:43:32,683
I was popular back then.

535
00:43:32,684 --> 00:43:34,084
Let's step inside.

536
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,940
Today I just wanted you...

537
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:41,521
...to freely tell your story.
That's why I asked you to come in.

538
00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:46,421
I'm going to record this.

539
00:43:50,816 --> 00:43:53,047
Jeong-woo, just say whatever you want.

540
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:01,602
It was the day after
the college entrance exam.

541
00:44:02,178 --> 00:44:04,042
Besides me, Geon-oh...

542
00:44:04,043 --> 00:44:06,720
...and Deok-mi,
everyone else failed their exams...

SOUTHERN CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION

544
00:44:09,959 --> 00:44:13,030
Your wife is doing well with Hye-yeong.

545
00:44:15,013 --> 00:44:18,721
Thanks for letting me know
how everyone is doing.

546
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:21,457
There's no need to thank me.

547
00:44:21,913 --> 00:44:23,808
I won't be coming back here again.

548
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:27,630
Exactly.
As if you'd want to return here.

549
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:29,897
So.

550
00:44:30,653 --> 00:44:32,897
They'll reopen the case and
have a retrial, right?

551
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:35,639
If you need a witness, let me know.

552
00:44:37,629 --> 00:44:39,841
Gosh.

553
00:44:42,786 --> 00:44:45,516
If only I wasn't a chronic alcoholic
back then...

554
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,175
If only I didn't abuse Bo-yeong
and her mom every day...

555
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:53,571
Then my Bo-yeong wouldn't have
ended up like that, right?

556
00:44:55,631 --> 00:44:58,092
I should have believed you.

560
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,864
<i>My life during that time</i>

561
00:45:26,678 --> 00:45:28,708
<i>Someone who killed two friends,</i>

562
00:45:28,829 --> 00:45:30,367
<i>and did not reveal</i>
<i>where their bodies were,</i>

563

564
00:45:32,619 --> 00:45:34,735
<i>Someone who was completely unforgivable.</i>

565
00:45:34,736 --> 00:45:36,352
<i>A true murderer.</i>

566
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:38,591

569
00:45:44,423 --> 00:45:46,065

<i>When we finally discovered the truth,</i>

574
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:05,743
<i>it had people filled with</i>
<i>greed and jealousy.</i>

575
00:46:06,232 --> 00:46:08,432
<i>There were real murderers,</i>

<i></i>
<i>However, the truth is just so cruel...</i>

581
00:46:25,037 --> 00:46:28,024
<i>...because the people who framed me...</i>

582
00:46:28,048 --> 00:46:30,466
<i>...were those whom I loved the most.</i>

583
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:33,356

<i>But I want to establish that.</i>

590
00:46:54,232 --> 00:46:56,673
<i>I did not commit any crime.</i>

591
00:46:57,049 --> 00:47:00,194
<i>That is the only proof I need</i>

DEFENSE COUNSEL

594
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,322
I will now give the verdict.

595
00:47:25,372 --> 00:47:26,678
The original verdict...

596
00:47:26,702 --> 00:47:29,326
...is henceforth overturned.

597
00:47:29,785 --> 00:47:32,170
The plaintiff is not guilty.

598
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:36,501
The summary of the judgment
for the plaintiff is made public.

599
00:47:37,394 --> 00:47:41,337
The forensic results from the National
Forensic Service at the crime scene...

600
00:47:41,338 --> 00:47:43,175
...and the police statements...

601
00:47:43,176 --> 00:47:47,133
...are insufficient to conclude that
the plaintiff committed the crime,

602
00:47:47,167 --> 00:47:50,129
And there is no other evidence
to support this,

603
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:53,621
Therefore, in accordance with
the Criminal Procedure Act,

604
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,930
the plaintiff must be declared
not guilty.

605
00:47:57,565 --> 00:47:58,965
Yes!

606
00:47:59,349 --> 00:48:01,459
You're the best, Attorney Park!

607
00:48:08,705 --> 00:48:10,304
What would you like to do?

608
00:48:10,548 --> 00:48:11,948
I'll just leave quietly.

609
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:13,349
You know the staff entrance, right?

610
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,759
Yeah.

611
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:16,243
Thank you.

612
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:17,760
I'll leave it to you to wrap things up.

613
00:48:17,824 --> 00:48:19,604
- I'll call you.
- Get lost.

614
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:21,859
- I'll get lost.
- Take care.

615
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,491
Isn't Mr. Goh Jeong-woo
coming out with you?

616
00:48:34,491 --> 00:48:35,916
Please say a few words.

617
00:48:35,995 --> 00:48:39,389
Thank you. This is a great day.

618
00:48:39,945 --> 00:48:43,312
It would be best if Mr. Goh Jeong-woo
spoke for himself...

619
00:48:48,262 --> 00:48:49,662
Congrats!

620
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,600
You did well.

621
00:49:00,077 --> 00:49:01,577
It's all thanks to you, Detective.

622
00:49:04,002 --> 00:49:05,402

623
00:49:06,145 --> 00:49:08,113
My sincerest thanks.

624
00:49:12,976 --> 00:49:14,410
I'll get going.

625
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:17,679
Jeong-woo.

626
00:49:25,018 --> 00:49:26,418
Just...

627
00:49:28,694 --> 00:49:30,799
...live an ordinary life now.

628
00:49:31,103 --> 00:49:34,770
Experience ordinary struggles
and ordinary joys.

629
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:36,883
Smile and cry ordinarily.

630
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:40,637
Just endure and live on
with an ordinary heart.

631
00:49:42,754 --> 00:49:45,937
Don't ever think that you've
lost out in life.

632
00:49:46,203 --> 00:49:49,809
If you move,
don't be afraid of your new neighbors.

633
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:53,151
Don't start by being wary of strangers.

634
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:55,847
Just...

635
00:49:56,978 --> 00:49:58,378
Like that.

636
00:49:58,808 --> 00:50:00,951
Just live as you are now.

637
00:50:03,136 --> 00:50:04,539
I'm sure you can.

What do we need now?

00:51:29,444 --> 00:51:31,300
We don't have concrete evidence.

653
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:34,329
Of course I know how sharp
your intuition is,

654
00:51:34,353 --> 00:51:36,203
just as I did 10 years ago.

655
00:51:36,204 --> 00:51:38,102
You messed everything up, you bastard!

You!

657
00:51:39,459 --> 00:51:40,916
You're the one who screwed up
the investigation...

658
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:42,717
...and caused this mess, you bastard!

659
00:51:42,718 --> 00:51:44,249
You should resign.

00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,990
Jeong-woo,

663
00:52:11,850 --> 00:52:13,516
when will you come to visit me?

664
00:52:25,379 --> 00:52:26,779
I'm sorry...

665
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:30,435
...that I couldn't love you more.

666
00:52:35,339 --> 00:52:36,802

Please have some of this.

672
00:53:21,352 --> 00:53:23,777
When I told you not to come
on the death anniversary,

673
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:27,974
you know I meant for you
to forget and move on.

674
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:29,675
So why did you come?

675
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:32,895
It's your birthday, father-in-law.

676
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:36,787
I heard you got transferred to
somewhere in Gyeonggi-do.

677
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:38,935
Why are you living so recklessly?

678
00:53:38,936 --> 00:53:41,048
Just live a normal life.

679
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:43,841
Father, I'm not normal.

680
00:53:45,673 --> 00:53:47,478
How could I be normal?

681
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:50,513
But you know,

682
00:53:50,514 --> 00:53:53,402
everyone else lives on
despite not being normal.

683
00:53:54,451 --> 00:53:57,665
It's not just me going through
a hard time, everyone is.

684
00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:00,327
But they all just endure it.

685
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,580
So, Father.

686
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:07,179
I'm not okay,

687
00:54:07,986 --> 00:54:10,610
but I'll try to live on like that.

688
00:54:13,805 --> 00:54:17,998
So don't worry about me too much.

689
00:54:28,068 --> 00:54:30,568
I'll get going now.

690
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:32,053
Sang-cheol.

691
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:41,613
My son-in-law.

692
00:54:43,562 --> 00:54:45,726
It wasn't your fault.

693
00:54:46,767 --> 00:54:48,706
It wasn't your fault.

694
00:54:54,998 --> 00:54:56,789
No, Father.

695
00:54:57,322 --> 00:54:58,862
It was my fault.

696
00:55:00,977 --> 00:55:04,292
So I'm never going to forget.

697
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:07,764
I'm going to keep remembering her.

698
00:55:34,077 --> 00:55:35,380
Hey, freshman!

699
00:55:35,381 --> 00:55:37,358
You know how to play footbag?

700
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:40,157
Isn't that game too old?

701
00:55:40,157 --> 00:55:42,665
I heard you were
quite old for your year,

702
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:43,934
so I looked it up.

703
00:55:43,935 --> 00:55:45,364
Is that not you?

704
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:47,083
It's me.

705
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:49,501
So we finally meet.

706
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:51,080
The legendary outcast...

00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:56,730
What do you think?
I look quite cool in person, right?

710
00:55:57,810 --> 00:55:59,383
Do you have class?

711
00:55:59,627 --> 00:56:01,436
Have you been to the library over there?

712
00:56:01,437 --> 00:56:02,837
There's a library?

713
00:56:05,808 --> 00:56:07,057
I'm back.

714
00:56:07,058 --> 00:56:08,181
Oh, you're here?

715
00:56:08,182 --> 00:56:10,680
Did you have lots of customers?
Is there anything for me to do?

716
00:56:12,053 --> 00:56:13,593
Eat first.

717
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:16,296
Are you adapting to college?

718
00:56:17,368 --> 00:56:18,824
I am...

719
00:56:18,825 --> 00:56:20,809
...but the kids these days are too fast
for me to keep up.

720
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,832
They must not hang out with you
because they find you difficult.

721
00:56:22,833 --> 00:56:24,178
You're right.

722
00:56:24,405 --> 00:56:25,879
But what can you do?

723
00:56:28,662 --> 00:56:30,316
Study hard.

724
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:33,224
- Hurry up!
- Hurry!

725
00:57:36,122 --> 00:57:38,944
Oh, this is way too fast.

726
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,094
We're here.

727
00:57:42,264 --> 00:57:44,724
- We're here.
- Wow! Wow! Look at that!

728
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,810
This is so awesome!

729
00:57:48,393 --> 00:57:49,908
Min-su isn't coming.

730
00:57:49,909 --> 00:57:52,007
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming. Let's go together!

731
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:54,029
- Come quickly.
- Got it.

732
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,515
Wow, this is nice.

733
00:57:55,516 --> 00:57:57,454
- Push, push!
- Okay, okay!

734
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:00,872
Hey, wait for me!

735
00:58:03,243 --> 00:58:03,874
- Geon-oh.
- Yeah.

736
00:58:03,874 --> 00:58:05,647
- Let's put it in the shade.
- Okay, okay.

737
00:58:05,671 --> 00:58:06,959
It's heavy.

738
00:58:07,321 --> 00:58:11,356
Let's be honest, it's so much
easier without Su-oh here.

739
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:16,095
If he came with us,
we still wouldn't have made it here.

740
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:18,819
- We'd be cooking this in the street.
- Looks delicious.

741
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:20,875
Why be so harsh?

742
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:23,102
Hey, stop talking nonsense.
When will the noodles be ready?

743
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,111
The water's just started to boil.

744
00:58:27,228 --> 00:58:28,350
Why did you say it like that?

745
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:30,599
Su-oh's our friend too.
We should take care of him.

746
00:58:32,499 --> 00:58:34,464
Yes, thank you, oh, wise one.

747
00:58:34,465 --> 00:58:36,275
We'll be careful, Jeong-woo.

748
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:38,755
How many noodle packs
should we cook?

749
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:40,168
12?

750
00:58:41,096 --> 00:58:42,449
8.

751
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:50,374
Geon-oh.

752
00:58:54,305 --> 00:58:55,705
Jeong-woo.

753
00:58:59,448 --> 00:59:01,502
We endure it because of you.

754
00:59:04,033 --> 00:59:07,176
When Su-oh gets mistreated by others...

755
00:59:07,177 --> 00:59:09,688
...because he acts weird.

756
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,470
Or when he gets beat up by strangers.

757
00:59:15,078 --> 00:59:17,408
Every time I discover how much...

758
00:59:17,409 --> 00:59:20,129
...of a coward I am
when those things happen.

759
00:59:21,739 --> 00:59:23,844
Every time,

760
00:59:23,845 --> 00:59:26,010
you were by my side.

761
00:59:26,682 --> 00:59:28,294
That's how I endure it.

762
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:31,011
The sunset sure is amazing.

763
00:59:35,491 --> 00:59:36,891
Thanks.

764
00:59:37,028 --> 00:59:38,428
Forget it.

<i>Please keep watching over me.</i>

769
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:12,865
<i>Even now.</i>

770
01:00:15,442 --> 01:00:17,826
<i>Please watch how I live my life.</i>

771
01:00:19,012 --> 01:00:20,412
<i>Watch closely.</i>

772
01:00:23,437 --> 01:00:25,321
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

773
01:00:27,385 --> 01:00:29,026
<i>And I love you.</i>
