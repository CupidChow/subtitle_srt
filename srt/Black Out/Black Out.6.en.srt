00:00:15,385 --> 00:00:16,973
This month's lunch fees...

5
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:21,340
...no one has any overdue.

6
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:24,058
Let's all thank our parents.

7
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:25,849
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes.

8
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:28,182
Attention. Bow.

9
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:30,482
Thank you!

10
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:36,915
- Hey, Goh Jeong-woo.
- Yeah?

11
00:00:36,915 --> 00:00:38,782
Did you pay for
my lunches again?

12
00:00:38,782 --> 00:00:40,488
So what?

13
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,182
You can pay me
back with interest later.

14
00:00:55,542 --> 00:00:57,675
Hey, don't push me.

15
00:00:58,582 --> 00:01:00,115
Where are you going?

16
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:02,215
Hey, you two! Come over here!

17
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:04,449
- Hey, get over here!
- Are you all right?

18
00:01:04,449 --> 00:01:06,765
You're both dead.
You want another beating?

19
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,082
Bo-yeong.

20
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:10,182
Shim Bo-yeong, you come over here.
Come over here!

21
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:11,949
Stop it, sir!

22
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:13,782
If you ever do this again,
I'll tell my dad.

23
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:16,149
- You little punk!
- What did they do wrong?

24
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:17,632
- Hey, Byeong-mu, take them.
- Get out of the way.

25
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:20,391
Hey! Hey, Shim Bo-yeong,
you come here!

26
00:01:20,392 --> 00:01:22,225
- Go quickly!
- Hey, you punk!

27
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:24,393
Why are you like this
every time you drink?

28
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:25,743
You punks!

29
00:01:25,743 --> 00:01:26,743
Hey! Shim Bo-yeong,
get over here!

30
00:01:26,743 --> 00:01:27,665
Get going!

31
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,224
You come here, you punk!

32
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:37,001
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

33
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,208
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

34
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,332
Your interest is
two days overdue.

35
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:53,035
This happened last month too.

36
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:55,512
Maybe I've been too easy on you...

37
00:01:55,536 --> 00:01:56,978
Excuse me.

38
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:02,132
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll pay you as soon as I close today...

39
00:02:02,132 --> 00:02:03,581
Jeon Gyeong-suk?

40
00:02:04,112 --> 00:02:05,784
Are you Jeon Gyeong-suk?

41
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:08,666
- That's me.
- Oh, this guy's getting nosy.

42
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:10,166
We're in the middle
of a conversation.

43
00:02:10,166 --> 00:02:11,399
Yeah, whatever.

44
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:13,532
Do you work for the courts
or the police?

45
00:02:13,532 --> 00:02:16,027
I doubt it.

46
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:19,498
What are you waiting for?
Report him for unlawful debt collection.

47
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,964
I got hit on the head, darn it!
Get them over here!

48
00:02:35,003 --> 00:02:36,004
Hey!

49
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,428
You stop right there!

50
00:02:40,532 --> 00:02:41,951
Hey!

51
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,766
Hey, pig. What you gonna do now?

52
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:02,624
You're in trouble now.

53
00:03:02,716 --> 00:03:05,119
You're the ones who are in trouble.

54
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:07,666
Just take the beating.

55
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:09,432
There's no CCTV...

56
00:03:09,932 --> 00:03:11,690
You said there's no CCTV.

57
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:21,925
Darn it!

58
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,032
Ah, geez.

59
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,985
Hey, hey, get up, get up.
No, no.

60
00:03:38,232 --> 00:03:39,765
Darn it.

61
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,814
Hey, stop interfering!

62
00:03:48,051 --> 00:03:49,553
Hello?

63
00:03:52,414 --> 00:03:55,071
<i>Team Head, Mr. Shim was released</i>
<i>from a lack of evidence...</i>

64
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:56,564
<i>...and statement being invalid.</i>

65
00:03:57,366 --> 00:03:58,899
I'll see you at home.

66
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:00,936
Hey.

67
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,242
That was Mr. Shim Dong-min, wasn't it?

68
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,866
I'll take care of it.

69
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,432
As if you will...

70
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,511
Please follow
that taxi in front.

71
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:54,099
How did you get released?

72
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:09,932
Even a killer like you was released
after just 10 years.

73
00:05:11,332 --> 00:05:14,661
So why would I get locked up
when there's no evidence?

74
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:15,829
Are you even human?

75
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,663
How could you toss your friend
into a ditch like that?

76
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:29,958
I didn't kill Bo-yeong.

77
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:35,711
Da-eun died in the warehouse
when Bo-yeong was being abandoned.

78
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:39,212
Unless there're two of me,
that's impossible.

79
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:44,745
What did you do that day?

80
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:48,038
- What?
- Bo-yeong...

81
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,589
...had a hard time and
was scared of you.

82
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:55,319
On that final day,
she was crying in my car.

83
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,391
I'm sure it was because of you.

84
00:06:00,938 --> 00:06:02,885
You murdering bastard!

85
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:06,866
Are you...
suspecting me right now? Huh?

86
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,266
Shoot me.

87
00:06:08,932 --> 00:06:11,323
But I didn't kill Bo-yeong.

88
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:37,135
I didn't kill her.

89
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:39,169
Bo-yeong is watching from above.

90
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,537
You're right.

91
00:06:42,085 --> 00:06:44,651
Bo-yeong is
watching from above...

92
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:49,205
Can you stand
proudly before her?

93
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:50,851
What?

94
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:15,399
Darn it. Please pick up.

95
00:07:19,565 --> 00:07:21,765
Goh Jeong-woo! Goh Jeong-woo!

96
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:24,572
Goh Jeong-woo!

97
00:07:24,918 --> 00:07:26,218
Goh Jeong-woo!

98
00:07:36,037 --> 00:07:37,304
Hey, Goh Jeong-woo.

99
00:07:37,305 --> 00:07:39,605
- Hey, are you all right?
- I'm all right.

100
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:41,401
Damn it.

101
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:45,345
I said I'm all right.

102
00:07:47,152 --> 00:07:48,452
Geez.

103
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,578
Damn it.

104
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,166
Drive.

105
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:56,699
What happened, huh?

106
00:07:57,366 --> 00:08:00,855
If it wasn't for that detective,
I would've gotten rid of Goh Jeong-woo.

107
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:03,083
Hurry up and drive!

108
00:08:13,377 --> 00:08:14,677
Hyeon Geon-oh.

109
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,397
Geon-oh.

110
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:25,384
When did you get here?

111
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,698
You should've called ahead of time
to tell me you were coming.

112
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:34,071
Oh, I understand now.

113
00:08:34,352 --> 00:08:37,852
Ha Seol, this is Su-oh's brother, Geon-oh.

114
00:08:38,638 --> 00:08:40,919
Oh, I see. Hello.

115
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,454
I'm Ha Seol.

116
00:08:42,454 --> 00:08:44,687
I'm Su-oh's friend.

117
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,480
Okay.

118
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,152
I'm sorry for bothering you.

119
00:08:56,153 --> 00:08:57,729
- It's okay.
- Bye.

120
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:18,767
Wow, they look exactly the same.

121
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:23,873
Are you some kind of collector?

122
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:26,608
Is collecting scars
on your face a hobby? Huh?

123
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,987
All done.

124
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:31,038
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

125
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,121
More importantly...

126
00:09:37,546 --> 00:09:40,735
You almost died, you know that?

127
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,487
Who was it?

128
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,905
It was Shim Bo-yeong's father,
Shim Dong-min, right?

129
00:09:54,926 --> 00:09:55,926
Hey.

130
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:58,561
Bring me a pillow.

131
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:01,720
Why a pillow?

132
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,520
Even if you're a criminal,
your life is being threatened.

133
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,087
I can't just leave, can I?

134
00:10:06,087 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm a very good civil servant.

135
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:12,999
It's time to take
your medication.

136
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,636
Open wide and let me see.

137
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,807
Under your tongue.

138
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,420
Well done.

139
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:40,538
Has Su-oh gone somewhere?

140
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:44,185
You hospitalized him again, didn't you?

141
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,087
Which hospital is it?

142
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:50,566
Why are you suddenly back?

143
00:10:53,532 --> 00:10:55,165
For what reason?

144
00:10:58,297 --> 00:10:59,764
Father.

145
00:11:00,998 --> 00:11:04,180
Isn't that a bit much to say
to your son who's returned after 10 years?

146
00:11:11,332 --> 00:11:13,599
Pull yourself together, okay?

147
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:16,844
Please pull yourself together!

148
00:11:21,732 --> 00:11:23,166
Forget it.

149
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:25,288
Just go back tomorrow.

150
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,732
Nobody can know you were here.

151
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,518
Don't even think
about meeting anyone.

152
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:31,464
You understand, right?

153
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,103
Go back.

154
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:39,465
Father.

155
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,891
Jeong-woo's been released, right?

156
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,250
Don't you think
about seeing him.

157
00:12:03,302 --> 00:12:04,503
Oh, I just need to go back to the car.

158
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,290
Are you looking for this?

159
00:12:10,132 --> 00:12:11,304
Oh...

160
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:14,658
Was it in your bag?

161
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:19,504
You need to explain first.

162
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:23,659
Oh...

163
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,768
Did you read that?

164
00:12:24,792 --> 00:12:26,925
That's not the answer I'm looking for.

165
00:12:30,605 --> 00:12:32,869
It's from a private number.

166
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:41,099
"You killed me...

167
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,712
...11 years ago...

168
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:48,664
...why did you kill me 11 years ago?"

169
00:12:51,632 --> 00:12:54,465
These things happen
sometimes during consultations.

170
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:56,932
You know how there are
all kinds of patients out there.

171
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:58,965
I'll sort it out...

172
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:02,110
- ...so don't worry about it.
- And just how will you do that?

173
00:13:07,891 --> 00:13:10,482
I'll take care of it.
Don't do anything.

174
00:13:11,518 --> 00:13:13,118
Whatever it is you want to do...

175
00:13:13,898 --> 00:13:15,852
...just don't do it.

176
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,751
The elections for
governor are coming up.

177
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:25,952
We don't want anyone to
have an excuse to attack you.

178
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,432
- It was 11 years ago...
- Stop being so complacent!

179
00:13:31,432 --> 00:13:34,799
If you're complacent,
you'll decay like stagnant water!

180
00:13:42,624 --> 00:13:44,024
Goh Jeong-woo.

181
00:13:47,205 --> 00:13:48,939
Hey, Goh Jeong-woo!

182
00:14:24,665 --> 00:14:27,745
Where did this jerk go now?

183
00:14:27,746 --> 00:14:30,131
- Hey, that smells.
- Oh, gosh.

184
00:14:30,132 --> 00:14:31,365
How come you're so good at this?

185
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,679
DEAD, KILLER
This is just basic.

186
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,491
That's a work of art.

187
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,735
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

188
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:42,505
Hey, Mister. We
heard you're a killer.

189
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,807
- What?
- How does it feel to kill someone?

190
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:46,675
My mom keeps nagging me,
saying that I shouldn't grow up...

191
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:48,870
...to be human filth like
you. Move out of here!

192
00:14:48,871 --> 00:14:51,177
You're making our
property values fall.

193
00:14:51,178 --> 00:14:54,144
- Move out! Move out!
- You rotten punks.

194
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:54,779
Get over here.

195
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,146
- Get lost!
- Killer!

196
00:14:56,147 --> 00:14:56,714
Come here!

197
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,455
- Get lost!
- You killer!

198
00:15:06,165 --> 00:15:08,699
- Where did you go?
- Let's go inside.

199
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,696
What are you doing? Huh?

200
00:15:22,096 --> 00:15:24,096
Everyone in the village,

201
00:15:24,096 --> 00:15:26,396
including the kids,
are telling you to leave...

202
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:29,129
...by swearing at you
and cursing you.

203
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,629
But you're here
keeping the house clean...

204
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,657
...and doing the grocery shopping.

205
00:15:33,902 --> 00:15:35,963
Why are you staying here?

206
00:15:36,523 --> 00:15:37,439
Huh?

207
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:39,254
You almost died yesterday.

208
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:41,628
I've told you several
times already.

209
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,070
Until the case is
reopened, we find Da-eun,

210
00:15:46,094 --> 00:15:48,388
and my mom wakes up,
I can't leave.

211
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:58,282
Reopen the case?

212
00:15:58,505 --> 00:15:59,805
Right.

213
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,794
I'm asking because
I really don't understand.

214
00:16:02,794 --> 00:16:06,761
Even if we dig into this case,
you're the one who has the most to lose.

215
00:16:06,761 --> 00:16:08,411
So why are you doing this?

216
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,062
Because it's unjust.

217
00:16:14,033 --> 00:16:15,469
It's unjust?

218
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,985
Bo-yeong and Da-eun...

219
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:20,303
...were really good friends of mine.

220
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,944
They were kind,

221
00:16:23,412 --> 00:16:24,832
and smiled a lot.

222
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,148
But they died before
they even reached 20.

223
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:33,912
I feel it's so unjust
when I'm alive.

224
00:16:33,912 --> 00:16:36,386
So imagine how they feel.

225
00:16:40,718 --> 00:16:42,892
Please help me reopen the case.

226
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,644
If I really committed the murders,

227
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:48,479
I will repay my debt
for the rest of my life.

228
00:16:51,732 --> 00:16:54,828
Just tell me what I have to do.

229
00:17:04,971 --> 00:17:07,971
We haven't found any
personal belongings yet.

230
00:17:09,591 --> 00:17:12,937
You know, like, a watch or a mirror,
since they're girls.

231
00:17:12,938 --> 00:17:15,145
Or even a phone.

232
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:18,012
None of that has been found yet.

233
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:19,745
You were their friend.

234
00:17:19,745 --> 00:17:21,991
You must know something.

235
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:23,506
Huh?

236
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:38,979
TO GOH JEONG-WOO

237
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,179
Look at this.

238
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,812
This was the backpack
she carried every day for 3 years.

239
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:51,445
She was wearing it
on that day as well.

240
00:17:55,479 --> 00:17:57,912
Where did the backpack go?

241
00:18:29,397 --> 00:18:30,757
Hyeon Geon-oh.

242
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:33,904
Get up.

243
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,162
Hyeon Geon-oh!

244
00:18:36,812 --> 00:18:38,312
Open your eyes.

245
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:47,879
Did you drink that all night?

246
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,984
Okay.

247
00:18:55,179 --> 00:18:56,927
You must have jet lag.

248
00:19:00,685 --> 00:19:03,033
I'll arrange the plane ticket.

249
00:19:03,698 --> 00:19:05,532
So leave as soon as it's ready.

250
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:08,968
Okay.

251
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:13,272
You...

252
00:19:15,192 --> 00:19:18,441
Don't you ever dare to come
back without my permission.

253
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,392
MUCHEON MISSING BODY MURDER,
REMAINS FOUND AFTER 11 YEARS

254
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:56,792
REMAINS CONFIRMED
TO BELONG TO MISS SHIM

255
00:20:14,303 --> 00:20:15,970
What is it?

256
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:23,382
You're a smart kid,
so I'll get straight to the point.

257
00:20:25,175 --> 00:20:28,097
We don't know when we
can reopen the restaurant,

258
00:20:28,098 --> 00:20:30,611
and it's hard for us
to give you any wages.

259
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,007
So thank you for all your work.

260
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:38,569
All of a sudden?

261
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,401
Ma'am, you know I'm a good worker.
Please reconsider.

262
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:44,436
I heard you have to
go back to your studies.

263
00:20:44,437 --> 00:20:46,177
Just go back home now.

264
00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:48,110
And back to university.

265
00:20:49,747 --> 00:20:52,735
I'm not exactly sure
when I'll return to my studies.

266
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:54,935
Please reconsider one more time.

267
00:20:57,669 --> 00:20:59,862
Why are you being like this?

268
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:02,243
Police Chief Hyeon
already said no.

269
00:21:02,449 --> 00:21:05,813
Sorry? Did the police chief
tell you to fire me?

270
00:21:07,254 --> 00:21:09,252
That's not it.

271
00:21:09,782 --> 00:21:11,915
Move out by the end of the week.

272
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:14,217
Wait...

273
00:21:19,648 --> 00:21:22,632
What's going on all of a sudden?

274
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,057
<i>The door's open.</i>

275
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:49,823
Police Chief,
I have something to ask...

276
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:56,363
I think he's already gone to work.

277
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,468
You're Su-oh's friend, right?
Have a drink before you go.

278
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,073
Oh, okay...

279
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,176
Here.

280
00:22:15,915 --> 00:22:19,382
So you're drinking in the morning...

281
00:22:21,562 --> 00:22:23,264
Someone said this...

282
00:22:23,728 --> 00:22:25,909
I'm drinking because of jet lag.

283
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,762
Okay.

284
00:22:28,801 --> 00:22:32,235
I came on my scooter so...

285
00:22:36,075 --> 00:22:38,341
Su-oh doesn't make friends easily...

286
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,802
Oh... We're close though.

287
00:22:41,803 --> 00:22:45,021
We talk a lot together,
and we look at paintings.

288
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:47,206
We get along really well.

289
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:59,089
In that case,
can I ask you for a favor?

290
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:15,082
Why are you here?

291
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,621
SHIM BO-YEONG, LOVE YOU

292
00:24:04,874 --> 00:24:06,527
My Bo-yeong...

293
00:24:07,907 --> 00:24:11,131
She never had her own
room when she was alive.

294
00:24:12,574 --> 00:24:14,524
It was only in death,
she got to have one.

295
00:24:17,459 --> 00:24:20,059
The purple bag she
always used to carry around.

296
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:22,518
You remember it, right?

297
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,407
Have you seen it?

298
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,409
Only you'd know where it is.

299
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:39,493
When I fell pregnant with
Bo-yeong at the age of 19,

300
00:24:39,859 --> 00:24:43,528
got kicked out of my family,
and wandered around Mucheon...

301
00:24:44,413 --> 00:24:47,748
...the person who took me in,
fed me and gave me a bed...

302
00:24:49,174 --> 00:24:50,674
...was your mother.

303
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,374
She was pregnant and yet...

304
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,234
...she went all the way to Seoul
to drag Bo-yeong's dad back here...

305
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
...and set up a house for us.

306
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,640
Your mother...

307
00:25:09,852 --> 00:25:12,125
...is my lifelong benefactor.

308
00:25:14,993 --> 00:25:17,660
But for 10 years after
you killed Bo-yeong...

309
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:22,940
She's just a wench
that I wanted to murder.

310
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:28,942
What's the use in dragging her knees
on the floor begging for forgiveness?

311
00:25:29,313 --> 00:25:34,146
Just the sound of her breath
fills me with rage and fury.

312
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:38,979
That would drive me insane.

313
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:42,999
That's how I've
spent every single day...

314
00:25:44,307 --> 00:25:46,023
...for 10 years.

315
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,316
Auntie...

316
00:25:55,607 --> 00:25:57,942
...I didn't kill Bo-yeong.

317
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,131
If it wasn't you who killed her,

318
00:26:02,574 --> 00:26:05,212
then who did it?

319
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:07,783
Why now?

320
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,340
For 10 years,

321
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:12,474
me, Da-eun's grandmother,

322
00:26:12,474 --> 00:26:15,534
your mother, and your father...

323
00:26:15,535 --> 00:26:18,335
...had to live rotten
and festering lives...

324
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:21,966
...just like Bo-yeong who
was thrown into the sewer!

325
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:28,532
Just leave.

326
00:26:29,606 --> 00:26:31,443
Leave.

327
00:26:32,006 --> 00:26:33,873
If your mom wakes up,

328
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,593
I'll take good care of her.

329
00:26:37,146 --> 00:26:38,645
I beg you.

330
00:26:39,093 --> 00:26:41,159
Please just leave.

331
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,607
I'm sorry, Auntie.

332
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,992
Why didn't you
just die in prison?

333
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:00,633
Here.

334
00:27:00,634 --> 00:27:01,939
Oh, thanks.

335
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:08,240
Hey.

336
00:27:08,806 --> 00:27:11,645
You hid it well, right?

337
00:27:12,893 --> 00:27:14,293
Don't you worry.

338
00:27:14,294 --> 00:27:16,617
I hid it where no
one would find it.

339
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:18,310
Okay.

340
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:22,535
But what if that
detective comes here?

341
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,325
Shouldn't we have an alibi
ready or something like that?

342
00:27:25,822 --> 00:27:27,885
He didn't even see my face,

343
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:30,053
and he can't arrest me
without any evidence.

344
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:32,988
What about Jeong-woo?

345
00:27:32,988 --> 00:27:34,355
He must have seen you.

346
00:27:34,355 --> 00:27:35,622
What if he reports you?

347
00:27:35,622 --> 00:27:38,199
<i>I didn't kill Bo-yeong.</i>

348
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,975
What did you do that day?

349
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,015
Are you blameless?

350
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:48,901
Jeong-woo, that punk.
He can't report me.

351
00:27:49,654 --> 00:27:52,054
He'll try to catch me himself.

352
00:27:59,028 --> 00:28:00,894
Okay. Yeah.

353
00:28:01,267 --> 00:28:02,785
Hey,

354
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:05,398
why are you wandering
around this late at night? Huh?

355
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:09,766
There's not much going on.

356
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:11,289
What could they find in a corpse...

357
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,282
...that's been decomposing
for over 10 years?

358
00:28:13,915 --> 00:28:15,010
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:17,534
You deliver this to the family.

360
00:28:17,535 --> 00:28:18,841
Yes, sir.

361
00:28:19,588 --> 00:28:20,988
This part seems odd.

362
00:28:20,988 --> 00:28:22,288
What?

363
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:23,788
Listen to this.

364
00:28:23,788 --> 00:28:26,488
"There is an irregular
hole, 8cm in diameter,

365
00:28:26,488 --> 00:28:28,988
on the left side of the
frontal bone of the skull.

366
00:28:28,988 --> 00:28:32,435
It is suggested that an external force
was applied multiple times to this part.

367
00:28:32,436 --> 00:28:36,207
A hairline fracture was discovered
on the left iliac bone of the pelvis.

368
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,675
No other unusual
findings were observed."

369
00:28:39,946 --> 00:28:41,188
What's wrong with that?

370
00:28:41,188 --> 00:28:45,788
The cause of death is the brain trauma
caused by this 8cm hole in the skull.

371
00:28:45,788 --> 00:28:47,855
So why was her pelvis fractured?

372
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:49,239
That's strange.

373
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,541
Don't you agree?

374
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:54,100
It probably happened
when she fell over.

375
00:28:54,101 --> 00:28:57,604
But only her panties
were missing.

376
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:00,927
And if her pelvis was fractured,
couldn't this be sexual assault?

377
00:29:00,928 --> 00:29:03,274
Hey! What on earth...

378
00:29:03,513 --> 00:29:06,738
It's been 11 years
already! 11 years!

379
00:29:06,739 --> 00:29:07,792
Panties?

380
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:10,860
They could've decomposed
or washed away in the rain.

381
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,545
But why only the panties?

382
00:29:13,546 --> 00:29:15,105
Geez, come on.

383
00:29:15,106 --> 00:29:16,606
What is wrong with you?

384
00:29:16,606 --> 00:29:19,639
I'll discuss this with
the chief myself.

385
00:29:19,914 --> 00:29:21,340
I'll be back. Let's go.

386
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:23,280
Hey, you! Don't make
things complicated!

387
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:24,364
AUTOPSY REPORT

388
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:30,980
I don't see any
particular findings.

389
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,785
It's just everything
we expected.

390
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:37,128
Chief.

391
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:40,821
The fact that her panties are missing
and the hairline fracture on her pelvis.

392
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:43,284
Plus none of her
belongings have been found.

393
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:45,818
There are several suspicious
things about this case.

394
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,259
Is that so?

395
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,506
Let's look into that.

396
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:00,157
We haven't found her
belongings for 10 years.

397
00:30:00,158 --> 00:30:02,158
But we should look
into whatever we can.

398
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:09,113
<i>Yes, Chief.</i>

399
00:30:09,114 --> 00:30:10,580
Hey, good work.

400
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,480
I've seen the autopsy report.

401
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:15,380
Besides the direct
cause of death...

402
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,073
...the hairline fracture on the
left iliac bone of the pelvis.

403
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:22,447
Could it be caused
by an external force?

404
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:25,314
So for example,
like a sexual assault.

405
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:29,014
<i>If it was caused by a</i>
<i>strong external force,</i>

406
00:30:29,014 --> 00:30:31,514
<i>we can't rule out the</i>
<i>possibility of sexual assault.</i>

407
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:35,786
<i>But it's only circumstantial.</i>
<i>It can't be conclusive.</i>

408
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:37,553
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

409
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,206
He says it can't be conclusive.

410
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,459
Shim Dong-min
threatened Goh Jeong-woo.

411
00:30:58,965 --> 00:31:01,126
Why did you release
Shim Dong-min?

412
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:02,793
He even made a confession.

413
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,520
Right. That confession.

414
00:31:13,347 --> 00:31:14,765
Look.

415
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:17,280
<i>Did I really say that?</i>

416
00:31:17,964 --> 00:31:18,947
<i>I don't remember.</i>

417
00:31:18,947 --> 00:31:22,206
<i>I mean, that detective...</i>

418
00:31:22,207 --> 00:31:24,320
<i>...kept offering me drinks.</i>

419
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:26,759
<i>How could he lead the</i>
<i>questioning like that?</i>

420
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,910
<i>How can an officer do that?</i>

421
00:31:30,047 --> 00:31:32,980
I figured it could become a headache
if he makes a big deal out of it.

422
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,244
So I dealt with it for now.

423
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,710
Is that enough of
an explanation?

424
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:40,587
You can't afford to go through
another inspection, can you?

425
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:46,493
Okay. Listen carefully.

426
00:31:47,056 --> 00:31:49,047
Our focus now...

427
00:31:49,047 --> 00:31:53,247
...is to help that family hold the
funeral as soon as possible.

428
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,546
Got that?

429
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,100
Yes, sir.

430
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,886
You may leave.

431
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,688
Jeong-woo...

432
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:47,079
Hey, what happened to you?

433
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,947
- Are you really okay?
- Min-su.

434
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,514
I don't know what's going on,
but let's get you treated first.

435
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:56,660
I don't know who did it but they
did a great job with the first aid.

436
00:32:57,257 --> 00:32:59,380
- You just need to disinfect it.
- Yes, thank you.

437
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,132
Where did Jeong-woo get hurt?

438
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,062
What's going on?
What happened to you?

439
00:33:03,086 --> 00:33:06,552
I thought his head was
cracked but he's fine.

440
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:08,720
- I'm fine.
- You are not fine.

441
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:11,806
You might've just hurt your head
today but what about next time?

442
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,169
Where will you
get hurt next time?

443
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:17,561
Hey, hey, we're grown-ups
now. Let's not fight.

444
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:19,982
How about we get ice
Americanos instead?

445
00:33:19,983 --> 00:33:21,283
Guys.

446
00:33:21,676 --> 00:33:23,809
Can you help me out first?

447
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,590
Ma'am, this is jujube tea.

448
00:33:31,573 --> 00:33:33,723
You didn't even have lunch.

449
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:36,074
You're concerned about
something, aren't you?

450
00:33:36,362 --> 00:33:38,862
I'm always concerned
about something.

451
00:33:39,657 --> 00:33:41,557
The election is just
around the corner.

452
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,957
Please hand over all your concerns,
unrelated to the election, to me.

453
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,757
It concerns the director.

454
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:52,208
Oh...

455
00:33:52,557 --> 00:33:56,057
He's always been patient
and careful during elections...

456
00:33:56,057 --> 00:33:57,257
I know.

457
00:33:57,257 --> 00:33:59,223
Maybe he's in
heat early this year.

458
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:01,823
- I'll relay that to Secretary Hwang.
- No.

459
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,390
It seems a bit
different this time.

460
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,841
I'd like you to look into it.

461
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:15,123
These were roasted yesterday
so they should have a good aroma.

462
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,930
For you.

463
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,810
Director.

464
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:23,304
I really have to see Su-oh.
Isn't there any way you can help?

465
00:34:24,516 --> 00:34:28,283
It's like I said yesterday. This is a
special request from the police chief.

466
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:30,250
So I don't think I can.

467
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,838
Or...

468
00:34:33,816 --> 00:34:37,716
Is there some other reason why
you've visited twice to ask this?

469
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:50,203
It's cute, isn't it?

470
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:52,743
I turned out the lights
to leave yesterday...

471
00:34:52,744 --> 00:34:54,769
...and I noticed
something sparkling.

472
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,470
That's how I found it.

473
00:34:57,471 --> 00:34:59,489
I'm not sure who left it there.

474
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,290
I think it fell off my clothes.

475
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:06,323
I have the same
sticker on my drawer.

476
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:08,323
Is that so?

477
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:11,690
You live in the same
village as Su-oh, don't you?

478
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,119
Yes, Mucheon Village.

479
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,820
I live on the 2nd floor of
the chicken soup restaurant.

480
00:35:17,456 --> 00:35:19,214
Mucheon Garden.

481
00:35:20,002 --> 00:35:21,569
So that's where you live.

482
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,030
Yes.

483
00:35:25,227 --> 00:35:26,327
So Director,

484
00:35:26,327 --> 00:35:30,261
please contact me when
you go to Su-oh's hospital.

485
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:45,807
Doc, do you know we've
met 14 times already?

486
00:35:46,694 --> 00:35:47,967
I told you I add a
glow in the dark sticker...

487
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:49,894
...every time we meet.

488
00:35:51,194 --> 00:35:52,061
Yes.

489
00:35:52,061 --> 00:35:53,527
Sleep tight, Doc.

490
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:03,230
SOMEONE SAW YOU KILLING ME

491
00:36:10,304 --> 00:36:11,504
Hello.

492
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:16,219
Ms. Ha Seol!

493
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:18,511
Director?

494
00:36:25,844 --> 00:36:29,315
Why are you trying
to meet Su-oh?

495
00:36:30,011 --> 00:36:34,144
Well... I'm worried about him, and
I have something to ask him too.

496
00:36:39,036 --> 00:36:41,069
Are you free in the evening?

497
00:36:42,011 --> 00:36:43,844
You mean tonight?

498
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:46,811
Oh, hey. Okay.

499
00:36:46,811 --> 00:36:49,709
I'm not taking Jeong-woo's side.

500
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:53,311
Yeah. I feel bad
for Bo-yeong too.

501
00:36:53,683 --> 00:36:55,924
Yeah. Okay.

502
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:58,124
Sorry. Bye.

503
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:04,620
I can't even bring
it up with the others.

504
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:09,129
Maybe you shouldn't contact
our homeroom teacher either.

505
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,717
I'll take care of it.

506
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:14,311
Okay, okay.

507
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:16,611
Yeah. Bye.

508
00:37:20,897 --> 00:37:23,940
See? I told you they'd say no.

509
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:25,848
Don't worry.

510
00:37:26,303 --> 00:37:28,234
I have a way.

511
00:37:29,411 --> 00:37:31,311
A way to help Jeong-woo.

512
00:37:41,038 --> 00:37:43,975
Sir, I'll head home after I
meet with the bereaved family.

513
00:37:43,976 --> 00:37:45,409
Okay.

514
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:50,915
- Someone reported a robbery...
- We'll go check out the scene.

515
00:37:50,915 --> 00:37:52,181
Okay.

516
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:55,048
<i>There's no trace</i>
<i>of the victim...</i>

517
00:38:01,015 --> 00:38:02,881
I'm home.

518
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:04,615
You're here, Son. Did you eat?

519
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,682
Oh, I'm hungry, Mom.

520
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:08,148
- Min-su, you're here. Come have a seat.
- Yeah, come here.

521
00:38:08,148 --> 00:38:09,815
I'll bring you rice.
Sit down and eat.

522
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:11,548
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

523
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:14,915
Eat this.

524
00:38:26,688 --> 00:38:29,821
Bo-yeong used to love meat.

525
00:38:36,295 --> 00:38:38,114
You're having a tough
time these days, aren't you?

526
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:40,948
Of course he is. He's
dying on the inside.

527
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:44,155
Hey, hey, Min-su.

528
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:50,061
When did you say
you last saw Bo-yeong?

529
00:38:50,281 --> 00:38:52,015
So...

530
00:38:52,015 --> 00:38:53,748
Why didn't you hang out
with Bo-yeong that day?

531
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,381
You guys always used
to hang out together.

532
00:38:57,381 --> 00:38:59,548
Why are you bothering my son?

533
00:39:00,248 --> 00:39:02,381
I just find it strange.

534
00:39:02,615 --> 00:39:07,464
Hye-yeong said that
Bo-yeong didn't come home.

535
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,771
Then...

536
00:39:10,648 --> 00:39:12,198
Where was she? And
what was she doing?

537
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,151
That's normal for kids
going through puberty.

538
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:15,881
She was probably alone
in the corner somewhere.

539
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,457
- Here, have another drink.
- Wait a second.

540
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,015
Drink up.

541
00:39:21,016 --> 00:39:22,449
But you...

542
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,391
When did you see her that day?

543
00:39:24,391 --> 00:39:25,791
He said he doesn't know.

544
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:27,791
Why do you keep bothering
him when he's trying to eat?

545
00:39:27,792 --> 00:39:30,717
Damn it.

546
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:33,437
- Dig in.
- Okay.

547
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,744
Su-oh!

548
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:46,796
Geon-oh?

549
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:49,226
Are you really Geon-oh?

550
00:39:49,226 --> 00:39:52,259
Yes. Have you been well?

551
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,779
What brings you to my house?

552
00:39:58,126 --> 00:39:59,532
Just...

553
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:06,598
Oh, no!

554
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:08,926
Oh, that's hot.

555
00:40:08,926 --> 00:40:12,342
Byeong-mu must have
become a police officer.

556
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,210
Yeah.

557
00:40:14,292 --> 00:40:15,959
He passed the exam.

558
00:40:15,959 --> 00:40:17,959
He passed...

559
00:40:22,374 --> 00:40:24,259
What a shameless bastard.

560
00:40:24,792 --> 00:40:26,092
What?

561
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:28,246
What did you just say?

562
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:31,136
Can I see Byeong-mu if
I go to the police station?

563
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,936
Why do you want
to see Byeong-mu?

564
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:34,669
He's my friend.

565
00:40:35,336 --> 00:40:38,302
It's been 10 years, so I
should see his face at least.

566
00:40:40,369 --> 00:40:42,336
He might not be
at the police station.

567
00:40:42,336 --> 00:40:44,436
He's often out investigating...

568
00:40:45,336 --> 00:40:47,877
Should I call emergency
services instead?

569
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:51,802
Mister, let me borrow your
phone so I can call him.

570
00:40:52,102 --> 00:40:54,602
No, no. I'll do it.

571
00:40:59,736 --> 00:41:01,569
I really don't know anything.

572
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:03,394
Ma'am.

573
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,336
Shim Bo-yeong was found.

574
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:10,069
You were her homeroom
teacher, weren't you?

575
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,663
Bo-yeong was just
an ordinary student.

576
00:41:14,664 --> 00:41:17,381
No, wait, ma'am.

577
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:18,862
Just one thing.

578
00:41:18,863 --> 00:41:20,463
Park Da-eun...

579
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:23,964
...was Goh Jeong-woo's
girlfriend at the time, right?

580
00:41:24,908 --> 00:41:27,475
Da-eun was a transfer student,

581
00:41:27,941 --> 00:41:31,008
and I only remember
that she was very pretty.

582
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,236
It hasn't been that long.

583
00:41:36,236 --> 00:41:38,036
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

584
00:41:38,036 --> 00:41:39,895
- Thank you.
- Bye.

585
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:48,605
That guy.

586
00:41:48,629 --> 00:41:50,592
Ma'am, ma'am.

587
00:41:55,735 --> 00:41:57,302
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

588
00:41:58,269 --> 00:41:59,836
I'm really sorry.

589
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:02,402
But please let me just
ask a few questions.

590
00:42:02,402 --> 00:42:04,178
It's been 10 years,

591
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:06,736
but whenever I
think of Bo-yeong,

592
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:09,282
it gets too hard for me.

593
00:42:10,989 --> 00:42:12,562
Did you ever...

594
00:42:15,015 --> 00:42:19,249
...see Bo-yeong hang out
with other kids besides us?

595
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:22,155
Did you find anything
that belongs to Bo-yeong...

596
00:42:22,462 --> 00:42:25,629
...in her locker since that
day? That's all I want to ask.

597
00:42:27,555 --> 00:42:28,755
I don't know.

598
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,089
I told you I don't know.

599
00:42:32,488 --> 00:42:35,084
Jeong-woo, don't do this.

600
00:42:35,749 --> 00:42:37,253
I...

601
00:42:37,862 --> 00:42:39,329
I've forgotten everything.

602
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,382
I want to forget.

603
00:42:52,702 --> 00:42:54,037
Hey.

604
00:42:54,095 --> 00:42:56,716
You're a funny little
bastard, aren't you?

605
00:42:57,669 --> 00:42:59,436
Why on earth would
you come here?

606
00:42:59,436 --> 00:43:01,602
I can't work out who
Bo-yeong and Da-eun...

607
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:04,302
...were with that afternoon,
or where they went.

608
00:43:04,536 --> 00:43:07,069
- Bo-yeong was in the warehouse...
- Are you a detective?

609
00:43:07,069 --> 00:43:09,902
Are you here to do an
investigation? Are you?

610
00:43:12,241 --> 00:43:14,341
I'm here for the same
reason you're here.

611
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:16,801
No,

612
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:19,804
don't follow me around,
and just ask the police chief.

613
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,538
Take it up with him.

614
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,478
I'll take care of
the investigation.

615
00:43:26,836 --> 00:43:28,269
You said...

616
00:43:30,862 --> 00:43:32,528
...you're not the killer.

617
00:43:38,835 --> 00:43:41,045
There's no time. No time.

618
00:43:46,728 --> 00:43:49,168
- <i>Yes, Dad.</i>
- Byeong-mu.

619
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:51,064
<i>Dad, I'm at Mucheon Garden.</i>

620
00:43:51,236 --> 00:43:53,102
<i>Why? Should I go home?</i>

621
00:43:53,102 --> 00:43:54,402
No, no.

622
00:43:54,402 --> 00:43:56,787
I'll go there, yes.

623
00:43:58,302 --> 00:44:00,436
Byeong-mu must be
at Mucheon Garden?

624
00:44:00,436 --> 00:44:01,402
No, no.

625
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:02,702
Hey...

626
00:44:03,055 --> 00:44:05,755
Did you drink? Drink a lot?

627
00:44:06,369 --> 00:44:07,704
Where are you going?

628
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:09,402
Geon-oh?

629
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:11,420
Hey, Geon-oh.

630
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:12,855
Geon-oh!

631
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,823
How did you come together?

632
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,824
I met him out front
after a consultation.

633
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:26,058
Byeong-mu, come
here. Have a drink.

634
00:44:26,058 --> 00:44:27,658
I'm working right now.

635
00:44:28,824 --> 00:44:32,058
Would you like a
warm cup of tea?

636
00:44:34,457 --> 00:44:36,172
He's got something to say.

637
00:44:40,348 --> 00:44:42,212
It's about Bo-yeong, right?

638
00:44:42,427 --> 00:44:43,673
Yes.

639
00:44:43,784 --> 00:44:45,684
The report must be out.

640
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:47,802
Hurry up and tell us.

641
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,337
You can speed
up the funeral now.

642
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:55,870
The National Forensic Service
released the results today.

643
00:44:55,871 --> 00:44:57,471
It's as you expected.

644
00:44:59,724 --> 00:45:02,865
I knew it, Jeong-woo,
that bastard.

645
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:08,170
There's a lot to
organize for the funeral.

646
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:11,595
I'll contact our
mutual aid society.

647
00:45:12,511 --> 00:45:13,876
Thanks, Chu-ho.

648
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,410
Don't mention it.

649
00:45:16,419 --> 00:45:18,670
Hey, where's your father?

650
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,337
He called me not long
ago saying he's on his way.

651
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:22,870
Okay, good.

652
00:45:23,404 --> 00:45:24,737
There he is.

653
00:45:26,859 --> 00:45:27,899
Let's go.

654
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:28,936
What's going on?

655
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:29,970
Let's go right now.

656
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,277
Why? What's going on?

657
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:34,285
What?

658
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:41,064
MUCHEON GARDEN

659
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:53,215
Why?

660
00:45:57,437 --> 00:45:59,054
Oh, my. Look who it is.

661
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:01,223
Isn't that Geon-oh?

662
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:03,537
It is Geon-oh!

663
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:06,870
Have you all been well?

664
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,670
Oh, yes. How long has it been?

665
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,970
You should visit
home more often.

666
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:13,504
Yeah!

667
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:16,171
You've always been
good at startling people.

668
00:46:16,172 --> 00:46:17,972
Have you been well?

669
00:46:27,304 --> 00:46:28,937
Looks like he's had a drink too.

670
00:46:28,937 --> 00:46:31,004
Yeah? That's good.

671
00:46:31,345 --> 00:46:34,037
It's been so long. Come
here, let me pour you a drink.

672
00:46:34,037 --> 00:46:35,304
Okay.

673
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,224
You punk.

674
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:44,056
Here.

675
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:45,191
Thank you.

676
00:46:49,044 --> 00:46:51,010
Hey, Geon-oh! It's been so long.

677
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:53,098
It's been so long since
we saw each other.

678
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:54,264
Is it okay if we drink alone?

679
00:46:54,265 --> 00:46:57,068
Sure, you young guys
should have a drink...

680
00:47:04,411 --> 00:47:08,211
It's okay if I
drink here, right?

681
00:47:09,831 --> 00:47:11,334
Yes, of course.

682
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:12,804
Let me pour you one.

683
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:14,317
All right.

684
00:47:16,671 --> 00:47:17,937
Geon-oh.

685
00:47:17,937 --> 00:47:19,937
Let's all hang out together.

686
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,237
You know Deok-mi, right?

687
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:22,637
She's become a
really famous actress.

688
00:47:22,637 --> 00:47:25,682
Now that Jeong-woo is out of
prison, we should get together and...

689
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:28,170
have fun...

690
00:47:34,131 --> 00:47:35,660
How have you...

691
00:47:36,131 --> 00:47:38,454
...been this whole time?

692
00:47:38,624 --> 00:47:40,041
Me?

693
00:47:40,104 --> 00:47:42,671
I'm fine, as you can see.

694
00:47:43,744 --> 00:47:46,610
I got some money,
but I don't feel at peace.

695
00:47:48,771 --> 00:47:51,104
You shouldn't say
that in front of the kids.

696
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:54,897
I'm sorry.

697
00:47:56,844 --> 00:48:00,610
I should have come sooner.

698
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,403
What do you mean?

699
00:48:06,757 --> 00:48:08,691
What do you think?

700
00:48:08,975 --> 00:48:12,137
Didn't he come back from the
U.S. after hearing about Bo-yeong?

701
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:13,678
Yes, yes.

702
00:48:49,123 --> 00:48:50,482
I...

703
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:55,723
I'll get going now.

704
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:58,127
Geez. He's really drunk.

705
00:48:58,128 --> 00:48:59,537
Hey, hey.

706
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:01,304
We'll take care of
him, so don't worry.

707
00:49:01,304 --> 00:49:01,937
Oh, right.

708
00:49:01,937 --> 00:49:03,671
- I'm sorry.
- Let's go.

709
00:49:03,671 --> 00:49:04,604
Min-su.

710
00:49:04,604 --> 00:49:06,583
- Dad, don't worry about him.
- I'm sorry.

711
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:07,951
You punk.

712
00:49:08,544 --> 00:49:10,788
How did he get so drunk?

713
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,223
- Geon-oh, let's go.
- I'm sorry.

714
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:14,346
- Let's go.
- That's okay.

715
00:49:14,347 --> 00:49:16,447
- Nothing wrong with getting drunk.
- Let go.

716
00:49:19,264 --> 00:49:20,457
Damn it.

717
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,225
- Why did you drink so much?
- Let me go.

718
00:49:23,343 --> 00:49:24,679
Don't touch me.

719
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:33,431
Hey, Hyeon Geon-oh.

720
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:36,493
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

721
00:49:36,893 --> 00:49:38,461
So you've become a cop?

722
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:41,260
And you've become a nurse?

723
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,560
Yeah...

724
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:47,426
You've all achieved your dreams.

725
00:49:48,393 --> 00:49:49,751
So... what...

726
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,661
Should I applaud you?

727
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,593
You must be really drunk.

728
00:49:57,593 --> 00:50:00,093
When else will you ride in a
police car? I'll give you a ride.

729
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:00,950
Damn.

730
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:02,851
- Let's go.
- Don't touch me.

731
00:50:05,013 --> 00:50:07,893
Geon-oh, take the car.

732
00:50:12,162 --> 00:50:13,477
Oh, yeah.

733
00:50:16,573 --> 00:50:21,054
I brought back some
gifts for you two.

734
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:25,232
But I forgot to bring
them out today.

735
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,084
Just wait a while.

736
00:50:29,085 --> 00:50:31,075
I'll deliver them to you soon.

737
00:50:44,633 --> 00:50:47,157
You guys are
acting strange today.

738
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:52,557
I need to empty my bladder.

739
00:50:52,558 --> 00:50:54,461
Let's have a serious talk after.

740
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,334
There's no need
to worry, all right?

741
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:13,170
For us...

742
00:51:14,225 --> 00:51:16,807
It's the same back
then as it is now.

743
00:51:18,191 --> 00:51:20,277
We don't know anything.

744
00:51:27,758 --> 00:51:29,880
<i>Hyeon Geon-oh</i>
<i>can't get a ticket.</i>

745
00:51:30,225 --> 00:51:34,356
<i>He's forbidden from leaving the</i>
<i>country for dealing psychoactive drugs.</i>

746
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:40,257
I understand.

747
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:27,356
I've got something
to tell you, Uncle.

748
00:52:30,325 --> 00:52:31,591
Jeong-woo.

749
00:52:31,591 --> 00:52:33,258
This isn't a place where you can...

750
00:52:33,258 --> 00:52:35,581
...just barge in
whenever you feel like.

751
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,358
I'm busy. I have to go out.

752
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:39,876
Let's talk later.

753
00:52:40,458 --> 00:52:41,690
Uncle.

754
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,891
Bo-yeong met with someone
other than me on that day.

755
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:49,946
Please help me.

756
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,084
Yes.

757
00:53:09,718 --> 00:53:11,397
About Goh Jeong-woo...

758
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:14,173
No.

759
00:53:14,197 --> 00:53:16,930
Bring in all the files we have on
the Mucheon Missing Body Murder.

760
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:19,176
Yes, all of it.

761
00:53:19,525 --> 00:53:20,842
Right now.

762
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:35,491
This is all that we have
left since it's a closed case.

763
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,925
The victim's side testimonies
and the rest of the files...

764
00:53:37,925 --> 00:53:39,949
...are with the prosecutors.

765
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:45,558
Now, listen up.

766
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:47,040
This is the last time.

767
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:52,758
These photos are evidence
of you being drunk that night.

768
00:53:55,275 --> 00:53:56,458
And this...

769
00:53:56,458 --> 00:53:59,663
...is the monkey spanner with
Park Da-eun's blood stains.

770
00:53:59,897 --> 00:54:02,799
This murder weapon was discovered
in the trashcan in your house.

771
00:54:04,784 --> 00:54:08,900
This is the evidence that the corpse
was disposed of using your car.

772
00:54:16,377 --> 00:54:18,532
Must you really do this?

773
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:20,134
Huh?

774
00:54:20,158 --> 00:54:21,532
Jeong-woo.

775
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:25,858
You doing this right now
is deceiving your friends...

776
00:54:26,191 --> 00:54:28,558
Your mother who waited
for you for 10 years...

777
00:54:28,558 --> 00:54:30,660
And even me.

778
00:54:34,764 --> 00:54:36,497
This is so strange, Uncle.

779
00:54:36,791 --> 00:54:39,225
I don't remember any of this.

780
00:54:39,758 --> 00:54:41,658
The only thing I
remember is this.

781
00:54:41,658 --> 00:54:43,512
The photo of my room.

782
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:47,191
You've been saying the
same thing for 10 years now.

783
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:48,558
Do you know that?

784
00:54:50,691 --> 00:54:52,145
All right.

785
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:53,813
Here.

786
00:54:55,078 --> 00:54:56,479
Your shoes.

787
00:54:56,758 --> 00:54:59,209
Your shoes caked
with blood and mud.

788
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:03,158
Park Da-eun and Shim Bo-yeong's
blood stains were found on your shoes.

789
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:04,868
And as for this mud,

790
00:55:05,383 --> 00:55:07,698
it rained very
heavily that night.

791
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:10,750
So this is the evidence
that you went outside.

792
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:19,590
Now, if we put
all of this together,

793
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:23,940
the person who killed and disposed
of Shim Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun...

794
00:55:24,938 --> 00:55:26,313
...is you.

795
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:28,582
Do you get it?

796
00:55:30,658 --> 00:55:32,132
Let's stop now.

797
00:55:40,411 --> 00:55:44,325
My mom bought me these
shoes in 2008 for my birthday.

798
00:55:45,831 --> 00:55:49,042
But I've never worn them before
because they were too small.

799
00:55:51,064 --> 00:55:52,426
Uncle.

800
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,871
What if all this
was to fall apart?

801
00:55:54,991 --> 00:55:56,825
What if I find new evidence?

802
00:55:56,825 --> 00:55:57,525
Jeong-woo.

803
00:55:57,525 --> 00:55:59,858
Bo-yeong carried around a
purple backpack for 3 years.

804
00:55:59,858 --> 00:56:01,883
So why hasn't it been found yet?

805
00:56:02,558 --> 00:56:03,925
Why does nobody know...

806
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:06,725
...where Bo-yeong went,

807
00:56:06,725 --> 00:56:08,614
and who she was with, Uncle?

808
00:56:11,344 --> 00:56:12,744
That night...

809
00:56:14,931 --> 00:56:17,256
What were Geon-oh
and Su-oh doing?

810
00:56:19,819 --> 00:56:20,859
Why you!

811
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,191
Chief, are you really going to
put up with this crazy nonsense?

812
00:56:24,191 --> 00:56:25,584
Hey, get out!

813
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:28,651
Get out, you bastard! Get out!

814
00:56:29,326 --> 00:56:31,023
Answer me. Please answer me.

815
00:56:31,024 --> 00:56:33,687
- Get out, you bastard!
- Uncle!

816
00:56:48,425 --> 00:56:50,404
You're still here, Detective.

817
00:56:51,291 --> 00:56:55,224
I don't have anything more to
say about Bo-yeong or Da-eun.

818
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,025
I understand.

819
00:56:57,025 --> 00:57:01,338
But I thought you might have
something to say about Goh Jeong-woo.

820
00:57:10,271 --> 00:57:14,023
Rumors travel fast in Mucheon.

821
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:19,537
I hope nobody knows
that I met with Jeong-woo.

822
00:57:20,704 --> 00:57:22,230
I understand, ma'am.

823
00:57:23,878 --> 00:57:27,666
So what was Goh
Jeong-woo like as a student?

824
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:31,266
Jeong-woo...

825
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,824
was a very good boy, at
least the Jeong-woo I knew.

826
00:57:35,624 --> 00:57:37,693
But seeing Jeong-woo today...

827
00:57:38,699 --> 00:57:42,739
...made me feel hate, pity,
anger and sorrow for him.

828
00:57:51,966 --> 00:57:55,250
What was his relationship
with Shim Bo-yeong?

829
00:57:58,512 --> 00:58:02,412
They were best friends
that grew up together.

830
00:58:03,759 --> 00:58:06,575
Bo-yeong's family
was impoverished.

831
00:58:06,955 --> 00:58:09,845
But whenever she came to
school, she smiled so much.

832
00:58:09,846 --> 00:58:12,822
And it was Jeong-woo who
helped her smile like that.

833
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:17,072
He paid for her
lunches and her books.

834
00:58:19,635 --> 00:58:21,588
Oh...

835
00:58:22,866 --> 00:58:27,090
You must have been shocked
after hearing about the case.

836
00:58:27,729 --> 00:58:29,033
Yes.

837
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:33,015
Even after I heard
Jeong-woo was the killer,

838
00:58:34,538 --> 00:58:36,437
I actually didn't believe it.

839
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:46,414
Get in.

840
01:00:14,405 --> 01:00:15,820
Geon-oh.

841
01:00:17,866 --> 01:00:19,347
Jeong-woo.

842
01:00:23,066 --> 01:00:24,612
I heard you went to the U.S.?

843
01:00:24,613 --> 01:00:25,925
When did you get back?

844
01:00:26,885 --> 01:00:28,408
I came back to see you.

845
01:00:36,025 --> 01:00:37,637
It's good to see you.

846
01:00:41,753 --> 01:00:43,103
Have you been well?

847
01:00:44,381 --> 01:00:45,391
Yeah...

848
01:00:45,392 --> 01:00:46,848
Let's see your face.

849
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:52,202
You haven't changed.

850
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:55,945
Jeong-woo...

851
01:01:05,179 --> 01:01:06,481
Are you all right?

852
01:01:08,072 --> 01:01:10,039
Yes, I'm all right.

853
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,066
What did he find in here?

854
01:01:48,001 --> 01:01:49,165
Yes.

855
01:01:49,166 --> 01:01:50,942
We need to find Geon-oh.

856
01:01:52,066 --> 01:01:53,589
Right now.

857
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:56,835
I'll get you some water.

858
01:01:57,312 --> 01:01:58,642
Jeong-woo...

859
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:04,065
Jeong-woo...

860
01:02:04,325 --> 01:02:06,227
Jeong-woo, forgive me.

861
01:02:06,528 --> 01:02:09,129
I should have come back sooner.

862
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:11,435
I was too late, Jeong-woo.

863
01:02:11,436 --> 01:02:13,365
I'm so sorry.

864
01:02:13,366 --> 01:02:15,432
I didn't know you
were living like this.

865
01:02:15,432 --> 01:02:16,794
Jeong-woo...

866
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:19,408
Geon-oh.

867
01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:23,190
What did you do wrong?

868
01:02:24,671 --> 01:02:26,090
Hyeon Geon-oh.

869
01:02:43,735 --> 01:02:45,091
It can't be anything
serious, can it?

870
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:47,810
Can't you tell if Gu-tak
that jerk actually called us?

871
01:02:47,811 --> 01:02:49,346
Something bad has happened.

872
01:02:49,713 --> 01:02:51,616
Let's go to
Jeong-woo's house first.

873
01:02:51,617 --> 01:02:53,365
We'll find out
when we get there.

874
01:02:53,366 --> 01:02:55,099
Darn it.

875
01:03:17,966 --> 01:03:19,834
Geon-oh, did you...

876
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,401
Did you kill Bo-yeong?

877
01:03:26,899 --> 01:03:28,400
That's not true, is it?

878
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:30,932
Tell me, did you kill Bo-yeong?

879
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,817
No... No... That's not it.

880
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:36,508
Did you kill Bo-yeong?

881
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:18,651
BLACK OUT
SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

882
01:04:19,486 --> 01:04:21,027
<i>Why did you kill Bo-yeong?</i>

883
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:23,107
<i>Why did you kill Bo-yeong?</i>

884
01:04:23,108 --> 01:04:24,872
<i>He won't give up on</i>
<i>reopening this case.</i>

885
01:04:24,873 --> 01:04:26,060
<i>It was an accident!</i>

886
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,157
<i>How many times do I have</i>
<i>to tell you it was an accident!</i>

887
01:04:28,483 --> 01:04:30,400
<i>I'm going to turn myself in.</i>

888
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,046
<i>You saw the</i>
<i>video in here, right?</i>

889
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:34,612
<i>The suspect you've</i>
<i>been so desperate to find...</i>

890
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:37,495
<i>You scared? Are you scared?</i>
