00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,273
<i>- Chief.</i>
<i>- What is it?</i>

5
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:17,674
<i>We got the real culprit</i>
<i>behind the overpass case.</i>

6
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:18,215
<i>What?</i>

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,341
<i>It's Shim Bo-yeong's father.</i>
<i>The girl that Goh Jeong-woo killed.</i>

8
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,445
<i>Why did you do that to my mom?</i>

9
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:23,285
<i>Then what about you?</i>

10
00:00:23,285 --> 00:00:24,749
<i>Why did you do</i>
<i>that to my Bo-yeong?</i>

11
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:28,141
<i>If Dong-min gets</i>
<i>arrested, Jeong-woo will...</i>

12
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,431
<i>...try to settle down</i>
<i>here with his mom.</i>

13
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:32,566
<i>It wasn't me who killed her.</i>

14
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:34,860
<i>I cannot live with</i>
<i>that murderer.</i>

15
00:00:34,884 --> 00:00:37,140
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>
<i>But where did you get that bone?</i>

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,265
<i>They found Bo-yeong.</i>

17
00:00:38,289 --> 00:00:40,387
<i>Where's my daughter?</i>

18
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,662
<i>Bo-yeong, it's your mom.</i>

19
00:00:43,686 --> 00:00:46,409
<i>Thank you for finding</i>
<i>me, Jeong-woo.</i>

20
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,540
<i>You made Goh Jeong-woo confess</i>
<i>to get a reduced sentence, didn't you?</i>

21
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,926
<i>Why do your words feel so sharp?</i>

22
00:00:53,146 --> 00:00:54,122
<i>What's with your face?</i>

23
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:54,625
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO

24
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:55,931
<i>Is something going on?</i>

25
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,829
<i>Su-oh painted</i>
<i>something so grotesque.</i>

26
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,265
<i>Leave.</i>

27
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:03,050
<i>Su-oh! Su-oh, what's going on?</i>

28
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:06,937
<i>It was here.</i>

29
00:01:07,577 --> 00:01:09,226
<i>This is where my car was parked.</i>

30
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:10,731
<i>- I fought with Bo-yeong here.</i>
<i>- Hey, you!</i>

31
00:01:10,755 --> 00:01:14,109
<i>The victim was a</i>
<i>19-year-old student at the time.</i>

32
00:01:14,138 --> 00:01:16,819
<i>So didn't she have any</i>
<i>accessories or a backpack?</i>

33
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,202
<i>Oh, right...</i>
<i>She was missing underwear.</i>

34
00:01:19,226 --> 00:01:20,509
<i>Park Da-eun.</i>

35
00:01:20,964 --> 00:01:22,130
<i>Well, how about</i>
<i>we get some drinks?</i>

36
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:24,295
<i>Is that because you</i>
<i>go through a black out?</i>

37
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:25,721
<i>Why do you keep</i>
<i>talking down to me, punk?</i>

38
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:27,497
<i>That's how I speak</i>
<i>to all criminal scum.</i>

39
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,233
<i>Get lost!</i>

40
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:29,718
<i>why do you keep staying here</i>
<i>when you're treated like this?</i>

41
00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:31,232
<i>You vermin!</i>
<i>You're not even human!</i>

42
00:01:31,232 --> 00:01:32,110
<i>Leave with me.</i>

43
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,092
<i>- I can't leave.</i>
- Why?

44
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:36,391
<i>I won't leave</i>
<i>until I find Da-eun.</i>

45
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,309
<i>How far away</i>
<i>did you bury Park Da-eun, huh?</i>

46
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,276
<i>Did you throw her</i>
<i>away in another village?</i>

47
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,029
<i>Can you really not remember...</i>

48
00:01:43,053 --> 00:01:45,209
<i>...or are you pretending not to?</i>

49
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:45,856
<i>Or...</i>

50
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,013
<i>I definitely didn't kill them.</i>

51
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,640
<i>It wasn't Jeong-woo.</i>

52
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:51,016
<i>Does Goh Jeong-woo</i>
<i>really have black outs?</i>

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,054
<i>I wasn't here when it happened.</i>

54
00:01:54,371 --> 00:01:56,404
Jeong-woo, come and eat.

55
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:57,771
I'm not hungry.

56
00:01:59,471 --> 00:02:00,404
Come and eat.

57
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:01,678
I'm not hungry.

58
00:02:02,737 --> 00:02:04,613
Fine then.

59
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:07,337
But I did make your favorite
seaweed soup and rib patties.

60
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:08,871
I guess I'll just
have to throw it out.

61
00:02:08,871 --> 00:02:12,371
Come on, Mom. That's cheating.

62
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:13,649
Get up.

63
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:20,235
Why did your dad have
to buy you a car already?

64
00:02:20,271 --> 00:02:22,341
I won't drive it anywhere,
I'm just going to look at it.

65
00:02:22,341 --> 00:02:24,437
It's parked right in front
of the warehouse there.

66
00:02:24,437 --> 00:02:25,792
Go and look at it all you like.

67
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:29,837
Mom, cars need to be
driven to be looked at.

68
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:31,115
No.

69
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:32,671
They must be
driven to be looked at.

70
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,046
No, you can't drive it.

71
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:37,104
- I'm not hungry.
- Huh?

72
00:02:37,104 --> 00:02:39,071
- Seriously.
- Hey.

73
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:43,871
- Hey, hey.
- What's your weak point?

74
00:02:43,871 --> 00:02:45,071
- Mom, I apologize.
- Hey, stop.

75
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,289
- No, no.
- Mom.

76
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,447
Hey, hey, you.

77
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:49,380
I really won't drive
it, I won't drive it.

78
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:53,829
Jeong-woo, promise me you'll
only look at it! You shouldn't drive it.

79
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:39,109
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

80
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:43,983
What are you playing at?

81
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,135
Why are you pretending
like you can't remember?

82
00:03:50,557 --> 00:03:52,895
You saw Bo-yeong...

83
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,182
...for the last
time in this house.

84
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,635
Just lie down.

85
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,637
- I told you to lie down...
- Geon-oh, Su-oh.

86
00:04:03,637 --> 00:04:06,104
I don't know if it's okay
for me to be this happy.

87
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:09,635
Mom?

88
00:04:13,063 --> 00:04:14,063
Um...

89
00:04:18,346 --> 00:04:19,582
Disgusting.

90
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:21,578
Bo-yeong!

91
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,435
Gu-tak.

92
00:04:31,737 --> 00:04:33,035
What's wrong?

93
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:36,292
Bo-yeong...

94
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,432
...was killed by us.

95
00:04:41,743 --> 00:04:43,235
On that day.

96
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:46,361
She said she was going to play
with the kids at Jeong-woo's house.

97
00:04:47,406 --> 00:04:48,640
Had she done that...

98
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,815
We wouldn't have gotten
caught, isn't that right?

99
00:04:53,435 --> 00:04:57,280
What would have happened
if I had run after Bo-yeong?

100
00:05:14,931 --> 00:05:16,365
It's all in the past now.

101
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,246
It's not for me.

102
00:05:20,346 --> 00:05:21,275
Jae-hee.

103
00:05:24,455 --> 00:05:25,714
Why did you barge in here?

104
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:27,441
Why are you bringing
this up all of a sudden?

105
00:05:29,609 --> 00:05:30,875
Bo-yeong's dad.

106
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,482
Release him.

107
00:05:44,084 --> 00:05:45,151
I can't do that.

108
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,755
Even if I am the police chief,

109
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:50,351
I can't release someone
when they've already confessed.

110
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:52,995
I can't.

111
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,132
Get going.

112
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,176
If you don't release
my husband...

113
00:06:04,312 --> 00:06:05,912
...you'll find out
what I'm capable of.

114
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:12,649
I'll show you just how fast
word can spread in our village.

115
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,227
Anyone who could drive...

116
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,039
...could take my
car at any time.

117
00:06:38,422 --> 00:06:39,795
The car keys...

118
00:06:40,185 --> 00:06:41,883
...were always in the toolbox.

119
00:06:44,012 --> 00:06:45,714
Gosh.

120
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:50,255
Now that the body has
been identified as your friend,

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,275
you must be quite upset.

122
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:52,818
Isn't that right?

123
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,835
It's in times like these
that you must focus harder.

124
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,635
We have to find Park Da-eun.

125
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,521
Right.

126
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,235
<i>Da-eun...</i>

127
00:07:03,124 --> 00:07:06,774
...I'm going to kill you,
so shut your mouth.

128
00:07:08,152 --> 00:07:11,447
Like this, like this, like this.

129
00:07:11,447 --> 00:07:14,282
Like this! Like this!

130
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,238
That's how I killed her, right?

131
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,395
But I didn't kill them.

132
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:23,200
I definitely didn't kill them.

133
00:07:25,247 --> 00:07:27,357
You've lived in Mucheon
a long time, right?

134
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,085
Yes, I was born here.

135
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:33,254
Then how long would it take...

136
00:07:33,254 --> 00:07:36,070
...to drive from
Mucheon to Cheonsu?

137
00:07:36,605 --> 00:07:39,218
I'm not sure. How
long would it take?

138
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:42,531
There aren't any detours
and it's a rural road.

139
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:44,905
So you could only
go at 20 to 30km/hr...

140
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,413
So maybe 15 minutes?

141
00:07:48,518 --> 00:07:50,395
Early this morning,

142
00:07:50,499 --> 00:07:52,902
you drove your car
to the warehouse.

143
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,285
Oh, yes. That's right.

144
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,075
I drove, didn't I?

145
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:58,635
Gosh.

146
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,925
I drank on an empty
stomach so I'm really out of it.

147
00:08:03,293 --> 00:08:04,839
Gosh.

148
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:12,155
Right, you couldn't be
in your right mind now.

149
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:13,507
I'm sorry, Byeong-mu.

150
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,990
Not at all, sir.

151
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:18,723
I'll help in whichever way
I can. Please just tell me.

152
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,221
- All right.
- Yes.

153
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,063
<i>The farthest it could go</i>
<i>was the abandoned school.</i>

154
00:09:01,449 --> 00:09:03,869
So many weird things
are happening these days.

155
00:09:04,597 --> 00:09:06,098
And what's up with Su-oh?

156
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,673
What are you painting?

157
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:28,312
Bring me the paintings.

158
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:31,285
The kids used to stack
hay on the big tractor...

159
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,452
...and play on it all the time.

160
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,371
Su-oh saw everything.

161
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,169
It wasn't Jeong-woo.

162
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,074
Su-oh is the witness.

163
00:10:59,122 --> 00:11:02,675
VACANT

164
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:05,202
Cheonsu Village, please.

165
00:11:12,086 --> 00:11:13,215
Sir.

166
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,101
Oh, thank you, thank you.

167
00:11:15,101 --> 00:11:15,940
What are you doing?

168
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,399
I made a copy of the
witness statement file.

169
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,674
Oh.

170
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,521
<i>I think it was just</i>
<i>before 11 p.m.</i>

171
00:11:26,197 --> 00:11:28,240
<i>Anyway, it was around then.</i>

172
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:31,756
I was getting off the bus...

173
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,154
- Is this the last bus?
- Yes.

174
00:11:41,473 --> 00:11:44,974
<i>Jeong-woo's car was headed</i>
<i>in the opposite direction.</i>

175
00:11:46,344 --> 00:11:48,416
But why...

176
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,573
<i>Are you sure that the car</i>
<i>belonged to Goh Jeong-woo?</i>

177
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:53,794
<i>I'm sure.</i>

178
00:11:54,364 --> 00:11:59,102
<i>I've seen the car parked in front</i>
<i>of the warehouse all the time.</i>

179
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,532
My son was so
jealous of that car.

180
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:10,848
<i>Goh Jeong-woo's car was seen...</i>

181
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:12,264
SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS

182
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:14,489
<i>...at around 10:58 p.m.</i>

183
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:21,962
<i>From the bus stop to</i>
<i>the abandoned school...</i>

184
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:23,097
CHEONSU ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

185
00:12:23,097 --> 00:12:24,656
<i>...is around 15 minutes.</i>

186
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,757
<i>He would've arrived at Cheonsu</i>
<i>Village at around 11:13 p.m.</i>

187
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:41,634
It was 11:13 p.m.

188
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:04,715
<i>No matter how fast Goh</i>
<i>Jeong-woo hid the body...</i>

189
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:11,164
<i>It would have taken</i>
<i>at least 10 minutes...</i>

190
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:13,968
<i>...to carry a body</i>
<i>over 50kg by himself...</i>

191
00:13:15,603 --> 00:13:17,237
<i>...from the car trunk</i>
<i>to the manhole.</i>

192
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:27,006
<i>The body was left in the manhole</i>
<i>between 11:20 and 11:30 p.m.</i>

193
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,864
HE RETURNED TO THE
WAREHOUSE AROUND 11:30 P.M.

194
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:31,930
HE ASSAULTED PARK DA-EUN AT
AROUND 11:35 P.M. AND KILLED HER

195
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:43,273
<i>Da-eun said that she</i>
<i>was with her boyfriend.</i>

196
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,165
<i>When I called her,</i>

197
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:47,833
<i>I could hear his voice.</i>

198
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,033
<i>I thought the call had ended...</i>

199
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,989
But then suddenly,

200
00:13:53,777 --> 00:13:56,578
<i>I heard Da-eun screaming.</i>

201
00:13:56,578 --> 00:14:00,678
<i>Park Da-eun's grandmother's</i>
<i>call record shows it was 11:30 p.m.</i>

202
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:05,932
<i>Goh Jeong-woo could not have</i>
<i>returned to the warehouse by then...</i>

203
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:08,927
<i>Yet she heard his voice?</i>

204
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,109
<i>That doesn't make sense.</i>

205
00:14:27,274 --> 00:14:30,832
I went to the
warehouse around 10:30.

206
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,056
And?

207
00:14:32,608 --> 00:14:35,451
I met with Da-eun at 11:30.

208
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,610
<i>No matter how fast Goh Jeong-woo</i>
<i>got back to the warehouse,</i>

209
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:53,713
<i>it had to have been</i>
<i>around 11:50 p.m.</i>

210
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,878
<i>Park Da-eun was</i>
<i>already dead by then.</i>

211
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:08,512
PARK DA-EUN'S CORPSE
DISPOSED OF IN THE MUCHEON AREA

212
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:11,039
<i>That's it!</i>

213
00:15:11,922 --> 00:15:13,788
<i>The two murders could not</i>
<i>have occurred at the same time!</i>

214
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,220
Where are you going?

215
00:15:19,325 --> 00:15:22,492
Darn it, this case
is over already!

216
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,574
What are you doing here? Huh?

217
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,734
Why did you come here?

218
00:17:05,581 --> 00:17:07,286
Did you find anything?

219
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:13,585
Bo-yeong...

220
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:16,637
Who could've killed her?

221
00:17:19,352 --> 00:17:22,164
Da-eun died at the same time
Bo-yeong's body was hidden.

222
00:17:22,164 --> 00:17:25,594
Unless I have two bodies,
this is physically impossible.

223
00:17:25,956 --> 00:17:28,722
I put gas in my car
a total of five times.

224
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:30,297
Every time it was
exactly $10 worth.

225
00:17:31,456 --> 00:17:32,756
Bo-yeong's killer knew...

226
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:34,357
...that the abandoned
school could be reached...

227
00:17:34,357 --> 00:17:36,322
...without refueling the car.

228
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,022
They must be around the village.

229
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,234
Stop.

230
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,956
You're severely
misunderstanding something.

231
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:48,433
Just because
there are two killers...

232
00:17:48,457 --> 00:17:50,871
...doesn't exempt you
from being one of them.

233
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,122
Accomplice!

234
00:17:54,183 --> 00:17:55,504
You're right.

235
00:17:57,404 --> 00:17:59,004
Maybe I did kill her.

236
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:05,138
So I tried to kill myself.

237
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:07,946
But it's not that easy.

238
00:18:09,592 --> 00:18:11,725
That's why I reflected
on myself for 10 years...

239
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:15,198
...and did everything I could to
try and recall at least a trace...

240
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:17,806
...of a memory that
proved I didn't do it.

241
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:20,422
That's how I persevered.

242
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:21,813
However...

243
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,851
I told you I don't trust
the words of criminals.

244
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:30,698
I don't believe them either.

245
00:18:31,356 --> 00:18:34,856
Shameless bastards who only give excuses
in the face of their heinous crimes.

246
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:38,063
They always say it wasn't them.
They always say they didn't kill anyone.

247
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:41,400
Even in your eyes...

248
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,556
You must see me as
vermin just like them.

249
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:46,837
That's right. You're
vermin to me.

250
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,570
- I didn't kill them!
- Wait a minute!

251
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:55,474
Oh... So... You were here...

252
00:18:56,736 --> 00:19:00,014
The thing is... I've got
something to tell you.

253
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:03,144
- Me?
- Yes.

254
00:19:04,033 --> 00:19:06,166
I think I saw something.

255
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,256
What did you see?

256
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:45,189
Well, I think someone saw
everything that happened that day.

257
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:47,056
I think there's a witness.

258
00:19:47,747 --> 00:19:49,314
A witness?

259
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:53,494
Well...

260
00:19:54,156 --> 00:19:55,605
The thing is...

261
00:19:55,605 --> 00:20:00,522
I saw a painting with a
person bleeding out here.

262
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,701
A painting?

263
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,022
By any chance,
did Su-oh paint it?

264
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,225
Su-oh?

265
00:20:06,879 --> 00:20:08,914
Do you mean Hyeon Su-oh?

266
00:20:09,726 --> 00:20:10,998
Yes.

267
00:20:11,022 --> 00:20:13,757
Su-oh made a painting...

268
00:20:13,757 --> 00:20:16,489
...that seemed like he
was here that day.

269
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:19,008
Wait, you do know
Hyeon Su-oh suffers...

270
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:21,422
...from a neurological
disorder, right?

271
00:20:21,422 --> 00:20:24,351
He's the only one
that wasn't interviewed...

272
00:20:24,351 --> 00:20:26,656
...because his testimony
wasn't credible.

273
00:20:26,656 --> 00:20:28,589
But a painting?

274
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:30,056
It's not even a photo or video?

275
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,545
How can a painting be evidence?

276
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:34,283
It could obviously
be his imagination.

277
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:36,456
And isn't he in the
hospital as we speak?

278
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:38,562
But just in case.

279
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:39,630
Forget it.

280
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,728
Let's just go.
Where do you live?

281
00:20:41,728 --> 00:20:42,989
I'll take you home.

282
00:20:42,989 --> 00:20:45,295
I can make my own way, thanks.

283
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:47,028
Just get out of here.

284
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:57,836
How'd he ever become a detective
when he doesn't hear anyone out?

285
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:04,478
You'll never catch a
cab all the way out here.

286
00:21:04,502 --> 00:21:07,947
I'll go and get Su-oh's
painting, so just stay put.

287
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:22,624
Su-oh...

288
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,215
Yes, I brought him here myself,
so you needn't worry too much.

289
00:21:29,215 --> 00:21:30,997
He'll get better soon.

290
00:21:30,997 --> 00:21:32,472
Okay, thank you.

291
00:21:33,432 --> 00:21:35,207
Yes, I'll leave it
to you, Director.

292
00:21:35,207 --> 00:21:36,677
Yes, thank you.

293
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,222
<i>Just because</i>
<i>there are two killers...</i>

294
00:22:00,422 --> 00:22:02,722
<i>...doesn't exempt you</i>
<i>from being one of them.</i>

295
00:22:03,381 --> 00:22:06,003
<i>I finally found a clue...</i>

296
00:22:06,003 --> 00:22:07,308
<i>Accomplice?</i>

297
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:09,534
<i>An accomplice?</i>

298
00:22:09,534 --> 00:22:13,927
<i>Goh Jeong-woo, you are under arrest</i>
<i>for the murder and unlawful disposal...</i>

299
00:22:13,927 --> 00:22:15,473
<i>...of Shim Bo-yeong</i>
<i>and Park Da-eun.</i>

300
00:22:15,473 --> 00:22:17,479
<i>The accused is</i>
<i>sentenced to 10 years.</i>

301
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:19,416
Please say something!

302
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:21,249
Bring Mom here!

303
00:22:42,657 --> 00:22:44,882
The moment you became a killer,

304
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:47,082
you stopped being my son.

305
00:22:49,876 --> 00:22:51,359
Your mom, Jeong Geum-hee...

306
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:52,740
It was because of you.

307
00:22:52,764 --> 00:22:55,322
You have no right
to blame anyone.

308
00:22:55,322 --> 00:22:57,296
What is it that you want?

309
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,394
What do you want?

310
00:22:58,394 --> 00:23:01,042
I want you to die
like my daughter!

311
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:04,745
If you just disappear,
nothing will go wrong.

312
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:10,322
Shoot!

313
00:23:11,177 --> 00:23:12,890
Shoot me!

314
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,413
I've been begging for 10 years...

315
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:17,712
<i>...to let me find</i>
<i>Bo-yeong and Da-eun.</i>

316
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:20,603
If you keep waiting, you'll
get at least one chance.

317
00:23:20,627 --> 00:23:23,339
And when you do, you
go all the way to the end.

318
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,758
Mom.

319
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:40,567
Do you remember
what Dad used to say?

320
00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:48,842
To go all the way to the end.

321
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,948
No matter what happens...

322
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,786
To go all the way.

323
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:17,771
I'm going all the
way to the end.

324
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:24,032
CHUNGJU WEEDAHM
INTEGRATIVE HOSPITAL

325
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:55,399
Sorry.

326
00:24:57,169 --> 00:24:58,536
Mom...

327
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:02,536
She went for a check-up.

328
00:25:02,536 --> 00:25:04,572
They said it'll take
around 3 hours.

329
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:07,520
You didn't go back to Seoul?

330
00:25:22,495 --> 00:25:25,328
I'm okay. You can leave.

331
00:25:38,775 --> 00:25:40,427
I need to wash.

332
00:25:52,783 --> 00:25:55,108
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

333
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:58,713
Thank you for taking part
in the witness interviews.

334
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,996
It was nothing.

335
00:26:01,996 --> 00:26:03,711
Bo-yeong's dad is
the one that's suffering.

336
00:26:04,456 --> 00:26:07,593
I heard you were the one who
told him of the news about Bo-yeong.

337
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:09,856
And you even organized
this meeting for us.

338
00:26:09,856 --> 00:26:11,556
Thank you for everything.

339
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:13,521
I only did what I should.

340
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:17,058
You raised your son really well.

341
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:18,858
Gosh.

342
00:26:23,336 --> 00:26:24,902
Dong-min.

343
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:28,656
Hey, what happened to you?

344
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,956
I'll give you some privacy.

345
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:31,489
Thanks, Byeong-mu.

346
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,622
You've become so
haggard after just one day.

347
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,156
Geez, what is going on?

348
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:42,789
Even I'm feeling like this,
so how bad must it be for you.

349
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,037
I'm rotting on the inside.

350
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:47,022
Rotting to the core.

351
00:26:48,222 --> 00:26:50,756
I won't let that Jeong-woo
bastard get away with this.

352
00:26:52,556 --> 00:26:55,315
The thing is...

353
00:26:55,673 --> 00:26:57,568
...we have to hold the funeral.

354
00:26:57,856 --> 00:26:59,056
Yes, we must.

355
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:02,969
They have to do
more investigations...

356
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:06,069
...but we can hold the
funeral after the autopsy.

357
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:10,461
I'll get you released
no matter what today.

358
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:12,709
So don't worry.

359
00:27:13,449 --> 00:27:14,883
And how will you do that?

360
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:18,256
Even the congresswoman
couldn't do it. So how could you?

361
00:27:18,256 --> 00:27:20,022
She's not just my daughter,
she's my late daughter.

362
00:27:20,022 --> 00:27:21,701
So what couldn't I do?

363
00:27:21,701 --> 00:27:22,961
Damn it.

364
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:24,722
Did you go and
cause trouble again?

365
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,890
You're the one
who caused trouble!

366
00:27:27,129 --> 00:27:29,114
This isn't the time to
be locked up in here!

367
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:31,939
Are you really going to
face Bo-yeong in that state?

368
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:34,489
What?

369
00:27:34,489 --> 00:27:35,689
You going to hit me?

370
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:40,622
Are you trembling all over from
holding it in for the past 10 years?

371
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:41,989
Just try and hit me.

372
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:44,422
You will never see me
or Hye-yeong ever again!

373
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:46,489
Why are you two being like this?

374
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,023
This is for Bo-yeong.

375
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:52,485
Just think about
our late Bo-yeong!

376
00:27:58,432 --> 00:28:00,186
Try doing as much as I do!

377
00:28:00,528 --> 00:28:03,956
I won't let my daughter's
killer get away with it!

378
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,483
Hey, darn it!

379
00:28:13,175 --> 00:28:14,591
Jeong-woo...

380
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,713
Where were you yesterday?

381
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:23,339
Did something come up?

382
00:28:26,515 --> 00:28:29,715
If you're having a hard
time, you can tell me.

383
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:41,071
We're friends.

384
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:43,572
I want to be friends with you.

385
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:47,073
I thought about it and I
think that's much better.

386
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,953
Let's just...

387
00:28:51,622 --> 00:28:55,481
...be friends for life.

388
00:29:20,974 --> 00:29:23,618
Yes? Yes, thank you.

389
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:26,085
Yes, I'll be right there. Bye.

390
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:40,256
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS, WE'RE CLOSED
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE - MUCHEON GARDEN

391
00:29:46,122 --> 00:29:47,322
Hello.

392
00:30:01,689 --> 00:30:04,389
I know, right? The
neighborhood is in a sorry state.

393
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:06,956
- It's a terrible time.
- I'm here.

394
00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:08,856
Oh, have a seat.

395
00:30:09,956 --> 00:30:11,222
Do you want some coffee?

396
00:30:11,222 --> 00:30:12,856
No, no. I'm all right.

397
00:30:16,143 --> 00:30:18,485
Where Bo-yeong was found...

398
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:21,269
...wasn't even that far away.

399
00:30:25,102 --> 00:30:27,235
And yet we couldn't find it.

400
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:29,291
Geez.

401
00:30:31,552 --> 00:30:33,482
We haven't slept at all...

402
00:30:33,506 --> 00:30:36,984
...since Bo-yeong's
remains were found.

403
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,798
Bo-yeong's family
is going through a lot.

404
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:42,555
When can we hold the funeral?

405
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:45,956
You can do it as soon as
we get the autopsy report...

406
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:48,518
...from the NFS, so
don't worry too much.

407
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:50,058
How can we not worry?

408
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,401
It's not like this is
about some strangers.

409
00:30:51,425 --> 00:30:52,886
This is Bo-yeong's
family we're talking about.

410
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,456
We should do what we can.

411
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:58,217
I stormed into
Jeong-woo's house...

412
00:30:58,241 --> 00:31:00,168
...with the locals yesterday.

413
00:31:00,168 --> 00:31:03,592
That bastard is so shameless.

414
00:31:03,592 --> 00:31:04,625
Geez.

415
00:31:04,625 --> 00:31:06,556
You wasted your time.

416
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:11,892
Please stop taking
matters into your own hands.

417
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:13,296
Okay.

418
00:31:13,296 --> 00:31:14,255
Okay?

419
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:15,455
Okay.

420
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,841
I'll deal with
Jeong-woo as well,

421
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,889
so just don't do
anything from now on.

422
00:31:23,357 --> 00:31:24,916
Okay, okay.

423
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,240
Okay.

424
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:30,121
Oh, and about your part-timer...

425
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,989
PRIVATE NUMBER: YOU
KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...

426
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:39,224
Yes.

427
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,222
Hello.

428
00:31:43,451 --> 00:31:45,143
Oh, welcome.

429
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,134
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

430
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:52,242
Thank you for
making time like this.

431
00:31:53,505 --> 00:31:56,872
You're a friend of Su-oh.
Of course I'll make time.

432
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:00,823
He did get transferred
to another hospital, right?

433
00:32:04,145 --> 00:32:05,478
Well...

434
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:09,110
Su-oh's not in the
best state right now.

435
00:32:09,134 --> 00:32:12,206
He's continuing to have anxiety
attacks so it's a bit dangerous.

436
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,071
We decided it'd
be best for him...

437
00:32:13,071 --> 00:32:14,935
...to get intensive treatment
at a specialist hospital.

438
00:32:15,114 --> 00:32:18,014
Can I visit him?

439
00:32:18,014 --> 00:32:19,747
There's something I
need to speak to him about.

440
00:32:19,747 --> 00:32:22,160
I can't allow that without
permission from his father.

441
00:32:22,486 --> 00:32:23,715
However,

442
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,643
I can relay anything
you want to say to him.

443
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:27,615
Oh, the thing is...

444
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,275
I have to ask him myself.

445
00:32:31,342 --> 00:32:32,994
Oh, is that so?

446
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:38,360
Once his condition becomes more
stable, I'll tell him to contact you.

447
00:32:38,762 --> 00:32:40,782
Okay. Thank you.

448
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:42,885
Yes. Take care.

449
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,814
MUCHEON SARANG HOSPITAL

450
00:33:13,484 --> 00:33:16,918
Min-su said he doesn't
know when he can make it.

451
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:18,373
So let's start without him.

452
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,781
This looks good.

453
00:33:28,996 --> 00:33:30,285
Jeong-woo.

454
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,179
I trust you.

455
00:33:33,776 --> 00:33:35,823
I trust everything you say.

456
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,638
I think I understand why
you want to clear your name.

457
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,988
I would feel the same way.

458
00:33:45,302 --> 00:33:48,662
I just want you
to be at peace...

459
00:33:49,815 --> 00:33:53,946
...and enjoy your life with your
mother. That's all I wanted.

460
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:56,511
I'm sorry.

461
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,962
Let me help.

462
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:01,426
Bo-yeong and Da-eun
were my friends too.

463
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:05,124
I got close to you
and the other guys...

464
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:07,226
...all thanks to Da-eun.

465
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:10,464
Let me help.

466
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,835
Thanks.

467
00:34:14,041 --> 00:34:16,241
Once you clear your name...

468
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:20,133
Once you catch the real killer,

469
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,960
let's take mother...

470
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:24,568
...and move to Seoul.

471
00:34:25,217 --> 00:34:26,618
Once it's all over.

472
00:34:29,217 --> 00:34:30,952
Once Mom wakes back up.

473
00:34:32,694 --> 00:34:35,210
I never planned
to stay in Mucheon.

474
00:34:36,022 --> 00:34:37,431
Also, Deok-mi...

475
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:40,526
...I went back to the
abandoned school.

476
00:34:43,523 --> 00:34:45,548
Bo-yeong was left at
the abandoned school...

477
00:34:45,548 --> 00:34:47,846
...at the same time Da-eun was
murdered at the warehouse.

478
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:49,559
They occurred at the same time.

479
00:34:50,749 --> 00:34:51,657
That means...

480
00:34:51,681 --> 00:34:53,915
Even if I did commit
all those acts,

481
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:55,962
the investigation was wrong.

482
00:34:58,337 --> 00:35:00,971
Can they reopen the case?

483
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,355
I'll ask at the police station.

484
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,654
Then let me come with you.

485
00:35:04,678 --> 00:35:05,957
I'll drive you there.

486
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,148
No. I prefer to go by myself.

487
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:10,965
Let's eat.

488
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,477
Su-oh?

489
00:35:42,281 --> 00:35:44,423
I thought he was at
a different hospital.

490
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:01,665
It takes about 15 minutes
traveling at 20km/hr.

491
00:37:01,689 --> 00:37:04,097
It's estimated that
Shim Bo-yeong's body...

492
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,866
...was disposed of at 11:28 p.m.

493
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:11,358
And it's estimated that Park
Da-eun was murdered at 11:30 p.m.

494
00:37:11,382 --> 00:37:15,016
Which means there's
an error in the timeline...

495
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,337
Hey! Turn the lights on!

496
00:37:20,449 --> 00:37:22,206
Are you freaking
out of your mind?

497
00:37:22,398 --> 00:37:23,822
An error in the timeline?

498
00:37:23,846 --> 00:37:26,859
Is this the first time you've heard a
witness statement that's not perfect?

499
00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:29,926
Then what about the suspect
armed with a knife a few days ago?

500
00:37:29,926 --> 00:37:33,059
Some said he was wearing
white, some said grey or black.

501
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:35,559
They mentioned
every possible color!

502
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,392
- Well...
- Then in that case,

503
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:39,359
was that an error
in their vision?

504
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,292
How do you not know this?

505
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:44,459
You can't trust everything
that witnesses say!

506
00:37:44,459 --> 00:37:45,659
Yes, Section Chief.

507
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:48,568
I know exactly
what you mean, sir.

508
00:37:48,592 --> 00:37:51,513
But it seems like
this case is different.

509
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:55,372
As you know, the time of
the last bus wouldn't change.

510
00:37:55,396 --> 00:37:58,868
And we have a clear record
of Park Da-eun's call time.

511
00:37:58,892 --> 00:37:59,659
This...

512
00:37:59,659 --> 00:38:02,557
Yes, you've got a point there.

513
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:07,574
We could have missed
something. Right?

514
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:11,609
But the thing is,
it's not enough.

515
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,548
Unless there's new evidence...

516
00:38:13,572 --> 00:38:15,944
You know it's impossible
to reopen the case.

517
00:38:17,792 --> 00:38:19,326
Yes, sir.

518
00:38:19,326 --> 00:38:23,126
It seems impossible
that Goh Jeong-woo...

519
00:38:23,126 --> 00:38:25,063
...committed the
murders all on his own.

520
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:28,835
So I think this might prove...

521
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:31,024
...that he had an accomplice...

522
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:33,426
An accomplice?

523
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:35,345
Okay, so let's say
there's an accomplice.

524
00:38:36,112 --> 00:38:37,512
How will you find them?

525
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:39,692
How am I supposed
to support you...

526
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,548
...when you have no
conclusive evidence?

527
00:38:42,802 --> 00:38:43,975
Do I just trust you...

528
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:46,150
...and put the entire Violent
Crimes 2nd unit on it?

529
00:38:46,174 --> 00:38:48,111
Then what about costs for
the investigation and vehicles?

530
00:38:48,135 --> 00:38:50,068
What about our backlogged cases?

531
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,712
But still...

532
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:57,028
I thought the most important thing
was to find Park Da-eun's body.

533
00:38:57,052 --> 00:38:59,004
- Team Head Noh.
- Yes, sir.

534
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:01,577
We searched for 10 years
because it was important.

535
00:39:02,462 --> 00:39:03,462
Huh?

536
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:05,379
What if we can't find it?

537
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:07,919
Will you be held responsible?

538
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:12,052
Well...

539
00:39:12,677 --> 00:39:13,733
Sir.

540
00:39:13,757 --> 00:39:16,968
I can't let my team waste
its time on a closed case.

541
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:19,402
All right.

542
00:39:19,426 --> 00:39:20,726
Get out, all of you!

543
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:22,883
Why are you wasting
your time on this?

544
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:38,634
Timeline error?

545
00:39:38,919 --> 00:39:41,061
What a load of nonsense.

546
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,614
But isn't Team Head
Noh really strange?

547
00:39:43,638 --> 00:39:45,268
Even if the remains were found,

548
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,126
why bring back a case
that's been solved?

549
00:39:47,126 --> 00:39:49,759
And why did the police
chief get involved?

550
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:52,626
He was in charge of
the case back then.

551
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:55,977
He even got a special promotion
for solving it. Why would he reopen it?

552
00:39:56,426 --> 00:39:58,559
There's no way
they'll reopen the case.

553
00:40:00,826 --> 00:40:02,526
Sir, please reconsider...

554
00:40:02,526 --> 00:40:03,692
Look, that's enough.

555
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:06,392
- I just need the minimum manpower...
- That's enough!

556
00:40:06,392 --> 00:40:07,683
Uncle.

557
00:40:08,404 --> 00:40:09,589
Goh Jeong-woo!

558
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,326
How dare you come
in here, you punk!

559
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,346
There's proof I
wasn't at the scene.

560
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:17,139
There's an error with my alibi.

561
00:40:17,399 --> 00:40:18,989
So you should reopen the case.

562
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:21,759
- How dare you order me around!
- Stop, Jeong-woo.

563
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:23,391
Jeong-woo!

564
00:40:24,793 --> 00:40:26,813
Go home. I'll call you.

565
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,548
Uncle.

566
00:40:29,944 --> 00:40:32,385
For the sake of
Da-eun and Bo-yeong...

567
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:35,789
...please reopen the case.

568
00:40:39,898 --> 00:40:41,231
Come to my office.

569
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:47,644
Wait...

570
00:40:48,908 --> 00:40:50,226
Damn!

571
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,048
What is wrong with you? Huh?

572
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:01,148
I've been living like an empty
husk for the past 10 years.

573
00:41:01,148 --> 00:41:03,714
I received death
threats every single day.

574
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,648
I was condemned for
killing my friends, killing girls,

575
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:09,414
killing my girlfriend.

576
00:41:09,414 --> 00:41:12,181
I was beaten like a dog, and
yet I persevered. But Uncle...

577
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,557
That's why I told you that
this time is very important.

578
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:18,998
- If you live an honest life...
- For me to live an honest life, Uncle!

579
00:41:23,374 --> 00:41:25,065
When Mom wakes up

580
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,949
I want to greet
her with a smile.

581
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:29,859
In order to do
that, I must know.

582
00:41:30,328 --> 00:41:31,085
What?

583
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:33,477
Why they killed
Bo-yeong and Da-eun.

584
00:41:33,477 --> 00:41:34,865
Who killed them.

585
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,989
- And how they killed them...
- Jeong-woo!

586
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:39,750
What are you even talking about?

587
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:41,356
Are you saying I
made you into a criminal...

588
00:41:41,356 --> 00:41:42,473
...because I didn't
investigate properly?

589
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:43,427
Uncle, 10 years ago...

590
00:41:43,427 --> 00:41:46,109
Are you saying the police
conspired to make you a criminal?

591
00:41:51,113 --> 00:41:52,192
Right.

592
00:41:52,216 --> 00:41:54,807
The fact that you served
your sentence and got released...

593
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:59,107
...means that you have already
been punished for your crimes,

594
00:41:59,107 --> 00:42:01,762
but that doesn't mean
the case has disappeared.

595
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:05,273
It doesn't mean that
your crime is erased.

596
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:09,575
Where were you 10 years
ago during my interrogation?

597
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:12,407
Even when for the
scene inspection...

598
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:13,887
Jeong-woo!

599
00:42:15,287 --> 00:42:16,887
I'm your uncle...

600
00:42:17,383 --> 00:42:18,729
No...

601
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,671
I'm your father's best friend.

602
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:25,732
So I will do whatever
I can to help you.

603
00:42:25,973 --> 00:42:29,607
But I can't erase the
crime that you committed.

604
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,624
Jeong-woo...

605
00:43:02,132 --> 00:43:04,132
<i>Release Bo-yeong's dad.</i>

606
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:06,553
<i>This is your last warning.</i>

607
00:43:07,779 --> 00:43:09,249
Isn't it so strange?

608
00:43:09,273 --> 00:43:12,273
You should never
touch a closed case.

609
00:43:12,273 --> 00:43:14,483
An error is just an error.

610
00:43:14,507 --> 00:43:18,973
I don't want to get involved in
something the police chief is against.

611
00:43:19,495 --> 00:43:20,362
FATHER-IN-LAW

612
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,040
Huh?

613
00:43:27,801 --> 00:43:29,852
- Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

614
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:35,888
Hello?

615
00:43:35,912 --> 00:43:37,613
That's his father-in-law.

616
00:43:37,637 --> 00:43:38,983
Our team head is married?

617
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,115
I thought his
wedding got canceled.

618
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:41,515
Yes, I understand.

619
00:43:50,713 --> 00:43:52,514
Sir, are you married?

620
00:43:52,538 --> 00:43:55,938
I thought you were a bachelor
because you look so young.

621
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,603
Actually...

622
00:44:06,526 --> 00:44:09,189
The day after tomorrow is the
anniversary of my wife's passing.

623
00:44:09,705 --> 00:44:11,148
My father-in-law said...

624
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,140
...not to come by anymore.

625
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,474
Oh...

626
00:44:20,033 --> 00:44:21,933
I'm heading home.

627
00:44:25,217 --> 00:44:27,498
- Oh, Jeong-woo.
- Wait.

628
00:44:28,172 --> 00:44:29,806
There's something
I must tell you.

629
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:54,049
Is this alcohol?

630
00:44:54,288 --> 00:44:55,271
Yes.

631
00:44:55,295 --> 00:44:58,897
Just like we used
in the old times.

632
00:44:58,921 --> 00:45:00,018
Right.

633
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:03,726
And smoking too,
right? Like old times?

634
00:45:06,479 --> 00:45:07,912
What do you even do?

635
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,907
I'm the section chief.

636
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:12,540
Right, you're the section chief.

637
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,340
What were you doing while they
were serving drinks and smoking...

638
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,673
...in the interrogation room?

639
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,140
Well, the thing is...

640
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:20,273
Don't you know
how the world works?

641
00:45:20,706 --> 00:45:22,973
Think about the
times we're living in.

642
00:45:23,615 --> 00:45:25,240
Are you really going to pass
this on to the prosecutors?

643
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:27,865
Well, the thing is...

644
00:45:27,865 --> 00:45:31,666
He made a confession and an
application was made for a warrant.

645
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:32,866
Hee-do!

646
00:45:34,179 --> 00:45:35,209
So?

647
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:36,781
Should I call the
prosecutor myself?

648
00:45:36,781 --> 00:45:38,853
Oh, no, no.

649
00:45:38,853 --> 00:45:40,753
I will. I'll do it.

650
00:45:41,873 --> 00:45:43,640
Geez.

651
00:45:54,073 --> 00:45:57,340
HYEON GU-TAK

652
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:04,651
Hello?

653
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,324
You called, so speak.

654
00:46:12,408 --> 00:46:16,208
I can't believe the
lengths I'll go to for you.

655
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:20,944
He's been released,
so don't worry.

656
00:46:21,582 --> 00:46:22,782
Jae-hee.

657
00:46:23,653 --> 00:46:24,886
Hang up.

658
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:41,558
Dad's coming.

659
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,899
Just wait a little longer.

660
00:46:47,651 --> 00:46:49,751
Jeong-woo that bastard.

661
00:46:54,295 --> 00:46:55,863
Chu-ho, where are you?

662
00:46:55,887 --> 00:46:57,484
I just got released.

663
00:46:57,587 --> 00:46:59,887
No, no. I'll go
to the restaurant.

664
00:47:00,361 --> 00:47:02,362
Wait, Chu-ho.

665
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:04,987
You know that guy.

666
00:47:05,011 --> 00:47:07,745
The one who catches pheasants.

667
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,446
Do you know if
he still hunts them?

668
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:14,714
Yes, sure. Let's
go hunt a pheasant.

669
00:47:14,738 --> 00:47:15,872
Pheasant?

670
00:47:15,896 --> 00:47:17,896
This is no time to
go pheasant hunting!

671
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:19,916
What will you do about Ha Seol?

672
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,208
Must you fire her?

673
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:23,483
Do I really have
to repeat myself?

674
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,539
We don't even have enough customers.
What's the point in having a part-timer?

675
00:47:26,539 --> 00:47:28,240
Will she work for free?

676
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,207
And that's what
Gu-tak said to do.

677
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:34,627
Fine. There's no
need to get worked up.

678
00:47:37,093 --> 00:47:38,579
How strange.

679
00:47:39,152 --> 00:47:40,971
Why is the chief of police...

680
00:47:40,971 --> 00:47:42,905
...getting involved in
something so trivial?

681
00:47:43,143 --> 00:47:44,662
Oh, my legs.

682
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,763
How much did we walk today?

683
00:47:46,787 --> 00:47:48,826
It was around 12,000 steps.

684
00:47:48,826 --> 00:47:52,159
Wow. I won't need to
exercise today, right?

685
00:47:52,159 --> 00:47:53,459
Yes, ma'am.

686
00:47:53,459 --> 00:47:54,992
Did you book the restaurant?

687
00:47:54,992 --> 00:47:57,959
Yes. I booked
your preferred table.

688
00:47:57,959 --> 00:47:59,326
Okay.

689
00:48:00,092 --> 00:48:03,203
I wonder where my
director is about now.

690
00:48:10,794 --> 00:48:12,659
Oh, hello.

691
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:15,159
- Can I take a selfie with you?
- Sure.

692
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:19,092
- Thank you. You're so pretty.
- Enjoy your meal.

693
00:48:19,092 --> 00:48:20,692
Can I please shake your hand?

694
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:21,526
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

695
00:48:21,526 --> 00:48:23,526
- Enjoy your meal. Thank you.
- You're so beautiful.

696
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:26,842
I hope you have
a lovely evening.

697
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,074
The director will
be arriving soon.

698
00:48:32,098 --> 00:48:33,866
I'll be in the car. Please
call me if you need anything.

699
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:35,266
Okay. Thanks.

700
00:48:39,692 --> 00:48:41,074
Hello.

701
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,510
All the best!

702
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,902
There's a window table
that's become available.

703
00:48:50,926 --> 00:48:52,162
Should I move her to that table?

704
00:48:52,186 --> 00:48:54,031
No, she prefers that one.

705
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:55,589
That attracts more attention.

706
00:48:55,613 --> 00:48:56,747
Sorry?

707
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,470
Nothing. Take care.

708
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:08,414
I can't think straight.

709
00:49:09,355 --> 00:49:10,569
Chu-ho,

710
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:12,892
don't just stand there and call him
again to see when he's getting here.

711
00:49:12,892 --> 00:49:14,359
I must have it.

712
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:16,859
Hey. I called him
five minutes ago.

713
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:18,592
I'll call again in five.

714
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,500
Let's not do this.

715
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:28,290
We shouldn't do this.

716
00:49:28,651 --> 00:49:29,849
Stay out of it.

717
00:49:30,618 --> 00:49:31,952
Yeah, you stay out.

718
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:36,332
Jeong-woo, that bastard.
I'm going to kill him.

719
00:49:37,025 --> 00:49:39,498
How dare he abandon
Bo-yeong in a place like that?

720
00:49:45,165 --> 00:49:48,708
We'll take care of
this, so just go home.

721
00:50:00,492 --> 00:50:03,359
Come on, Jeong-woo.
Why are you being like this?

722
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,759
- I need to tell him something.
- Like what? Just tell me.

723
00:50:06,759 --> 00:50:08,261
Can you...

724
00:50:08,726 --> 00:50:10,035
...help reopen the case?

725
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:12,232
Of course I can help. Of course.

726
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:16,959
But neither the section chief
nor the police chief wants to do it.

727
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:21,287
Geez. Give me a minute.

728
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,458
Yeah, Dad. Why
do you keep calling?

729
00:50:25,873 --> 00:50:26,873
Huh?

730
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,149
Okay.

731
00:50:29,979 --> 00:50:30,959
Hey, I'm sorry.

732
00:50:30,959 --> 00:50:32,459
My dad seems to be unwell.

733
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:33,809
I have to go home.

734
00:50:34,951 --> 00:50:38,351
You've got this to figure out
and you've got your mom as well.

735
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:40,351
So just go home
and get some rest.

736
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:43,171
Get some sleep, okay?

737
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:04,974
Do you like me?

738
00:51:05,733 --> 00:51:07,633
Why do you keep
following me around?

739
00:51:08,226 --> 00:51:10,693
You agree that the case
needs to be reopened, right?

740
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,473
Reopened?

741
00:51:13,399 --> 00:51:15,099
Yeah, we should.

742
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,649
Right.

743
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:22,286
Let's go over everything
from the beginning.

744
00:51:23,153 --> 00:51:25,300
You say you never went
to the abandoned school.

745
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,973
You just happened to go because
she happened to tell you about it,

746
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:29,740
and you happened
to find the body.

747
00:51:30,305 --> 00:51:31,725
As for the proof you
weren't at the scene...

748
00:51:31,749 --> 00:51:33,282
Fine, I accept that.

749
00:51:33,306 --> 00:51:37,188
But even if I accept
and believe all of that,

750
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:41,077
it only shows you didn't
dispose of Shim Bo-yeong's body.

751
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:43,230
It's not proof that
you didn't kill her.

752
00:51:43,254 --> 00:51:44,362
Isn't that right?

753
00:51:44,649 --> 00:51:46,749
I only want to reopen the case...

754
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:49,640
...to catch your accomplice who

755
00:51:50,361 --> 00:51:52,849
disposed of Shim Bo-yeong's body...

756
00:51:52,873 --> 00:51:55,020
...while you were
killing Park Da-eun.

757
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:58,711
So don't act all innocent
and think I'm on your side.

758
00:51:58,986 --> 00:52:00,354
I can't stand it!

759
00:52:00,378 --> 00:52:02,245
I don't want anything else.

760
00:52:02,269 --> 00:52:04,549
You just have to
catch that accomplice.

761
00:52:04,573 --> 00:52:07,278
The accomplice
must know everything.

762
00:52:07,302 --> 00:52:08,969
Da-eun wasn't at the
abandoned school.

763
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,294
Just as you say, we
must find Da-eun as well.

764
00:52:11,318 --> 00:52:12,584
Yes, we must.

765
00:52:14,077 --> 00:52:16,386
Let's be honest with each other.

766
00:52:25,446 --> 00:52:26,969
Goh Jeong-woo,

767
00:52:27,032 --> 00:52:30,532
when did you last
see Park Da-eun?

768
00:52:33,708 --> 00:52:34,908
Why?

769
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:38,227
You think you might
kill again if you drink?

770
00:52:38,251 --> 00:52:39,704
And forget everything again?

771
00:52:40,077 --> 00:52:42,043
You scumbag who
selectively blacks out.

772
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:46,251
On my way home on
the bus after school,

773
00:52:46,655 --> 00:52:48,755
I saw Da-eun out the window.

774
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,374
I was so happy to see
her that I called her.

775
00:52:52,398 --> 00:52:55,431
But she didn't pick up
and just kept walking.

776
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:58,661
I called her all day long but...

777
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:01,394
I couldn't get in
touch with her.

778
00:53:02,173 --> 00:53:04,406
I drove the car to the
warehouse to find her.

779
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:05,806
Yes, to be honest...

780
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:09,962
I was so angry.

781
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,640
At the time, there was a rumor going
around the school and my friends...

782
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,473
...was that Da-eun was
meeting someone else.

783
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:19,207
And that day,

784
00:53:21,642 --> 00:53:24,309
Bo-yeong and
Deok-mi told me as well.

785
00:53:26,839 --> 00:53:30,039
That time on the bus was
the last time I ever saw Da-eun.

786
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:38,588
Whether we reopen the case
or not, that's not up to you.

787
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:40,560
So just leave.

788
00:53:41,112 --> 00:53:42,112
Okay?

789
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,393
You're ruining the mood.

790
00:54:22,029 --> 00:54:23,463
I'm not asking
for anything more.

791
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:26,421
I just need to find the
accomplice that you mentioned.

792
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:39,796
Why does my honey
look so down today?

793
00:54:41,694 --> 00:54:43,360
It's because of Su-oh, right?

794
00:54:43,794 --> 00:54:45,129
Oh...

795
00:54:47,193 --> 00:54:50,510
It upsets me whenever
I think of Su-oh.

796
00:54:50,643 --> 00:54:52,357
I don't know what happened...

797
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:54,007
...but he's gotten so much worse.

798
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:57,609
He even acts hostile
towards me at times.

799
00:54:57,633 --> 00:54:58,948
What'll we do?

800
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:02,471
But then...

801
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:04,662
...seeing you makes
me feel much better.

802
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:08,930
I need to use the restroom.

803
00:55:16,637 --> 00:55:18,066
Director!

804
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,186
Oh, Yeo-jin.

805
00:55:20,895 --> 00:55:23,309
- Did you come here for dinner?
- Yes.

806
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:24,755
How are you feeling?

807
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:26,256
I'm much better now.

808
00:55:26,256 --> 00:55:27,680
Oh.

809
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:34,442
Where have you
been all this time?

810
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:37,028
Are you feeling sick?

811
00:55:37,028 --> 00:55:39,028
Why did you keep calling me?

812
00:55:42,538 --> 00:55:45,271
Wait, what? What are you doing?

813
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,805
Do you...

814
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:49,662
...have a gun?

815
00:55:51,656 --> 00:55:53,971
Guns aren't toys, Dad.

816
00:55:53,995 --> 00:55:56,783
We can't just carry them
around because we're cops.

817
00:55:56,807 --> 00:55:58,990
Seriously, why are
you being like this?

818
00:56:00,456 --> 00:56:01,656
I'm scared.

819
00:56:04,015 --> 00:56:05,671
I'm just scared.

820
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,328
Scared of what?

821
00:56:07,328 --> 00:56:08,928
What's scaring you?

822
00:56:10,649 --> 00:56:12,915
- Jeong-woo.
- What about Jeong-woo?

823
00:56:14,127 --> 00:56:15,527
He's going to die.

824
00:56:17,429 --> 00:56:21,128
What are you talking about?

825
00:56:21,128 --> 00:56:23,382
Gosh. Just get some rest.

826
00:56:23,382 --> 00:56:26,306
You got me worried for nothing.

827
00:56:35,444 --> 00:56:37,177
Who could it be at this hour?

828
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:41,628
YOU KILLED ME 11 YEARS AGO...
WHY DID YOU KILL ME 11 YEARS AGO?

829
00:57:30,472 --> 00:57:32,542
I'm sure it was Su-oh.

830
00:57:41,407 --> 00:57:42,628
Dong-min...

831
00:57:47,483 --> 00:57:48,776
Chu-ho,

832
00:57:49,828 --> 00:57:52,733
I haven't done
anything for Bo-yeong.

833
00:58:02,781 --> 00:58:06,672
He says this gun
isn't even registered.

834
00:58:07,286 --> 00:58:10,106
- It might be old, but it's clean...
- All right, darn it.

835
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:11,812
How many times
are you telling me?

836
00:58:14,062 --> 00:58:15,795
I don't even know if
this is the right thing.

837
00:58:15,795 --> 00:58:18,028
Dong-min, think it
through one more time.

838
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,242
Chu-ho...

839
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:21,844
Just make a good
alibi for me later.

840
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:27,281
- Dong-min...
- What?

841
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:29,521
Be careful.

842
00:58:30,462 --> 00:58:31,982
Just keep watch.

843
00:58:49,124 --> 00:58:51,818
What? He really
did get discharged.

844
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:01,129
What are you doing here?

845
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:03,117
I'm sorry for
coming over so late.

846
00:59:03,141 --> 00:59:05,008
But I just came to see Su-oh.

847
00:59:07,405 --> 00:59:09,206
You already know
Su-oh's in the hospital.

848
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:12,796
I think I saw Su-oh in town.

849
00:59:14,038 --> 00:59:15,306
You saw Su-oh?

850
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:17,496
And his room light is on.

851
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:23,456
What? It was on
just a second ago.

852
00:59:32,901 --> 00:59:34,232
There.

853
00:59:37,595 --> 00:59:38,890
Will that do?

854
00:59:39,067 --> 00:59:40,500
I'm sorry.

855
00:59:43,623 --> 00:59:46,026
You have quite the personality.

856
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,475
Let's go.

857
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,788
Father.

858
01:01:31,915 --> 01:01:33,740
How did you get released?

859
01:01:46,049 --> 01:01:49,582
Even a killer like you was
released after just 10 years.

860
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:54,249
So why would I get locked
up when there's no evidence?

861
01:01:54,249 --> 01:01:55,483
Are you even human?

862
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:59,158
How could you toss your
friend into a ditch like that?

863
01:02:04,329 --> 01:02:06,229
I didn't kill Bo-yeong.

864
01:03:00,492 --> 01:03:03,792
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

865
01:03:04,104 --> 01:03:05,508
<i>Nobody can know you were here.</i>

866
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:06,697
<i>Don't even think</i>
<i>about meeting anyone.</i>

867
01:03:06,698 --> 01:03:08,504
<i>And just how will you do that?</i>

868
01:03:08,505 --> 01:03:10,523
<i>Did the police chief</i>
<i>tell you to fire me?</i>

869
01:03:10,524 --> 01:03:12,813
<i>There are several suspicious</i>
<i>things about this case.</i>

870
01:03:13,753 --> 01:03:15,094
<i>Su-oh!</i>

871
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,048
<i>Just tell me what I have to do.</i>

872
01:03:18,073 --> 01:03:20,581
<i>We haven't found any</i>
<i>personal belongings yet.</i>

873
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:24,366
<i>For us, it's the same</i>
<i>back then as it is now.</i>

874
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:26,357
<i>What if I find new evidence?</i>

875
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:28,040
<i>What did he find in here?</i>

876
01:03:28,088 --> 01:03:29,983
<i>What was Su-oh doing?</i>
