00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:13,213
<i>Bo-yeong.</i>

2
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:15,247
This is fun.

3
00:00:15,247 --> 00:00:16,612
<i>Bo-yeong, where are you?</i>

4
00:00:16,612 --> 00:00:18,564
<i>Why aren't you taking my calls?</i>

5
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:22,236
<i>I'll tell you everything,</i>
<i>so answer the phone.</i>

6
00:00:24,739 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>Let's have a talk at home, Bo-yeong.</i>

7
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:28,320
<i>Oh, what?</i>

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,279
I'm going to spend some time
in the warehouse and then go home.

9
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:31,167
<i>The warehouse?</i>

10
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,501
<i>Who are you with?</i>

11
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,138
- What do you mean?
<i>- I heard you're dating their son.</i>

12
00:00:36,138 --> 00:00:37,475
<i>You can't stay with him this late.</i>

13
00:00:37,475 --> 00:00:39,500
All right.
I'll call you when I get home.

14
00:00:41,252 --> 00:00:42,318
<i>Da-eun!</i>

15
00:00:42,779 --> 00:00:44,013
<i>Hello?</i>

16
00:00:44,279 --> 00:00:46,013
<i>Is anybody there?</i>

17
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,113
<i>Hello?</i>

18
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:09,603
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

OFF LIMITS / UNDER INVESTIGATION

20
00:01:42,412 --> 00:01:43,312
You're here.

21
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:45,378
Hey.

22
00:01:45,732 --> 00:01:46,898
- Section Chief.
- What?

23
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:57,079
KCSI

24
00:02:12,558 --> 00:02:13,431
Chief.

25
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:16,713
A visual analysis on the bloodstains
reveals that...

26
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:19,213
...the locations of the case...

27
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,598
...are two in total.

28
00:02:21,646 --> 00:02:23,679
And the victim might not be just one,

29
00:02:23,679 --> 00:02:25,879
but two or even more.

30
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,546
Hey, did missing reports other than
Park Da-eun's come in?

31
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,157
Section Chief!

32
00:02:32,466 --> 00:02:33,933
Section Chief, sir!

33
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:34,924
Come this way.

34
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:39,759
The owner of this car
is also Mr. Goh Chang-su,

35
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,326
but its actual driver
was Goh Jeong-woo.

36
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:43,377
Section Chief.

37
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:44,369
This is...

38
00:02:44,877 --> 00:02:45,711
You know?

39
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:47,517
All right.

40
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,579
Okay.

41
00:02:48,913 --> 00:02:50,579
Now! Get ready!

42
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:52,746
Goh Jeong-woo will be arrested
without a warrant.

Hurry up.

47
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,179
Have the rest of the team
surround the area.

48
00:03:38,179 --> 00:03:39,013
Come in.

49
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:40,313
Hurry.

50
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,125
Get up! Come out!

51
00:03:51,379 --> 00:03:52,646
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

52
00:03:53,546 --> 00:03:56,634
You are under arrest on suspicion of
murder of Shim Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun...

53
00:03:56,634 --> 00:03:58,146
...and abandonment of their dead bodies.

54
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,813
- What?
- Take him away.

55
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:00,964
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute.

56
00:04:09,652 --> 00:04:11,352
Let go! Darn it!

57
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,147
- Grab hold of him.
- Yes, sir!

58
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:15,136
Uncle!

59
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,746
Uncle!

60
00:04:16,746 --> 00:04:18,646
Hey, Jeong-woo. It's all right.

61
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:24,913
Get in.

62
00:04:24,913 --> 00:04:26,251
- Uncle.
- Hey, come on.

63
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:27,746
- Get out of the way.
- Uncle.

64
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:28,814
Darn it!

65
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:30,879
Hey, be gentle.

66
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:31,780
Uncle.

67
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,508
It's okay.

68
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:34,137
I'm here for you,
I'll go see you soon.

69
00:04:34,137 --> 00:04:35,274
Stay calm.

70
00:04:42,168 --> 00:04:43,669
You all look like you want to...

71
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:47,113
...drink and play hard
now that the CSAT is over.

72
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:48,713
You shouldn't drink and play!

73
00:04:48,713 --> 00:04:50,153
- All right!
- All right!

74
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:50,987
Okay.

75
00:04:50,987 --> 00:04:51,854
Jeong-woo.

76
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:54,480
Jeong-woo?

77
00:04:55,913 --> 00:04:56,913
Attention.

78
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:58,713
Bow to the teacher.

79
00:04:58,713 --> 00:05:00,546
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

80
00:05:02,246 --> 00:05:04,246
<i>It was the day after the CSAT.</i>

81
00:05:05,245 --> 00:05:08,846
<i>Everyone flunked the test</i>
<i>except me, Geon-oh and Deok-mi,</i>

82
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:10,153
<i>so to console them...</i>

83
00:05:10,972 --> 00:05:12,027
<i>Right,</i>

84
00:05:12,027 --> 00:05:15,118
<i>my house was empty because</i>
<i>my parents were on a trip to Hawaii.</i>

85
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:19,013
<i>So I told my friends that...</i>

86
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,687
<i>...we should drink at my house.</i>

87
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:26,115
<i>I was supposed to buy groceries</i>
<i>with Da-eun,</i>

88
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,714
<i>but she hadn't come to school that day</i>
<i>and couldn't be reached.</i>

89
00:05:30,714 --> 00:05:31,224
GOH JEONG-WOO

90
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:39,872
Da-eun.

91
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,779
$410

92
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,521
Darn it.

93
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:15,605
Give the car key.

94
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:17,262
Give it to me.

95
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:19,204
Oh, hurry up.

96
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:23,865
Please get out.

97
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:26,372
I just want to be alone, that's all.

98
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,846
I also want to be alone right now.

99
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,079
Get out right now.

100
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:31,913
What?

101
00:06:32,213 --> 00:06:33,446
You're supposed to be my friend.

102
00:06:33,446 --> 00:06:34,813
This is my car!

103
00:06:35,218 --> 00:06:36,313
Get out now.

104
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,246
Hurry up!

105
00:06:39,772 --> 00:06:41,302
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun.

106
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,979
What about Da-eun?

107
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,146
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun.

108
00:06:44,146 --> 00:06:44,946
What about Da-eun?

109
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,879
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun!

110
00:06:47,813 --> 00:06:48,746
She's...

111
00:06:49,845 --> 00:06:50,811
A slut.

112
00:06:51,713 --> 00:06:52,779
What did you just call her?

113
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,984
What did you just...
What did you just call her?

114
00:06:56,246 --> 00:06:57,664
What did you call her?

115
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:00,405
Hey.

116
00:07:03,746 --> 00:07:04,909
Darn it!

117
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,513
Shim Bo-yeong!

118
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,164
Shim Bo-yeong!

119
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:10,898
<i>I was quite angry then.</i>

120
00:07:11,713 --> 00:07:14,013
<i>So I canceled all the plans</i>
<i>I had with my friends...</i>

121
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:16,402
<i>...and just drank alone at my house.</i>

122
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:19,178
After loading Shim Bo-yeong
into the trunk of the car...

123
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,446
...and abandoning her body,

124
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:24,413
you returned to the warehouse
around 11:30 p.m....

125
00:07:24,413 --> 00:07:26,113
and met Park Da-eun, right?

126
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,615
It wasn't me.

127
00:07:27,946 --> 00:07:29,169
Exactly, you punk.

128
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,747
It's not that you didn't do it.

129
00:07:30,748 --> 00:07:33,282
- Come in here.
- You just don't remember, all right?

130
00:07:34,265 --> 00:07:36,799
Where in the world
did this joker come from?

131
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,179
I said I didn't do it...

132
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:42,946
I didn't.

133
00:07:42,946 --> 00:07:45,513
Come to your senses, you bastard!

134
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:50,877
We were supposed to hang out
at Jeong-woo's place after the CSAT,

135
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,313
but Jeong-woo was in a bad mood.

136
00:07:53,313 --> 00:07:54,645
Jeong-woo was mad.

137
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:58,281
He couldn't get in touch with Da-eun
after the CSAT.

138
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:00,132
Bo-yeong?

139
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:03,292
I last saw Jeong-woo
and Bo-yeong...

140
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,359
...next to the warehouse.

141
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,823
It looked like they had
argued in the car.

142
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:09,218
Yes.

143
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:11,999
I went to Jeong-woo's house
for a short while.

144
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,113
What? You startled me.

145
00:08:18,113 --> 00:08:20,504
Did you finish this all by yourself?

146
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,413
- This?
<i>- He seemed to be very angry...</i>

147
00:08:23,413 --> 00:08:25,479
<i>- ...because of Da-eun.</i>
- Yeah, I did.

148
00:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,013
He seemed a bit drunk,

149
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:30,046
so I just left the house.

150
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,679
That's why...

151
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:33,879
We hung out at my house
until late into the night.

152
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,683
And after that...

153
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:40,113
I don't know what happened.

154
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:49,813
Gu-tak...

155
00:08:55,746 --> 00:08:57,179
This makes no sense at all.

156
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,213
All of you, stay outside.

157
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:01,216
Gu-tak.

158
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,246
Da-eun said that...

159
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:19,613
...She was with her boyfriend.

160
00:09:19,613 --> 00:09:20,598
Right.

161
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:22,099
When I called her,

162
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:24,458
I could hear his voice.

163
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:26,212
Detective sir, you know how it is.

164
00:09:26,213 --> 00:09:27,779
- Right?
- I do know.

165
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,179
Please find my Bo-yeong.

166
00:09:29,746 --> 00:09:31,146
It's freezing right now.

167
00:09:31,146 --> 00:09:33,179
How cold she must she be right now?

168
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,446
My Bo-yeong.

169
00:09:34,446 --> 00:09:37,113
Find Bo-yeong! You bastard!

170
00:09:37,113 --> 00:09:38,446
But then suddenly,

171
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,849
Da-eun's scream was heard.

172
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,669
Did you drink alcohol on the evening
of November 19?

173
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,214
Yes.

174
00:09:48,292 --> 00:09:50,955
Did you kill Shim Bo-yeong,
your friend, in the warehouse?

175
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:55,551
No.

176
00:09:56,646 --> 00:09:57,913
No, I...

177
00:09:58,672 --> 00:10:00,239
No, I didn't!

178
00:10:01,547 --> 00:10:04,113
When I got off the bus...

179
00:10:04,113 --> 00:10:07,146
SEOCHEON-GU OFFICE, MUCHEON VILLAGE,
PUBLIC BUS TERMINAL

180
00:10:07,146 --> 00:10:08,346
<i>Jeong-woo's car...</i>

181
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:10,546
<i>...was headed in the opposite direction.</i>

182
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,212
<i>Are you sure</i>
<i>it was Goh Jeong-woo's car?</i>

183
00:10:15,646 --> 00:10:16,946
I'm sure.

184
00:10:17,987 --> 00:10:19,046
Goh Jeong-woo.

185
00:10:19,046 --> 00:10:20,879
How was the weather last night?

186
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:22,986
It rained last night, right?

187
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:25,679
Huh?

188
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:30,646
You became dead drunk
the night before last...

189
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:33,213
...and went to the warehouse, right?

190
00:10:33,213 --> 00:10:34,413
No.

191
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:35,856
No, I didn't go there.

192
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,760
Pantry back there, yes.

193
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,984
Check out the clothes in the washer.

194
00:10:47,485 --> 00:10:48,438
Team Head, sir!

195
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:49,864
We found it.

196
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,278
Hey, what did I tell you!

197
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,613
<i>Jeong-woo's shoes smeared with</i>
<i>the girls' blood and mud were found.</i>

198
00:10:56,046 --> 00:10:57,913
Do you know what that means?

199
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:00,434
That's strong evidence...

200
00:11:00,435 --> 00:11:01,878
...that proves he was...

201
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:04,979
...in the same warehouse as Bo-yeong
and Da-eun when they were bleeding.

202
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:08,452
Even if Jeong-woo was drunk...

203
00:11:10,913 --> 00:11:13,213
He isn't the type
who would do such a thing.

204
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:16,074
According to the criminal behavior
analysis team,

205
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:19,266
<i>when one accidentally kills someone</i>
<i>while extremely intoxicated,</i>

206
00:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,579
<i>a powerful defense mechanism</i>
<i>within them activates...</i>

207
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,513
<i>...and one goes through a blackout.</i>

208
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:28,646
<i>And they aren't able</i>
<i>to remember what they did.</i>

209
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:33,646
I went to the warehouse
around 10:30 p.m.

210
00:11:33,646 --> 00:11:35,013
Hey!

211
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:36,021
And then what?

212
00:11:37,588 --> 00:11:40,488
<i>You bastard got drunk,</i>
<i>went into the warehouse,</i>

213
00:11:40,513 --> 00:11:43,546
and killed Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun there!

214
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,979
I met with Da-eun at 11:30 p.m.

215
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:47,960
Da-eun.

216
00:11:47,961 --> 00:11:49,578
Let go!

217
00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:51,246
You're just trash.

218
00:11:53,758 --> 00:11:55,991
I told you not to talk to me like that.

219
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,079
Did you kill them?

220
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:03,687
I didn't kill them, Mom.

221
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:05,513
It was definitely not me.

222
00:12:05,513 --> 00:12:06,979
You didn't kill them?

223
00:12:12,279 --> 00:12:13,812
Mom.

224
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,346
What were you doing...

225
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:17,872
...when the girls were dying?

226
00:12:18,146 --> 00:12:20,213
I don't know. I think I was sleeping.

227
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:21,499
I have absolutely no...

228
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,312
Memory of what happened then.

229
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,746
I don't know, Mom.

230
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,946
Did you really...

231
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:36,146
Kill the girls?

232
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,479
I...

233
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:55,033
Mom.

234
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:57,509
Mom!

235
00:12:58,313 --> 00:12:59,746
Mom!

236
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,846
Mom, what do I do?

237
00:13:03,213 --> 00:13:04,713
Mom!

238
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:09,313
- Please take a step back.
- Let's get going.

239
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:10,546
- Move back.
- Please.

240
00:13:12,479 --> 00:13:13,846
Hey, you should smack the head.

241
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:16,276
You said that's how you killed her.

242
00:13:16,746 --> 00:13:17,579
Huh?

243
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:19,246
MONKEY WRENCH

244
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:24,151
Dong-min!

245
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:26,479
- Dong-min.
- Reenact it the way you did it.

246
00:13:31,094 --> 00:13:31,874
That's right.

247
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,318
You confessed that you hit her
like this several times.

248
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:38,079
- Bo-yeong...
- No, don't go.

249
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,050
You're no better than a dog!

250
00:13:43,613 --> 00:13:44,913
- Bo-yeong.
- It wasn't me!

251
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:47,846
- Where's my Bo-yeong?
- It wasn't me!

252
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:51,979
- It wasn't me.
- Kill him!

253
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:53,813
- Out of the way.
- No!

254
00:13:53,813 --> 00:13:56,479
- Hey!
- It wasn't me!

255
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,572
Have they still not found Bo-yeong?

256
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,013
No.

257
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:14,846
What about Da-eun?

258
00:14:18,966 --> 00:14:20,599
Coming in here...

259
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:24,765
I keep thinking about them.

260
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:30,613
<i>On the morning of the 20th,</i>

261
00:14:30,613 --> 00:14:32,879
<i>Mucheon Police arrested</i>
<i>19-year-old Goh without a warrant...</i>

262
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:34,979
<i>...on suspicion of murder</i>
<i>of his two friends.</i>

263
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,504
SUSPECT FOR TWO MURDERS ARRESTED
<i>Over 3 liters of blood...</i>

264
00:14:37,505 --> 00:14:39,662
<i>...were discovered at the site.</i>

265
00:14:40,033 --> 00:14:43,644
<i>The police assume that the victims</i>
<i>are most likely dead.</i>

266
00:14:43,645 --> 00:14:44,846
<i>The police are looking...</i>

267
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:47,720
<i>...at the possibility of</i>
<i>the corpses being abandoned.</i>

268
00:14:48,117 --> 00:14:50,413
THE DOCK
The accused is sentenced to 10 years.

269
00:14:50,913 --> 00:14:52,379
Before the pronouncement
of judgment,

270
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,513
76 days of confinement
will be added to the sentence.

271
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,079
Considering the fact that the victims'
corpses haven't been discovered yet...

272
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,446
...and that he hasn't been forgiven
by the families of the deceased,

273
00:15:02,446 --> 00:15:05,146
it is only appropriate to impose
a severe punishment on the accused...

274
00:15:05,146 --> 00:15:07,479
...that corresponds
to the gravity of his actions.

275
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:11,079
However, the accused has
no previous criminal records...

276
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:13,346
...and committed the act by accident...

277
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,298
...under the influence of alcohol...

278
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,113
I didn't kill them.
Please...

279
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:21,513
Bo-yeong and Da-eun.

280
00:15:21,513 --> 00:15:22,646
Bo-yeong.

281
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:24,913
Da-eun.

282
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,479
Are you on a picnic or what,
you punk?

283
00:15:43,346 --> 00:15:45,046
It's such a waste.

284
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,746
Pick it up and eat it.

285
00:16:05,713 --> 00:16:06,646
Jeong-woo.

286
00:16:07,699 --> 00:16:08,945
Is Geon-oh here too?

287
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:10,313
Why aren't Byeong-mu
and Min-su coming?

288
00:16:10,313 --> 00:16:12,682
They might know that
I wasn't in the warehouse that night.

289
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,379
I can't get in touch with them either,
Jeong-woo.

290
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:23,579
What do I do?

291
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,199
What do I do, Deok-mi?

292
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,846
<i>Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

293
00:16:44,646 --> 00:16:46,675
<i>You're the one who killed</i>
<i>Bo-yeong and Da-eun.</i>

294
00:16:49,246 --> 00:16:51,204
<i>In order to survive in here,</i>

295
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,507
<i>it has to be you who killed them!</i>

296
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,313
Jeong-woo.

297
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:03,588
Did they beat you?

298
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,558
It was nothing serious.

299
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,213
Jeong-woo...

300
00:17:15,946 --> 00:17:17,705
At 11:30 p.m.

301
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:22,413
Bo-yeong.

302
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:24,513
Park Da-eun is a slut.
Park Da-eun is a slut!

303
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:25,472
It wasn't me.

304
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:28,372
- Oh, please.
- Park Da-eun is a slut.

305
00:17:31,246 --> 00:17:32,244
<i>Jeong-woo.</i>

306
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,679
Please find me.

307
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:36,113
Please find them.

308
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,246
Bo-yeong and Da-eun...

309
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:40,013
Hey, let go!

310
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:42,579
- Please...
- You're just trash!

311
00:17:44,346 --> 00:17:45,479
<i>Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

312
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:47,946
Think.

313
00:17:49,046 --> 00:17:50,313
Remember!

314
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:51,946
Remember!

315
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,071
Remember!

316
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:57,011
Please don't kill me.

317
00:17:57,579 --> 00:17:58,524
Please don't kill me.

318
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:01,113
- I told you to listen to me.
- I'm sorry.

319
00:18:02,932 --> 00:18:05,949
Your father's funeral went well.

320
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,379
He died...

321
00:18:09,498 --> 00:18:10,498
In peace.

322
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,179
It's all my fault.

323
00:18:17,785 --> 00:18:18,952
Where's Mom?

324
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,179
Right, your mom...

325
00:18:22,813 --> 00:18:23,679
She's working.

326
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:24,846
But you work as well, dad.

327
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,778
- Jeong-woo.
- Her son is a murderer,

328
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:30,913
so she must be terrified.

329
00:18:30,913 --> 00:18:33,022
She wouldn't be able
to even look at my face.

330
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:36,779
Just be honest, Dad.

331
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:39,146
No, it's not that.

332
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,879
That's not the kind of person
your mom is.

333
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:46,185
How can a mother not visit her son
for 6 years?

334
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:49,546
Say something.

335
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,361
Bring Mom here!

336
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,583
Hey, run!

337
00:19:09,645 --> 00:19:10,745
<i>But, Uncle.</i>

338
00:19:11,513 --> 00:19:13,812
<i>I still don't remember anything.</i>

339
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,365
<i>Even if you don't remember,</i>

340
00:19:18,313 --> 00:19:20,079
<i>that doesn't mean that</i>
<i>what has already happened disappears...</i>

341
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,846
<i>...or that your crime disappears.</i>

342
00:19:52,922 --> 00:19:55,017
You harassed him so much that
he slit his wrist.

343
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,478
Are you crazy,
you good-for-nothing?

344
00:20:05,892 --> 00:20:08,025
Are you crazy or what, you punk?

345
00:20:11,105 --> 00:20:12,792
Go to hell, you punk.

346
00:20:12,801 --> 00:20:14,079
- What are you doing?
- You bastard.

347
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,413
- Just die.
- Come over here.

348
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:16,979
- Get up.
- Move.

349
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,346
I said, move!

350
00:20:18,346 --> 00:20:19,852
This is one crazy bastard.

351
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:22,892
You must have a death wish.

352
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,335
You're laughing?

353
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:27,845
How dare you laugh!

354
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:28,746
You trash.

355
00:20:28,746 --> 00:20:29,613
Are you for real, you bastard?

356
00:20:31,426 --> 00:20:33,293
This is a crazy bastard.

357
00:20:35,446 --> 00:20:36,512
Darn it!

358
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:37,546
You son of a...

359
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:42,028
- You bastard!
- Let go!

360
00:20:42,921 --> 00:20:43,921
Let go!

361
00:20:56,346 --> 00:20:58,088
You need to buy yourself
healthy food...

362
00:20:58,089 --> 00:20:59,922
...that's good for you.

363
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:03,065
This is the first payment I got.

364
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,478
It was a very important scene.

365
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,779
It was a very emotional scene,

366
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,719
where I was dazed
due to the death of my parents.

367
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,667
- Sure, let's do it.
- Yep, yep.

368
00:21:10,668 --> 00:21:11,930
What are we doing?

369
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:13,037
- I got tense.
- Go!

370
00:21:13,414 --> 00:21:14,182
- Hey!
- Darn it.

371
00:21:14,183 --> 00:21:15,183
What are we doing?

372
00:21:16,678 --> 00:21:18,012
You are happy every day?

373
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:20,746
Extremely happy?

374
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:21,874
Just eat.

375
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,837
<i>I heard something.</i>

376
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:29,781
<i>And I was so curious</i>
<i>about who he was.</i>

377
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:31,512
<i>Have you been well?</i>

378
00:21:31,513 --> 00:21:33,479
You were here around Christmas.
You didn't need to come again.

379
00:21:33,479 --> 00:21:35,304
The season has changed.

380
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:37,646
Didn't you say you were
shooting abroad?

381
00:21:37,936 --> 00:21:39,951
I stayed abroad for around
a month and came back.

382
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:44,578
<i>Jeong-woo, there's a street</i>
<i>in Paris called "Saint-Germain."</i>

383
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:47,762
<i>And the "Cafe de Flore" there</i>
<i>used to be Hemingway's haunt.</i>

384
00:21:48,695 --> 00:21:51,045
<i>Back in 11th grade,</i>
<i>you wrote a book review...</i>

385
00:21:51,046 --> 00:21:52,646
<i>...on "The Old Man and the Sea."</i>

386
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,787
<i>Do you remember that?</i>

387
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:55,840
<i>Did I do that?</i>

388
00:21:56,746 --> 00:21:58,079
<i>It's almost the end.</i>

389
00:21:59,158 --> 00:22:00,170
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

390
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:16,719
Cut!

391
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:22,413
- Okay?
- Okay!

392
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:24,813
Thank you for your hard work.

393
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:26,879
- Thank you.
- You did a great job.

394
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,479
Choi Na-gyeom.

395
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,113
Hand over the car keys.

396
00:22:31,113 --> 00:22:32,213
What? The car keys?

397
00:22:32,623 --> 00:22:34,445
Why? Where are you going?

398
00:22:34,446 --> 00:22:36,478
- I'm taking a 3-day vacation.
- What?

399
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,979
- Thank you!
- Hey, Choi Na-gyeom!

400
00:23:09,113 --> 00:23:11,746
Wow, that viper is getting out.

401
00:23:48,566 --> 00:23:49,678
Goh Jeong-woo.

402
00:23:52,045 --> 00:23:53,111
Oh, I'm not late.

403
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:03,069
It must've been really tough.

404
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:05,522
I can't believe that you're
right in front of me.

405
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:08,946
You look even cooler outside.

406
00:24:08,946 --> 00:24:10,279
You're talking nonsense.

407
00:24:11,446 --> 00:24:12,413
Deok-mi.

408
00:24:14,013 --> 00:24:14,893
Thanks.

409
00:24:15,213 --> 00:24:16,546
- Choi Na-gyeom.
- Oh!

410
00:24:17,318 --> 00:24:19,944
- Sorry.
- I changed my name, remember?

411
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:21,112
I'm just so used to that name.

412
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,512
Is this what's trendy these days?

413
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,046
I came here right after the shoot.

414
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:32,813
We'll have to go there first, right?

415
00:25:03,613 --> 00:25:05,157
Get up.

416
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:09,346
Get up.

417
00:25:09,346 --> 00:25:11,456
Look at me, you bastard.

418
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,313
Look at me, you bastard.

419
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:14,526
Look at me.

420
00:25:14,527 --> 00:25:15,461
Look at me.

421
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:17,146
Look at me, you bastard.

422
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:19,179
Look at me, you bastard.

423
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:24,401
Look at me.

424
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:25,388
You crazy punks, stop!

425
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:27,079
- Stop it!
- Sang-cheol!

426
00:25:28,579 --> 00:25:29,490
Let go!

427
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:31,579
Let go!

428
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:32,979
Let go!

429
00:25:32,979 --> 00:25:34,946
Come to your senses!

430
00:25:34,946 --> 00:25:36,913
When are you going to stop doing that?

431
00:25:49,242 --> 00:25:50,242
Damn it.

432
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:03,318
The suit fits you well.

433
00:26:05,646 --> 00:26:07,546
You came to meet your father.

434
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:09,646
So it's nice to dress up like this.

435
00:26:15,126 --> 00:26:17,140
- Thanks.
- Go and say hello.

436
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:21,446
Let's go together.

437
00:26:27,372 --> 00:26:28,705
Your father...

438
00:26:30,746 --> 00:26:32,983
Insisted that his ashes
get scattered here.

439
00:26:33,346 --> 00:26:35,122
This was his favorite spot.

440
00:26:35,946 --> 00:26:37,079
We came here often.

441
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:16,190
BUNGALOW NO. 6

442
00:27:17,913 --> 00:27:20,513
Dad, we've been here
for 2 hours. Let's go home.

443
00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:22,546
Dad?

444
00:27:24,813 --> 00:27:25,732
Dad!

445
00:27:27,282 --> 00:27:28,309
Captain!

446
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:29,913
Hey, be quiet.

447
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,646
The fish will all run away.

448
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:33,079
I'm the one who wants to run away.

449
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:40,413
Just wait.

450
00:27:40,879 --> 00:27:42,879
Time will go by, anyway.

451
00:27:42,879 --> 00:27:44,513
And a chance comes at least once.

452
00:27:50,813 --> 00:27:52,713
Jeong-woo, it's here! Catch it!

453
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:54,679
Wow, it's really strong.

454
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,013
Wow, that's huge.

455
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:04,946
I'm here.

456
00:28:13,646 --> 00:28:14,713
I'm sorry.

457
00:28:16,979 --> 00:28:17,961
Dad.

458
00:28:40,979 --> 00:28:42,779
NATIONAL TECHNICAL
QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATE

459
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,717
Well done.

460
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:46,379
Jeong-woo...

461
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,713
CRIMINAL PSYCHOLOGY

462
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:02,679
WARNING GIVEN BY MY FUTURE SELF

463
00:29:13,446 --> 00:29:15,279
You didn't have to come.

464
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,779
- Why would you bring that?
- Give it to me.

465
00:29:19,146 --> 00:29:21,664
This is what you gave to me last time.

466
00:29:22,313 --> 00:29:23,946
If you take it easy...

467
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:25,513
...and try to calm your mind a bit,

468
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,813
you'll be able to make a comeback.

469
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:28,513
This is what you call
a waste of manpower.

470
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:31,613
A suspension of 2 months
would suffice, but you're exiled!

471
00:29:32,013 --> 00:29:32,879
I'll get going.

472
00:29:34,346 --> 00:29:34,913
Goodbye.

473
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:35,779
- Bye.
- All right.

474
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:37,741
Stop by when you've got time.

475
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,776
- All right.
- I'll get going.

476
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:44,723
Good.

477
00:29:53,026 --> 00:29:58,001
MUCHEON GARDEN

478
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:00,516
You're here.

479
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:07,297
Come here.

480
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:09,735
Right.

481
00:30:11,013 --> 00:30:11,979
Sit down.

482
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:25,112
My goodness.

483
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:26,413
Oh, dear.

484
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:29,813
Auntie, here.

485
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:32,212
Hold on tight.

486
00:30:50,513 --> 00:30:52,679
The cut isn't that deep.

487
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,679
You're wasting
your medical school training on me.

488
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:02,546
Auntie, is something going on today?

489
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,679
You look as if you've seen a ghost.

490
00:31:06,546 --> 00:31:07,988
Nothing's going on.

491
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,639
You were fidgety all day today.

492
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:14,378
There is definitely
something going on.

493
00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:15,379
There isn't.

494
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,746
Thanks.

495
00:31:50,139 --> 00:31:52,139
Could you pull over if it's possible?

496
00:31:52,813 --> 00:31:54,379
I think I should get changed.

497
00:31:55,146 --> 00:31:56,654
That suits you well,
so why would you?

498
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:58,279
I have to go meet Mom.

499
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:00,473
I'm going to wear something
she bought for me.

500
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:09,312
Did you kill them?

501
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:11,432
Did you really...

502
00:32:14,278 --> 00:32:15,811
Kill the girls?

503
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:20,439
Are you okay?

504
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,537
That bastard.

505
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:39,284
I have to catch him.

506
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,337
Lower your window.

507
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,237
Lower it further.

508
00:33:11,103 --> 00:33:13,147
A hit-and-run
and no license plate?

509
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:15,373
Hey. I mean, sir...

510
00:33:16,403 --> 00:33:17,770
I'm very sorry about that,
okay?

511
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,803
This is the police, get out.

512
00:33:18,803 --> 00:33:20,637
- Mister, just let me go this time.
- Get out.

513
00:33:20,637 --> 00:33:22,170
- What do you mean, sir?
- Just once... I apologize.

514
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,937
- I'm a policeman, not a mister. Hey!
- Just let me go this once.

515
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,684
Hey, hey!

516
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,837
- Darn him...
- I'll go to him.

517
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,318
Don't get out.

518
00:33:38,189 --> 00:33:39,497
Mr. Soccer Player.

519
00:33:40,637 --> 00:33:42,803
Hey, look here.

520
00:33:46,137 --> 00:33:48,070
You just drove into that car
and ran away.

521
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,756
No, that's not it.

522
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:51,802
It was a chain-reaction collision,
so let's catch that car first.

523
00:33:51,803 --> 00:33:53,237
You get what I'm saying?

524
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:55,437
Did you have a pint
after soccer club?

525
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,403
Your car reeks of alcohol.

526
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,270
Oh, I didn't drink that...

527
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,990
Sorry, but I didn't see anything.

528
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:05,170
You can't just crash a car
and run away.

529
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,203
Let's get this taken care of.

530
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:08,857
- Get out.
- This is so frustrating.

531
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:12,093
Hey.

532
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:14,137
Look here.

533
00:34:14,137 --> 00:34:17,003
I'm not a soccer club member
but a policeman, all right?

534
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,637
I didn't want to say this, but...

535
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,370
Do you know about
the major crime unit?

536
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,937
The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency
Major Crime Unit.

537
00:34:30,937 --> 00:34:32,203
- So what?
- What...

538
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,464
Anyone can drink and drive
and cause a hit-and-run.

539
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,499
Just give me your number.
I'll call the insurance company.

540
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,683
All right, just give it here!

541
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:49,470
Seriously.

542
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,937
Oh, for real?

543
00:34:50,937 --> 00:34:53,537
The police are good-for-nothing
in this country.

544
00:34:53,766 --> 00:34:55,454
Here. You happy now?

545
00:35:02,315 --> 00:35:03,803
ASSEMBLYWOMAN OF MUCHEON,
YE YEONG-SIL

546
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,838
THE CENTER OF GYEONGGI-DO!
THE CENTER OF THE WORLD!

547
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:36,154
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

548
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:43,237
Let's go.

549
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:58,082
Ugh, I should hang in there.

550
00:36:01,096 --> 00:36:02,926
- Hey, Byeong-mu.
- Yes?

551
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:04,822
Did you hear the news?

552
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:06,969
About the new team head
who's coming tomorrow...

553
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,044
He's coming here
because he caused trouble.

554
00:36:08,045 --> 00:36:09,045
What trouble?

555
00:36:10,022 --> 00:36:10,855
Assault.

556
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:13,862
Supposedly, he beats people
to a pulp like a gangster would.

557
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:16,438
Oh, come on. Look at the world
we're living in now.

558
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,606
We can't even hit criminals
without a reason.

559
00:36:19,337 --> 00:36:21,137
That's why he was sent to the country.

560
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,470
He's skilled, but he's got a bad temper,

561
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,272
so the Major Crime Unit sent him here.

562
00:36:25,337 --> 00:36:26,436
That can't be true.

563
00:36:26,437 --> 00:36:27,703
It just might be true.

564
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,750
So what's the truth?

565
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:34,137
- Geez.
- Hello.

566
00:36:34,137 --> 00:36:35,470
Come on in.

567
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:43,003
Hey.

568
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,970
Now, attention!

569
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,003
This is Inspector Noh Sang-cheol from...

570
00:36:51,003 --> 00:36:52,619
...the SMPA Major Crime Unit.

571
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,653
His official first day is tomorrow,

572
00:36:54,654 --> 00:36:56,021
but he's here to say hello
in advance.

573
00:36:58,275 --> 00:36:59,882
I figured it'd be better
to meet my teammates...

574
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:03,311
...than to stay at home,
so I came by to introduce myself.

575
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:06,984
Wow, look at his attitude.

576
00:37:07,303 --> 00:37:09,203
His skills are even better.

577
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,070
He already managed a case.

578
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,650
On the way here...

579
00:37:12,651 --> 00:37:15,136
He caught a hit-and-run driver
without a license...

580
00:37:15,137 --> 00:37:17,537
...and handed him over
to the Traffic Division.

581
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,335
You all know about this.

582
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:23,169
The arrest of all Bulsapa Gang members
in 2012.

583
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:26,137
The murder case of the elderly couple
in Mawon-gu in 2013.

584
00:37:26,138 --> 00:37:28,138
He's the type...

585
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,263
...that just dives in head first.

586
00:37:32,176 --> 00:37:33,842
Oh! Wow.

587
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,470
He's like a stallion.

588
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:38,903
Anyway, he will be...

589
00:37:38,903 --> 00:37:41,870
...the team head of Team 2 starting today,

590
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,002
so be nice to him.

591
00:37:43,003 --> 00:37:45,003
I look forward to working with you.

592
00:37:45,004 --> 00:37:46,371
I'm in your hands!

593
00:37:46,372 --> 00:37:47,905
I'm in your hands!

594
00:37:50,123 --> 00:37:52,781
Now, let's go and say hello
to the Police Chief.

595
00:37:52,782 --> 00:37:54,277
Oh, he's out of office right now.

596
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,590
- What?
- Because of Su-oh.

597
00:38:08,473 --> 00:38:09,306
Son.

598
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:12,269
What are you doing? Get out.

599
00:38:13,783 --> 00:38:14,950
Well done.

600
00:38:16,896 --> 00:38:18,329
Let's take your medicine
before taking a break.

601
00:38:20,903 --> 00:38:21,836
Su-oh.

602
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,363
- This must be taken twice a day.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:33,537
Good job.

604
00:38:35,988 --> 00:38:37,374
This is...

605
00:38:37,423 --> 00:38:39,990
...a present I'm giving you for taking
your medicine well for a month.

606
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,975
- Will you go in?
- What?

607
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:07,156
Will you be all right?

608
00:39:13,503 --> 00:39:14,570
I honestly don't understand...

609
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:17,570
...why you want to come back here.

610
00:39:18,503 --> 00:39:19,969
You know how it is.

611
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,510
You can't live here anymore.

612
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,303
True...

613
00:39:29,796 --> 00:39:32,129
Mom might not recognize me.

614
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,057
She didn't visit me once
for the past decade.

615
00:39:38,703 --> 00:39:40,503
- Jeong-woo.
- I'm not too sure.

616
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,570
I just don't know.

617
00:39:42,362 --> 00:39:45,229
But I thought I had to see
Mom's face upon my release.

618
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:47,457
I will have to see her face to find out...

619
00:39:47,458 --> 00:39:50,537
...how I'll live and what I should do
from now on.

620
00:39:50,537 --> 00:39:52,496
No, it's all over.

621
00:39:54,865 --> 00:39:57,833
Forget it. Just forget what happened.

622
00:39:58,143 --> 00:39:59,209
Forget it.

623
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:12,963
Thanks for today.

624
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:15,564
Oh, right.

625
00:40:18,523 --> 00:40:19,590
I'll call you.

626
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,370
MUCHEON GARDEN

627
00:41:28,116 --> 00:41:29,802
Chu-ho, are you nearly finished?

628
00:41:29,803 --> 00:41:31,615
Come in here,
we should share a drink.

629
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:33,616
It's almost finished. Go on in first.

630
00:41:33,617 --> 00:41:34,784
- Come in.
- All right.

631
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,444
CONGRATULATIONS ON JEONG-WOO'S
ACCEPTANCE TO MEDICAL SCHOOL

632
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:46,347
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

633
00:41:46,348 --> 00:41:47,848
Congratulations, have a glass.

634
00:41:48,269 --> 00:41:49,269
That's okay.

635
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,289
Congratulations.

636
00:41:54,822 --> 00:41:56,889
- That's too much.
- Bottoms up.

637
00:42:00,109 --> 00:42:01,305
Wow, he's a good drinker.

638
00:42:02,237 --> 00:42:03,403
You punk.

639
00:42:03,611 --> 00:42:05,237
- You shouldn't drink alcohol.
- He gave it to me.

640
00:42:05,237 --> 00:42:07,270
- Why would you give him alcohol?
- It's fine.

641
00:42:08,316 --> 00:42:10,924
- Did you get the alcohol?
- We'll get caught.

642
00:42:11,563 --> 00:42:12,496
Geon-oh.

643
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,130
- You'll get the alcohol, right?
- Yeah.

644
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:18,356
Bring that new student who lives
in the rooftop house as well.

645
00:42:18,803 --> 00:42:19,670
Hurry up.

646
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,023
Eat your fill.

647
00:42:27,736 --> 00:42:30,525
Excuse me, my mom says
you should come and eat.

648
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:34,250
What is it?

649
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:48,421
My mom says you should
come and eat.

650
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,040
Hello.

651
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:06,053
Sir, the restaurant is that way.

652
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:13,227
MUCHEON GARDEN

653
00:43:24,756 --> 00:43:25,756
Hey!

654
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:28,422
Hey!

655
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,350
Ugh, this is salty!

656
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:37,641
Do you expect me to eat this crap?

657
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:39,437
You did this on purpose, right?

658
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,337
Why would I do that?

659
00:43:42,337 --> 00:43:44,402
Why are you talking informally
to a customer?

660
00:43:44,403 --> 00:43:45,403
Are we close?

661
00:43:49,702 --> 00:43:50,803
Sorry.

662
00:43:50,803 --> 00:43:52,327
That must have been a bit bland.

663
00:43:52,328 --> 00:43:55,595
Oh...
You're saying I did this on purpose.

664
00:43:55,596 --> 00:43:56,602
Are you messing with me now?

665
00:43:56,603 --> 00:43:58,237
Do you think I did this on purpose?

666
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:01,407
I'll cook it again and bring it
to you.

667
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:02,907
You should have done that
in the first place.

668
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,249
Come on.

669
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:13,302
Watch where you're going.

670
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:14,270
I'll do it.

671
00:44:15,582 --> 00:44:18,309
Hey! Who are you to help her?

672
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,676
Why would you clean that up?

673
00:44:20,303 --> 00:44:21,239
Get inside.

674
00:44:45,337 --> 00:44:46,314
Mom.

675
00:44:58,103 --> 00:44:59,112
You punk.

676
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:04,170
How dare you show your face here?

677
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:06,769
You bastard.

678
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,470
How could you do that
to my daughter?

679
00:45:09,103 --> 00:45:11,804
Where did you put my daughter
after killing her?

680
00:45:18,903 --> 00:45:20,754
I should give her a funeral,
you bastard.

681
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:24,067
Can't you just tell me
where she is?

682
00:45:27,569 --> 00:45:29,002
Tell me.

683
00:45:29,003 --> 00:45:31,336
Tell me where my daughter is!

684
00:45:34,562 --> 00:45:35,996
Think.

685
00:45:36,482 --> 00:45:38,149
Think, you bastard!

686
00:45:39,776 --> 00:45:40,809
You!

687
00:45:41,337 --> 00:45:43,137
You stay out of my sight!

688
00:45:43,663 --> 00:45:46,580
Or else, I'll kill both you
and your mother!

689
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:55,458
Mom.

690
00:45:59,537 --> 00:46:00,505
I want to live with...

691
00:46:00,506 --> 00:46:02,378
So today was the day of your release.

692
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,670
You can't live here.

693
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:09,170
Even though you've served your sentence,

694
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:12,034
you can't atone for your crime.

695
00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:20,635
I'm sorry.

696
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:23,790
Never let that thought leave you
as long as you live.

697
00:46:26,537 --> 00:46:28,883
I'm going to stay here until I die...

698
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:33,262
Since my son is a criminal.

699
00:46:44,823 --> 00:46:47,412
- Mom.
- The moment you became a murderer,

700
00:46:48,510 --> 00:46:50,676
you stopped being my son.

701
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,984
Don't you dare step foot
in this place ever again.

702
00:47:12,603 --> 00:47:14,438
Nobody welcomes you here.

703
00:47:37,476 --> 00:47:39,609
MUCHEON BUK-RO 2-GIL,
IGO VEGETABLE BLOOD SAUSAGES

704
00:47:41,623 --> 00:47:43,937
This place will be a bit boring.

705
00:47:43,937 --> 00:47:47,737
Isn't it a good thing
if a detective is bored?

706
00:47:47,737 --> 00:47:49,299
Mucheon, the city without crimes.

707
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,436
Seriously!

708
00:47:50,437 --> 00:47:53,070
This is the place of my dreams!

709
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:55,437
There are petty criminals, though.

710
00:47:55,437 --> 00:47:57,070
Yes, there are a lot.

711
00:47:57,070 --> 00:47:59,637
There are so many thieves
and happy slappers these days.

712
00:47:59,637 --> 00:48:01,993
- They are a pain.
- Right.

713
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:04,639
Geez, that was uncalled for.

714
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,306
Let's keep this vibe
and go for round two.

715
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:10,895
I got a missed call.

716
00:48:10,896 --> 00:48:12,263
I should go back to the station.

717
00:48:12,736 --> 00:48:13,869
Violent Crime Team 2.

718
00:48:13,870 --> 00:48:15,870
- Go easy.
- Go easy.

719
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:17,438
- Go easy.
- All right.

720
00:48:31,749 --> 00:48:32,704
Goh Jeong-woo?

721
00:48:33,916 --> 00:48:35,549
Hey, Jeong-woo!

722
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:36,417
Goh Jeong-woo!

723
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,339
Wow, Jeong-woo!

724
00:48:42,703 --> 00:48:43,869
Hey, well done.

725
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:47,242
No, I mean, it's nice to see you.

726
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:50,203
That came out wrong.

727
00:48:51,482 --> 00:48:53,288
What should I say in a situation
like this?

728
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,003
Have you been well?

729
00:49:02,797 --> 00:49:04,269
Hey, is there anything you want to do?

730
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,336
How about we go downtown
and get drinks?

731
00:49:06,337 --> 00:49:07,670
I don't drink.

732
00:49:09,756 --> 00:49:11,517
Oh, I must be crazy.
You got drunk and caused...

733
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:14,090
Jeong-woo, I must be really insane.

734
00:49:14,372 --> 00:49:16,237
How about you just hit me once?

735
00:49:16,237 --> 00:49:17,570
Come on. Just hit me.

736
00:49:20,403 --> 00:49:21,437
COP

737
00:49:24,175 --> 00:49:25,775
You just saved me.

738
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:27,756
Guess who I'm with right now.

739
00:49:28,309 --> 00:49:29,370
Hold on a sec.

740
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,582
Jeong-woo, it's Byeong-mu.

741
00:49:37,575 --> 00:49:39,309
- Hey.
- Darn it.

742
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:42,249
You punk.

743
00:49:44,016 --> 00:49:46,949
Wow, you really are Jeong-woo.

744
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:50,416
Hey, we should meet.

745
00:49:51,082 --> 00:49:52,416
No. You know...

746
00:49:52,909 --> 00:49:54,609
You should come downtown right now.

747
00:49:56,016 --> 00:49:57,549
Yes, I'll be done with work soon.

748
00:49:58,270 --> 00:49:59,203
All right!

749
00:50:03,703 --> 00:50:05,269
I'm sorry.

750
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,797
Byeong-mu says we should
come downtown.

751
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,789
Oh, we can take the bus here.

752
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:13,809
After your dad passed, your mom
put Mucheon Garden up for sale.

753
00:50:14,256 --> 00:50:15,975
My dad bought it by taking out a loan...

754
00:50:16,437 --> 00:50:19,730
...and your mom begged to let her
keep working in the kitchen.

755
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:22,869
My parents were a bit uncomfortable
with that, of course.

756
00:50:22,870 --> 00:50:25,126
But your mom begged them so much that...

757
00:50:25,127 --> 00:50:26,760
...my father caved in...

758
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:33,237
Anyway, you haven't changed a bit.

759
00:50:33,237 --> 00:50:34,337
You're exactly the same.

760
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,423
How could you...

761
00:50:37,416 --> 00:50:39,268
...not visit me even once for 10 years?

762
00:50:40,415 --> 00:50:42,588
I had a lot of things to take care of.

763
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:44,369
After that happened to you,
Byeong-mu and I...

764
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:46,795
...enlisted in the army together
and served there for 2 years.

765
00:50:46,796 --> 00:50:48,136
After our discharge,
we went to college.

766
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:50,050
And after our graduation,
we made preparations to get jobs.

767
00:50:51,514 --> 00:50:53,995
Hey, I'm an emergency room nurse.

768
00:50:53,996 --> 00:50:56,829
Working three shifts is just too hard.

769
00:50:56,830 --> 00:50:58,028
It's all on me today.

770
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:01,037
That jerk is at it again.

771
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:02,108
Darn it!

772
00:51:02,903 --> 00:51:04,815
Hey, you crazy?

773
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:06,249
What are you looking at?
Look down, will you?

774
00:51:06,503 --> 00:51:07,491
What are you glaring at?

775
00:51:07,492 --> 00:51:08,836
Oh, we're sorry.

776
00:51:08,837 --> 00:51:09,995
- Sorry.
- Hey.

777
00:51:09,996 --> 00:51:11,426
What are you doing?
Don't waste your energy and go.

778
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:13,260
- He's snickering.
- Let's go.

779
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:15,464
- Crazy bastard.
- We apologize.

780
00:51:18,317 --> 00:51:21,383
Just ignore him. It's all on me.

781
00:51:21,384 --> 00:51:22,596
Let's just go.

782
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:24,948
Hey, over there!

783
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,149
Let's go!

784
00:51:44,902 --> 00:51:46,311
Let's wait for the police.

785
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:47,610
Min-su, call the police.

786
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:50,642
Byeong-mu, come here quickly.
There's a fight going on.

787
00:51:52,403 --> 00:51:53,804
What's with you lot?

788
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:55,862
You're nothing but a bully.

789
00:51:56,337 --> 00:51:57,593
Ugh, darn it!

790
00:52:02,381 --> 00:52:03,615
You bastard!

791
00:52:04,737 --> 00:52:06,037
Stop, you bastard!

792
00:52:06,037 --> 00:52:07,617
Hey! Stop right there!

793
00:52:07,970 --> 00:52:09,034
Are you all right?

794
00:52:10,169 --> 00:52:12,510
They went after them,
so they'll get caught soon.

795
00:52:12,511 --> 00:52:13,837
Ugh, I'm screwed.

796
00:52:13,837 --> 00:52:16,633
It was really hard to catch
those happy slappers.

797
00:52:17,003 --> 00:52:19,670
- We got them thanks to you, sir.
- Oh, really?

798
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,837
- Yes, thank you.
- All right.

799
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:24,103
Hey, Jeong-woo!

800
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:25,462
Hey!

801
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,603
The police chief wants to meet you.

802
00:52:30,603 --> 00:52:31,623
Let's go.

803
00:52:33,411 --> 00:52:35,149
You're a real police officer.

804
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:38,960
I'll see you tomorrow.

805
00:52:38,961 --> 00:52:40,128
All right. Bye.

806
00:52:43,103 --> 00:52:45,336
- How long has it been?
- Is Min-su gone?

807
00:52:45,337 --> 00:52:46,398
That loser ran away.

808
00:52:48,432 --> 00:52:50,499
Auntie, is he really your son?

809
00:52:51,332 --> 00:52:53,837
Did your son go to prison
and get released today?

810
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,604
Is that why you were
in a daze all day?

811
00:52:57,399 --> 00:52:59,299
You should just say it
if things are hard.

812
00:52:59,299 --> 00:53:00,632
Otherwise, you'll end up
with a heartache.

813
00:53:00,632 --> 00:53:01,865
Why aren't you working?

814
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:04,099
I'm sorry.

815
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:07,882
I mean, I was just worried
about you.

816
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:12,252
So you're leaving tomorrow?

817
00:53:12,927 --> 00:53:13,932
Yeah.

818
00:53:15,251 --> 00:53:16,411
With your mom?

819
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,478
No.

820
00:53:19,731 --> 00:53:21,253
- Jeong-woo.
- Yeah?

821
00:53:21,898 --> 00:53:24,598
Call me whenever
you're having a hard time.

822
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:27,086
I'll help you in whichever way I can.

823
00:53:29,065 --> 00:53:29,932
Thanks.

824
00:53:31,332 --> 00:53:33,964
Ugh, this feels weird.

825
00:53:33,965 --> 00:53:36,205
You helped me all the time
when we were young.

826
00:53:40,557 --> 00:53:42,337
Come to your senses, you bastard!

827
00:53:43,411 --> 00:53:46,631
You killed Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun!

828
00:53:46,632 --> 00:53:49,899
The monkey wrench assumed to be
the murder weapon was discovered.

829
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:52,565
Did you kill Shim Bo-yeong,
your friend, in the warehouse?

830
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:03,199
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

831
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,099
I'm so forgetful these days.

832
00:54:05,099 --> 00:54:06,865
I had forgotten about
your release date.

833
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:10,635
- Jeong-woo.
- Yes?

834
00:54:10,636 --> 00:54:12,264
Remember what I told you before?

835
00:54:12,265 --> 00:54:13,765
That if anything happens to you,

836
00:54:14,065 --> 00:54:16,302
think of me as your father
and come to me.

837
00:54:20,265 --> 00:54:21,899
Try contacting them.

838
00:54:23,232 --> 00:54:25,723
You need to live a diligent life now,
especially for your mother's sake.

You should go to Seoul.

00:54:29,632 --> 00:54:31,732
You should take your mother

I'm sure you already know but it's

Let's start anew in another place,
Mom.

867
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,484
Let's go together.

868
00:57:16,485 --> 00:57:18,386
I'm going to stay here.

869
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:21,012
You should leave.

870
00:57:21,827 --> 00:57:22,865
You're still young.

871
00:57:27,704 --> 00:57:29,674
I don't know what I should do
from now on...

872
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:33,325
...and what kind of a life I must lead.

873
00:57:34,772 --> 00:57:37,072
I can't do anything without you, Mom.

874
00:57:38,765 --> 00:57:39,997
That's okay.

875
00:57:40,565 --> 00:57:42,365
What you're experiencing
right now is nothing.

876
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,904
- I'm okay.
- You're not okay.

877
00:57:46,992 --> 00:57:48,592
I'm the one who committed
the crime,

878
00:57:49,018 --> 00:57:50,818
so why should you live like this,
Mom?

879
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,118
Dad is not with us anymore.

880
00:58:02,165 --> 00:58:03,799
I missed you so much...

881
00:58:03,799 --> 00:58:06,032
...but you didn't visit me even once
for the past 10 years.

882
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:10,799
Did you stay here like this
because of me?

883
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:20,227
There are people
who still haven't found...

884
00:58:20,228 --> 00:58:22,561
...their children's bodies
even after 10 years.

885
00:58:24,399 --> 00:58:26,699
They live in hell right now.

886
00:58:29,604 --> 00:58:31,371
You should leave this place.

887
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:35,336
And don't ever come back here.
That's what you need to do.

888

- Did you come here to give me this?
- Yes.

- Have you kept up with your drawing?
- Yes.

897
01:00:16,877 --> 01:00:18,499
You should come in...

898
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:19,539
Su-oh.

899
01:00:25,132 --> 01:00:26,400
Su-oh, thanks.

900
01:00:28,965 --> 01:00:30,100
This is prime beef brisket.

901
01:01:12,125 --> 01:01:13,465
<i>You're no better than a dog!</i>

902
01:01:13,465 --> 01:01:14,999
<i>Hey, you should smack the head.</i>

903
01:01:14,999 --> 01:01:16,932
<i>You said that's how you killed her.</i>

904
01:01:16,932 --> 01:01:19,799
<i>My daughter! Where's my Bo-yeong?</i>

905
01:01:19,799 --> 01:01:21,882
<i>- Kill him.</i>
<i>- You Bastard!</i>

906
01:02:39,038 --> 01:02:42,687
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

907
01:02:42,688 --> 01:02:44,655
<i>It doesn't seem to be an accident</i>
<i>or a suicide attempt.</i>

908
01:02:44,655 --> 01:02:46,475
<i>Someone could have pushed her...</i>

909
01:02:46,475 --> 01:02:48,531
<i>...or perhaps there was</i>
<i>a physical altercation.</i>

910
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,093
<i>Show me what the Major Crime Unit</i>
<i>can do.</i>

911
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,864
<i>I'm going to find the person...</i>

912
01:02:53,864 --> 01:02:55,539
<i>...who did that to mom.</i>

913
01:02:55,539 --> 01:02:57,411
<i>Isn't everyone here so strange?</i>

914
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,411
<i>Nobody looks concerned.</i>

915
01:02:59,773 --> 01:03:01,246
<i>But think about Jeong-woo.</i>

916
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:02,613
<i>No one can't take her side.</i>

917
01:03:04,144 --> 01:03:06,552
<i>Why is this person running</i>
<i>when it's raining?</i>

918
01:03:07,808 --> 01:03:09,220
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

919
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:12,009
<i>You know the person caught on</i>
<i>the security camera, don't you?</i>

920
01:03:13,944 --> 01:03:15,164
<i>You went onto the overpass, right?</i>

921
01:03:15,164 --> 01:03:17,314
<i>Did you push Ms. Jeong Geum-hee</i>
<i>from the overpass?</i>

922
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:19,815
<i>Mr. Yang, did you</i>
<i>do that to my mom?</i>

923
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:23,709
<i>You should have pushed me</i>
<i>and not my mom!</i>

924
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,733
