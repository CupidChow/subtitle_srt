BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

00:00:06,822 --> 00:00:09,041
<i>A GOOD FRIEND TO MEET</i>

00:00:09,819 --> 00:00:13,815
PRODUCTION SUPPORTED BY
MINISTRY OF CULTURE, SPORTS AND TOURISM
KOREA CREATIVE CONTENT AGENCY

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,381
Go!

5
00:00:15,381 --> 00:00:17,527
<i>It was the day after the CSAT.</i>

6
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,291
<i>So I told my friends that</i>

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:20,919
<i>we should drink at my house.</i>

8
00:00:20,919 --> 00:00:23,416
<i>I was supposed to buy groceries</i>
<i>with Da-eun,</i>

9
00:00:23,735 --> 00:00:25,915
<i>but she hadn't come to school that day</i>
<i>and couldn't be reached.</i>

10
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:27,955
You're just doing this
because of Da-eun.

11
00:00:27,955 --> 00:00:29,556
She's...

12
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:31,263
A slut.

13
00:00:31,263 --> 00:00:32,376
<i>So I canceled all the plans</i>
<i>I had with my friends...</i>

14
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,357
<i>...and just drank alone at my house.</i>

15
00:00:36,887 --> 00:00:38,329
Bo-yeong...

16
00:00:38,353 --> 00:00:39,455
And the victim might not be just one,

17
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:41,130
but two or even more.

18
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,376
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

19
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,267
You are under arrest on suspicion of
murder of Shim Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun...

20
00:00:44,268 --> 00:00:46,676
...and abandonment of their dead bodies.

21
00:00:46,677 --> 00:00:49,483
You became dead drunk
the night before last...

22
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:50,932
...and went to the warehouse, right?

23
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:51,815
No.

24
00:00:51,816 --> 00:00:53,772
Please find my Bo-yeong.

25
00:00:53,773 --> 00:00:55,660
Find Bo-yeong! You bastard!

26
00:00:55,684 --> 00:00:58,950
And killed Shim Bo-yeong
and Park Da-eun there!

27
00:00:59,044 --> 00:00:59,905
Gu-tak.

28
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,562
THE DOCK
The accused is sentenced to 10 years.

29
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:08,734
It must've been really tough.

30
00:01:08,782 --> 00:01:10,396
About the new team head
who's coming tomorrow...

31
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:11,068
He's coming here
because he caused trouble.

32
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,342
Supposedly, he beats people
to a pulp like a gangster would.

33
00:01:13,343 --> 00:01:15,775
Oh, come on. Look at the world
we're living in now.

34
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,596
We can't even hit criminals
without a reason.

35
00:01:17,597 --> 00:01:19,636
You can't just crash a car
and run away.

36
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:21,202
Hey.

37
00:01:21,203 --> 00:01:22,194
Look here.

38
00:01:22,194 --> 00:01:23,125
Do you know about
the major crime unit?

39
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:24,531
So what?

40
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:26,314
You bastard.

41
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,160
How could you do that
to my daughter?

42
00:01:28,161 --> 00:01:30,824
Where did you put my daughter
after killing her?

43
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:32,828
The moment you became a murderer,

44
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:35,029
you stopped being my son.

45
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,190
Don't you dare step foot
in this place ever again.

46
00:01:37,191 --> 00:01:38,530
Nobody welcomes you here.

47
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,550
Hey, Jeong-woo!

48
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,071
Goh Jeong-woo!

49
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:41,783
Have you been well?

50
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:43,537
Hey, Jeong-woo!

51
00:01:44,763 --> 00:01:46,860
Jeong-woo, remember
what I told you before?

52
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,583
That if anything happens to you,

53
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:50,905
think of me as your father
and come to me.

54
00:01:50,906 --> 00:01:52,105
Uncle.

55
00:01:52,106 --> 00:01:53,887
Is Su-oh doing well?

56
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,625
What kind of a person
was Goh Jeong-woo?

57
00:01:56,626 --> 00:01:59,936
He seems too confident for a murderer.

58
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:03,065
Jeong-woo's mom got into
an accident.

59
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:03,821
What accident?

60
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:06,513
She fell from the overpass,
and is unconscious.

61
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:10,163
Show me what the Major Crime Unit
can do.

62
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,079
I don't think it was an accident.

63
00:02:12,103 --> 00:02:14,011
I'm going to find the person...

64
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:15,217
...who did that to mom.

65
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,316
Where were you this morning?

66
00:02:22,178 --> 00:02:23,378
Let's go.

67
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,124
Let's go.

68
00:02:41,796 --> 00:02:43,196
This is amazing!

69
00:02:56,503 --> 00:02:58,152
Let's go!

70
00:02:58,396 --> 00:03:00,629
Wait a minute!

71
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,116
Let's go! Let's go!

72
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:08,549
Faster!

73
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,054
Hey, we're out of gas.
Let's go back.

74
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,381
Min-su.

75
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,183
Byeong-mu...

76
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,686
Jeong-woo.

77
00:03:55,859 --> 00:03:57,238
Bo-yeong.

78
00:03:57,903 --> 00:03:59,208
Jeong-woo.

79
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:05,317
Bo-yeong!

80
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:15,374
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE
EPISODE 3

81
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:18,358
If you don't want to get stabbed,
don't say a word and just leave.

82
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:20,393
- Let me just ask a few questions.
- Get out.

83
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:21,964
Get out, get out.

84
00:04:22,776 --> 00:04:24,309
How dare a murderer
go around here? Darn.

85
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,004
He killed two people.

86
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:28,116
Remember that murder case?

87
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:31,083
The one they couldn't find the bodies.
He's the murderer.

88
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,849
You vermin!
You're not even human!

89
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:34,964
How scary.

90
00:04:34,965 --> 00:04:37,656
Do you remember who bought this?

91
00:04:39,062 --> 00:04:41,655
Oh, on the pedestrian overpass.

92
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,360
But who might you be?

93
00:04:45,976 --> 00:04:47,453
I'm her son.

94
00:04:48,264 --> 00:04:49,598
I remember.

95
00:04:49,978 --> 00:04:52,578
She was very particular about
choosing the clothes.

96
00:04:52,932 --> 00:04:56,142
It almost took her 30 minutes
to pick a single shirt.

97
00:04:57,685 --> 00:04:59,251
May I see...

98
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,421
...the security camera footage
from around here?

99
00:05:04,698 --> 00:05:07,631
The police took all of it away.

100
00:06:07,716 --> 00:06:10,404
- Why are you following me?
- Oh, wait, wait.

101
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:13,067
It's me.

102
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:14,268
The detective.

103
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:17,838
Are you all right?

104
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:19,576
Oh.

105
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,654
These are the last things
my mom purchased.

106
00:06:24,678 --> 00:06:26,054
Meat and a shirt.

107
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:28,211
It can't be suicide.
Please take a look.

108
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,840
So this is how you choose
to threaten me?

109
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,146
I know you have your doubts...

110
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,781
Why are you following me?

111
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,849
It seems like you have a lot
to say to me.

112
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,572
Well, how about we get some drinks?

113
00:06:45,002 --> 00:06:46,202
Why?

114
00:06:46,676 --> 00:06:48,859
Is that because you
go through a black out?

115
00:06:48,883 --> 00:06:50,853
Yes, that's why I quit drinking
10 years ago.

116
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:52,526
Still!

117
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,400
You have to remember.

118
00:06:55,008 --> 00:06:56,992
You need to find your friends.

119
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:01,793
All criminal scum are the same.

120
00:07:01,817 --> 00:07:04,426
All they do is scheme
how to get away.

121
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,416
They always say they have no memory,
or they don't know...

122
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,592
They always make up excuses
or plead the Fifth.

123
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:09,993
You're no different.

124
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,867
I've been curious about this
since last time.

125
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:16,000
Why do you keep
talking down to me, punk?

126
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,726
That's how I speak
to all criminal scum.

127
00:07:23,162 --> 00:07:26,046
I'll find the culprit who hurt my mom.

128
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:27,322
No.

129
00:07:27,825 --> 00:07:29,867
That's not who you have to find.

130
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,336
You just find your dead friends.

131
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,375
You murderer scum.

132
00:07:42,183 --> 00:07:44,517
NA-GYEOM

133
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,520
Hello?

134
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:51,312
I'll go there now.

135
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:59,046
Don't you follow me.

136
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,453
Damn, this is making me mad.

137
00:08:09,477 --> 00:08:11,649
How the hell did he know
I was following him?

138
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,576
<i>It was raining, but he ran</i>
<i>without using his umbrella?</i>

139
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:22,562
<i>Why?</i>

140
00:08:23,355 --> 00:08:25,124
BIG CLOTHES FASHION

141
00:08:28,748 --> 00:08:31,667
<i>Byeong-mu's father</i>
<i>might know something.</i>

142
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:49,412
<i>Everyone in this village seems</i>
<i>to despise Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

143
00:08:49,436 --> 00:08:50,356
<i>And...</i>

144
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,580
Jeong-woo...

145
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:53,582
...isn't a victim.

146
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,516
<i>Goh Jeong-woo who</i>
<i>just got out of prison...</i>

147
00:08:55,517 --> 00:08:57,316
<i>...must have been the trigger.</i>

148
00:08:57,317 --> 00:08:58,782
He's a murderer.

149
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:00,374
<i>Everyone is a suspect.</i>

150
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:02,549
<i>Everyone in this village.</i>

151
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:08,927
<i>This is getting interesting.</i>

152
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:33,710
CEO, I've decided.

153
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,225
"Snow White".

154
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:38,983
I've read it and it's interesting.

155
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,410
Okay.

156
00:11:07,776 --> 00:11:10,473
CHUNGJU WEEDAHM INTEGRATIVE HOSPITAL

157
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:15,885
Excuse me. Where is the patient
who was staying here?

158
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:19,068
Did she die, by any chance?

159
00:11:20,141 --> 00:11:21,357
Did she?

160
00:11:22,212 --> 00:11:24,108
No, she was transferred.

161
00:11:35,383 --> 00:11:37,602
How did she get so bad?

162
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:40,284
I was thoughtless.

163
00:11:40,962 --> 00:11:43,270
I should've looked out
for your mother sooner.

164
00:11:44,156 --> 00:11:46,516
You should have contacted me
right away.

165
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,149
What is wrong with you?

166
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,350
I'm sorry...

167
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:53,249
What about the thing I requested?

168
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,529
- Hanguk University Hospital?
- Yes.

169
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,728
It shouldn't be too long.

170
00:11:55,729 --> 00:11:58,429
I made some calls on my way here.

171
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,362
Thank you, CEO.

172
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,502
You're here.

173
00:12:05,931 --> 00:12:07,365
What happened?

174
00:12:07,723 --> 00:12:10,198
Oh, I'll go and buy more beverages.

175
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:12,355
There isn't any coffee...

176
00:12:13,787 --> 00:12:16,093
I thought it'd be better for her
to receive intensive treatment here...

177
00:12:16,117 --> 00:12:17,796
...rather than being in the ICU.

178
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,022
Who's this?

179
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,080
My CEO helped out a lot.

180
00:12:23,872 --> 00:12:25,193
Thank you.

181
00:12:26,017 --> 00:12:27,480
Then...

182
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,631
Is that his mother?

183
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,724
And how do you two know each other?

184
00:12:36,009 --> 00:12:37,425
We're friends.

185
00:12:42,681 --> 00:12:45,176
Let's step out for a chat, Na-gyeom.

186
00:12:48,744 --> 00:12:50,112
I'm screwed.

187
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,393
Should I change jobs?

188
00:12:55,479 --> 00:12:59,332
Hmm, let's go over each point
one by one.

189
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:04,418
This isn't the right time
for you to be in an independent film.

190
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:08,660
Sure you didn't choose that script
because the location's near here?

191
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:10,949
The person lying down on the bed...

192
00:13:11,063 --> 00:13:12,785
...isn't your mother,

193
00:13:12,865 --> 00:13:14,629
but that boy's mother.

194
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,775
Well, now.

195
00:13:18,739 --> 00:13:21,863
How should I interpret this situation?

196
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:27,293
CEO...

197
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,473
My friend's mother is in
critical condition.

198
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,701
I need to help him.

199
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:37,998
Right?

200
00:13:38,406 --> 00:13:39,842
That's what this is, right?

201
00:13:40,114 --> 00:13:42,598
You're helping out a friend, right?

202
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,418
Su-oh.

203
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,699
Su-oh?

204
00:13:57,371 --> 00:13:58,863
Do you want ice cream?

205
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:05,978
What is it that you're drawing?

206
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,575
Geez. I won't look.

207
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:16,080
Su-oh.

208
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,855
Do you want to go hiking with me?

209
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,020
The kitchen lady got into an accident,

210
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:22,221
so we're closing for a day or two.

211
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,022
We could go look at flowers.

212
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:27,388
We could enjoy the sky.

213
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:29,888
You can take your things
and paint as well.

214
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:31,822
- I don't want to.
- Why not?

215
00:14:31,823 --> 00:14:35,122
We'll visit the kitchen lady
in the hospital on our way back.

216
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:37,022
- Jeong-woo's mom?
- Yes.

217
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:40,088
The fact that she hasn't gained
consciousness yet...

218
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:42,156
...means she must be in a bad condition.

219
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,932
I'm busy, you should go there alone.

220
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:48,911
- It's because of this painting, right?
- Stop that.

221
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:49,900
Show me what it is.

222
00:14:49,924 --> 00:14:52,002
- Give that back to me then.
- Stop.

223
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:56,168
Gosh, why are you acting so cheap?

224
00:14:56,584 --> 00:14:57,784
I'm cheap.

225
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,421
When's Professor Yun getting here?

226
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,567
I said when's
Professor Yun getting here!

227
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,445
Geez.

228
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:30,252
You moron!

229
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:36,594
You said she had an aortic rupture?

230
00:15:36,618 --> 00:15:37,823
Sorry?

231
00:15:38,155 --> 00:15:39,933
Yes, sir...

232
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,168
This isn't an easy operation.

233
00:15:42,556 --> 00:15:44,722
- Make sure you explain properly.
- Sorry?

234
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,142
Wait...

235
00:15:46,523 --> 00:15:49,156
Wasn't this an appendectomy?

236
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:53,980
Can't you do anything right?

237
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,293
I'm sorry, sir.

238
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:57,523
Just wrap this up and
you take a few days off.

239
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,700
04:20 p.m.

240
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,731
Mr. Ju Won has passed away.

241
00:16:08,293 --> 00:16:11,299
You dare let those med student scrubs
question the professor's surgery?

242
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:12,988
And if that's not bad enough, what?

243
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:14,240
Victim?

244
00:16:14,956 --> 00:16:16,799
They say he's a victim.

245
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:19,088
A victim?

246
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:21,255
They say he's a victim!

247
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:23,320
That we need to apologize!

248
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,199
Damn it!

249
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:35,746
It's so peaceful.

250
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:44,736
JEONG GEUM-HEE

251
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:12,506
MUCHEON SARANG HOSPITAL

252
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,660
Mr. Yang.

253
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,522
You're here because of my mom, right?

254
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:32,756
I'm cleaning.

255
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,789
You're a witness.

256
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:38,704
Please be truthful about...

257
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:40,462
...what you saw that day.

258
00:17:41,123 --> 00:17:43,812
Mr. Yang, there must be a reason
why you came here.

259
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:45,830
Why are you lying?

260
00:17:47,823 --> 00:17:50,340
Why are you doing this? Darn it!

261
00:17:50,902 --> 00:17:51,965
Mr. Yang.

262
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:54,323
MEN'S TOILET

263
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,923
Why are you hiding it?

264
00:18:03,323 --> 00:18:06,582
The chief and Byeong-mu
are both cops, so why?

265
00:18:07,502 --> 00:18:09,398
What has Byeong-mu got to do with this?

266
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:13,610
My mom didn't do anything wrong.

267
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:16,465
How dare you mention my son's name?

268
00:18:17,741 --> 00:18:21,324
Please, I'm begging you.

269
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,830
Please, just disappear.

270
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:29,730
You don't belong here!

271
00:18:29,754 --> 00:18:31,787
If you just disappear,

272
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,211
nothing will go wrong!

273
00:18:34,856 --> 00:18:36,223
Tell me...

274
00:18:42,492 --> 00:18:43,692
Oh, how cute.

275
00:18:44,946 --> 00:18:46,855
Doggy.

276
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:48,629
Hi.

277
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,053
- Isn't she cute?
- Yes!

278
00:18:50,077 --> 00:18:51,377
Her name's Bok-sun.

279
00:18:51,401 --> 00:18:54,090
Bok-sun, she's taking a photo.
Say cheese!

280
00:18:55,164 --> 00:18:56,537
Look here.

281
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:10,144
Excuse me, sir.
But where did you get that bone?

282
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:13,382
It's a pork hock
from the drain over there.

283
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:17,683
Bok-sun has such a great sense of smell.

284
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,565
Don't you, now?

285
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:28,735
No.

286
00:19:29,993 --> 00:19:31,893
Not at Mucheon Garden.

287
00:19:32,274 --> 00:19:33,790
I'll see you at home.

288
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:36,777
I'll see you at your home.

289
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:53,413
<i>Let's retrace the steps of</i>
<i>Jeong Geum-hee on that day.</i>

290
00:19:54,173 --> 00:19:57,594
<i>Jeong Geum-hee</i>
<i>went to the clothing store.</i>

291
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:03,356
<i>Then at what point did</i>
<i>the culprit start following her?</i>

292
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:32,350
Hello.

293
00:20:33,606 --> 00:20:35,573
I'm here from the
Mucheon Police Station.

294
00:21:06,462 --> 00:21:07,929
Just this, please.

295
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:27,164
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

296
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,956
Oh, this is Bo-yeong's mom.

297
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:32,843
Yes.

298
00:21:33,789 --> 00:21:35,001
Yes.

299
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:48,441
Why isn't anyone home?

300
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:49,389
Huh?

301
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,139
It's dinnertime, where is everyone?

302
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,902
Hey, Bo-yeong!

303
00:21:54,986 --> 00:21:56,667
Bo-yeong's mom!

304
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:58,986
Geez. I'm dying of starvation,
where is she?

305
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:01,616
- Bo-yeong, my mom says...
- Hey, Bo-yeong!

306
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,281
That you can come over
with your mom for steamed crab.

307
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,883
I totally forgot about it.

308
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:10,054
I'll call your mom. Let's go, okay?

309
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,507
Let's go.

310
00:22:13,062 --> 00:22:14,429
Come on.

311
00:22:25,784 --> 00:22:27,950
- Heung-su.
- Yes.

312
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:29,855
What brings you here?

313
00:22:30,732 --> 00:22:32,299
Chu-ho's here as well.

314
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:33,388
Is that right?

315
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:35,720
Are we having a
neighborhood meeting or something?

316
00:22:38,674 --> 00:22:39,589
Where were you off to?

317
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,544
I should at least do some work.

318
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:44,535
I'm the only one earning a living
in this house.

319
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:46,832
I have to send Hye-yeong money
for her overseas study.

320
00:22:46,856 --> 00:22:49,105
Right, you're doing a great job.

321
00:22:50,222 --> 00:22:51,000
I'll let you go.

322
00:22:51,024 --> 00:22:52,788
- All right, have fun.
- Yeah.

323
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,056
Bye.

324
00:22:56,387 --> 00:22:58,478
<i>So that's Bo-yeong's house now.</i>

325
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:02,629
<i>But why did Byeong-mu's dad come here?</i>

326
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:05,455
Have a drink.

327
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:07,055
I need to drive.

328
00:23:07,056 --> 00:23:08,153
Oh, you're here.

329
00:23:08,177 --> 00:23:09,563
Sit down.

330
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:21,288
- Byeong-mu!
- Hello.

331
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:24,088
- Hello, Detective!
- Oh, hello.

332
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:25,288
- It's nice to meet you.
- Same.

333
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:27,359
Even if you don't take out
any other policy,

334
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:29,188
you must take out this one.

335
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:31,388
This is a comprehensive package
that includes medical expenses.

336
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:33,055
And it guarantees up to 90%!

337
00:23:33,056 --> 00:23:35,552
You'd be a fool not to take it.

338
00:23:35,823 --> 00:23:37,355
Wow.

339
00:23:37,356 --> 00:23:39,713
You're so good at explaining this!

340
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:43,863
Has anybody told you that
you resemble Kim Hee-sun?

341
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,144
About three times?

342
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,822
I'll have a think about this
and give you a call.

343
00:23:52,823 --> 00:23:54,488
Can I have your phone?
I'll put my number in.

344
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:55,622
I can give you my business card.

345
00:23:55,623 --> 00:23:57,122
Hey, come now.

346
00:23:57,123 --> 00:23:59,643
No one exchanges business cards
in this day and age.

347
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:02,995
We're like family,
we can just exchange numbers.

348
00:24:03,049 --> 00:24:04,849
Everyone does that these days.

349
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,527
Is that right?

350
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,210
- Here.
- Thank you.

351
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:12,862
Oh, how do you open this?

352
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:15,696
- Oh, like this.
- Right.

353
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:19,694
Mrs. Lee, would you like some cake?

354
00:24:19,718 --> 00:24:21,518
This place has the best cake.

355
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:22,478
Is that right?

356
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,801
All this talk is giving me
a sugar craving.

357
00:24:24,825 --> 00:24:26,192
- I'll go buy some cake.
- Sure.

358
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:27,682
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

359
00:24:29,786 --> 00:24:32,047
RECENT

360
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,453
Why did you do that
to Jeong-woo's mom?

361
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:43,644
What, what do you mean?

362
00:24:43,856 --> 00:24:45,262
I saw you.

363
00:24:45,865 --> 00:24:47,949
I saw you push her over.

364
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,956
What?

365
00:24:51,975 --> 00:24:53,175
Is that true?

366
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:55,465
No.

367
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:57,722
Jeong-woo said he would leave!

368
00:24:57,723 --> 00:25:00,856
You could have waited
just one more day! Why...

369
00:25:01,223 --> 00:25:04,046
Hey, what are you talking about?

370
00:25:06,272 --> 00:25:08,976
Are you saying this because
I harassed Jeong-woo's mom?

371
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,555
Geez, if you're feeling that upset
about this,

372
00:25:11,556 --> 00:25:14,955
you should go and clean her stool
and take care of her.

373
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:15,823
Damn it!

374
00:25:15,824 --> 00:25:17,588
Hey, come on.

375
00:25:17,589 --> 00:25:18,899
If you suspect me that much...

376
00:25:18,923 --> 00:25:20,032
Then fine.

377
00:25:20,033 --> 00:25:22,222
Just report me to the police. Go on.

378
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,522
Do it.

379
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:26,042
- What are you waiting for? Do it!
- I'm...

380
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:29,927
...holding back because of Bo-yeong.

381
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:32,255
Damn it.

382
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,402
Just throw that away.

383
00:25:38,256 --> 00:25:39,888
What?

384
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:41,646
Hey, come on.

385
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:45,073
Geez!

386
00:25:47,523 --> 00:25:50,123
Hey, what's going on here? Huh?

387
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:53,067
Are you certain?
Are you certain about this?

388
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:58,270
I'm sure he'll take care of it
after what I just said.

389
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,397
That punk.

390
00:26:01,822 --> 00:26:05,622
Darn it, you're on his side,
and yet he's flipping out.

391
00:26:05,623 --> 00:26:07,155
You shouldn't have helped him out.

392
00:26:07,156 --> 00:26:09,052
Just report him now, it's not too late.

393
00:26:09,178 --> 00:26:10,455
You can just call Byeong-mu.

394
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:11,788
No.

395
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:13,055
Don't you get it?

396
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:16,099
What? Stop beating around the bush.

397
00:26:16,123 --> 00:26:18,589
Just tell it to me straight.

398
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:22,667
If Dong-min gets arrested,
Jeong-woo will...

399
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,949
...try to settle down here
with his mom.

400
00:26:26,023 --> 00:26:28,623
No way, we can't have that.

401
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:31,909
I cannot live with that murderer.

402
00:26:35,056 --> 00:26:36,256
<i>Husband?</i>

403
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:39,256
This one's good. So is the tiramisu.

404
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,232
I should get the tiramisu.

405
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:42,023
- Tiramisu?
- Yes.

406
00:26:42,024 --> 00:26:43,155
- Should we do that?
- Yes.

407
00:26:43,156 --> 00:26:44,408
Ma'am.

408
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:46,565
I've just been called to duty.

409
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:48,155
But what about the insurance?

410
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:50,455
Oh, I'll sleep on it and call you.

411
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:51,622
Oh, right.

412
00:26:51,623 --> 00:26:52,788
- Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

413
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:53,523
Let's go.

414
00:26:53,524 --> 00:26:54,688
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

415
00:26:54,689 --> 00:26:56,155
- Sorry.
- Give me a call.

416
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:57,615
- I will.
- Bye.

417
00:26:58,315 --> 00:27:01,581
Are you really going to reinvestigate
the overpass case?

418
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:03,522
Yeah.

419
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:08,022
It doesn't feel right to ignore it
when we have a suspect.

420
00:27:08,023 --> 00:27:08,951
- Don't you all agree?
- Yes.

421
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:09,988
That's true but...

422
00:27:09,989 --> 00:27:13,354
Can we really do this without
reporting to the section chief?

423
00:27:13,556 --> 00:27:15,699
It's clearly possible if we
base it on conviction.

424
00:27:15,723 --> 00:27:18,856
Yeah, it feels dirty to ignore,
after everything we've seen.

425
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,019
That's what I'm saying.

426
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:24,870
We just need to find
one more clue from now on.

427
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,823
Shall we begin?

428
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,047
Yes, sir.

429
00:27:28,489 --> 00:27:29,689
Let's go.

430
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:39,217
Huh? I've found it.

431
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:41,256
I've found it, I've found it!

432
00:27:41,256 --> 00:27:42,256
- You found it?
- Yes.

433
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:43,988
- Here, here.
- Did you find it?

434
00:27:43,989 --> 00:27:45,688
- Here, here.
- Let me take a look.

435
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:47,018
Here.

436
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:49,288
It's Bo-yeong's dad!
It's definitely him!

437
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:50,189
- Good job.
- Thank you.

438
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,817
Okay. We're going to check
all the security cameras...

439
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:55,588
...in the shops and on the roads
along the route the suspect took.

440
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:57,622
You and I will scan
all the nearby shops.

441
00:27:57,623 --> 00:27:58,823
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

442
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:10,050
HANAREUM MART

443
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:11,123
Geez.

444
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,056
Damn it.

445
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:51,802
Hey, you punk. Give that back.

446
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:53,679
This is what you wore that day, right?

447
00:29:54,394 --> 00:29:55,594
Hand it over, you rude bastard...

448
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:57,173
Why did you do that to my mom?

449
00:29:59,649 --> 00:30:00,849
What?

450
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:02,533
Then what about you?

451
00:30:02,557 --> 00:30:04,394
Why did you do that to my Bo-yeong?

452
00:30:04,789 --> 00:30:07,289
When I think of Bo-yeong,
I feel so sorry...

453
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,393
...that I can't even swallow any food.

454
00:30:09,394 --> 00:30:10,622
But you...

455
00:30:10,623 --> 00:30:14,022
How can you be
so calm and collected?

456
00:30:14,023 --> 00:30:15,922
Then slit my throat,

457
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:17,822
smash my head in,

458
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:19,822
or stab me in the gut and kill me.

459
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:21,689
You should've done it to me.

460
00:30:22,575 --> 00:30:24,575
Why would you harm my innocent mom?

461
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:28,988
You can't do that to my mom...
Why did you do that to my mom?

462
00:30:28,989 --> 00:30:30,189
Yes.

463
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:33,422
It should be you
in the hospital right now,

464
00:30:33,423 --> 00:30:35,122
not your mom.

465
00:30:35,123 --> 00:30:36,255
It should be you!

466
00:30:36,256 --> 00:30:38,427
You bastard!

467
00:30:38,729 --> 00:30:41,196
Hand it over, hand it over.

468
00:30:42,484 --> 00:30:44,422
Hand it over, you bastard!

469
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:45,756
Hand it over...

470
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:46,957
Hand it...

471
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:53,483
You...

472
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:56,055
You...

473
00:30:56,056 --> 00:30:57,489
Yeah.

474
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:03,654
Kill me.

475
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,249
Kill you?

476
00:31:05,273 --> 00:31:07,639
All right, I'll kill you...

477
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:10,073
You're dead today.

478
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,386
You bastard!

479
00:31:13,891 --> 00:31:15,123
Shim Dong-min!

480
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,091
Calm down and drop your weapon.

481
00:31:16,092 --> 00:31:17,723
- Grab him.
- What's this?

482
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:19,739
- Who is it?
- Mr. Shim.

483
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:20,938
- Mr. Shim.
- Let go!

484
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,129
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Jeong Geum-hee.

485
00:31:23,153 --> 00:31:24,900
What are you talking about, you jerk?

486
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,891
Just go quietly.

487
00:31:25,892 --> 00:31:27,156
Byeong-mu,
what are you doing right now?

488
00:31:27,157 --> 00:31:29,071
- Just go quietly.
- Don't you know who I am?

489
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:30,868
- Go quietly.
- Jeong-woo, you bastard!

490
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:32,436
I told you already!

491
00:31:32,437 --> 00:31:34,137
They're clothes, shoes and a hat.

492
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:35,838
Right, collect all of that.

493
00:31:36,105 --> 00:31:36,920
Hey!

494
00:31:36,944 --> 00:31:38,983
Let go of me, you punks!

495
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:51,080
Look.

496
00:31:51,104 --> 00:31:54,061
Look how much the people here hate you.

497
00:31:56,397 --> 00:31:58,101
Your mom, Ms. Jeong Geum-hee...

498
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,479
Right.

499
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:03,111
It was because of you.

500
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,865
Everything happened because of you.

501
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,607
You...

502
00:32:07,937 --> 00:32:10,037
...have no right to blame anyone.

503
00:32:37,421 --> 00:32:38,485
YANG BYEONG-MU

504
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:42,955
Chief! Chief!

505
00:32:42,979 --> 00:32:43,987
What is it?

506
00:32:44,011 --> 00:32:46,718
We got the real culprit
behind the overpass case.

507
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:51,884
- What?
- You'll be shocked to hear this...

508
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:55,896
But it's Shim Bo-yeong's father.
The girl that Goh Jeong-woo killed.

509
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:57,123
Shim Dong-min?

510
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:58,324
Yes.

511
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:02,324
Are you sure?

512
00:33:02,325 --> 00:33:06,244
Well, I mean, he did hold a grudge
against him so...

513
00:33:06,268 --> 00:33:08,405
It could've been revenge...

514
00:33:09,816 --> 00:33:10,883
The Major Crime Unit...

515
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:13,827
Gosh, he truly is talented.

516
00:33:16,991 --> 00:33:19,290
Hey, go home and get some rest,
will you?

517
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,143
You look terrible right now.

518
00:33:21,144 --> 00:33:22,410
Byeong-mu.

519
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,497
About Bo-yeong's father...

520
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,582
They began investigating him, right?

521
00:33:26,583 --> 00:33:28,450
I'll call you, okay? Please go home.

522
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:30,063
Byeong-mu.

523
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:31,500
Right, did you bring it?

524
00:33:35,063 --> 00:33:36,630
This is a human bone, right?

525
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:39,664
Well, I showed that photo
of yours to Forensics,

526
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:41,531
and they told me to bring it in.

527
00:33:41,738 --> 00:33:43,814
I think the heavy rain must've
brought it down from somewhere.

528
00:33:43,838 --> 00:33:45,970
I did hear that a few
of the unmarked graves...

529
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:47,805
...up on the mountain were damaged.

530
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:50,604
But why did you go to Cheonsu Village?

531
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:52,971
I just went to visit a sacred place.

532
00:33:54,938 --> 00:33:57,237
Let's get lunch together next time.

533
00:33:57,238 --> 00:33:58,438
Sure.

534
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,370
Jeong-woo, go on.

535
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,588
Yeah.

536
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,427
Excuse me.

537
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:09,838
I overheard your conversation
with Byeong-mu.

538
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,135
That bone...

539
00:34:14,947 --> 00:34:16,380
I'm sorry.

540
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,958
Let me just ask you one thing.

541
00:34:19,629 --> 00:34:21,029
That bone...

542
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:24,129
Where did you find it?

543
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:32,897
Oh, wait.
There are several drains there.

544
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:35,970
Oh, whatever.

545
00:34:35,971 --> 00:34:38,081
It's none of my business.

546
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:46,628
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

547
00:35:20,961 --> 00:35:22,808
As I explained,

548
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:26,979
all the evidence and circumstances
point toward you, sir.

549
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,551
It wasn't me.

550
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:32,159
Bring Goh Jeong-woo here.

551
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:34,343
Bring the bastard
who killed my daughter.

552
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,945
Did you do it because of Goh Jeong-woo?

553
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:40,003
It obviously wasn't me.

554
00:35:46,907 --> 00:35:49,237
Doing this will only
put you at a disadvantage.

555
00:35:49,405 --> 00:35:53,605
Sir, you got out of a taxi
at 10 a.m. yesterday and...

556
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:57,058
...followed Ms. Jeong Geum-hee
up the overpass, right?

557
00:35:57,271 --> 00:35:58,651
Where's the police chief?

558
00:35:59,405 --> 00:36:01,181
Where's Gu-tak?

559
00:36:05,124 --> 00:36:06,334
Gu-tak!

560
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:10,563
Gu-tak.

561
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,785
Gu-tak.

562
00:36:13,132 --> 00:36:15,433
Gu-tak! Gu-tak!

563
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:17,437
Geez.

564
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:18,556
Gu-tak!

565
00:36:18,557 --> 00:36:20,667
I guess he's trying to
grasp at straws...

566
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,589
Do I look like straw to you?

567
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:27,765
Oh, no, sir. I didn't mean that.

568
00:36:27,912 --> 00:36:28,897
I mean...

569
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,897
It's just that you two are very close...

570
00:36:35,083 --> 00:36:36,869
- Section Chief Kim.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:39,160
If you prioritize connection and
school ties in this tiny village,

572
00:36:39,184 --> 00:36:40,754
you'll get nowhere.

573
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,517
Yes, sir.

574
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:44,681
I'm not like that.

575
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,105
No, of course not.

576
00:36:48,327 --> 00:36:49,593
Do you all understand?

577
00:36:49,617 --> 00:36:50,818
Yes, sir.

578
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:54,222
Police Chief!

579
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,781
Where's our police chief? Huh?

580
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:59,138
Gu-tak!

581
00:36:59,538 --> 00:37:00,738
Mr. Shim Dong-min.

582
00:37:01,478 --> 00:37:03,605
The chief's already gone home.

583
00:37:03,729 --> 00:37:05,224
He's not here.

584
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,559
He's telling me to go home, right?

585
00:37:15,531 --> 00:37:16,869
Gosh.

586
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:22,023
Oh.

587
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,380
It'd look strange if the
Muncheon Police chief...

588
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:27,848
...steps in because
it involves the locals.

589
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,305
Isn't that right?

590
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:32,136
Our police chief
is a morally upright person.

591
00:37:32,561 --> 00:37:35,112
We don't want strange rumors
spreading about him because of you.

592
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:36,371
Right?

593
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,316
Let's go home.

594
00:37:42,317 --> 00:37:43,834
Keep up the good work.

595
00:37:43,858 --> 00:37:45,597
Yes, sir.

596
00:37:45,621 --> 00:37:47,554
Pay attention.

597
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:59,630
Hey, Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.

598
00:38:00,438 --> 00:38:04,327
I was told the bone was found
under the drain here.

599
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:39,440
There's nothing there.

600
00:38:40,942 --> 00:38:43,073
I think the water's flowing.

601
00:38:44,749 --> 00:38:46,482
You don't think...

602
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:50,393
...that bone belongs
to the victim, do you?

603
00:38:53,701 --> 00:38:55,534
Have you been here before?

604
00:38:55,577 --> 00:38:56,960
This is my first time here.

605
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,377
I found this place by asking you.

606
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:01,348
Oh, right.

607
00:39:03,212 --> 00:39:05,058
I'm strange and scary, right?

608
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:07,992
I'd be lying if I said no.

609
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:09,661
You should get going.

610
00:39:09,685 --> 00:39:11,152
Oh, I...

611
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:15,350
Here.

612
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:17,683
Take this just in case.

613
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,866
Thank you.

614
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:33,434
Geez, you can't see in here.

615
00:39:38,188 --> 00:39:40,621
Oh, gosh.

616
00:39:40,645 --> 00:39:42,618
I guess I won't be going home.

617
00:39:42,642 --> 00:39:45,625
So this is the best solution
for a day like today.

618
00:39:49,431 --> 00:39:51,804
You'll get arrested
and indicted, either way.

619
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:54,065
So just talk to me
when you feel like it.

620
00:39:56,347 --> 00:39:57,903
Is that allowed?

621
00:39:57,927 --> 00:39:59,853
He's completely insane.

622
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,590
What are you playing at now?

623
00:40:04,614 --> 00:40:06,499
I'm just offering you a drink.

624
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,238
What did we do wrong?

625
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:16,381
Where is my husband?
Where is he?

626
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:17,970
I know Shim Dong-min is in
the interrogation room.

627
00:40:17,971 --> 00:40:19,504
Let us just see him.

628
00:40:19,505 --> 00:40:21,567
Visiting hours are over. Please leave.

629
00:40:21,591 --> 00:40:23,656
What are you all doing here?

630
00:40:27,451 --> 00:40:29,409
How could you do this to us?

631
00:40:29,672 --> 00:40:33,347
Just seeing that murderer wander
around freely makes my blood boil.

632
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,409
How could you arrest my husband?

633
00:40:36,091 --> 00:40:37,568
How can you do this?

634
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:39,614
Please leave. Everyone, please leave.

635
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,237
It's not like we're strangers.

636
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,470
Just let us see him once.
Why are you being so...

637
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:44,504
Chu-ho!

638
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,147
We're at the police station.

639
00:40:46,171 --> 00:40:48,636
What you're doing right now
is an obstruction of justice.

640
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:51,934
We're currently investigating.

641
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:53,270
So please leave for now.

642
00:40:53,271 --> 00:40:56,037
It's late. Come back tomorrow.

643
00:40:56,038 --> 00:40:58,226
We'll conduct the investigation
according to the law...

644
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,576
...and proper procedures.

645
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,787
You're not helping by being here.

646
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,717
I won't say this again.

647
00:41:03,718 --> 00:41:04,965
Please leave.

648
00:41:33,593 --> 00:41:35,627
I would've done the same thing.

649
00:41:35,651 --> 00:41:38,717
As soon as I laid eyes on
Goh Jeong-woo, that jerk's face,

650
00:41:38,741 --> 00:41:41,633
I would've twisted his neck!

651
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:43,276
Geez.

652
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:00,959
- Hey, Detective.
- Yes, sir.

653
00:42:04,539 --> 00:42:06,066
In the past...

654
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:10,570
I used to send Bo-yeong
on errands to buy drinks.

655
00:42:14,471 --> 00:42:16,480
<i>I have a younger daughter</i>
<i>named Hye-yeong.</i>

656
00:42:16,504 --> 00:42:19,875
<i>She would never go on my drink errands.</i>

657
00:42:21,371 --> 00:42:23,933
<i>- My eldest daughter...</i>
- How many hours has it been?

658
00:42:24,005 --> 00:42:25,490
We can't get a confession today.

659
00:42:25,514 --> 00:42:27,390
She complained about it.

660
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:29,183
But she always did it.

661
00:42:30,238 --> 00:42:31,441
She was kind.

662
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:33,155
She was so...

663
00:42:34,222 --> 00:42:35,464
Kind.

664
00:42:43,538 --> 00:42:45,170
Gosh, this won't do.

665
00:42:45,171 --> 00:42:47,636
Hey, let's step outside.

666
00:42:55,202 --> 00:42:57,595
You don't even smoke,
so why did you follow us out?

667
00:42:57,619 --> 00:43:01,858
I know important info
is exchanged on cigarette breaks.

668
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:03,982
You're clever, aren't you?

669
00:43:04,405 --> 00:43:06,554
- Want me to tell you a story I heard?
- What is it?

670
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:08,098
Why the team head is still single?

671
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,416
He probably hasn't found
the right person.

672
00:43:10,677 --> 00:43:12,342
He must have high standards, right?

673
00:43:12,366 --> 00:43:15,589
His fiancee ran away
on their wedding day.

674
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:16,931
- For real?
- Wow, that's something else.

675
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:18,999
- She broke it off.
- That's astounding.

676
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:23,463
If you're hungry,
would you like some rice soup?

677
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,292
Forget it.

678
00:43:25,721 --> 00:43:29,358
Geez, you must be so upset.

679
00:43:29,725 --> 00:43:31,987
I can understand how
you wouldn't want to eat.

680
00:43:33,128 --> 00:43:34,449
Gosh.

681
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:39,745
Hey, hey, you're going to
drink yourself to death.

682
00:43:39,799 --> 00:43:42,132
At least eat something as you drink.

683
00:43:43,256 --> 00:43:44,689
I want to die.

684
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,042
Give it to me.

685
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:49,812
Give it.

686
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,798
Sure. Let's just all die together.

687
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,066
Alcohol won't solve our problems.

688
00:43:59,399 --> 00:44:00,599
Jeong-suk.

689
00:44:02,366 --> 00:44:04,445
What can I do?

690
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:06,310
Chu-ho.

691
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:08,731
What can I do?

692
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,419
You knew about it, right?

693
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,892
That your husband did it.

694
00:44:30,636 --> 00:44:32,433
What does it matter?

695
00:44:34,164 --> 00:44:38,461
The important thing is that
Bo-yeong's dad is under arrest.

696
00:44:39,732 --> 00:44:41,465
Yeah, well...

697
00:44:41,466 --> 00:44:44,422
Who cares if you knew or not?

698
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:46,038
The important thing is getting him out.

699
00:44:46,062 --> 00:44:47,470
Aren't I right?

700
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:54,497
Should we ask Gu-tak again?

701
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,051
Forget it!

702
00:45:10,394 --> 00:45:13,012
What's up with that Goh Jeong-woo jerk?

703
00:45:13,036 --> 00:45:14,869
Just what kind of person...

704
00:45:14,893 --> 00:45:16,560
You saw Jeong-woo's face, right?

705
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,439
He looks completely normal.

706
00:45:20,463 --> 00:45:21,525
He was smart too.

707
00:45:21,549 --> 00:45:23,155
He was the top ranked student
in Gyeonggi-do.

708
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,538
He got admitted to Hanguk University
Medical School.

709
00:45:24,539 --> 00:45:26,139
He was the son of the richest family
in our neighborhood.

710
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,387
You know Mucheon Garden, right?

711
00:45:27,411 --> 00:45:28,945
That belonged to his family.

712
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:31,336
He had nothing to lose.
That's how he ended up like that.

713
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,894
He, he's a...

714
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,565
Psychopath.

715
00:45:54,438 --> 00:45:57,069
That psychopath freak
killed my daughter!

716
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:44,385
Let me have a smoke.

717
00:46:47,781 --> 00:46:50,515
Here you all are.
Give me all the smokes you've got.

718
00:46:50,539 --> 00:46:51,685
- Hurry, hurry.
- I don't smoke...

719
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:53,853
Oh, this one.
Bo-yeong's father smokes this.

720
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:54,630
- This one here?
- Yes.

721
00:46:54,631 --> 00:46:55,565
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

722
00:46:55,566 --> 00:46:57,145
- Thanks!
- But...

723
00:46:59,077 --> 00:47:01,575
If the accused asks for a smoke,
doesn't it mean he's taken the bait?

724
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:02,566
Okay!

725
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:04,832
That means he's ready
to confess, right?

726
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:16,657
What's going on?

727
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:20,828
But I thought
he served his full sentence.

728
00:47:21,141 --> 00:47:22,920
So why would he now...

729
00:47:22,944 --> 00:47:24,676
I didn't kill them.

730
00:47:25,478 --> 00:47:27,245
I didn't kill them.

731
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,071
I didn't.

732
00:47:29,072 --> 00:47:30,405
That bone...

733
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:32,060
Where did you find it?

734
00:47:33,072 --> 00:47:35,894
It didn't seem like he was lying...

735
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:40,422
I'm so curious it's driving me insane.

736
00:48:00,957 --> 00:48:02,471
Why did you come back?

737
00:48:02,472 --> 00:48:04,924
Oh, well...

738
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:11,378
I'm genuinely curious about this.

739
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,651
So...

740
00:48:14,019 --> 00:48:15,719
Can you really not remember...

741
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:17,885
...or are you pretending not to?

742
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:19,296
Or...

743
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,746
Was it not you who did it?

744
00:48:27,139 --> 00:48:29,007
Your name is Ha Seol, right?

745
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:31,593
What do you think?

746
00:48:32,581 --> 00:48:33,896
Me?

747
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,313
Well...

748
00:48:36,472 --> 00:48:38,894
Isn't the case over already?

749
00:48:39,006 --> 00:48:41,019
It isn't over yet for me.

750
00:48:42,772 --> 00:48:44,071
I was so scared,

751
00:48:44,072 --> 00:48:45,633
and so sleepy and hungry,

752
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:48,566
that I said yes to everything
because I wanted to see my parents.

753
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:51,254
I thought if I did that...

754
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:55,035
...then everything would be okay.
But that wasn't the case.

755
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:59,735
I'm going to do everything I can
to find out and uncover it.

756
00:49:00,502 --> 00:49:02,016
That is my duty.

757
00:49:03,011 --> 00:49:05,379
And that's the only right
that I have left.

758
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:10,261
If I did commit the crime,
I'm going to get punished again.

759
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,602
Oh... So...

760
00:49:19,626 --> 00:49:22,326
I saw this a while ago.

761
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:24,582
There's another manhole over there.

762
00:49:25,977 --> 00:49:27,535
Would you like to see it?

763
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,793
Over there.

764
00:50:32,614 --> 00:50:36,326
Is that why you followed
Goh Jeong-woo's mother?

765
00:50:37,994 --> 00:50:41,715
Seeing how she bought meat
and clothing...

766
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,991
...for that sorry excuse of a son,

767
00:50:43,992 --> 00:50:46,799
I just felt so enraged.

768
00:50:46,823 --> 00:50:49,180
That's why you followed her
to the overpass.

769
00:50:59,752 --> 00:51:00,952
Huh?

770
00:51:01,882 --> 00:51:04,733
Jeong-woo's mom! Geum-hee!

771
00:51:05,568 --> 00:51:07,068
Oh...

772
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:27,534
You bought clothes
for that bastard, Jeong-woo?

773
00:51:28,264 --> 00:51:30,715
You're really despicable.

774
00:51:31,507 --> 00:51:33,032
You acted like you weren't
his mother anymore...

775
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:35,607
...but now that Jeong-woo is back,
are you all excited and giddy?

776
00:51:36,664 --> 00:51:38,428
So did Jeong-woo confess?

777
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:41,936
Did he tell you where
he tossed aside my Bo-yeong?

778
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:43,684
I'm really sorry.

779
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:45,194
Kick him out right now.

780
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,851
If I lay eyes on him,
I will seriously kill him.

781
00:51:47,852 --> 00:51:49,718
I'll tear him apart
right in front of your eyes...

782
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:52,342
...and ditch him in the sewer!

783
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:59,235
I beg you.

784
00:52:00,172 --> 00:52:03,272
Please let me feed him
just one meal.

785
00:52:04,218 --> 00:52:07,068
I couldn't cook for Bo-yeong
or buy her clothes...

786
00:52:07,152 --> 00:52:09,752
...for the past 10 years!

787
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,438
And I'll never get to!

788
00:52:29,864 --> 00:52:31,742
What happened?

789
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:40,228
I couldn't hold back.

790
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,343
It was a mistake.

791
00:52:47,625 --> 00:52:49,773
You pushed her from the overpass
by mistake.

792
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:34,083
How about we hit the rice soup place
near here and then the sauna?

793
00:53:34,084 --> 00:53:35,184
Oh, that sounds great.

794
00:53:35,185 --> 00:53:36,718
- All right.
- A full course.

795
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:38,219
That sounds great.

796
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:41,287
- You managed to complete a case.
- You did it, sir.

797
00:53:41,288 --> 00:53:43,655
I didn't think we'd get a confession.

798
00:53:43,662 --> 00:53:44,895
But you got it out of him.

799
00:53:44,896 --> 00:53:47,328
No, don't worry about it. It's okay.

800
00:53:47,329 --> 00:53:49,628
- He seemed a bit unsettled...
- No, no.

801
00:53:49,629 --> 00:53:53,564
It's just after being in prison
for 10 years,

802
00:53:53,796 --> 00:53:55,707
he's become a bit weird.

803
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:57,639
He's changed a lot.

804
00:53:57,663 --> 00:53:58,496
I see.

805
00:53:58,497 --> 00:53:59,929
<i>Oh, yeah, by the way...</i>

806
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:03,571
Next week,

807
00:54:03,596 --> 00:54:06,126
can you free up some time for dinner?

808
00:54:06,435 --> 00:54:10,228
Oh... Well... I'll call you back later.

809
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:17,893
- Byeong-mu.
- Yes?

810
00:54:17,917 --> 00:54:19,185
Was that about Goh Jeong-woo?

811
00:54:19,209 --> 00:54:20,870
Oh, no, it's just...

812
00:54:21,334 --> 00:54:22,754
There's a girl I know
in the neighborhood.

813
00:54:22,778 --> 00:54:25,841
She found a humerus bone
that floated down from the rain...

814
00:54:25,865 --> 00:54:26,905
...and reported it.

815
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:30,306
And apparently Goh Jeong-woo
asked her where she found it.

816
00:54:30,484 --> 00:54:33,626
Is she with him right now?

817
00:54:34,301 --> 00:54:35,568
What?

818
00:54:37,218 --> 00:54:39,215
All of you wait here on standby.

819
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:41,039
I'll go and get the equipment
and head out first.

820
00:54:41,063 --> 00:54:41,696
Wait, Team Head!

821
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:44,328
What if Goh Jeong-woo
is trying to get rid of evidence...

822
00:54:44,329 --> 00:54:46,205
...in case we find out
where he hid the remains?

823
00:54:46,229 --> 00:54:49,062
And your friend could be in danger.

824
00:54:49,086 --> 00:54:50,394
So stay in touch with her.

825
00:54:50,418 --> 00:54:52,385
Update me as soon as
you find out anything.

826
00:54:52,409 --> 00:54:55,373
Team Head, the bone was found...

827
00:54:55,621 --> 00:54:57,337
...in Cheonsu Village.

828
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:58,900
That's our neighboring village.

829
00:54:58,924 --> 00:55:01,639
We searched through it 10 years ago,
and nothing was found.

830
00:55:01,663 --> 00:55:04,454
That's why I'm saying I'll go first.

831
00:55:04,705 --> 00:55:06,186
Wait, but it's right next door...

832
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,816
Wait...

833
00:55:29,072 --> 00:55:33,129
SHIM BO-YEONG

834
00:55:44,647 --> 00:55:47,516
Bo-yeong!

835
00:55:56,767 --> 00:56:01,134
Why... Why are you...

836
00:56:02,111 --> 00:56:03,651
Why?

837
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:08,666
I've missed you so much.

838
00:56:11,596 --> 00:56:13,117
I'm sorry.

839
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:18,567
How could I...

840
00:56:22,403 --> 00:56:25,949
Let you go like that?

841
00:56:27,482 --> 00:56:29,941
Sorry.

842
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:35,318
But you shouldn't be here!

843
00:56:35,342 --> 00:56:36,683
Bo-yeong...

844
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:39,850
You shouldn't be here!

845
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:42,010
Excuse me.

846
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:45,055
- Mr. Goh Jeong-woo.
- Bo-yeong...

847
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,078
Mr. Goh Jeong-woo!

848
00:56:55,282 --> 00:56:57,849
Bo-yeong.

849
00:57:05,974 --> 00:57:08,341
Bo-yeong.

850
00:57:10,363 --> 00:57:12,229
SHIM BO-YEONG

851
00:57:16,888 --> 00:57:18,692
Shim Bo-yeong...

852
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:34,539
Yes, we'll be right there.

853
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:37,248
- Hey!
- Yes.

854
00:57:37,272 --> 00:57:39,638
Hey, what's going on here?

855
00:57:39,639 --> 00:57:41,139
What do you mean
a body was discovered?

856
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,074
Sure it's not a prank?

857
00:57:43,075 --> 00:57:46,089
The body had a nametag
with Shim Bo-yeong on it.

858
00:57:46,507 --> 00:57:48,157
- What?
- Shim Bo-yeong.

859
00:57:48,181 --> 00:57:50,458
We'll need a thorough analysis
to know for sure.

860
00:57:52,913 --> 00:57:54,461
Shim Bo-yeong?

861
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:57,172
Hey! What are you waiting for?

862
00:57:57,196 --> 00:58:00,828
Call everyone here
who can mobilize with Forensics!

863
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:02,604
They're already ready to go.

864
00:58:02,758 --> 00:58:04,492
Oh... Good job.

865
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,039
The chief! Chief!

866
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,532
Housekeeper.

867
00:58:15,827 --> 00:58:17,461
Housekeeper, are you awake?

868
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:19,285
Oh, yes.

869
00:58:19,309 --> 00:58:21,059
What's going on so early in the morning?

870
00:58:21,083 --> 00:58:21,924
Right.

871
00:58:21,948 --> 00:58:25,149
Make sure Su-oh takes his medicine
as soon as he wakes up.

872
00:58:25,173 --> 00:58:26,539
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

873
00:58:42,042 --> 00:58:43,590
Where are you?

874
00:58:43,614 --> 00:58:46,348
You didn't even put away the board.

875
00:58:46,372 --> 00:58:47,506
Ma'am,

876
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:50,274
I'm calling from Cheonsu Village.

877
00:58:55,503 --> 00:58:56,936
What?

878
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,210
Yeah, I'm almost there. Hurry over here.

879
00:58:59,742 --> 00:59:02,118
That sly bastard.

880
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:10,629
Get up.

881
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:13,269
Huh?

882
00:59:14,263 --> 00:59:15,596
What?

883
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:17,293
They found her.

884
00:59:17,853 --> 00:59:19,419
Found who?

885
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:21,294
They found Bo-yeong.

886
00:59:26,916 --> 00:59:28,284
Jeong-suk.

887
00:59:30,245 --> 00:59:31,879
What did you just say?

888
00:59:31,903 --> 00:59:34,003
They found Bo-yeong.

889
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:37,208
Bo-yeong?

890
00:59:38,796 --> 00:59:40,472
My Bo-yeong?

891
00:59:43,262 --> 00:59:45,392
Where is she?

892
00:59:46,256 --> 00:59:47,456
Huh?

893
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:50,576
Where's Bo-yeong?

894
01:00:06,796 --> 01:00:07,928
Where's Goh Jeong-woo?

895
01:00:07,929 --> 01:00:10,426
Yes, he's down below there.

896
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,062
That bastard.

897
01:00:12,063 --> 01:00:13,928
But he didn't know where...

898
01:00:13,929 --> 01:00:15,563
It's dangerous, so take a step back.

899
01:00:15,587 --> 01:00:17,222
The police will be arriving soon.

900
01:00:21,423 --> 01:00:22,795
Just stand back.

901
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:26,411
Bo-yeong...

902
01:00:30,429 --> 01:00:31,867
Bo-yeong...

903
01:00:41,624 --> 01:00:43,724
SHIM BO-YEONG

904
01:00:46,025 --> 01:00:47,256
Bo-yeong...

905
01:00:48,122 --> 01:00:49,844
You trying to destroy the evidence?

906
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:53,230
Don't you even dare
lay a finger on that!

907
01:00:53,254 --> 01:00:55,842
Hey, look straight into my eyes.

908
01:00:56,808 --> 01:00:58,430
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

909
01:01:00,928 --> 01:01:02,466
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

910
01:01:04,363 --> 01:01:05,296
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

911
01:01:05,297 --> 01:01:06,828
Goh Jeong-woo, get a hold of yourself.

912
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:07,829
Get a hold of yourself!

913
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,428
Goh Jeong-woo, you bastard!

914
01:01:09,429 --> 01:01:10,995
Goh Jeong-woo,
get a hold of yourself!

915
01:01:10,996 --> 01:01:12,896
She needs to be found!

916
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:26,579
<i>Thank you for finding me, Jeong-woo.</i>

917
01:01:28,681 --> 01:01:29,999
I'm sorry.

918
01:01:31,196 --> 01:01:32,516
I'm sorry.

919
01:01:32,926 --> 01:01:34,993
I'm sorry...

920
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:38,661
You think saying sorry
solves everything?

921
01:01:38,685 --> 01:01:40,768
Does that change anything?

922
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:44,296
Huh?
Is saying sorry all it takes?

923
01:01:47,729 --> 01:01:49,095
She's already dead.

924
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:50,563
She's already dead!

925
01:01:50,587 --> 01:01:54,420
You killed her, you bastard!

926
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:57,028
You killed her.

927
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:58,629
Shoot!

928
01:01:59,063 --> 01:02:00,454
Shoot!

929
01:02:45,198 --> 01:02:47,945
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

930
01:02:50,272 --> 01:02:52,348
<i>I want to see Bo-yeong!</i>

931
01:02:52,372 --> 01:02:54,131
<i>Bo-yeong.</i>

932
01:02:54,155 --> 01:02:56,665
<i>Please catch the killer.</i>

933
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,234
<i>So please stop doing anything</i>
<i>to hurt Bo-yeong...</i>

934
01:02:58,258 --> 01:02:59,331
<i>...any further.</i>

935
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:00,962
<i>Why are you only telling us</i>
<i>where Shim Bo-yeong is?</i>

936
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,719
<i>Where is Park Da-eun?</i>
<i>Park Da-eun!</i>

937
01:03:02,743 --> 01:03:05,413
<i>Goh Jeong-woo!</i>
<i>Take your mom and move away.</i>

938
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:06,395
<i>Leave with me.</i>

939
01:03:06,396 --> 01:03:08,154
<i>I won't leave until I find Da-eun.</i>

940
01:03:08,155 --> 01:03:10,806
<i>And what will change if you find her?</i>

941
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,924
<i>It proves I'm not a murderer.</i>

942
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:14,077
<i>Evidence.</i>

943
01:03:14,101 --> 01:03:16,067
<i>If only I can find the evidence.</i>

944
01:03:16,091 --> 01:03:18,950
<i>About Goh Jeong-woo's case.</i>
<i>Doesn't it not make sense.</i>

945
01:03:19,285 --> 01:03:21,170
<i>It wasn't Jeong-woo.</i>

946
01:03:22,128 --> 01:03:24,328
<i>If I was wrongfully accused...</i>

947
01:03:25,465 --> 01:03:28,267
<i>That means I'm not the killer, right?</i>
