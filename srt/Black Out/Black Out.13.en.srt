1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:05,593
BYUN YO-HAN

2
00:00:06,494 --> 00:00:08,998
GO JOON

3
00:00:09,493 --> 00:00:12,428
KO BO-GYEOL
KIM BO-RA

4
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:15,642
BAE JONG-OK
KWON HAE-HYO

5
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,265
BLACK OUT

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,945
SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,700
You can drive, right?

8
00:00:34,808 --> 00:00:37,258
It's okay.
There are no DUI checks tonight.

9
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,531
Why?
Aren't you driving?

10
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:41,853
I've been summoned by the chief.

11
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:45,540
It's because we let you go
meet the then police chief...

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:48,286
...all the way up to
being the police chief,

13
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:49,656
Chief Hyeon Gu-tak!

14
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:51,218
The trunk...

15
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,091
There were two shovels in there.

16
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:56,577
Everything will be revealed
if we have those shovels!

17
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:00,324
Bo-yeong was alive?

18
00:01:00,349 --> 00:01:02,467
When I opened the trunk, Bo-yeong...

19
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,346
She was squirming and
trying to say something.

20
00:01:05,347 --> 00:01:06,473
Please help me...

21
00:01:06,474 --> 00:01:10,260
But Min-su's dad, Chu-ho,
killed her with the shovel!

22
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:14,921
Chu-ho... killed my Bo-yeong.

23
00:01:14,946 --> 00:01:17,421
So I got vengeance for her.

24
00:01:18,428 --> 00:01:19,884
Once I become governor,

25
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:22,380
you can join me
as the Head of Public Security.

26
00:01:22,841 --> 00:01:23,843
But first,

27
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:28,060
please handle that case.

28
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,925
Park Da-eun's grandmother
heard when she was murdered...

29
00:01:30,926 --> 00:01:32,694
I could hear his voice.

30
00:01:32,695 --> 00:01:34,331
She heard Goh Jeong-woo's voice!

31
00:01:34,332 --> 00:01:35,900
Goh Jeong-woo is the culprit.

32
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,029
Su-oh, What did you draw here?

33
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:40,800
Murderer.

34
00:01:42,348 --> 00:01:43,587
You need to resign.

35
00:01:43,944 --> 00:01:46,160
Goh Jeong-woo is the murderer.

36
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:49,276
The chief definitely said
I was right back then.

37
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,669
Choi Na-gyeom is definitely
in love with you.

38
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,186
But even so,

39
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,776
she's way too obsessed with you
and this case.

40
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:57,041
There's a lot she's hiding too.

41
00:01:57,228 --> 00:01:58,861
And when we look at
Hyeon Su-oh's drawing,

42
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,860
Choi Na-gyeom was somewhere
in the warehouse that day.

43
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,740
I'm going to report you!

44
00:02:24,472 --> 00:02:25,329
I feel stuffy.

45
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,686
I'm going outside to play.

46
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:38,709
Su-oh.

47
00:02:39,027 --> 00:02:40,522
I made a secret room for you...

48
00:02:40,562 --> 00:02:43,322
...that only you will know about.

49
00:02:43,809 --> 00:02:45,413
Want me to show you?

50
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:07,164
Yang Byeong-mu, come out.

51
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,351
Byeong-mu!

52
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,912
Excuse me, where is he going?

53
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,176
Is it to the prosecutor's office?

54
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:19,277
He's being taken to the prison
as of today.

55
00:03:19,308 --> 00:03:21,585
As for the criminal investigation,
the prosecutor will decide...

56
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:23,969
...whether he needs to be
investigated later.

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,757
Not me? Just Byeong-mu?

58
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:27,488
What more do you need to investigate?

59
00:03:27,513 --> 00:03:28,332
What about him?

60
00:03:28,403 --> 00:03:29,700
Aren't you taking Min-su?

61
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:31,494
Please just keep it down.

62
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:33,351
As if they'd know anything.

63
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,665
What else is there to investigate?

64
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:36,562
Wait...

65
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:38,140
Please let me speak to the chief.

66
00:03:38,514 --> 00:03:41,789
The chief said I could ask
if I ever needed anything.

67
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,510
Please let me call him.

68
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,423
Officer Kang, he wants to make a call.

69
00:03:46,534 --> 00:03:47,140
Yes.

70
00:03:52,578 --> 00:03:53,632
Sir, have you had lunch?

71
00:03:55,281 --> 00:03:55,953
Yeah.

72
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:15,945
I'm coming in for a minute.

73
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:31,835
Is this how you're going to escape?

74
00:04:35,827 --> 00:04:37,953
I met Park Da-eun's grandmother.

75
00:04:38,605 --> 00:04:41,382
She said it wasn't Goh Jeong-woo's voice
at the time of the incident.

76
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:44,509
She said she told you it was
an older man's voice several times.

77
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,052
Why did you do it?

78
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:50,871
At the time...

79
00:04:53,297 --> 00:04:55,339
Everything was Goh Jeong-woo.

80
00:04:59,107 --> 00:05:00,670
What was Goh Jeong-woo?

81
00:05:00,695 --> 00:05:02,375
You didn't even have
any decisive evidence.

82
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:05,357
The spanner with no fingerprints?

83
00:05:05,797 --> 00:05:07,484
As a police officer,
don't you feel ashamed?

84
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,260
You didn't even meet the conditions
for an emergency arrest.

85
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:12,340
You didn't even give the kid
a chance to explain.

86
00:05:12,493 --> 00:05:15,152
You coerced him into a confession
by depriving him of sleep!

87
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:18,281
What was Goh Jeong-woo?

88
00:05:18,864 --> 00:05:21,294
Why did you carry out the
investigation like that...

89
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,481
...and ruin a young man's life?

90
00:05:24,989 --> 00:05:27,546
Two schoolgirls were killed.

91
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,258
It was the biggest case
of my detective career.

92
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:35,851
I had to catch the killer
no matter what...

93
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:38,882
I'm sure it was a huge case in Mucheon.

94
00:05:39,622 --> 00:05:42,655
That's why there's no way
you acted alone.

95
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:45,824
Who was it?

96
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:50,137
Who ordered you to
frame Goh Jeong-woo?

97
00:06:14,283 --> 00:06:17,100
But this is all just
circumstantial evidence.

98
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:18,460
Yes, sir.

99
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:19,780
Hee-do,

100
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:21,460
what do you think?

101
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,290
It's okay to tell me honestly.

102
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:29,831
It does seem like Goh Jeong-woo
is the perpetrator.

103
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,928
I think so too.

104
00:06:31,736 --> 00:06:32,912
He is the perpetrator.

105
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,758
Everything points to him
being the killer.

106
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,060
- Yes.
- But...

107
00:06:39,134 --> 00:06:41,108
...if we pass this case
over to the prosecutors in this state,

108
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:43,611
they'll acquit him due to
a lack of evidence.

109
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,634
The murder weapon has no fingerprints.

110
00:06:45,635 --> 00:06:49,143
Moreover, we haven't found Shim
Bo-yeong and Park Da-eun's bodies.

111
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:53,855
A murder with no body?

112
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,015
If he just denies it in court,
he'll be released.

113
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,020
We can't let that happen.

114
00:07:02,347 --> 00:07:03,700
Justice must be served.

115
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,221
Right.

116
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,614
I agree with you.

117
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:09,869
I believe that everyone
is equal before the law.

118
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,924
Gosh.

119
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:18,752
He's my friend's son.

120
00:07:19,957 --> 00:07:21,561
It really breaks my heart, but...

121
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:25,125
Don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.

122
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:27,774
Yes. Of course. For sure.

123
00:07:29,288 --> 00:07:30,658
What do we need right now?

124
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:33,443
- Evidence?
- Yes, evidence.

125
00:07:33,843 --> 00:07:36,716
Evidence that Jeong-woo
was in the warehouse.

126
00:07:37,313 --> 00:07:40,683
Whether it's hair, clothes or shoes.

127
00:07:41,215 --> 00:07:42,651
Whatever it is, if we can find it,

128
00:07:42,676 --> 00:07:44,651
it'd have a drop of blood on it
at least.

129
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,193
Huh?

130
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,507
If we can just find that...

131
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:50,115
It'll be decisive evidence that

132
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:52,040
Jeong-woo was with the victim.

133
00:07:54,617 --> 00:07:56,596
Damn.

134
00:07:58,068 --> 00:07:59,071
Hee-do.

135
00:08:00,287 --> 00:08:01,567
Can we find it?

136
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:07,075
We can find it.

137
00:08:07,554 --> 00:08:08,540
Hey, it's so cold tonight.

138
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:11,248
Go and eat some rice soup.

139
00:08:12,442 --> 00:08:13,660
It's okay.

140
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:14,460
Go on.

141
00:08:14,997 --> 00:08:15,935
- Thank you, sir.
- Go.

142
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:17,135
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

143
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:20,598
Go and eat up.

144
00:09:08,332 --> 00:09:09,332
Team Head!

145
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:10,652
We found it.

146
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:11,740
See, I told you!

147
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,607
There had to be some evidence!

148
00:09:14,706 --> 00:09:16,326
Good job!

149
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:22,318
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

150
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,491
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

151
00:09:43,953 --> 00:09:45,887
But thinking about it now...

152
00:09:45,984 --> 00:09:46,700
Hee-do,

153
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,699
do you regret what happened...

154
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:51,388
...11 years ago?

155
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:54,388
But it was because you
worked like crazy...

156
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:56,140
...that we caught Goh Jeong-woo.

157
00:09:56,361 --> 00:09:57,873
We did our best back then, didn't we?

158
00:09:58,613 --> 00:10:00,062
Where is this witness?

159
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,640
Where is he?

160
00:10:02,696 --> 00:10:03,696
What are you going to do?

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,062
Oh, then we should...

162
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:10,525
I mean, I should scrap the car.

163
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:13,053
Honestly, I don't know whether
the shoes you found with blood on them...

164
00:10:13,078 --> 00:10:14,597
...were real or not.

165
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:20,171
Maybe I...

166
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:24,722
...was a very diligent lab rat.

167
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,153
So...

168
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,106
You won't reveal who
gave you the orders?

169
00:10:33,644 --> 00:10:35,534
Even after handing in
your letter of resignation?

170
00:10:35,559 --> 00:10:36,559
Section Chief!

171
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,476
Don't become a public servant like me.

172
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:49,370
Though I'm sure you'll do well
without me telling you.

173
00:10:55,288 --> 00:10:56,176
Oh.

174
00:10:57,295 --> 00:11:00,039
Investigate carefully and meticulously.

175
00:11:02,174 --> 00:11:04,645
And if needed, come arrest me anytime.

176
00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:07,099
You know where I live, right?

177
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,901
Detective Kim Hee-do!

178
00:11:15,882 --> 00:11:18,681
You need to take responsibility! Okay?

179
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,652
You need to catch the real culprit!

180
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:28,856
Section Chief!

181
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:56,127
NOVEMBER 20, 2013: EVIDENCE OBTAINED
FROM GOH JEONG-WOO'S HOUSE

182
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:56,871
FEBRUARY 6, 2014:
GO JEONG-WOO'S TRIAL ENDS

183
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:57,627
SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS FOR MURDER

184
00:11:57,628 --> 00:11:58,401
FEBRUARY 7, 2014:
SECTION CHIEF HYEON GU-TAK ORDERED

185
00:11:58,402 --> 00:11:59,006
EVIDENCE TO BE DESTROYED AFTER TRIAL

186
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:00,574
Yes, sir.

187
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,900
It was perfect right through
to the end of the trial.

188
00:12:04,147 --> 00:12:05,195
<i>Good job.</i>

189
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:08,190
<i>I think you'll be getting</i>
<i>good news soon.</i>

190
00:12:08,191 --> 00:12:08,731
Sorry?

191
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:11,072
<i>Your promotion is</i>
<i>just around the corner.</i>

192
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:13,099
Thank you, sir!

193
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,819
- Sir...
- <i>Yeah?</i>

194
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,520
You know I truly respect you, right?

195
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:19,344
<i>I know.</i>

196
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,686
I'll be loyal to you for life.

197
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,232
<i>Remember, it's important</i>
<i>to finish strong.</i>

198
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,059
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:27,641
I'll take care of everything.

200
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:28,943
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Yes, sir.

201
00:12:50,491 --> 00:12:52,877
I found that friend of Park Da-eun
you asked for last time.

202
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:53,976
Come quick.

203
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:17,048
Thank you.

204
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,142
I'll stay here.
Please go and get some rest.

205
00:13:24,194 --> 00:13:26,067
I'm planning to leave tomorrow.

206
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,588
Being alone in Mucheon Garden...

207
00:13:28,894 --> 00:13:30,934
...doesn't feel right either.

208
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:35,264
Is there anything I can help with
before you leave?

209
00:13:35,289 --> 00:13:37,291
Oh, no need.

210
00:13:37,373 --> 00:13:38,839
All I did was be overly nosy.

211
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,745
You might not know this,
but I've learned so much here.

212
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,562
I figured out what I need to do
once I get back to Seoul.

213
00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:51,497
Your mother will wake up for sure.

214
00:13:52,516 --> 00:13:54,262
Please contact me when she does.

215
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,299
I don't think I'll be able
to come back here,

216
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,094
so I'll stay here today.

217
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,677
You should go home and get some rest.

218
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:16,495
Okay.

219
00:14:18,638 --> 00:14:19,638
Goh Jeong-woo?

220
00:14:24,755 --> 00:14:27,072
We were paying
a lot of attention to her.

221
00:14:27,268 --> 00:14:29,295
But you moved her
without even a word.

222
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,078
My apologies.

223
00:14:32,877 --> 00:14:34,646
I sincerely thank you
for all you've done.

224
00:14:39,651 --> 00:14:41,013
I saw the press conference.

225
00:14:42,555 --> 00:14:43,322
Congratulations.

226
00:14:44,088 --> 00:14:45,088
Thank you.

227
00:14:49,136 --> 00:14:51,244
The reason why I wanted to
speak with you...

228
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,764
...was because I didn't ask
the most important thing.

229
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:02,720
Na-gyeom has been in love with you
since high school.

230
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:03,837
Did you know that?

231
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:06,343
How do you feel, Jeong-woo?

232
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:07,919
About Na-gyeom...

233
00:15:09,265 --> 00:15:10,127
Do you like her?

234
00:15:15,607 --> 00:15:17,517
During my 10 years in prison,

235
00:15:19,192 --> 00:15:21,004
the guys who I thought
were my true friends...

236
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,005
...never visited me,
let alone tried to contact me.

237
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,523
Deok-mi was the only friend
that visited me.

238
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,481
During my toughest time in prison,

239
00:15:29,482 --> 00:15:31,368
when my father passed away...

240
00:15:31,794 --> 00:15:33,680
On the day when I was released...

241
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:36,696
Deok-mi was the only one who came.

242
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,661
I think I may have waited for her...

243
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:43,644
...and heavily relied on her.

244
00:15:45,231 --> 00:15:47,040
Perhaps that's why she misunderstood.

245
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,239
A crush since high school?

246
00:15:54,095 --> 00:15:55,608
I had no idea back then.

247
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,997
So you don't love her?

248
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,119
No.

249
00:16:11,328 --> 00:16:12,438
Okay.

250
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:21,268
Why doesn't he? Why?

251
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:25,922
Why?

252
00:16:43,489 --> 00:16:45,822
It's a relief that he's...

253
00:16:46,438 --> 00:16:47,420
...not a murderer.

254
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:50,220
Just as you said, he isn't a murderer.

255
00:16:50,486 --> 00:16:52,215
But he doesn't love you either.

256
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:57,016
You can't win someone's love...

257
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,821
...by throwing tantrums.

258
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:01,359
Na-gyeom.

259
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:05,290
It's time to wake up
and return to Seoul.

260
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:09,371
Let's go and forget everything
and start over.

261
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:10,140
Get out.

262
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:13,620
What do you know to run your mouth?
Get out.

263
00:17:14,028 --> 00:17:15,048
Get out!

264
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,924
Get out! Get out of here!

265
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:29,789
Choi Na-gyeom.

266
00:17:30,197 --> 00:17:31,324
You have exactly one hour.

267
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,928
This isn't a suggestion
nor is it a request.

268
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:35,268
It's a warning.

269
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:47,801
Bring her back to Seoul today.

270
00:17:48,844 --> 00:17:50,548
If she keeps being stubborn, call me.

271
00:17:53,566 --> 00:17:55,243
I'm going to cancel her contract.

272
00:17:55,268 --> 00:17:55,780
Sorry?

273
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:57,346
That's what I'm planning.

274
00:17:58,247 --> 00:17:58,900
Yes, ma'am.

275
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,351
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

276
00:18:03,073 --> 00:18:04,130
Jeong-woo...

277
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:07,028
Have a seat.

278
00:18:08,897 --> 00:18:09,897
Have a seat.

279
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:26,113
My Byeong-mu...

280
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:30,197
...he was taken to the prosecution today.

281
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,983
I'll be taken tomorrow as well.

282
00:18:33,984 --> 00:18:35,921
So...

283
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,047
I thought it'd be harder
to meet with you.

284
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:45,060
Jeong-woo.

285
00:18:50,023 --> 00:18:51,023
I'm sorry.

286
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,133
It was me and Chu-ho...

287
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:57,646
...who were at fault for everything.

288
00:18:58,073 --> 00:18:59,317
So Jeong-woo,

289
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,572
you're the only one.

290
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:06,408
You're the only person...

291
00:19:10,212 --> 00:19:11,518
...who can save Byeong-mu.

292
00:19:13,739 --> 00:19:14,940
Please, just this once.

293
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,323
No...

294
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,237
This is my very last request.

295
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,010
Please write a letter of appeal...

296
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:27,337
...for my Byeong-mu.

297
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,225
Please, just one letter of appeal.

298
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,279
Yes?

299
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,560
Mister.

300
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,543
Yes?

301
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,599
I also had...

302
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:49,367
...a father who loved me.

303
00:19:53,149 --> 00:19:53,935
Jeong-woo!

304
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,504
Jeong-woo!

305
00:19:57,739 --> 00:19:58,992
I'm begging you!

306
00:20:05,966 --> 00:20:09,951
I hope this can be a place...

307
00:20:10,186 --> 00:20:12,206
...you can always return to.

308
00:20:13,774 --> 00:20:16,610
All of your childhood friends...

309
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:17,695
...are around here.

310
00:20:19,128 --> 00:20:20,500
An old friend...

311
00:20:20,693 --> 00:20:21,909
...is like your hometown.

312
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:24,460
<i>You can visit at any time.</i>

313
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,290
<i>And they're always there.</i>

314
00:20:29,801 --> 00:20:30,801
Dad...

315
00:20:33,661 --> 00:20:35,907
Those people are no longer your friends.

316
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,073
You already know, right?

317
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,710
I miss you.

318
00:20:50,869 --> 00:20:51,597
Yes.

319
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:53,461
Do you have Choi Na-gyeom's
promotional video?

320
00:20:57,273 --> 00:20:58,740
Ma'am, this is urgent.

321
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:01,156
I just received a call from
Mapo Police Station.

322
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:03,860
One of their major crime units...

323
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,940
...is going to investigate
Park Da-eun's death.

324
00:21:06,417 --> 00:21:09,140
They're investigating Park Da-eun
from Mapo? Why?

325
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:10,693
It seems their team head...

326
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:13,944
...received a request from the team head
of the Mucheon Violent Crime Team 2.

327
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:17,016
So...

328
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,424
I think our priority is to secure
the Park Da-eun evidence.

329
00:21:22,211 --> 00:21:23,461
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

330
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:26,154
<i>Her shift started,</i>
<i>but she must be running late.</i>

331
00:21:52,637 --> 00:21:53,637
Come here!

332
00:21:54,284 --> 00:21:55,443
Huh?

333
00:21:58,594 --> 00:21:59,594
Hey!

334
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:02,060
Tell me where you are right now.

335
00:22:02,061 --> 00:22:04,661
<i>We're heading towards Seongsu Bridge</i>
<i>from the Segwan Intersection.</i>

336
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:15,901
Nambu Beltway!

337
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:18,055
I'm heading towards Sadang
from Seocho.

338
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,039
I think they're heading
to the outskirts.

339
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:21,164
Huh?

340
00:22:21,189 --> 00:22:22,506
<i>Yes, we'll join soon.</i>

341
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:31,391
Stop the car!

342
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:32,890
Stop, I said!

343
00:22:43,501 --> 00:22:45,770
Hey, one guy's going that way!
Hey, grab him!

344
00:22:45,803 --> 00:22:46,803
Stop right there!

345
00:22:47,939 --> 00:22:49,687
Please don't kill me.

346
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:55,161
Stop trying to scheme and get out.

347
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,456
Who are you?

348
00:23:01,137 --> 00:23:02,254
Who do you work for?

349
00:23:02,279 --> 00:23:04,275
Who ordered you to do this?

350
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,146
Did you catch all of them?

351
00:23:06,464 --> 00:23:08,582
We missed one but we caught the rest.

352
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:12,296
So what is going on?

353
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:13,876
An old case.

354
00:23:14,849 --> 00:23:17,475
An old case that's still ongoing.

355
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,949
She bragged so much about
finding a decent man.

356
00:23:23,044 --> 00:23:25,900
He was the section chief
of a big hospital in Mucheon.

357
00:23:26,352 --> 00:23:28,140
And his wife was the daughter
of a rich family.

358
00:23:28,513 --> 00:23:32,118
He was always buying her clothes,
bags and shoes.

359
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:34,020
She said...

360
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,900
...he'd pay for her college tuition
and also give her living expenses.

361
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,913
But then...

362
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,736
Just a minute.

363
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,776
I'm sorry.

364
00:23:51,334 --> 00:23:51,980
What is it?

365
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,580
Hey, what on earth
are you investigating?

366
00:23:58,232 --> 00:23:59,731
So what did the abductors say?

367
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:00,940
Who ordered it?

368
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:03,513
They said it was a prank.
They mistook her for a friend.

369
00:24:03,546 --> 00:24:04,100
A prank?

370
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,580
- Let me go and...
- No!

371
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:08,157
They left.

372
00:24:09,476 --> 00:24:10,345
Left?

373
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:11,980
To where?

374
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:13,124
They were released.

375
00:24:13,125 --> 00:24:13,900
Released?

376
00:24:14,128 --> 00:24:16,383
They must have some connections.

377
00:24:16,408 --> 00:24:18,898
A lawyer rushed over and took them away.

378
00:24:20,243 --> 00:24:22,182
At least you still have her.

379
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:27,981
<i>Creating a better Gyeonggi-do...</i>

380
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:30,486
<i>...together with Candidate No. 3,</i>
<i>Ye Yeong-sil.</i>

381
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,846
<i>Hit that like button!</i>

382
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:39,703
The operation failed. I'm sorry.

383
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,833
We couldn't find out what
Park Da-eun's friend knew.

384
00:24:45,532 --> 00:24:46,922
I got Secretary Hwang out.

385
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:51,002
Let's play it safe.

386
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:53,035
Yes, ma'am.

387
00:25:02,347 --> 00:25:04,172
You'll have to move faster
than we thought.

388
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,303
I still have a lot to sort out...

389
00:25:09,328 --> 00:25:10,219
Sort what out?

390
00:25:10,747 --> 00:25:12,414
I told you that's for me to do.

391
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,924
Don't do any thinking.
That's not your job.

392
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:17,386
No, but...

393
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,000
My life is on the line here.

394
00:25:20,025 --> 00:25:21,660
How can I not think?

395
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:24,342
Have you decided to disobey me
to my face now?

396
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:27,182
If you had the ability to think,

397
00:25:27,183 --> 00:25:28,700
you should've done so 10 years ago!

398
00:25:29,626 --> 00:25:32,300
All that you're allowed
is regret and reflection!

399
00:25:37,778 --> 00:25:40,845
Go jogging at Citizen Park
for your morning exercise tomorrow.

400
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,041
Run for about 30 minutes...

401
00:25:43,066 --> 00:25:44,602
...and then get in the car
that's at the park entrance.

402
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,940
Go to the address saved in the GPS
and cool your head.

403
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,917
I'll contact you
once all this is sorted.

404
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,371
I understand.

405
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:03,550
I'll trust you and wait.

406
00:26:43,444 --> 00:26:44,749
Just tell me what you want.

407
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:47,342
There's always a reason
behind an action.

408
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,232
Jeong-woo.

409
00:26:48,875 --> 00:26:50,217
I want Goh Jeong-woo.

410
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,226
<i>I just...</i>

411
00:26:57,826 --> 00:26:59,459
<i>Fell for you at first sight.</i>

412
00:27:00,884 --> 00:27:01,884
Jeong-woo!

413
00:27:03,446 --> 00:27:04,784
Are we in the same class again?

414
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,798
Hey, wake up already!

415
00:27:06,877 --> 00:27:09,316
<i>You always shined,</i>

416
00:27:09,893 --> 00:27:12,745
<i>lighting up everything around you.</i>

417
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,039
<i>You probably don't know...</i>

418
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:19,020
<i>...but I was always around you,</i>

419
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>hoping you'd look at me just once.</i>

420
00:27:29,343 --> 00:27:31,376
We have a transfer student today.

421
00:27:31,401 --> 00:27:32,300
Come in.

422
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:39,800
Her name is Park Da-eun.

423
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,540
Say hello.

424
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:41,782
Hi.

425
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:47,300
You can go sit at the back
next to Deok-mi.

426
00:27:51,175 --> 00:27:54,780
<i>But you had terrible taste in women.</i>

427
00:28:09,246 --> 00:28:10,725
- What are you doing?
- What's happening?

428
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:11,709
You're last.

429
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,175
- What the?
- I fell over.

430
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,972
<i>It's the same even now.</i>

431
00:28:27,765 --> 00:28:28,717
Who's the guardian?

432
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:29,742
- I am.
- Me...

433
00:28:30,158 --> 00:28:32,573
<i>Jeong-woo and Ha Seol</i>
<i>are always together.</i>

434
00:28:32,605 --> 00:28:33,605
<i>No...</i>

435
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,577
<i>I bet they're already dating.</i>

436
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:39,680
<i>She even slept over</i>
<i>at Jeong-woo's place last night.</i>

437
00:28:40,748 --> 00:28:41,748
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

438
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:45,498
<i>I don't have much time left.</i>

439
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,890
<i>You have to come back to me.</i>

440
00:28:51,768 --> 00:28:52,954
<i>Just like...</i>

441
00:28:54,384 --> 00:28:55,315
<i>...10 years ago.</i>

442
00:29:01,354 --> 00:29:03,107
Make sure you buy something...

443
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,224
...that's healthy and good for you.

444
00:29:06,556 --> 00:29:08,201
That's from my first paycheck.

445
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:24,155
I'm glad that you're smiling.

446
00:29:57,005 --> 00:29:57,780
Hello?

447
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,380
<i>Jeong-woo.</i>

448
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:02,002
I have something to tell you.

449
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:06,940
I also have evidence to free you
from everything.

450
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:10,762
Will you come now?

451
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:15,574
Call Choi Na-gyeom! Call her!

452
00:30:15,758 --> 00:30:18,541
Deok-mi planned all this! Call her!

453
00:30:18,542 --> 00:30:19,463
Why Deok-mi?

454
00:30:19,764 --> 00:30:20,936
You moron, you don't know anything.

455
00:30:20,937 --> 00:30:23,020
She planned all of this, you bastard!

456
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:26,634
Byeong-mu is planning to say
that I was in the warehouse with him.

457
00:30:26,635 --> 00:30:29,625
Hey, did she say I threatened her too?

458
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,143
She's a true actress.

459
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:33,753
Do you use this app?

460
00:30:35,648 --> 00:30:39,344
Your location is linked
with Choi Na-gyeom.

461
00:31:08,945 --> 00:31:09,637
Deok-mi...

462
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:16,206
You were in the warehouse that day,
weren't you?

463
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:22,474
And you knew everything?

464
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:24,329
Of course I knew everything.

465
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,740
Since I saw everything.

466
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:34,980
<i>Da-eun, if I did something wrong,</i>
<i>please tell me.</i>

467
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:38,540
<i>I'll change. So please call me.</i>

468
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:46,725
<i>I couldn't reach Da-eun yesterday.</i>

469
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:49,340
<i>Can you please call her just once?</i>

470
00:31:49,619 --> 00:31:52,316
<i>Da-eun isn't dead, right?</i>

471
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:55,831
You only ever had eyes for Da-eun.

472
00:31:56,451 --> 00:31:58,764
When we went to
the police station that day,

473
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,791
I thought about telling you...

474
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,304
...when I saw you crying.

475
00:32:03,993 --> 00:32:05,389
But I decided not to.

476
00:32:06,073 --> 00:32:09,497
Even while you were crying,
you only worried about where Da-eun was.

477
00:32:11,729 --> 00:32:13,281
The very first time
I was given the honor...

478
00:32:13,282 --> 00:32:15,740
...of joining you guys
at the spicy rice cake place...

479
00:32:17,056 --> 00:32:19,834
Do you remember the very first thing
you said to me?

480
00:32:20,486 --> 00:32:22,446
The spicy rice cakes here
are real good. Try some.

481
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:23,672
Do you want fishcakes?

482
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:32,224
"Which class are you in?"

483
00:32:32,665 --> 00:32:37,461
I've been in the same class as you
since 10th grade.

484
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:40,060
And I've only had eyes
for you since then.

485
00:32:40,344 --> 00:32:43,140
I worked hard on my studies
to impress you.

486
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:45,460
I even did volunteer work with you.

487
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:47,620
"Who wants to clean Room 556?"

488
00:32:47,753 --> 00:32:48,340
"Me!"

489
00:32:48,618 --> 00:32:50,581
- Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong, Bo-yeong.
- Why me?

490
00:32:50,606 --> 00:32:53,287
But you never looked my way,
not even once.

491
00:32:55,622 --> 00:32:57,434
But you know, Jeong-woo...

492
00:32:58,406 --> 00:33:00,766
After you went to prison for 10 years.

493
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:03,553
You only looked at me.

494
00:33:04,372 --> 00:33:05,780
You cried when you saw me.

495
00:33:06,141 --> 00:33:08,150
You said I gave you strength.

496
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:10,228
You heard how the world
was doing through me.

497
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:11,820
You only thanked me!

498
00:33:12,217 --> 00:33:13,572
But now...

499
00:33:14,185 --> 00:33:15,368
My Jeong-woo...

500
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:18,420
You changed as soon as
you were released.

501
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,082
You betrayed me.

502
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,644
Are you doing this just because...

503
00:33:24,694 --> 00:33:26,100
Don't say it's just because!

504
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:28,740
You're the one
who fell for that slut!

505
00:33:32,891 --> 00:33:34,199
Who killed Da-eun?

506
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,390
Yeah.

507
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,647
That must be the only thing
you want to know from me.

508
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:48,791
From the moment Da-eun first
entered the warehouse...

509
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:52,417
...to the moment she died,
I captured it all on video.

510
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:53,422
Where is it?

511
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,787
Go to Seoul with me.

512
00:34:07,274 --> 00:34:09,260
If you promise to go with me,

513
00:34:09,378 --> 00:34:10,505
I'll hand...

514
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:12,875
...that video over to the police.

515
00:34:18,528 --> 00:34:20,565
You'll become free from everything.

516
00:34:20,672 --> 00:34:22,836
And you'll be able to do
whatever you want.

517
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:24,241
Your mother?

518
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:26,217
I'll get the best medical staff
to take care of her.

519
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:27,260
All you have to do...

520
00:34:27,477 --> 00:34:28,869
...is be with me...

521
00:34:29,548 --> 00:34:31,737
...and live a happy life.

522
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:35,152
I don't want any of that.

523
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:46,835
There's something I've learned
after returning to Mucheon...

524
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,020
...that's completely changed.

525
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,698
Take it all the way.

526
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,750
Do not give up.

527
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,407
Just drink this.

528
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:10,604
Drink this and I'll give you the video.

529
00:35:19,541 --> 00:35:23,144
You've gone back to the bold, brilliant
person you used to be.

530
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,787
You even drank alcohol.

531
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:31,864
<i>He was the section chief</i>
<i>of a big hospital in Mucheon.</i>

532
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:34,180
<i>And his wife was the daughter</i>
<i>of a rich family.</i>

533
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:38,179
<i>He was always buying her clothes,</i>
<i>bags and shoes.</i>

534
00:35:38,968 --> 00:35:41,740
If we're talking about
the wealthiest family in Mucheon...

535
00:35:41,919 --> 00:35:45,212
The first family that comes to mind
is the Mugu Foundation.

536
00:35:50,113 --> 00:35:50,865
Mugu Foundation?

537
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,180
With graduates of
the Mugu Foundation scholarship...

538
00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:55,540
...taking high-ranking positions
in the police force,

539
00:35:55,647 --> 00:35:57,660
it's become a major, powerful group.

540
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,182
The daughter of
the Mugu Foundation's founder...

541
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:01,460
...is Congresswoman Ye Yeong-sil.

542
00:36:01,922 --> 00:36:03,780
And her husband is
Director Park Hyeong-sik.

543
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:08,090
In 2013, he was the section chief of
the Mucheon Sarang Hospital psych ward.

544
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:10,818
This guy...

545
00:36:11,022 --> 00:36:13,626
GOH JEONG-WOO
...ought to know something.

546
00:36:19,062 --> 00:36:20,413
No matter what I try...

547
00:36:22,012 --> 00:36:23,653
No matter how hard I try...

548
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:26,822
Even if I threaten you...

549
00:36:28,874 --> 00:36:29,874
Nothing works.

550
00:36:40,297 --> 00:36:43,505
I'm giving this to you as a gift...

551
00:36:43,578 --> 00:36:47,714
...as a way of comforting and respecting
my heart for loving you for 14 years.

552
00:37:11,411 --> 00:37:13,623
Why did you have to drink?

553
00:37:20,218 --> 00:37:22,859
Once you wake up from a deep sleep,

554
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:26,726
you'll be by my side again.

555
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:39,585
What's going on?

556
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:42,740
I had a farewell drink with my friend...

557
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,449
...but he passed out.

558
00:37:45,628 --> 00:37:47,954
I'm sorry, but please help me out.

559
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,060
Help me take him home.

560
00:37:50,593 --> 00:37:51,922
I have to go back right away.

561
00:37:52,463 --> 00:37:54,823
You begged so much that I just came
to help with your stuff.

562
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,740
I'm really sorry for everything.

563
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:03,071
I'll explain everything to the CEO.

564
00:38:04,486 --> 00:38:07,375
The top manager should be
with the top actor.

565
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:08,597
Right?

566
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:12,917
Hey, why did he drink so much?

567
00:38:12,942 --> 00:38:14,792
Gosh, he's so heavy.

568
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:16,252
Oh, thank you.

569
00:38:17,634 --> 00:38:18,939
Please help.

570
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:27,389
Thank you.

571
00:38:27,414 --> 00:38:28,971
- Take care.
- Bye.

572
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,200
Jeong-woo!

573
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,543
CHOI NA-GYEOM

574
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:11,920
MUCHEON GARDEN

575
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,831
Is this Goh Jeong-woo's house?

576
00:39:20,303 --> 00:39:21,578
- Yeah.
- Why?

577
00:39:21,947 --> 00:39:23,955
Looks like he must be moving out too.

578
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,540
Yeah.

579
00:39:25,409 --> 00:39:25,992
Oh...

580
00:39:26,736 --> 00:39:29,195
Please go back and
load my stuff into the car.

581
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:33,562
I left the new script in the bedroom.

582
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,444
Don't forget to pack that.

583
00:39:36,394 --> 00:39:37,873
I need to read it on the way up.

584
00:39:38,115 --> 00:39:39,115
Okay!

585
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,063
- I'll be back quick.
- Okay.

586
00:39:41,064 --> 00:39:42,758
Call me if you need anything.

587
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,231
- Thanks.
- Sure.

588
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,069
<i>You just need to be gone...</i>

589
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:52,771
You should be careful.

590
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:54,213
<i>Ha Seol...</i>

591
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,103
<i>If you just disappear...</i>

592
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:01,070
<i>Ever since you appeared,</i>
<i>Jeong-woo changed.</i>

593
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:07,379
<i>Now everything will go back</i>
<i>to how it should be.</i>

594
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:14,266
He's usually not late.
Was he very tired?

595
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,220
Oh, excuse me.

596
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:21,628
Will she be okay without
a guardian for a few hours?

597
00:40:22,273 --> 00:40:23,877
- Yes.
- Oh, okay.

598
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:50,635
When you were inside,
you only looked upon me.

599
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:55,784
Let's go back.

600
00:40:57,523 --> 00:41:01,599
To the time when we would
look at each other and smile.

601
00:41:03,882 --> 00:41:05,402
The time when we were happy.

602
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:11,557
You just need to live in your bird cage.

603
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,168
Eat the food I give you.

604
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:17,704
And look upon me only.

605
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:23,314
I love you.

606
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:12,052
Let go of me!

607
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:14,342
Stay still or you'll break your arm.
You'll break your arm.

608
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:15,179
Let go!

609
00:42:15,556 --> 00:42:16,719
Get away from him!

610
00:42:17,555 --> 00:42:19,246
Don't touch him!

611
00:42:19,802 --> 00:42:21,231
Get your dirty hands away from him!

612
00:42:21,232 --> 00:42:22,998
- Is Jeong-woo okay?
- I don't think it's critical.

613
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:23,999
Let go of me!

614
00:42:24,471 --> 00:42:25,938
I'll kill you!

615
00:42:26,022 --> 00:42:26,844
Stop.

616
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:28,300
He's not yours!

617
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:41,222
Here.

618
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,497
GOVERNOR JEONG HYEONG-SU

619
00:42:57,276 --> 00:42:58,866
I'll be quick.

620
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:01,861
Yes.

621
00:43:07,228 --> 00:43:08,526
Oh! Jeong-woo...

622
00:43:10,294 --> 00:43:12,740
Jeong-woo, it's okay. It's me, Ha Seol.

623
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:13,903
You're safe now.

624
00:43:19,011 --> 00:43:20,282
How is he? Is he okay?

625
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:21,510
Yes, he's okay.

626
00:43:23,607 --> 00:43:25,353
Do you want to get up?

627
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:33,216
Where's about Deok-mi?

628
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:34,659
She's at the police station.

629
00:43:35,583 --> 00:43:39,100
Choi Na-gyeom moved you from
the hotel room where you passed out.

630
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:40,739
And she tried to kill Ha Seol.

631
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:43,772
I think she was trying to
frame you for Ha Seol's murder.

632
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:47,510
I'm sorry, Ha Seol.
All this because of me.

633
00:43:48,228 --> 00:43:49,622
I'm really sorry.

634
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:50,180
Oh...

635
00:43:52,483 --> 00:43:55,637
Wow. Hey, I did all the dangerous work.

636
00:43:55,693 --> 00:43:57,849
I'm the one who tracked your location.

637
00:43:57,874 --> 00:44:00,662
I ran here like crazy
in case something bad happened to you.

638
00:44:01,098 --> 00:44:02,098
Geez.

639
00:44:06,337 --> 00:44:08,624
I guess you're okay,
seeing how you can smile.

640
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:11,900
Why? Are you looking for your phone?

641
00:44:12,153 --> 00:44:13,377
You left it at my house.

642
00:44:13,378 --> 00:44:14,793
No, not that phone. Deok-mi's phone.

643
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:15,820
Deok-mi's old phone.

644
00:44:16,735 --> 00:44:18,980
That phone contains a video of
Da-eun's killer.

645
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:19,900
What?

646
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:21,372
Where is it?

647
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:22,591
At the hotel.

648
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,620
Everything is as it was
except for the mess.

649
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:33,569
Jeong-sik.

650
00:44:33,685 --> 00:44:35,860
Weren't you able to find an old phone?

651
00:44:36,094 --> 00:44:37,094
No, sir.

652
00:44:42,256 --> 00:44:43,421
You search over there.

653
00:44:58,687 --> 00:45:00,515
MUCHEON HIGH SCHOOL

654
00:45:12,286 --> 00:45:16,906
GOH JEONG-WOO

655
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:23,204
Only your photo is different.

656
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:27,273
I think it was erased because
I was a murderer.

657
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:29,020
Did Choi Na-gyeom stick this on here?

658
00:45:52,448 --> 00:45:53,448
Huh?

659
00:45:55,025 --> 00:45:56,025
What's this?

660
00:46:16,564 --> 00:46:19,235
<i>I'm going to report you</i>
<i>and destroy your life!</i>

661
00:46:22,877 --> 00:46:25,449
<i>No... No!</i>

662
00:46:31,757 --> 00:46:33,220
Let's stop watching this.

663
00:46:46,542 --> 00:46:48,034
<i>No!</i>

664
00:47:01,008 --> 00:47:02,181
What should we do?

665
00:47:04,332 --> 00:47:05,406
What do you mean?

666
00:47:06,398 --> 00:47:07,493
We need to investigate.

667
00:47:09,192 --> 00:47:10,021
Investigate.

668
00:47:10,062 --> 00:47:11,751
I really will.

669
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,056
Why? Are you scared?

670
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:21,167
Get started.

671
00:47:25,251 --> 00:47:27,541
You need to come to Suwon with me.

672
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:29,231
Within a year, you'll be promoted
to commissioner,

673
00:47:29,256 --> 00:47:31,946
then senior superintendent,
then chief superintendent.

674
00:47:31,971 --> 00:47:34,305
It'll be quick and guaranteed.

675
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,155
What do you think?

676
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,868
YE YEONG-SIL
I've heard a lot about you...

677
00:47:41,869 --> 00:47:43,242
...ever since my school days.

678
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:47,926
You did a lot of charity work
through the Mugu Foundation.

679
00:47:48,652 --> 00:47:51,022
Then this discussion
shouldn't take long.

680
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:52,540
Yes.

681
00:47:53,643 --> 00:47:57,052
You're a busy person,
so I'll get straight to the point.

682
00:47:58,767 --> 00:48:01,231
Please make him turn himself in
within 24 hours.

683
00:48:01,956 --> 00:48:02,956
Your husband, that is.

684
00:48:13,106 --> 00:48:14,988
It's an honor to have met you.

685
00:48:16,054 --> 00:48:17,266
I'll take my leave now.

686
00:48:27,566 --> 00:48:28,931
Where is he right now?

687
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:35,632
What's up with the director?

688
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:36,964
Is he resigning?

689
00:48:36,965 --> 00:48:38,108
Why isn't he coming to work?

690
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:41,577
Everything here is his.
As if he'd quit.

691
00:48:41,578 --> 00:48:44,060
I'm sure he's into some new girl
and is on a trip with her.

692
00:48:45,344 --> 00:48:47,397
But why isn't his phone working?

693
00:48:47,445 --> 00:48:49,927
Nurse Cha called him and it said
the number no longer exists.

694
00:48:55,904 --> 00:48:57,254
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

695
00:49:05,293 --> 00:49:08,403
PARK HYEONG-SIK

696
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:13,253
Who are you?

697
00:49:14,282 --> 00:49:16,203
I came for my appointment
with the doctor.

698
00:49:16,767 --> 00:49:20,193
Oh, I see...

699
00:49:25,374 --> 00:49:26,787
What were you doing in here?

700
00:49:26,788 --> 00:49:28,257
I... I...

701
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,969
I don't know anything!

702
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:46,920
Yeo-jin, great job.

703
00:49:47,165 --> 00:49:48,182
Where's the bag?

704
00:49:48,459 --> 00:49:49,622
I'm sorry.

705
00:49:49,678 --> 00:49:51,660
Someone suddenly barged in.

706
00:49:51,955 --> 00:49:55,825
So you didn't bring
the bag full of money?

707
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,242
I took everything out...
I took it out...

708
00:49:58,243 --> 00:50:01,180
But someone suddenly barged in.

709
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,687
I tried to...

710
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,620
How could you leave the money?

711
00:50:06,844 --> 00:50:09,821
How am I supposed to help you now?

712
00:50:09,822 --> 00:50:11,888
How come you can't even do
such a simple thing?

713
00:50:16,971 --> 00:50:18,929
I tried to do it...

714
00:50:18,954 --> 00:50:22,197
But he just barged in...

715
00:50:23,457 --> 00:50:25,503
I'm sorry, Yeo-jin. I'm sorry.

716
00:50:25,925 --> 00:50:29,580
I keep getting slandered
from all directions.

717
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,317
I'm just really on edge.

718
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:35,599
So who barged into the office?

719
00:50:37,456 --> 00:50:40,783
He said he had
an appointment with you...

720
00:50:41,567 --> 00:50:42,807
Sorry, just a minute.

721
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:47,790
<i>Why are you there?</i>

722
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:50,085
<i>I clearly said it was your last chance.</i>

723
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,469
<i>Come to my office right now.</i>

724
00:50:51,563 --> 00:50:53,723
<i>Don't make things difficult</i>
<i>and make me send my people.</i>

725
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,394
How is she watching me?

726
00:50:57,395 --> 00:50:58,485
Damn it.

727
00:50:59,135 --> 00:51:02,101
Yeo-jin, something urgent came up.

728
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:04,159
I'll call you.

729
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:04,980
I'll call.

730
00:51:05,283 --> 00:51:07,181
So keep your phone
with you at all times.

731
00:51:27,277 --> 00:51:28,584
I'm at the hospital.

732
00:51:30,044 --> 00:51:31,424
I saw Dr. Park Hyeong-sik.

733
00:51:36,337 --> 00:51:37,834
Don't leave me...

734
00:51:37,859 --> 00:51:38,810
Excuse me.

735
00:51:41,476 --> 00:51:43,359
Famous actor Choi Na-gyeom...

736
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:46,604
...was a witness to the
Missing Body Murder...

737
00:51:46,605 --> 00:51:49,462
<i>...back in November of 2013.</i>
<i>But despite that,</i>

738
00:51:49,463 --> 00:51:52,080
<i>she is under suspicion</i>
<i>of hiding that fact.</i>

739
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:56,823
<i>Choi recorded the murder in secret...</i>

740
00:51:56,824 --> 00:52:00,607
<i>...and used that video</i>
<i>to threaten Mr. Park.</i>

741
00:52:00,608 --> 00:52:04,090
<i>It is suspected that she used</i>
<i>those threats to set up...</i>

742
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:06,619
<i>...a financial sponsor relationship.</i>

743
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:08,621
<i>According to an anonymous</i>
<i>police source...</i>

744
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:18,235
How much do you think
my ratings will drop today?

745
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,821
Choi Na-gyeom really must be famous.

746
00:52:22,846 --> 00:52:25,100
She made my ratings rise and fall
4 to 5% in just a few days.

747
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,220
How do we fix it this time?

748
00:52:33,554 --> 00:52:34,901
I'm sorting it out now.

749
00:52:42,163 --> 00:52:44,380
An anonymous police source?

750
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:02,445
Go to the police station tomorrow
and turn yourself in.

751
00:53:07,423 --> 00:53:09,810
I won't survive a single day in prison.

752
00:53:12,161 --> 00:53:12,866
Why now?

753
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:15,671
Why are you abandoning me?

754
00:53:16,115 --> 00:53:17,903
How can you do this?

755
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,700
Why are you abandoning me?

756
00:53:19,934 --> 00:53:21,388
You have to resolve this for me.

757
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:23,142
Resolve it for me.

758
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:24,476
I can't go to prison.

759
00:53:25,259 --> 00:53:27,012
You need to withdraw from the election...

760
00:53:27,013 --> 00:53:28,608
...and seek forgiveness alongside me.

761
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:30,180
And just say it's not true.

762
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:32,269
Say you'll do your best
to prove your husband's innocence.

763
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,540
That's all you need to do.

764
00:53:33,541 --> 00:53:36,940
- Doctor, about prison...
- Enough! Enough! Be quiet!

765
00:53:37,104 --> 00:53:39,715
Every single day! Every single day!

766
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:40,740
I'm sick of it!

767
00:53:43,363 --> 00:53:45,860
I'm so tired of it! I've had enough!

768
00:53:45,937 --> 00:53:46,709
Doctor...

769
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:48,896
You shut your mouth! Alright?

770
00:53:53,301 --> 00:53:56,860
If you keep trying to abandon me...

771
00:53:59,112 --> 00:54:00,380
I won't sit still.

772
00:54:02,294 --> 00:54:04,273
You knew everything.

773
00:54:04,984 --> 00:54:08,848
I'll tell them you met
with Hyun Gu-tak directly.

774
00:54:09,842 --> 00:54:12,875
So please resolve this immediately.

775
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:29,203
CONGRESSWOMAN YE YEONG-SIL

776
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,140
Yes.

777
00:54:41,021 --> 00:54:42,654
That could be a solution.

778
00:54:44,306 --> 00:54:46,020
Resigning...

779
00:54:46,419 --> 00:54:47,945
...and seeking forgiveness...

780
00:54:49,367 --> 00:54:50,719
...for my husband.

781
00:54:52,736 --> 00:54:53,736
Ma'am!

782
00:54:57,241 --> 00:54:58,178
<i>I'm in a meeting.</i>

783
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,845
<i>Park Hyeong-sik will turn up.</i>

784
00:54:59,935 --> 00:55:01,073
<i>Don't worry too much.</i>

785
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:13,699
YE YEONG-SIL

786
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,540
Hello?

787
00:55:25,568 --> 00:55:26,678
<i>This is Goh Jeong-woo.</i>

788
00:55:28,732 --> 00:55:30,220
I think you have the wrong number.

789
00:55:32,183 --> 00:55:33,940
You left your bag in your office.

790
00:55:39,293 --> 00:55:40,607
Don't you want it?

791
00:55:41,533 --> 00:55:43,401
I'm sure you have something
to tell me as well.

792
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:44,606
Okay then.

793
00:55:45,597 --> 00:55:47,202
Ever since that day...

794
00:55:51,775 --> 00:55:54,576
First, bring me the bag.

795
00:55:55,163 --> 00:55:58,736
<i>If you bring the police or</i>
<i>anyone suspicious,</i>

796
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,356
I'll leave.

797
00:56:01,227 --> 00:56:02,227
Understood?

798
00:56:42,704 --> 00:56:44,814
Hey, my dad's been
saving this for ages.

799
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:45,456
Oh!

800
00:56:45,457 --> 00:56:46,817
But I took it without him knowing.

801
00:56:47,091 --> 00:56:48,461
- What do you think? Great job, huh?
- Get lost.

802
00:56:48,462 --> 00:56:49,565
What?

803
00:56:50,771 --> 00:56:52,701
Stop!

804
00:56:56,683 --> 00:56:57,683
Bo-yeong...

805
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:49,387
I'll protect you.

806
00:58:57,370 --> 00:58:58,370
Da-eun...

807
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,617
<i>I'll contact you within the hour.</i>

808
00:59:54,964 --> 00:59:57,501
<i>I've got the bag.</i>
<i>Let's leave together.</i>

809
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:11,980
<i>Please come back home.</i>
<i>I beg you.</i>

810
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:14,340
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>I'll let you go to prison.</i>

811
01:00:14,683 --> 01:00:16,611
<i>So come home.</i>
<i>Let's work this out together.</i>

812
01:00:19,377 --> 01:00:21,305
I guess you're scared
because I got mad.

813
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,384
Goh Jeong-woo...

814
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:52,000
<i>I'm to blame for everything.</i>

815
01:00:52,771 --> 01:00:55,281
<i>That cunning and shameless threat...</i>

816
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:59,030
<i>...caused my momentary lapse in</i>
<i>judgment that led to this tragedy.</i>

817
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:02,451
<i>I promised myself that I'd</i>
<i>turn myself in many times.</i>

818
01:01:03,177 --> 01:01:05,564
<i>But since the police</i>
<i>had already closed the case...</i>

819
01:01:06,084 --> 01:01:08,040
<i>I just couldn't work up the courage.</i>

820
01:01:09,385 --> 01:01:12,322
<i>I even kept it a secret from</i>
<i>my loving wife for 11 years.</i>

821
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:15,260
<i>All I can say is that I'm ashamed</i>
<i>for being so foolish...</i>

822
01:01:15,664 --> 01:01:17,189
<i>...to try to keep it quiet...</i>

823
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:19,985
<i>...and atone for it in my heart.</i>

824

SONGHAK REST AREA

825
01:02:01,518 --> 01:02:02,642
NOH SANG-CHEOL

826
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:09,980
Detective,

827
01:02:10,473 --> 01:02:13,129
is it possible to locate
a phone using its number?

828
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,460
You can't just do things like that.

829
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:17,438
I don't know where you learned
all these bad things.

830
01:02:17,439 --> 01:02:18,170
I'm sorry.

831
01:02:18,171 --> 01:02:20,762
I arranged to meet Park Hyeong-sik
and I'm here,

832
01:02:21,151 --> 01:02:22,980
but he's not picking up
and I don't know his car.

833
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:24,267
Where are you right now?

834
01:02:24,268 --> 01:02:26,669
I'm at Songhak Rest Area.
And the number is 010...

835
01:02:26,874 --> 01:02:27,359
Okay.

836
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:30,700
Yeah.

837
01:02:31,101 --> 01:02:32,441
Okay, got it.

838
01:02:33,841 --> 01:02:35,372
Is Songhak Rest Area far from here?

839
01:02:55,278 --> 01:02:56,094
Hey!

840
01:02:56,801 --> 01:02:57,508
Wake up!

841
01:03:03,025 --> 01:03:04,181
Wake up!

842
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,255
Wake up!

843
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:28,391
You have to wake up.

844
01:03:28,416 --> 01:03:29,416
Hey!

845
01:03:29,814 --> 01:03:31,200
Is anyone there?

846
01:03:31,455 --> 01:03:32,455
You have to wake up.

847
01:03:34,123 --> 01:03:34,820
Hey!

848
01:03:39,309 --> 01:03:40,673
Wake up!

849
01:03:41,957 --> 01:03:42,957
Da-eun!

850
01:03:44,137 --> 01:03:45,543
Hey!

851
01:04:22,878 --> 01:04:26,031
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

852
01:04:26,398 --> 01:04:28,568
<i>Though you made the wrong choice,</i>

853
01:04:28,593 --> 01:04:30,850
<i>I won't resent you.</i>

854
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:32,814
<i>The dead can't speak.</i>

855
01:04:32,815 --> 01:04:34,540
<i>But they do have their last words.</i>

856
01:04:34,832 --> 01:04:35,460
<i>Autopsy.</i>

857
01:04:35,851 --> 01:04:38,049
<i>You should head to</i>
<i>her room right now.</i>

858
01:04:38,074 --> 01:04:39,180
<i>She's...</i>

859
01:04:41,064 --> 01:04:42,064
<i>Mom.</i>

860
01:04:43,044 --> 01:04:44,684
<i>Are you admitting that</i>
<i>you're responsible?</i>

861
01:04:44,846 --> 01:04:46,498
<i>I need to ask you for one favor.</i>

862
01:04:46,964 --> 01:04:49,369
<i>I didn't kill Bo-yeong or Da-eun.</i>

863
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:51,500
<i>You knew everything!</i>

864
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:53,363
<i>Let's just end this already.</i>

865
01:04:55,063 --> 01:04:56,431
<i>It'll all be over.</i>
