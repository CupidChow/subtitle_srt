00:00:24,134 --> 00:00:32,134
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

6
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:49,471
SHIM BO-YEONG

7
00:01:00,378 --> 00:01:04,235
It's okay to leave her here, right?

8
00:01:11,282 --> 00:01:12,568
This land can't be developed.

9
00:01:14,562 --> 00:01:16,503
It's been that way for 5 years.

10
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,469
What could happen?

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,199
Even if something happens,

12
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:27,624
it'll be nothing but dirt by then.

13
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,017
That day at the warehouse.

14
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:44,946
Were you there too, Chief?

15
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,020
Why?

16
00:01:48,814 --> 00:01:51,067
Did you find my fingerprints
in Goh Jeong-woo's car?

17
00:01:57,887 --> 00:02:01,371
FINGERPRINT ANALYSIS REPORT

18
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,477
The NFS report...

19
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,103
...determined that the murder weapon
used for Shim Bo-yeong...

20
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:16,373
...was a shovel.

21
00:02:16,812 --> 00:02:18,172
And fingerprints were found on it.

22
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:22,091
Is that so?

23
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:25,236
It was Shin Min-su's father,

24
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:27,503
Shin Chu-ho.

25
00:02:31,444 --> 00:02:33,795
Did you kill her?
When Bo-yeong was alive?

26
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,072
Get his gun!

27
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:46,659
Ha Seol! Please stop him.

28
00:02:46,684 --> 00:02:49,045
It was Goh Jeong-woo, that bastard,
who killed Bo-yeong.

29
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,744
Kill him for Bo-yeong, okay?

30
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,575
- Shoot him now.
- Shut up!

31
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:03,799
Got it.

32
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:05,797
Secure the situation and...

33
00:03:05,822 --> 00:03:07,742
- ...begin the investigation immediately.
- Okay.

34
00:03:07,845 --> 00:03:08,845
Thank you, sir.

35
00:03:14,957 --> 00:03:15,957
Mister.

36
00:03:17,513 --> 00:03:18,740
Please calm down.

37
00:03:19,058 --> 00:03:20,058
Jeong-woo,

38
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:22,686
I haven't done anything
for Bo-yeong.

39
00:03:26,062 --> 00:03:26,900
All I did...

40
00:03:28,995 --> 00:03:30,991
...was buy her this $2 bracelet.

41
00:03:31,624 --> 00:03:34,557
Bo-yeong loved that bracelet, Mister.

42
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,568
She's looking down on you from heaven.

43
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,221
Please stop.

44
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:43,122
Calm down.

45
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:44,509
It's okay.

46
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:47,819
It's okay, Mister.

47
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:49,780
I'm fine.

48
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,635
And everything will be fine.
So please put down the gun.

49
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,220
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:23,292
No! Mister!

51
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,287
Mister...

52
00:04:27,138 --> 00:04:28,138
Mister...

53
00:04:29,174 --> 00:04:30,701
Mister, Mister...

54
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:36,349
Mister...

55
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,932
A clean cloth, anything.

56
00:04:38,557 --> 00:04:40,129
What do we do?

57
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:41,758
Honey!

58
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:46,589
Honey...

59
00:04:49,411 --> 00:04:50,478
Ketua Tim Noh.

60
00:04:51,912 --> 00:04:55,257
As you know, I was Goh Jeong-woo's
late father's best friend.

61
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,279
As you know, I was Goh Jeong-woo's
late father's best friend.

62
00:04:58,597 --> 00:04:59,140
Yes.

63
00:05:00,336 --> 00:05:03,148
Chief!

64
00:05:03,149 --> 00:05:05,700
There's been a shooting
in Mucheon Village.

65
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,434
I think it's a murder.

66
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:09,459
What?

67
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,571
- Hurry up and get over there.
- Yes, sir.

68
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:21,620
Mister...

69
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,570
Mister, that day in the warehouse...

70
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:24,740
Gu-tak...

71
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,268
- What did you say?
- Gu-tak...

72
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,460
Mister.

73
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:28,761
Gu-tak...

74
00:05:28,818 --> 00:05:29,857
Mister.

75
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:43,915
- Honey...
- Mister...

76
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:51,497
Mister!

77
00:05:51,869 --> 00:05:55,020
You need to tell me who was
in the warehouse!

78
00:05:55,252 --> 00:05:56,383
Honey!

79
00:06:01,138 --> 00:06:02,677
Open your eyes.

80
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:07,385
Tell me who was
in the warehouse that day...

81
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,752
Mister!

82
00:06:08,808 --> 00:06:09,832
That day...

83
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:11,071
Wake up!

84
00:06:18,533 --> 00:06:21,619
<i>Keep your promise and</i>
<i>take responsibility for my son.</i>

85
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:38,519
This is all your doing.

86
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:03,029
I'm going to tell Gu-tak everything.

87
00:07:03,054 --> 00:07:05,403
What? Are you crazy?

88
00:07:05,428 --> 00:07:07,456
Hey, watch the road!

89
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:12,274
Damn it.

90
00:07:17,117 --> 00:07:19,803
Why did you have to say that nonsense?

91
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:21,180
What do we do?

92
00:07:21,369 --> 00:07:23,239
This is driving me crazy.

93
00:07:23,264 --> 00:07:25,062
Hey! A car! A car's coming!

94
00:07:28,555 --> 00:07:29,677
What's going on?

95
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:35,522
Geez, those old people...

96
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:43,940
Shouldn't we tell Gu-tak
that Bo-yeong was alive?

97
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,272
If Gu-tak finds out,
he'll try to kill us too, you idiot.

98
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,660
Let's tell Gu-tak...

99
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:51,620
...about the accident and
the abandoned school.

100
00:07:51,709 --> 00:07:53,255
And how you killed Bo-yeong...

101
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,413
Hey, you moron!

102
00:07:57,362 --> 00:07:58,786
Get it straight, okay?

103
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,074
I could kill you right here and now.

104
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:14,010
What are you waiting for?

105
00:08:14,538 --> 00:08:15,432
Wipe your prints.

106
00:08:16,794 --> 00:08:18,060
Hurry up and wipe them.

107
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:20,060
- Damn it.
- Okay...

108
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:34,744
Hey.

109
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,150
About what happened today...

110
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:41,168
Do not tell another soul.

111
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,860
What...

112
00:08:43,437 --> 00:08:44,437
Got that?

113
00:08:44,887 --> 00:08:45,420
Okay.

114
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:46,980
Are you sure?

115
00:08:47,334 --> 00:08:48,260
Yes.

116
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,038
What's going on?

117
00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,668
- Hey, that's...
- What do we do?

118
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,169
What are you doing?
Hurry up and get out.

119
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:23,136
I said to get out.

120
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:40,986
<i>The number you have</i>
<i>dialed is unavailable...</i>

121
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,540
Honey... Jae-hee...

122
00:09:45,314 --> 00:09:46,631
It was Chu-ho.

123
00:09:47,099 --> 00:09:52,105
H-He's the b-bastard who...

124
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:54,601
...who killed Bo-yeong.

125
00:09:55,433 --> 00:09:57,048
He fooled us for 10 years.

126
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,760
So I...

127
00:09:59,645 --> 00:10:01,445
BO-YEONG, I MISS YOU
I avenged our Bo-yeong.

128
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:04,866
The bastard who killed Bo-yeong...

129
00:10:05,846 --> 00:10:06,540
I...

130
00:10:08,443 --> 00:10:09,546
I killed him.

131
00:10:11,514 --> 00:10:12,514
Bo-yeong...

132
00:10:13,345 --> 00:10:14,663
JAE-HEE
Now...

133
00:10:16,094 --> 00:10:17,838
She can rest in peace.

134
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:28,261
Get up...

135
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:30,913
You have to get up.

136
00:10:32,284 --> 00:10:34,795
You can't die.

137
00:10:40,295 --> 00:10:41,140
Who was it?

138
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,154
<i>Check over there.</i>

139
00:10:50,213 --> 00:10:51,213
How is he?

140
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,407
Goh Jeong-woo, did you kill again?

141
00:10:57,432 --> 00:11:00,220
Bo-yeong's dad killed my dad!

142
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:06,635
He said he killed his daughter...

143
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,532
...and shot him with a shotgun.

144
00:11:16,972 --> 00:11:18,991
Listen carefully,
he wouldn't have gone far,

145
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:21,176
Team 1, search the area
and strengthen the checkpoints,

146
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:23,540
- Ketua Tim Noh.
- Yes, sir?

147
00:11:23,731 --> 00:11:25,580
Let's go to Shim Dong-min's house
together.

148
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:34,285
MUCHEON GARDEN

150
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,671
It's Dong-min.

151
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:39,321
<i>Hyeon Gu-tak, come in alone.</i>

152
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:41,901
<i>If anyone else comes in,</i>

153
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,921
<i>I'll keep shooting like crazy...</i>

154
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:46,633
<i>...until you kill me.</i>

155
00:12:46,658 --> 00:12:47,500
Alright.

156
00:12:48,075 --> 00:12:49,075
I understand.

157
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:50,603
Dong...

158
00:12:55,012 --> 00:12:56,012
You can't do this.

159
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:02,258
Chief, at least wear this.

160
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:03,860
- It's too dangerous.
- It's okay.

161
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,870
Dong-min, I'm coming in.

162
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:48,002
What is this all about?

163
00:13:50,027 --> 00:13:51,694
Why did you do that to Chu-ho?

164
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:54,420
Because he killed Bo-yeong.

165
00:13:55,652 --> 00:13:56,260
What?

166
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,319
Oh, I see.

167
00:14:03,319 --> 00:14:04,319
Okay.

168
00:14:04,897 --> 00:14:06,259
I understand how you feel.

169
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:08,935
If Chu-ho really did that to Bo-yeong,

170
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,350
I think I understand how you feel.

171
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:14,420
But you should've told me first.

172
00:14:16,216 --> 00:14:17,216
Dong-min...

173
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:21,705
In situations like this,
there are extenuating circumstances.

174
00:14:22,324 --> 00:14:24,060
And I can help you,

175
00:14:24,262 --> 00:14:26,268
so put the gun down and let's talk.

176
00:14:27,624 --> 00:14:30,380
You knew, didn't you?
You had to have known.

177
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:33,029
The great Chief Hyeon Gu-tak.

178
00:14:34,018 --> 00:14:35,018
I didn't know.

179
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,166
I didn't know!

180
00:14:39,174 --> 00:14:40,614
You're really shameless, aren't you?

181
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:45,594
I called you here to kill you.

182
00:14:50,909 --> 00:14:51,829
Put the gun down.

183
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:54,340
Tell me... Just tell me the truth!

184
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:57,012
Put it down and let's talk. Come on.

185
00:15:05,181 --> 00:15:06,967
What did I do for you
to treat me like this?

186
00:15:07,826 --> 00:15:08,900
What did I do?

187
00:15:09,273 --> 00:15:11,806
Oh, was it helping
with Bo-yeong's tuition?

188
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,380
Buying her a uniform
when she started school?

189
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,142
Sending her on that field trip?

190
00:15:16,597 --> 00:15:17,300
Why?

191
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,540
Are you mad because I did that
instead of her own father?

192
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,965
I don't understand why
you're doing this!

193
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,684
I wasn't helping Bo-yeong's mom,
I was helping you,

194
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:28,100
my junior, Dong-min!

195
00:15:28,334 --> 00:15:29,662
I was helping Bo-yeong!

196
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,940
Go ahead, shoot.

197
00:15:39,447 --> 00:15:41,100
I couldn't protect Bo-yeong either.

198
00:15:42,011 --> 00:15:43,571
And I couldn't even catch the criminal.

199
00:15:44,794 --> 00:15:45,380
Shoot.

200
00:15:47,205 --> 00:15:48,658
You're her father, so it's okay.

201
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:50,309
Go on.

202
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:01,348
Shoot.

203
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,268
Situation over.

204
00:16:48,222 --> 00:16:49,500
This is all your fault.

205
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:50,614
Sorry?

206
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:54,955
You ruined everything, you bastard! You!

207
00:16:55,507 --> 00:16:56,982
Because you botched the investigation,

208
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,593
it led to all of this!

209
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,480
How are you going to take
responsibility for this? Huh?

210
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,513
But...

211
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:05,180
Get back to the station right now,
lock yourself in your office...

212
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
...and just wait there.

213
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:08,180
Don't run your mouth,

214
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:09,801
And don't go wandering around, got it?

215
00:17:11,106 --> 00:17:14,220
Team Head Noh, go and arrest
Yang Heung-su and Shin Min-su right now.

216
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,341
Why did you kill Shin Chu-ho?

217
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,670
Because...

218
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:25,909
...he killed my daughter.

219
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:29,540
I was carrying out justice.

220
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:34,163
Justice isn't a word you use
after killing someone.

221
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:37,654
How did you find out?

222
00:17:40,012 --> 00:17:41,414
Why does that matter?

223
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,079
It's the truth.

224
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,963
No, I'm asking how you found out.

225
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,076
Wait...

226
00:17:55,801 --> 00:17:57,499
How do you have this?

227
00:18:00,609 --> 00:18:04,863
Yang Heung-su said he was with him
and saw him do it.

228
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:11,439
Shin Chu-ho, that bastard,
called us all to Mucheon Garden.

229
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,103
We drank for a long time.

230
00:18:14,689 --> 00:18:16,993
We were together, I remembered it...

231
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:19,034
...so there was no way for me
to suspect him.

232
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:23,620
Even after Bo-yeong died,
the person who was the kindest to me...

233
00:18:24,886 --> 00:18:26,141
...was Shin Chu-ho.

234
00:18:28,002 --> 00:18:30,404
Shin Chu-ho, Yang Heung-su.

235
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:32,500
Who else did you drink with?

236
00:18:32,964 --> 00:18:33,780
Gu-tak.

237
00:18:33,973 --> 00:18:34,973
Hey, Dong-min.

238
00:18:35,443 --> 00:18:36,661
Why are you bringing up Chang-su?

239
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:38,378
Life is funny, isn't it?

240
00:18:38,899 --> 00:18:40,260
You know it.

241
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:43,450
No matter how hard you try
to crawl up in status,

242
00:18:44,002 --> 00:18:46,488
you can't beat Chang-su.

243
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:52,407
And Geon-oh will never beat Jeong-woo.

244
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:54,630
Hey, hey.

245
00:18:54,631 --> 00:18:55,584
Gu-tak, Gu-tak.

246
00:18:55,585 --> 00:18:56,803
Chief Hyeon was there.

247
00:18:58,313 --> 00:19:00,401
Gu-tak could never get a promotion...

248
00:19:00,402 --> 00:19:02,442
...because he aligned himself
with the wrong people,

249
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:06,098
so we'd always get together to drink.

250
00:19:07,322 --> 00:19:09,318
Yeah.
We were together.

251
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:17,924
I can finally die in peace now. However,

252
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:22,406
I feel so sorry and guilty towards...

253
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,820
...Geum-hee, Chang-su and Jeong-woo.

254
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,054
Team Head Noh,

255
00:19:35,044 --> 00:19:36,180
I did that...

256
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:38,740
...to Geum-hee.

257
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:41,723
I did it in a fit of anger.

258
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,978
So add that to my crimes.

259
00:19:47,591 --> 00:19:49,761
I'm not ashamed of killing Shin Chu-ho.

260
00:19:52,097 --> 00:19:52,820
But...

261
00:19:55,305 --> 00:19:57,477
With Geum-hee...

262
00:19:57,509 --> 00:19:58,739
I...

263
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,303
I...

264
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,595
- Byeong-mu.
- Yeah.

265
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,033
This was the best I could do.

266
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:15,060
I know.

267
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:19,107
There's no evidence to hold
the chief accountable.

268
00:20:20,091 --> 00:20:21,781
So there's no choice but
to stick with him.

269
00:20:21,979 --> 00:20:23,198
He promised...

270
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:27,170
...to have you released on probation.

271
00:20:30,968 --> 00:20:32,090
We'll have to wait and see.

272
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,576
As long as this bastard
keeps his mouth shut.

273
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:48,897
Hey, Shin Min-su, look at me.

274
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,124
Look up.

275
00:21:00,678 --> 00:21:02,697
Don't you ever say anything
about the chief.

276
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,350
Even after you're taken
by the prosecution,

277
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:09,220
don't think that you're
out of the chief's reach.

278
00:21:09,634 --> 00:21:11,339
It's already all over for me.

279
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:13,194
So why should I lie?

280
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:14,561
What about back then with
Goh Jeong-woo?

281
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:16,986
Did we not say anything then
because we didn't know anything?

282
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,125
Even if Goh Jeong-woo
really killed both of them,

283
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,378
he wouldn't have been
locked up for 10 years.

284
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,116
But look,

285
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:27,940
it was the chief who set it all up
for him to go in for 10 years.

286
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:31,746
So please get it together, you moron.

287
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:33,900
If you and I get unlucky,

288
00:21:34,275 --> 00:21:35,980
we'll just end up with longer sentences.

289
00:21:36,474 --> 00:21:39,780
They could even add things like
contempt of court to our charges.

290
00:21:40,012 --> 00:21:41,578
So what do you want from me?

291
00:21:42,456 --> 00:21:45,380
My father is dead...

292
00:21:45,503 --> 00:21:47,201
Stop crying!

293
00:21:49,592 --> 00:21:50,811
Shin Min-su.

294
00:21:52,946 --> 00:21:54,660
In the worst case,

295
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:57,553
you'll end up dead like your dad.

296
00:22:11,301 --> 00:22:13,833
Chang-su and his wife
were going on a trip,

297
00:22:14,607 --> 00:22:17,338
so Chu-ho invited me and Dong-min over
to raid their fridge...

298
00:22:17,363 --> 00:22:19,289
...and cook something for us.

299
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:23,500
So we closed shop
and ate for a long time.

300
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,686
Dong-min got drunk as usual
and left first.

301
00:22:26,848 --> 00:22:30,001
Chu-ho and I kept drinking...

302
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,308
...when we got a call.

303
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,118
From the boys.

304
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:39,100
We ran over to the warehouse,
and it had already happened.

305
00:22:39,472 --> 00:22:44,448
Chu-ho quickly sent
the boys somewhere...

306
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,900
...and told me to put Bo-yeong...

307
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:49,491
...into Jeong-woo's car trunk.

308
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:53,507
Who was there at Mucheon Garden
that night?

309
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,747
How many times are you going to ask?

310
00:22:57,461 --> 00:23:00,357
Chu-ho, me, and Dong-min.

311
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:04,862
Shin Dong-min claims that
Chief Hyeon Gu-tak was also there.

312
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:09,260
Why would Chief Hyeon be there?

313
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,696
Dong-min, that punk,
always got drunk first...

314
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:13,820
...and never remembered anything.

315
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:18,660
Chief Hyeon never hung out with us.

316
00:23:19,373 --> 00:23:22,820
He was really close with Chang-su,

317
00:23:23,258 --> 00:23:25,260
so he'd sometimes come
when Chang-su was there.

318
00:23:26,102 --> 00:23:29,638
Chief Hyeon didn't respect us...

319
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:33,384
...because we were poor
and we didn't even graduate college.

320
00:23:35,921 --> 00:23:40,300
You're so saying you witnessed
Shin Chu-ho murder Shim Bo-yeong?

321
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,420
Yes.

322
00:23:42,065 --> 00:23:44,620
When we got to the abandoned school
in Cheonsu Village,

323
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,336
I opened the trunk and...

324
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:54,820
Bo-yeong was trying to utter something.

325
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:59,180
I was so relieved and suggested
we take her to the hospital.

326
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:03,180
But Chu-ho, that monster...

327
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:05,620
He bludgeoned Bo-yeong's head...

328
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:08,060
...with the shovel.

329
00:24:08,374 --> 00:24:10,679
Over and over again.

330
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:22,596
- Let's go.
- Okay.

331
00:24:29,417 --> 00:24:30,490
Okay...

332
00:25:06,794 --> 00:25:07,460
Sit down.

333
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:09,915
Yes, sir.

334
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,569
- Team Head Noh.
- Yes.

335
00:25:21,882 --> 00:25:23,618
You can question me too if you need to.

336
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:26,060
Just tell me at any time.

337
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,772
Of course I should.

338
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:29,141
Alright.

339
00:25:31,911 --> 00:25:32,911
But Chief,

340
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:40,617
where were you
at the time of the incident?

341
00:25:56,003 --> 00:25:59,440
Former Chief Inspector Lee Jae-sik
called me downtown.

342
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:02,265
He's at the Northern Police Agency now,
so you can confirm it with him.

343
00:26:04,393 --> 00:26:05,393
Anything else?

344
00:26:10,524 --> 00:26:12,813
MUCHEON POLICE STATION

345
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:28,779
<i>Jeong-woo.</i>

346
00:26:29,322 --> 00:26:30,681
I want Goh Jeong-woo.

347
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:35,010
I've liked Jeong-woo for a long time.

348
00:26:37,389 --> 00:26:38,389
Please help me out.

349
00:26:38,992 --> 00:26:40,807
So that Jeong-woo can...

350
00:26:41,631 --> 00:26:43,698
...leave Mucheon for good with me.

351
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,285
Me?

352
00:26:48,056 --> 00:26:49,115
How can I help?

353
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:50,384
In this world,

354
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,868
there are many cold cases where...

355
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:55,246
...the culprit is never found.

356
00:26:56,201 --> 00:26:58,800
I don't want the doctor to suffer.

357
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:00,647
I just want Jeong-woo...

358
00:27:01,978 --> 00:27:03,124
...to sever all ties with Da-eun...

359
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,514
...and everything that happened...

360
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:10,820
I want Jung-woo to be by my side forever.

361
00:27:11,332 --> 00:27:15,010
And I'm sure you want that too.

362
00:27:15,171 --> 00:27:19,466
<i>At 12:38 today,</i>
<i>at a restaurant in Mucheon...</i>

363
00:27:19,491 --> 00:27:22,193
- Congressman.
- <i>A man committed murder with a shotgun.</i>

364
00:27:22,194 --> 00:27:24,856
<i>The culprit, Mr. Shim,</i>
<i>was the father of Shim Bo-yeong,</i>

365
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:26,445
<i>the victim of the Mucheon</i>
<i>Missing Body Murder...</i>

366
00:27:26,446 --> 00:27:29,263
<i>...from 11 years ago.</i>
<i>He suspected the deceased, Mr. Shin,</i>

367
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:32,388
who was a close friend,

368
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:34,780
of murdering his daughter...

369
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:38,340
...and enacted revenge after an argument.

370
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:43,888
<i>11 years ago, the Missing</i>
<i>Body Murder case was closed...</i>

371
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,498
...with Mr. Goh being
sentenced as the culprit.

372
00:27:47,704 --> 00:27:49,793
At the time of the incident
11 years ago,

373
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:51,980
there were clear errors...

374
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,518
...in the preliminary investigation
by the detective in charge.

375
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,096
He failed to identify the actual culprit...

376
00:27:58,097 --> 00:28:00,197
...due to bad judgment.

377
00:28:00,961 --> 00:28:03,060
I sincerely apologize to the public...

378
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:06,353
...and the victim's family.

379
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:15,029
Damn it.

380
00:28:17,546 --> 00:28:18,546
Goh Jeong-woo.

381
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,254
Goh Jeong-woo is the culprit.

382
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:22,382
He must be.

383
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,701
Ji-yeon! Have you been well?

384
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,871
Long time no see.

385
00:28:29,769 --> 00:28:31,660
Now you recognize that this case
is strange, right?

386
00:28:33,565 --> 00:28:35,180
- Ji-yeon?
- Yes?

387
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:36,605
Let me ask you for one more favor.

388
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:38,980
- What now?
- One of the victims,

389
00:28:39,294 --> 00:28:43,196
Park Da-eun,
transferred to Mucheon from Seoul.

390
00:28:43,957 --> 00:28:46,529
And I heard her
grandmother is still alive.

391
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,720
Now I can just meet up with her.

392
00:28:49,041 --> 00:28:51,060
But can you find out where she hung out...

393
00:28:51,398 --> 00:28:54,300
...or if she has any friends
still in Seoul?

394
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:57,620
Are you actually trying to subcontract
the Investigation Unit?

395
00:28:57,982 --> 00:28:58,700
Yes.

396
00:28:59,236 --> 00:28:59,981
Thanks.

397
00:29:21,087 --> 00:29:22,037
Yes, Congresswoman.

398
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,834
Yes, I understand.

399
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:29,779
Yes.

400
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:46,418
A few days ago,
I toured the west coast.

401
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,771
I was thinking deeply
about how to revive

402
00:29:49,796 --> 00:29:52,172
Gyeonggi's lagging economy...

403
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:56,400
...when I noticed how beautiful the
sunset was and took some photos.

404
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:59,916
My secretary thought they looked
wonderful and printed them for me.

405
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,096
But I found another photo among them.

406
00:30:05,673 --> 00:30:09,081
I thought it might belong to you.

407
00:30:20,077 --> 00:30:22,027
I guess I wasn't the
only one who wanted...

408
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:24,041
...that case closed quickly 11 years ago.

409
00:30:26,622 --> 00:30:28,740
It must've tormented you.

410
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:30,819
But now,

411
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,744
you want to reopen the case?

412
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:37,254
My Su-oh is a talented artist.

413
00:30:38,185 --> 00:30:38,860
Sorry?

414
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,412
I'm not sure what he saw...

415
00:30:44,172 --> 00:30:45,852
...but if he did see something that night,

416
00:30:46,937 --> 00:30:48,630
I wasn't the only person he saw.

417
00:31:01,272 --> 00:31:02,805
This is a gift for you.

418
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:04,459
It's the original.

419
00:31:05,754 --> 00:31:06,325
Congresswoman,

420
00:31:07,274 --> 00:31:10,823
as you well know,
Su-oh is mentally unwell.

421
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:14,094
So whatever he draws from
his unwell imagination...

422
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:17,663
...couldn't be evidence or
used to threaten anyone.

423
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:20,989
Oh, there's one more thing
I'd like to give you.

424
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,140
I've been holding on to this
for quite some time now.

425
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:27,774
But I'm unsure what to do with it.

426
00:31:45,457 --> 00:31:46,457
Congresswoman,

427
00:31:47,885 --> 00:31:50,471
this is all just
circumstantial evidence.

428
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:54,061
The investigation 11 years ago
was based on circumstantial evidence...

429
00:31:54,062 --> 00:31:56,782
...and that is why we're having
all of that commotion in Mucheon now.

430
00:31:57,949 --> 00:32:00,597
We can never
let that happen again, right?

431
00:32:01,876 --> 00:32:04,589
Looks like you and I have
lots to discuss today.

432
00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:15,308
I want to go to Suwon too.

433
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:32,349
Once I become governor, you can join me
as the Head of Public Security.

434
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,396
Within a year,
you'll be promoted to commissioner,

435
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:37,107
then senior superintendent,
then chief superintendent.

436
00:32:37,132 --> 00:32:39,482
It'll be quick and guaranteed.

437
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:41,415
What do you think?

438
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,423
Gosh.

439
00:32:43,051 --> 00:32:45,011
Just hearing you lay it out
is really exciting me.

440
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:47,500
But first,

441
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:51,245
please handle that case.

442
00:32:58,441 --> 00:32:59,821
I'm listening.

443
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:02,142
Then I'll have to replace
Su-oh's primary physician first.

444
00:33:26,444 --> 00:33:27,384
Are you upset?

445
00:33:30,836 --> 00:33:31,720
No, sir.

446
00:33:32,328 --> 00:33:35,415
It's all because of my shortcomings.

447
00:33:35,959 --> 00:33:37,100
I'm deeply sorry.

448
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,641
It was a mistake.

449
00:33:44,461 --> 00:33:46,061
We make mistakes all the time, don't we?

450
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:50,039
But this mistake is too big.

451
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,173
There are so many holes
that there's no way to cover them all.

452
00:33:53,367 --> 00:33:55,060
At times like these, it's best to
quickly acknowledge everything...

453
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:57,900
...and fix things one by one.

454
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:03,860
But what I just don't understand is...

455
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:07,060
How did Shin Chu-ho kill her at
the abandoned school with a shovel?

456
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:09,989
I mean, there was definitely blood...

457
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,990
- ...on the farming machinery...
- Hee-do, Hee-do!

458
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,223
I know, okay?

459
00:34:15,835 --> 00:34:17,023
I understand how you feel.

460
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:20,780
We couldn't even find the body,
so why would we care about some shovels?

461
00:34:21,535 --> 00:34:22,380
I understand.

462
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:25,387
But that's just an excuse at this point.

463
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:26,980
That's not all.

464
00:34:27,163 --> 00:34:29,257
You failed with the car accident
witness testimony.

465
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:32,482
I don't know.

466
00:34:33,728 --> 00:34:36,164
I'm not even sure anymore whether
the bloody shoes you reported to me...

467
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:37,616
...were real or not.

468
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:40,333
Anyway, my point is that
they will all cause issues.

469
00:34:42,638 --> 00:34:43,682
Can you endure it?

470
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:44,940
Sorry?

471
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:51,454
The internal inspection will soon begin.
Can you handle it?

472
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,087
What is this?

473
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,218
You need to resign.

474
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,180
It's a security company in Jeju.

475
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:16,265
They can match your housing and salary.

476
00:35:19,563 --> 00:35:21,526
Once the investigation starts
and the disciplinary process begins,

477
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:22,979
you can't even resign.

478
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,805
Hee-do,

479
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:29,380
I don't want to see the junior
that I cherish the most...

480
00:35:29,554 --> 00:35:32,698
...be interrogated by young brats,
get disciplined,

481
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,472
and be dishonorably discharged
from the force.

482
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,163
If you resign then, you won't
even have anywhere to go.

483
00:35:40,914 --> 00:35:42,057
So resign now.

484
00:35:42,852 --> 00:35:44,100
Once you do,

485
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:46,519
I'll take care of the rest.

486
00:35:48,107 --> 00:35:50,599
And I'll deal with the
internal inspection myself.

487
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,395
I can take the disciplinary action.

488
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:55,528
This is the very last thing
I can do for you.

489
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:58,285
Let's do that.

490
00:36:11,722 --> 00:36:12,460
You're home?

491
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:15,205
Huh?

492
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:16,873
Are you going somewhere?

493
00:36:16,874 --> 00:36:18,265
I saw the press conference.

494
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:20,194
The case is being reopened, right?

495
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,413
Yeah.

496
00:36:22,193 --> 00:36:23,507
And I'll do it right this time.

497
00:36:33,676 --> 00:36:35,788
I'm going to focus on nursing my mom
for the time being.

498
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,500
The nurses are really good to her
but it bothers me that I'm not there.

499
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,180
That sounds like a good idea.

500
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:44,220
But Jeong-woo,

501
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:48,460
I feel uneasy about you.

502
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:49,774
A shotgun?

503
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:55,100
And Shin Chu-ho and Yang Heung-su
orchestrating all of this by themselves?

504
00:36:55,443 --> 00:36:56,735
It's too perfect.

505
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:00,832
Let me see your phone.

506
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:02,420
Right now.

507
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,117
Why?

508
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:11,100
There's an app where
we can link our phones...

509
00:37:11,544 --> 00:37:13,900
...and we can always check
each other's locations.

510
00:37:15,947 --> 00:37:16,700
What's this?

511
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:18,740
What is it?

512
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,209
Do you already use this app?

513
00:37:22,268 --> 00:37:25,786
You location is linked to
Choi Na-gyeom's phone.

514
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:27,976
GOH JEONG-WOO, CHOI NA-GYEOM

515
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,579
There.

516
00:37:38,601 --> 00:37:40,434
I've linked our phones
using another app,

517
00:37:40,435 --> 00:37:42,495
so always carry your phone with you.

518
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:44,180
Okay.

519
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:49,180
Alright then. Let's go over this
one more time.

520
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,633
Choi Na-gyeom is definitely
in love with you.

521
00:37:53,534 --> 00:37:55,029
But even so,

522
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:57,340
she's way too obsessed with you
and this case.

523
00:37:57,501 --> 00:37:58,784
There's a lot she's hiding too.

524
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:00,398
Look here.

525
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,620
On the day of the incident,

526
00:38:02,925 --> 00:38:06,756
Shim Bo-yeong,
Yang Byeong-mu, Shin Min-su...

527
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:09,218
WITNESS? SPECTATOR?
...and Hyeon Geon-oh were in the warehouse.

528
00:38:09,331 --> 00:38:12,069
And this isn't for certain but
according to Ha Seol's assertions,

529
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:15,475
Hyeon Su-oh was also somewhere
in the warehouse.

530
00:38:15,476 --> 00:38:18,087
And when we look at
Hyeon Su-oh's drawing,

531
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:22,697
Choi Na-gyeom was somewhere
in the warehouse that day.

532
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:28,620
But then why did she give evidence
at the police station the next day...

533
00:38:28,963 --> 00:38:30,473
...saying she wasn't there at all?

534
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,707
She's cheating on you, you know that?

535
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:36,563
You're being fooled by Da-eun.

536
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,284
What do you guys know
about Da-eun to talk like that?

537
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:40,164
Why are you badmouthing her?

538
00:38:40,455 --> 00:38:42,438
Do you even know where she is right now?

539
00:38:42,463 --> 00:38:43,550
Get out.

540
00:38:44,325 --> 00:38:45,761
Just get out!

541
00:38:45,786 --> 00:38:46,786
Get out!

542
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:02,725
Oh, no. Sorry about this.

543
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,980
If it breaks, you'll buy me
a better one, right?

544
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,268
I guess you're right.

545
00:39:11,787 --> 00:39:12,460
My number.

546
00:39:17,867 --> 00:39:19,697
<i>Get a grip!</i>

547
00:39:25,075 --> 00:39:28,288
No one knows that we're here.

548
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:31,955
Let's move Bo-yeong.

549
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:52,436
Jeong-woo...

550
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,508
Jeong-woo...

551
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,874
<i>Da-eun, please tell me</i>
<i>if I did anything wrong.</i>

552
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:29,218
<i>I'll change.</i>

553
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:32,212
<i>So please just call me.</i>

554
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,792
CHUNGJU WEEDAHM INTEGRATIVE HOSPITAL

555
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:53,793
Geum-hee...

556
00:41:01,137 --> 00:41:02,249
I'm so sorry.

557
00:41:03,941 --> 00:41:06,071
I'm so, so sorry.

558
00:41:06,072 --> 00:41:07,366
What can I do?

559
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,531
Please wake up.

560
00:41:10,406 --> 00:41:12,856
Please wake up and let me
pay for my sins.

561
00:41:15,565 --> 00:41:16,732
Geum-hee...

562
00:41:19,306 --> 00:41:20,964
It wasn't Jeong-woo.

563
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:23,032
It wasn't your son.

564
00:41:23,234 --> 00:41:25,608
Your son didn't do it.

565
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,554
Geum-hee...

566
00:41:30,743 --> 00:41:32,677
Please stay alive.

567
00:41:33,258 --> 00:41:35,820
Please live with your son again.

568
00:41:38,169 --> 00:41:39,689
Geum-hee...

569
00:42:45,882 --> 00:42:49,621
The Central Party is asking if you must
hold the ceremony in Mucheon.

570
00:42:49,622 --> 00:42:52,138
They're suggesting Suwon
or Uijeongbu instead.

571
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:53,180
They're suggesting Suwon
or Uijeongbu instead.

572
00:42:53,462 --> 00:42:54,785
Don't talk about hope.

573
00:42:55,413 --> 00:42:56,532
Look at reality.

574
00:42:57,197 --> 00:42:58,437
GYEONGGI GOVERNOR POLL SURVEY

575
00:42:58,935 --> 00:43:01,471
Congresswoman, why don't you
use Choi Na-gyeom?

576
00:43:01,472 --> 00:43:04,020
How can an actor help in an election?

577
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:07,700
She's actually much more popular
than you think.

578
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:11,406
Why don't you post something short
on social media and watch the reaction?

579
00:43:13,243 --> 00:43:14,140
Please help me out.

580
00:43:14,357 --> 00:43:18,246
So that Jeong-woo can
leave Mucheon for good with me.

581
00:43:19,942 --> 00:43:21,189
I'm sorry. I messed up.

582
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,122
I should have paid
more attention back then.

583
00:43:25,717 --> 00:43:27,340
Even if you couldn't believe me,

584
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,774
you should've kept
looking for the girls.

585
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:34,202
Bo-yeong was all alone,
in the dark when she...

586
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,479
When you've been doing this
for as long as I have,

587
00:43:42,302 --> 00:43:43,861
sometimes there are cases...

588
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:47,935
...where everything comes together
perfectly like a picture.

589
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:50,020
But that's the problem.

590
00:43:50,581 --> 00:43:52,975
The picture is so perfect in your mind...

591
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:56,220
...that you even miss clear evidence
that's right in front of you.

592
00:43:56,697 --> 00:43:58,937
I think that's what happened
with this case 11 years ago.

593
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:02,306
I should have paid
more attention back then.

594
00:44:02,983 --> 00:44:05,387
I should have dragged him to the doctor...

595
00:44:05,388 --> 00:44:07,900
...to get his medical checkups.

596
00:44:10,971 --> 00:44:13,729
I've really wronged you and your father.

597
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,947
No, uncle.

598
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,989
Thank you.

599
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:25,940
Jeong-woo,

600
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,156
you're like a son to me.

601
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:33,860
From now on, I'll be your father.

602
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,257
I hope you can think of me
in that way too.

603
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:38,824
Okay?

604
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:42,487
Okay?

605
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:45,900
Just tell me if there's
anything you need.

606
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:46,911
Got that?

607
00:44:48,581 --> 00:44:49,580
But uncle...

608
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:51,626
Yes, what is it? Do you need something?

609
00:44:55,855 --> 00:44:58,188
I still can't remember anything.

610
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:00,620
What?

611
00:45:01,276 --> 00:45:03,315
Even if I blacked out...

612
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:07,780
I've studied a lot in here
reading various books.

613
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:09,893
They all say that a person can't
lose all of their memories.

614
00:45:09,894 --> 00:45:11,231
That they would remember
at least something...

615
00:45:11,256 --> 00:45:11,970
Jeong-woo,

616
00:45:14,063 --> 00:45:15,620
it's already been 9 years.

617
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:18,758
Why are you bringing it up again
only to torment yourself?

618
00:45:21,157 --> 00:45:23,429
You're only 30 once you get out.

619
00:45:24,823 --> 00:45:26,045
30.

620
00:45:28,321 --> 00:45:31,204
Once you get out, I'll do everything
within my power to help you.

621
00:45:32,441 --> 00:45:33,220
A job?

622
00:45:33,579 --> 00:45:34,857
I can help you find a job.

623
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:37,275
No, you were a smart kid.

624
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,861
You can prepare
to go to university again.

625
00:45:39,593 --> 00:45:41,260
Whether it's living costs or tuition,

626
00:45:41,418 --> 00:45:44,047
I'll ensure you and your mother
have zero financial worries.

627
00:45:44,048 --> 00:45:47,591
So you just focus on your life.

628
00:45:48,573 --> 00:45:50,179
You're only 30 once you get out.

629
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,839
Section Chief Kim was just so certain,

630
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,980
and since he was a junior
that I cherished,

631
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:00,714
I took him by his word too easily.

632
00:46:03,648 --> 00:46:05,157
But this is just an excuse.

633
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:09,890
This is the only thing
I can say to you right now.

634
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:13,725
Even though it's too late,
I know the truth now,

635
00:46:14,614 --> 00:46:18,221
so I'll do my very best
to find the real culprit.

636
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:20,528
Once I find them,

637
00:46:21,422 --> 00:46:24,865
I'll come and ask you and
your late father for forgiveness.

638
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,910
And I will spend the rest of my life...

639
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:31,068
...repaying this debt
to you and your mother.

640
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:34,760
Be with Bo-yeong on her final journey.

641
00:47:32,813 --> 00:47:34,020
Why are you making him leave already?

642
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:36,187
Her mom is here.

643
00:47:36,714 --> 00:47:38,354
I've already said
my goodbyes to Bo-yeong.

644
00:47:44,579 --> 00:47:45,696
Dong-min,

645
00:47:47,055 --> 00:47:48,575
are you sure you're okay to leave now?

646
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:55,581
Yeah.

647
00:48:08,178 --> 00:48:10,179
<i>It was the day after</i>
<i>the college entrance exam.</i>

648
00:48:10,908 --> 00:48:13,350
<i>Besides Geon-oh, Deok-mi and me,</i>

649
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,875
<i>everyone else had failed their exams...</i>

650
00:48:18,747 --> 00:48:19,660
No,

651
00:48:20,697 --> 00:48:22,928
It was a completely different voice.

652
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:25,220
It was a deep, soft voice...

653
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:29,708
...that sounded like a school teacher.

654
00:48:30,459 --> 00:48:31,300
Gosh.

655
00:48:32,485 --> 00:48:35,322
I've been trying so hard
to forget that voice...

656
00:48:35,347 --> 00:48:38,517
That man cursed at Da-eun,

657
00:48:38,518 --> 00:48:42,381
calling her a high school tramp
or something like that.

658
00:48:42,382 --> 00:48:43,220
And Da-eun...

659
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,633
...said "Mister something,"

660
00:48:49,991 --> 00:48:51,790
Oh, Detective,

661
00:48:53,107 --> 00:48:57,780
please find my dear Da-eun. Please.

662
00:48:58,119 --> 00:49:00,137
The Central Party will send
a large support team,

663
00:49:00,206 --> 00:49:02,717
so we'll only have the advance team
go to Suwon today.

664
00:49:03,082 --> 00:49:04,082
Yes, understood.

665
00:49:11,852 --> 00:49:12,620
<i>Yes, Congresswoman.</i>

666
00:49:13,169 --> 00:49:15,180
Chief, he'll be home soon.

667
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,279
Then I'll have to replace
Su-oh's primary physician first.

668
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:40,654
<i>So he'll take back my hostage.</i>

669
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:53,140
You did great.
I should've gone to pick you up.

670
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,440
Get out.

671
00:49:56,998 --> 00:49:59,420
Look how haggard Su-oh's face is!

672
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:01,121
Is there anything you want to eat?

673
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:03,240
I made all the foods that you like.

674
00:50:03,622 --> 00:50:04,996
How have you been?

675
00:50:04,997 --> 00:50:07,218
Chief, why did you suddenly
want Su-oh home?

676
00:50:11,847 --> 00:50:13,047
I thought you knew...

677
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:15,880
My apologies.

678
00:50:15,881 --> 00:50:17,477
I should have called you directly.

679
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:19,575
Oh...

680
00:50:20,522 --> 00:50:22,603
- It's a good thing.
- Yes.

681
00:50:24,072 --> 00:50:25,981
Thank you for your hard work.

682
00:50:53,911 --> 00:50:54,911
Hello?

683
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,318
It's me.

684
00:50:57,065 --> 00:50:59,098
I took Su-oh home like you said to.

685
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,600
What should I do now?

686
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:03,719
Alright.

687
00:51:10,736 --> 00:51:12,218
Because I saw everything that day.

688
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:14,757
Murderer.

689
00:51:14,782 --> 00:51:16,526
I'll take care of it. Don't do a thing.

690
00:51:16,566 --> 00:51:18,180
You can't resolve this!

691
00:51:18,387 --> 00:51:19,511
Don't forget...

692
00:51:20,138 --> 00:51:21,931
...the things I always say.

693
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:36,380
What's this smell?

694
00:52:37,828 --> 00:52:39,505
The smell of youth.

695
00:52:44,107 --> 00:52:46,499
There's so much dust in here...

696
00:52:48,471 --> 00:52:51,243
It's a bit disgusting.

697
00:52:51,438 --> 00:52:52,142
Doc.

698
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:54,420
I mean,

699
00:52:55,706 --> 00:52:56,706
babe.

700
00:52:58,303 --> 00:52:59,303
Come here.

701
00:53:00,968 --> 00:53:01,968
Yeah.

702
00:53:28,197 --> 00:53:29,526
How dare you...

703
00:53:32,052 --> 00:53:33,239
...mock me?

704
00:53:34,193 --> 00:53:35,480
You, of all people?

705
00:53:37,163 --> 00:53:40,239
You filthy slut...

706
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:45,516
Stop acting up and just be grateful
for what I give you.

707
00:53:45,953 --> 00:53:47,574
Hey, you perverted old loser!

708
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,306
You're so scared of that
great congresswoman.

709
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:57,413
You're the one meeting
a minor in secret...

710
00:53:57,438 --> 00:53:59,670
...and panting like a dog over her.

711
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:01,540
You disgusting freak.

712
00:54:01,665 --> 00:54:02,665
Why you little...

713
00:54:03,443 --> 00:54:04,260
You...

714
00:54:04,413 --> 00:54:05,912
I've treated you too nicely.

715
00:54:06,402 --> 00:54:08,848
I told you never to speak
to me like that!

716
00:54:12,982 --> 00:54:14,095
Hey, you bastard!

717
00:54:15,883 --> 00:54:17,090
I'm going to report you!

718
00:54:17,517 --> 00:54:20,549
I don't care.
I'm going to leave here anyway.

719
00:54:21,247 --> 00:54:24,086
I am goning to report
and shut you down!

720
00:54:44,287 --> 00:54:45,527
No!

721
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:02,091
Da-eun...

722
00:55:04,604 --> 00:55:06,322
Da-eun, Da-eun?

723
00:56:26,954 --> 00:56:28,160
Where are we?

724
00:56:28,754 --> 00:56:30,351
My class president's warehouse.

725
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:33,262
Oh, the guy that has a crush on you?

726
00:56:34,942 --> 00:56:36,893
Goh Jeong-woo...

727
00:56:37,456 --> 00:56:38,487
Yeah,

728
00:56:38,991 --> 00:56:40,247
Goh Jeong-woo.

729
00:56:40,248 --> 00:56:41,440
Mucheon Garden.

730
00:57:28,503 --> 00:57:29,260
Honey...

731
00:57:31,848 --> 00:57:34,245
Looks like you've had a long day.

732
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:37,818
Explain this blood.

733
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,818
Honey, the thing is...

734
00:57:41,269 --> 00:57:42,870
I always told you.

735
00:57:43,837 --> 00:57:45,783
There are just three things
you must not do.

736
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,013
Don't get them pregnant.

737
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:53,683
Don't do anything that
money can't fix.

738
00:57:55,275 --> 00:57:57,268
Don't do anything that'll
end up on the news.

739
00:57:59,005 --> 00:58:01,082
Is this that difficult?

740
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,422
I...

741
00:58:06,564 --> 00:58:07,380
Silence!

742
00:58:15,004 --> 00:58:18,554
Tell me every single thing
that happened from the moment...

743
00:58:20,686 --> 00:58:22,406
...you left home for work
until this moment.

744
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,168
Don't leave out a single minute.

745
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:40,940
Hello?

746
00:58:41,488 --> 00:58:42,028
<i>Hi.</i>

747
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:45,856
<i>Goh Jeong-woo,</i>
<i>I met Park Da-eun's grandmother.</i>

748
00:58:48,918 --> 00:58:50,350
What did Da-eun's grandmother say?

749
00:58:51,376 --> 00:58:52,671
<i>Hmm...</i>

750
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:54,526
<i>She said it's not you.</i>

751
00:58:54,551 --> 00:58:55,643
Of course, it's not.

752
00:58:55,668 --> 00:58:58,312
A deep and soft voice like
that of a teacher.

753
00:58:59,888 --> 00:59:01,737
The suspect in Park
Da-eun's murder case...

754
00:59:02,513 --> 00:59:04,940
...is definitely not someone
around Park Da-eun's age.

755
00:59:05,127 --> 00:59:05,920
<i>That's for certain, right?</i>

756
00:59:06,193 --> 00:59:07,780
<i>She remembers clearly...</i>

757
00:59:08,096 --> 00:59:09,604
...It definitely could have been
her sugar daddy.

758
00:59:17,177 --> 00:59:18,460
I guess you'll catch him soon.

759
00:59:18,707 --> 00:59:19,837
<i>Thank you for your hard work.</i>

760
00:59:19,838 --> 00:59:21,306
Okay. Get home safe.

761
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:41,244
When did you come down here?

762
01:00:02,306 --> 01:00:04,226
I got rid of those weird pictures.

763
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,900
I burned them all,
so don't look for them.

764
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:10,403
Su-oh,

765
01:00:11,685 --> 01:00:13,271
it's all my fault.

766
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,000
So you just have to forget.

767
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,092
I won't ask where you were that day...

768
01:00:19,178 --> 01:00:21,909
...or who you saw that day.

769
01:00:24,006 --> 01:00:25,228
Let's just forget it all,

770
01:00:26,742 --> 01:00:27,745
okay?

771
01:00:31,652 --> 01:00:33,875
Who did this, you punks?

772
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:39,928
How dare you...

773
01:00:47,641 --> 01:00:48,937
I'm glad you're home.

774
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:52,016
Oh, right.

775
01:00:52,822 --> 01:00:54,911
Geon-oh went back to America.

776
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:57,625
He wanted to travel somewhere.

777
01:01:35,265 --> 01:01:36,265
Sorry.

778
01:01:37,216 --> 01:01:38,496
I made you wait too long, right?

779
01:01:46,908 --> 01:01:50,774
SNOW WHITE

780
01:02:00,457 --> 01:02:04,529
<i>Snow White's cheeks were still rosy,</i>

781
01:02:05,086 --> 01:02:07,300
<i>as if she were still alive.</i>

782
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,208
<i>The dwarfs said,</i>

783
01:02:11,164 --> 01:02:13,847
<i>"We can't bury the princess</i>
<i>in the dark earth."</i>

784
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:18,824
<i>That is why the dwarfs built...</i>

785
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:20,733
<i>...a transparent coffin of glass.</i>

786
01:02:22,263 --> 01:02:25,526
<i>Snow White lay in</i>
<i>the coffin for years...</i>

787
01:02:25,847 --> 01:02:27,765
<i>...but her body did not decay.</i>

788
01:02:28,417 --> 01:02:30,789
<i>It just looked as though</i>
<i>she was asleep.</i>

789
01:02:31,902 --> 01:02:36,507
<i>Her skin was as white as snow.</i>
<i>Her lips as red as blood.</i>

790
01:02:37,178 --> 01:02:39,843
<i>And her hair as black as ebony.</i>

791
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,603
BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

792
01:03:21,743 --> 01:03:23,799
<i>Why did you carry out the</i>
<i>investigation like that...</i>

793
01:03:23,839 --> 01:03:27,060
<i>...and ruin a young man's life?</i>

794
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:29,167
<i>You were in the warehouse that day,</i>
<i>weren't you?</i>

795
01:03:29,192 --> 01:03:30,472
<i>And you knew everything?</i>

796
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:32,340
<i>Of course I knew everything.</i>

797
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,200
<i>Since I saw everything.</i>

798
01:03:34,566 --> 01:03:36,439
<i>They're going to investigate</i>
<i>Park Da-eun's death.</i>

799
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,800
<i>They're investigating Park Da-eun?</i>

800
01:03:38,435 --> 01:03:39,435
<i>Who was it?</i>

801
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:42,608
<i>Who ordered you to</i>
<i>frame Goh Jeong-woo?</i>

802
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:45,492
<i>Let's play it safe.</i>

803
01:03:46,973 --> 01:03:47,980
<i>Why? Are you scared?</i>

804
01:03:48,323 --> 01:03:49,702
<i>Who killed Da-eun?</i>

805
01:03:50,587 --> 01:03:54,169
<i>I have the video that shows</i>
<i>how Da-eun died.</i>

806
01:03:54,317 --> 01:03:56,574
<i>That phone contains</i>
<i>video of Da-eun's killer.</i>
