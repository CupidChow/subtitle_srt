00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:15,706
<i>Then how long would it take...</i>

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:17,852
<i>...to drive from Mucheon to Cheonsu?</i>

6
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:20,946
<i>The farthest it could go</i>
<i>was the abandoned school.</i>

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,706
<i>Da-eun died at the same time</i>
<i>Bo-yeong's body was hidden.</i>

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,869
<i>Unless I have two bodies,</i>
<i>this is physically impossible.</i>

9
00:00:26,893 --> 00:00:28,103
<i>That's it!</i>

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,458
<i>The two murders could not</i>
<i>have occurred at the same time!</i>

11
00:00:30,482 --> 00:00:31,117
<i>That means...</i>

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,217
<i>Even if I did commit all those acts,</i>

13
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,760
<i>the investigation was wrong.</i>

14
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:35,855
<i>So you should reopen the case.</i>

15
00:00:35,856 --> 00:00:37,842
<i>- How dare you order me around!</i>
<i>- Stop, Jeong-woo.</i>

16
00:00:37,843 --> 00:00:38,763
<i>Jeong-woo!</i>

17
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:41,540
<i>I'll get you released</i>
<i>no matter what today.</i>

18
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:42,686
<i>Did you go and cause trouble again?</i>

19
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,435
<i>You're the one who caused trouble!</i>

20
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:46,049
<i>You murdering bastard!</i>

21
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,927
<i>"Why did you kill me 11 years ago?"</i>

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,431
<i>I'll sort it out...</i>

23
00:00:54,455 --> 00:00:55,798
<i>...so don't worry about it.</i>

24
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,517
<i>And just how will you do that?</i>

25
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,907
<i>Why are you trying to meet Su-oh?</i>

26
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,638
<i>Ha Seol,</i>
<i>this is Su-oh's brother, Geon-oh.</i>

27
00:01:05,402 --> 00:01:06,667
<i>Oh, my. Look who it is.</i>

28
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,917
<i>Isn't that Geon-oh?</i>

29
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:10,669
<i>We haven't found</i>
<i>any personal belongings yet.</i>

30
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,508
<i>Have you seen a purple backpack</i>
<i>Bo-yeong always carried around?</i>

31
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:17,713
<i>I brought back some gifts for you two.</i>

32
00:01:17,737 --> 00:01:20,676
<i>Just wait a while.</i>
<i>I'll deliver them to you soon.</i>

33
00:01:23,034 --> 00:01:25,671
Hey, your bag looks nice.

34
00:01:26,034 --> 00:01:28,086
- His shoes look nicer.
- Where's your wallet?

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,990
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

36
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,438
Look at his ears turning red.

37
00:01:32,462 --> 00:01:33,404
Huh?

38
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:34,388
Hey, hey.

39
00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:35,947
Hey, let me see your wallet.

40
00:01:35,948 --> 00:01:38,736
- Hey.
- Are you scared?

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,134
Hey, hey, hey.

42
00:01:40,524 --> 00:01:41,624
What the hell is this?

43
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:42,961
What's with this moron?

44
00:01:43,984 --> 00:01:46,021
- What are you doing?
- Keep it down.

45
00:01:47,612 --> 00:01:49,730
- You're scared, huh?
- What are you gonna do?

46
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:51,081
- Su-oh?
- Look up.

47
00:01:51,105 --> 00:01:51,880
- You're scared, huh?
- Say something.

48
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:54,242
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

49
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:55,785
Damn it.

50
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,004
Su-oh, get up.

51
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,828
- What the...
- Hey.

52
00:01:59,852 --> 00:02:00,986
What do you think you're doing?

53
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,057
Who do you think you are?

54
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,503
Hey, you have nice clothes.

55
00:02:03,527 --> 00:02:05,211
Hey, you got any cash?

56
00:02:05,803 --> 00:02:07,552
Move.

57
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:09,145
You bastard.

58
00:02:09,246 --> 00:02:10,980
Look here.

59
00:02:17,396 --> 00:02:18,447
Are you okay?

60
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,119
- You bastard!
- It's okay.

61
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:23,317
Hey!

62
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:25,412
- What's going on?
- Hey!

63
00:02:25,413 --> 00:02:26,575
- Let go!
- What?

64
00:02:26,576 --> 00:02:28,704
You bastard! Hey!

65
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:30,280
You're okay, right?

66
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:37,057
Geez.

67
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:50,683
Ow.

68
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:53,634
You wouldn't have won
if it wasn't for me.

69
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,738
<i>Jeong-woo.</i>

70
00:02:59,336 --> 00:03:01,338
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

71
00:03:02,727 --> 00:03:05,012
<i>Sorry for giving it to you so late.</i>

BLACK OUT - SNOW WHITE MUST DIE

73
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,703
- Come in.
- Okay.

74
00:03:27,144 --> 00:03:28,692
It's been a while.

75
00:03:30,094 --> 00:03:32,316
- Did you drink a lot?
- Yeah.

76
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:36,030
- You okay?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:36,054 --> 00:03:37,344
I'll get you some water.

78
00:03:37,368 --> 00:03:38,746
Jeong-woo.

79
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:41,930
Jeong-woo...

80
00:03:45,645 --> 00:03:47,075
Geon-oh!

81
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:49,218
Come here.

82
00:03:56,589 --> 00:03:57,916
You okay?

83
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:32,330
What did he find in here?

84
00:04:45,501 --> 00:04:46,600
Yes.

85
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:48,459
I need to find Geon-oh.

86
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:51,154
Right now.

87
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:55,328
Geon-oh.

88
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,156
Are you okay?

89
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:01,845
Why'd you drink so much
when you can't even hold your liquor?

90
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,233
I'll get you some water.

91
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,046
Jeong-woo...

92
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,258
Jeong-woo...

93
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,594
Jeong-woo, I'm sorry.

94
00:05:13,975 --> 00:05:16,394
I should have come sooner.

95
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:18,762
I was too late, Jeong-woo.

96
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:20,532
I'm really sorry.

97
00:05:20,619 --> 00:05:22,754
I didn't know you were living like this.

98
00:05:22,778 --> 00:05:24,163
Jeong-woo...

99
00:05:25,335 --> 00:05:26,890
Geon-oh.

100
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:30,478
What did you do wrong?

101
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,345
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Jeong-woo.

102
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,348
Geon-oh, look at me.

103
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:41,258
Hyeon Geon-oh.

104
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:45,820
What did you do wrong,
and what are you sorry for?

105
00:05:52,612 --> 00:05:54,041
Jeong-woo.

106
00:05:55,329 --> 00:05:56,869
Jeong-woo...

107
00:05:56,893 --> 00:05:59,456
I'm so sorry for what I did, Jeong-woo.

108
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:02,553
It was a mistake.

109
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,205
MUCHEON GARDEN

110
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:12,169
It can't be anything serious, can it?

111
00:06:12,193 --> 00:06:14,719
Can't you tell if that asshole Gu-tak
actually called us?

112
00:06:14,906 --> 00:06:16,642
Something bad has happened.

113
00:06:16,806 --> 00:06:18,706
Let's go to Jeong-woo's house first.

114
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,361
We'll find out when we get there.

115
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,056
Darn it.

116
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,703
<i>Hey, Shim Bo-yeong!</i>

117
00:06:54,668 --> 00:06:56,464
Geon-oh, what is this?

118
00:07:20,505 --> 00:07:22,624
Why do you have this?

119
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:28,415
Tell me why you have this.

120
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:29,543
Hyeon Geon-oh, speak up.

121
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:31,539
I'm sorry, Jeong-woo.

122
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,365
I was too scared.

123
00:07:34,272 --> 00:07:35,772
Jeong-woo...

124
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:39,038
I was too scared.

125
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,212
I was too scared...

126
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,309
Geon-oh, did you...

127
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,805
Did you kill Bo-yeong?

128
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,080
You didn't, right?

129
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,509
Tell me, did you kill Bo-yeong?

130
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:04,274
No... No... I can explain...

131
00:08:04,298 --> 00:08:06,792
Did you kill Bo-yeong or not?

132
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:09,538
Did you...

133
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:18,725
Jeong-woo... Jeong-woo!

134
00:08:33,022 --> 00:08:34,666
Please...

135
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,180
Please...

136
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:38,105
Please...

137
00:08:45,848 --> 00:08:48,861
I was a bit surprised when you said
you were a friend of Su-oh.

138
00:08:48,885 --> 00:08:50,934
Su-oh is very shy around strangers.

139
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,687
Oh, I'm not shy at all,
so we became close real quick.

140
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,674
Really?

141
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:59,514
I heard you're a med student.

142
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,127
In your 2nd year?

143
00:09:01,151 --> 00:09:02,781
Or is it your 3rd year?

144
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,054
3rd year.

145
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:09,214
Am I asking silly questions?

146
00:09:10,212 --> 00:09:12,661
You must be busy
with your clinical training.

147
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,011
So what brings you to Mucheon?

148
00:09:15,967 --> 00:09:19,534
Well... I was traveling the country
when I decided to check it out.

149
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:22,942
Then Su-oh and the locals were so nice...

150
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,652
...that I decided to stay for a few months.

151
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:28,622
Is that so?

152
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:37,582
Is the second floor of Mucheon Garden
an attic or a rooftop room?

153
00:09:37,887 --> 00:09:39,412
Do you find it okay living there?

154
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:41,632
Huh?

155
00:09:56,569 --> 00:09:58,067
MUCHEON-RO

156
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,726
Hey, Choi Na-gyeom!

157
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,094
It's Na-gyeom!

158
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:22,378
- Hi. It's good to see you all.
- It's been so long.

159
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,548
Sorry for not organizing
this gathering sooner.

160
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:27,854
- No, no, it's no problem..
- It's fine.

161
00:10:29,436 --> 00:10:32,258
- It's so good to see you all.
- Yeah.

162
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:34,178
- I can tell you're a celebrity.
- You're amazing.

163
00:10:34,202 --> 00:10:35,482
- She's a goddess.
- Thank you.

164
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,696
- A real celebrity.
- Why'd you get so pretty?

165
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,700
RAPHAEL HOSPITAL

166
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,094
VISITING ROOM

167
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:45,621
Hey, Su-oh.

168
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:47,625
How have you been?

169
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,566
I brought your friend today to see you.

170
00:10:53,834 --> 00:10:55,914
I'll leave you to talk.
I'll be out there.

171
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:56,644
Okay.

172
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:58,460
- Nurse.
- Yes.

173
00:11:03,102 --> 00:11:05,153
Su-oh, it's me, Ha Seol.

174
00:11:05,228 --> 00:11:06,726
Do you recognize me?

175
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,366
Yes.

176
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,785
That's a relief.

177
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,598
Ha Seol...

178
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,366
Did you find the painting?

179
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:23,970
No...

180
00:11:23,994 --> 00:11:27,039
I searched the greenhouse and your room,

181
00:11:27,063 --> 00:11:28,792
but I think someone took it.

182
00:11:33,842 --> 00:11:36,298
So... 11 years ago...

183
00:11:36,893 --> 00:11:38,924
Were you...

184
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,478
...at the warehouse too?

185
00:11:47,175 --> 00:11:50,285
The... The painting... I need to...

186
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,920
I need to give it to Jeong-woo.

187
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:55,501
The painting...

188
00:11:55,502 --> 00:11:56,693
Su-oh, what's wrong?

189
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,783
Ha Seol.

190
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:04,993
Make sure to give my painting
to Jeong-woo, okay?

191
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,833
You have to give it to him.

192
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:10,654
Make sure you give him
the painting, okay?

193
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:11,898
Su-oh?

194
00:12:13,553 --> 00:12:16,579
Su-oh, what's wrong?

195
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,165
Painting...

196
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,527
Painting?

197
00:12:23,551 --> 00:12:24,980
Well...

198
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,336
He's saying he wants to paint.

199
00:12:30,294 --> 00:12:31,638
Oh...

200
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:34,165
He wants to paint?

201
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:39,261
Can you please bring us
some crayons and paper?

202
00:12:39,285 --> 00:12:42,627
Please leave the drawing paper
in his room and make sure it's safe.

203
00:12:42,651 --> 00:12:44,378
- Will do.
- Thank you.

204
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,686
Su-oh.

205
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,675
I'll come back to visit soon.

206
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,915
Okay.

207
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:16,061
You were home.

208
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:18,827
- What brings you here?
- Why didn't you answer the phone?

209
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:20,130
Oh, did you call?

210
00:13:20,154 --> 00:13:22,364
I need to go somewhere.
If it's not urgent, let's speak tomorrow.

211
00:13:22,388 --> 00:13:25,061
He said he had to discuss it with you.
That's why we're here.

212
00:13:25,762 --> 00:13:27,297
If you're busy, we'll just go.

213
00:13:27,321 --> 00:13:30,147
We can't rush Bo-yeong's funeral like this.

214
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:32,341
Did you forget everything already
because it was 10 years ago?

215
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,938
Don't be ridiculous.

216
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,504
We shouldn't discuss that out here.

217
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,827
- Let's go inside then.
- Okay.

218
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,374
Yes, okay.

219
00:13:55,146 --> 00:13:58,452
PLEASE CONNECT THE CHARGER

220
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,358
Bo-yeong...

221
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:22,820
Gu-tak, we can't cremate Bo-yeong.

222
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:24,490
I want to keep her close
and see her every day.

223
00:14:24,514 --> 00:14:26,781
No, she's a child who's been
in the ground for over 10 years.

224
00:14:26,805 --> 00:14:29,157
It's time to send her to a better place.

225
00:14:29,181 --> 00:14:30,961
Stop it, stop it.

226
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:34,043
I can't hold the funeral like this, okay?

227
00:14:34,067 --> 00:14:35,750
I need more compensation.

228
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,291
Geon-oh...

229
00:14:37,358 --> 00:14:40,687
Hey, Geon-oh, are you okay?
What are you doing?

230
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:45,482
Geon-oh!

231
00:14:45,506 --> 00:14:47,405
Geon-oh.

232
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,217
Hey, Geon-oh.

233
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,365
Geon-oh, open the door.

234
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,922
It's me.

235
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:55,254
Geon-oh, Geon-oh.

236
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:59,123
SHIM BO-YEONG

237
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,876
What do we do?

238
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:05,688
- Geon-oh, Geon-oh...
- Geon-oh!

239
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,872
<i>Go away!</i>

240
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,997
<i>- Go away!</i>
<i>- Geon-oh!</i>

241
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:18,083
<i>- Geon-oh!</i>
<i>- Go!</i>

242
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:21,525
<i>Open the door, it's me!</i>

243
00:15:32,428 --> 00:15:34,332
Geon-oh, Geon-oh.

244
00:15:34,425 --> 00:15:36,060
<i>Open the door, Geon-oh.</i>

245
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,579
<i>- Open the door.</i>
<i>- Geon-oh.</i>

246
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,203
<i>Let's go home. Open the door, okay?</i>

247
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:42,311
<i>Geon-oh!</i>

248
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,725
Hey, Geon-oh, what are you doing?

249
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:47,352
- What's this, huh?
- What are you doing?

250
00:15:47,376 --> 00:15:48,702
- Let go of me.
- Come out.

251
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:50,976
- Let go of me!
- Come out! Let's go home.

252
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:51,954
- Go.
- Let go of me.

253
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,583
Come out here, okay?

254
00:15:56,051 --> 00:15:57,404
Shit!

255
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:58,971
You bastard.

256
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:00,751
Come here.

257
00:16:01,985 --> 00:16:03,315
What's this?

258
00:16:04,177 --> 00:16:05,477
Damn it!

259
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,538
What are you doing?

260
00:16:25,672 --> 00:16:26,473
What do we do?

261
00:16:26,497 --> 00:16:28,125
Oh, no.

262
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:51,214
I don't think you'll be able
to visit Su-oh for a while.

263
00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:53,767
- I'll contact you.
- Okay.

264
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:06,525
A girl on a bike. That's a first.

265
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:12,460
- I'll hold him.
- Yeah, hold him.

266
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,039
You did well.

267
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:17,665
You did well, okay?

268
00:17:17,893 --> 00:17:20,436
As long as we don't say anything,
it'll be fine.

269
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,010
Got it?

270
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,672
Geon-oh!

271
00:17:28,117 --> 00:17:29,545
Geon-oh.

272
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:32,098
What's wrong with him?
Did someone beat him up?

273
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:35,125
No, no.
He just fell because he's drunk.

274
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:37,006
Oh, he reeks of alcohol.

275
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:40,312
Why did he drink so much?

276
00:17:40,804 --> 00:17:42,739
What's that? Are you going somewhere?

277
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:44,294
Oh, it's nothing.

278
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:46,658
What do you mean it's nothing?
It's a travel bag.

279
00:18:00,094 --> 00:18:01,658
What's wrong?

280
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,065
Nothing.

281
00:18:03,306 --> 00:18:05,981
Something just seems off.

282
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:15,118
Jeong-woo never went anywhere alone.

283
00:18:15,932 --> 00:18:18,184
Just like the 5 Musketeers.

284
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:22,565
Jeong-woo, Byeong-mu, Min-su,
Geon-oh, and Bo-yeong.

285
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:25,325
Sometimes they'd even call Su-oh...

286
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,447
...and hang out together every day.

287
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,318
- Every day?
- Yes,

288
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:33,512
they were pretty much always together
except for when they slept.

289
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:39,485
But I guess it must've been
a great shock for them too.

290
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:41,778
Even before Jeong-woo went to prison...

291
00:18:44,597 --> 00:18:46,390
...they all disappeared.

292
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:51,835
Before the trial even started,
they went to study abroad...

293
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:53,705
...and enlisted in the army
without even planning it.

294
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:58,498
Am I the only one
who finds this strange?

295
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:17,738
Goh Jeong-woo?

296
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:21,327
Hello?

297
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:24,220
Hello?

298
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,404
Hey, is something wrong?

299
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,799
Hello?

300
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:38,007
You said, you need our help.

301
00:19:40,282 --> 00:19:41,910
What are you curious about?

302
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,192
That day...

303
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,689
Did anyone see Bo-yeong?

304
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,665
Or did anyone get in contact with her?

305
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:59,535
- Hey, it's been a while.
- Long time.

306
00:19:59,837 --> 00:20:02,188
- There you are.
- You said you were too busy.

307
00:20:02,212 --> 00:20:04,497
Hey, everyone's here.
Long time no see.

308
00:20:05,251 --> 00:20:08,403
That's what I want to know the most.
Where Bo-yeong was.

309
00:20:08,715 --> 00:20:11,553
We were her best friends,
but we don't even know.

310
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:13,498
How would they know?

311
00:20:13,656 --> 00:20:15,049
They wouldn't.

312
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,298
I'm still looking for ways
to help Jeong-woo.

313
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,685
- Hey, pour me a drink.
- Sure.

314
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:31,658
Yeah, let's just drink.

315
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:32,572
Cheers, cheers!

316
00:20:32,596 --> 00:20:35,298
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you!

317
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,498
What's wrong with Goh Jeong-woo?
Did he get hurt?

318
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:00,303
You came just in time.

319
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,725
Can you help me with something?

320
00:21:02,902 --> 00:21:03,658
Me?

321
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:07,299
Well, could you sign Goh Jeong-woo
into the hospital?

322
00:21:07,323 --> 00:21:08,536
Oh, okay.

323
00:21:08,658 --> 00:21:11,913
And for the payment...

324
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,474
- Use this.
- Oh, okay.

325
00:21:15,404 --> 00:21:16,222
Thank you.

326
00:21:16,246 --> 00:21:17,642
So what happened?

327
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,342
Was it the people
who vandalized this place?

328
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,130
I think I'll have to find out.

329
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:28,319
Am I not allowed to take pictures?

330
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:31,698
- Let me take a picture.
- Come on!

331
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:34,201
- Deok-mi is great!
- He's amazing!

332
00:21:34,225 --> 00:21:36,396
Bye, Deok-mi. See you next time. Thanks.

333
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,914
Deok-mi, you're the best.
Thanks so much.

334
00:21:37,938 --> 00:21:39,026
Na-gyeom,

335
00:21:39,392 --> 00:21:42,003
I know you care about Jeong-woo, but...

336
00:21:42,027 --> 00:21:44,339
You're a famous actress now
recognized by everyone.

337
00:21:44,363 --> 00:21:47,298
You don't want to associate yourself
with an ex-convict...

338
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:48,880
What do you mean "ex-convict"?

339
00:21:54,592 --> 00:21:56,165
I think...

340
00:21:56,853 --> 00:21:59,912
...it'd be best if Jeong-woo
leaves Mucheon as quickly as possible.

341
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:03,172
- What do you guys think?
- Yeah.

342
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,827
Yeah, that might be better.

343
00:22:05,969 --> 00:22:07,437
What should we do first?

344
00:22:07,461 --> 00:22:09,085
Just say the word. I'll do anything.

345
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:15,112
We should transfer Jeong-woo's mother
to another hospital, right?

346
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:17,305
What should I do?

347
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:22,632
Make sure Bo-yeong's funeral
happens quickly.

348
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:24,698
Anything else?

349
00:22:26,175 --> 00:22:28,670
Once Jeong-woo moves up to Seoul,

350
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:36,132
you should make sure
he forgets about this place...

351
00:22:38,503 --> 00:22:40,230
...by not contacting him.

352
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:47,365
- Of course.
- Yeah, sure.

353
00:22:47,389 --> 00:22:48,845
What are friends for, anyway?

354
00:22:48,869 --> 00:22:51,168
- We can do that.
- We'll do it.

355
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:25,378
What if he dies in this place?

356
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:27,859
How many times is this already?

357
00:23:56,932 --> 00:23:58,264
Hi.

358
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:06,363
That punk learned nothing
but bad things overseas.

359
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:07,821
Geez.

360
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,016
What?

361
00:24:10,283 --> 00:24:11,939
Hey, Geon-oh got hurt...

362
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:14,589
...because he fell
while trying to run away.

363
00:24:14,613 --> 00:24:16,289
Don't give me that look.

364
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:20,391
We would've been in serious trouble
if we were one minute late.

365
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,504
Do you know what this is?

366
00:24:28,636 --> 00:24:31,337
SHIM BO-YEONG

367
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:34,836
Geon-oh must've taken it to Jeong-woo.

368
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,866
Thank god we saw it first.

369
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,826
What if Jeong-woo had seen it first?

370
00:24:40,727 --> 00:24:43,301
Both of you, just go home.
I'll handle it.

371
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,600
What? Handle it?

372
00:24:44,624 --> 00:24:46,046
How exactly are you going
to handle it, huh?

373
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,653
We should know too.

374
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:51,382
Hey, when are you sending Geon-oh
back to the U.S.?

375
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,435
Chief Hyun said he'll take care of it.

376
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,306
- Let's just leave.
- Hey, let me go for a second.

377
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:59,294
I can't keep living like this,
on edge all the time.

378
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:00,942
What are you going to do
about that bastard Jeong-woo?

379
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,559
Are we going to keep
letting him show up?

380
00:25:07,202 --> 00:25:09,901
You're crossing the line again,
you know.

381
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:12,544
What?

382
00:25:13,002 --> 00:25:15,018
After doing that to my son,

383
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:17,232
you're raising your voice at me?

384
00:25:17,324 --> 00:25:18,438
Huh?

385
00:25:19,073 --> 00:25:20,149
Unbelievable.

386
00:25:20,173 --> 00:25:22,310
I told you it wasn't us.

387
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:25,694
This is making me so mad!

388
00:25:25,718 --> 00:25:28,514
Don't you have any respect, you asshole?

389
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:29,948
Respect?

390
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:32,798
Who should be showing
respect to who here?

391
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,958
- Chief Hyeon.
- Huh?

392
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,182
Let's just stop and leave.

393
00:25:37,206 --> 00:25:39,606
Chief Hyeon says
he'll take care of everything.

394
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,697
Let's go now.
We're leaving, okay?

395
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:42,910
- Seriously!
- Let's go, let's go.

396
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:53,013
SHIM BO-YEONG

397
00:25:58,344 --> 00:26:00,257
I've treated his wounds...

398
00:26:00,281 --> 00:26:03,212
...but it seems he hasn't eaten anything
and he's quite fatigued.

399
00:26:04,212 --> 00:26:06,630
Basically, it's malnutrition.

400
00:26:07,659 --> 00:26:10,112
You need to take good care of him.

401
00:26:23,087 --> 00:26:25,125
<i>Who did you meet, Goh Jeong-woo?</i>

402
00:26:25,602 --> 00:26:27,684
Just what happened to you?

403
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,517
What's this?

404
00:27:15,793 --> 00:27:17,554
This is a really old charger.

405
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,704
I have to give these to Jeong-woo.

406
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:46,468
Give what? What? You freak!

407
00:28:48,141 --> 00:28:49,561
What's wrong with you?

408
00:28:50,065 --> 00:28:52,674
Why are you doing this?

409
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:55,063
Father...

410
00:28:57,646 --> 00:28:59,115
Father...

411
00:28:59,396 --> 00:29:01,545
Father, please, I'm begging you.

412
00:29:01,916 --> 00:29:04,350
Do you know how hard it's been for me?

413
00:29:04,374 --> 00:29:05,909
Do you know how much I've suffered...

414
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:08,208
...because Jeong-woo went to prison
instead of me?

415
00:29:10,345 --> 00:29:13,068
I'm begging you, Father.

416
00:29:17,929 --> 00:29:19,254
Geon-oh...

417
00:29:20,293 --> 00:29:21,708
Geon-oh...

418
00:29:22,336 --> 00:29:23,689
Look at me.

419
00:29:24,921 --> 00:29:26,174
Geon-oh...

420
00:29:27,254 --> 00:29:29,572
Jeong-woo is fine, okay?

421
00:29:30,329 --> 00:29:32,208
Jeong-woo is out now.

422
00:29:32,714 --> 00:29:35,827
It's all in the past, okay?

423
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:37,261
It's okay.

424
00:29:37,695 --> 00:29:40,641
He's going to live well from now on.
Jeong-woo is fine.

425
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:41,854
Okay?

426
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:46,759
Father...

427
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:49,055
Does Jeong-woo...

428
00:29:49,703 --> 00:29:51,648
...really look fine to you?

429
00:29:58,498 --> 00:30:00,941
To me, the old Jeong-woo is gone.

430
00:30:05,138 --> 00:30:07,221
I'm going to turn myself in.

431
00:30:16,269 --> 00:30:17,706
Turn yourself in?

432
00:30:19,433 --> 00:30:22,108
Do you really think these things
will count as evidence?

433
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:38,265
Tell me...

434
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:40,416
What is it?

435
00:30:41,178 --> 00:30:43,359
What else don't I know?

436
00:30:44,591 --> 00:30:46,032
Tell me.

437
00:30:47,194 --> 00:30:48,669
Tell me.

438
00:30:59,564 --> 00:31:01,016
<i>Bo-yeong...</i>

439
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,875
<i>Bo-yeong, where are you?</i>

440
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,888
<i>Why aren't you answering your phone?</i>

441
00:31:07,536 --> 00:31:09,821
<i>It's so late. Where are you?</i>

442
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,759
<i>I'll explain everything,</i>
<i>so please pick up.</i>

443
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:17,109
<i>Come home and talk to me, Bo-yeong.</i>

444
00:31:17,681 --> 00:31:19,075
Father...

445
00:31:19,318 --> 00:31:21,436
Father, I'm going to turn myself in.

446
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,461
I'm going to turn myself in.

447
00:31:22,485 --> 00:31:24,167
You fool!

448
00:31:24,311 --> 00:31:26,856
Jeong-woo didn't do anything wrong, Father!

449
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,689
I'm the one who killed Bo-yeong!

450
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:29,737
Father...

451
00:31:29,761 --> 00:31:31,543
You didn't kill anyone!

452
00:31:31,567 --> 00:31:32,915
It was an accident!

453
00:31:32,939 --> 00:31:34,951
How many times do I have to tell you
it was an accident!

454
00:31:34,975 --> 00:31:36,381
How will you turn yourself in?

455
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,816
What will you confess?

456
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,222
Geon-oh, tell me.

457
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:44,734
Tell me right now
what it is I don't know.

458
00:31:44,758 --> 00:31:46,028
Father...

459
00:31:46,755 --> 00:31:49,187
Father, don't do this.

460
00:31:49,211 --> 00:31:50,183
Please.

461
00:31:50,207 --> 00:31:51,934
You remember
when you were little, right?

462
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:55,855
You have to behave.

463
00:31:59,523 --> 00:32:01,388
You can't come out until you do.

464
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:03,819
Father...

465
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:14,138
Father... Father! Father...

466
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:16,367
<i>Father...</i>

467
00:32:31,345 --> 00:32:33,034
<i>Hello!</i>

468
00:32:33,504 --> 00:32:35,382
<i>Why isn't anyone reacting?</i>

469
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:37,730
<i>Hey, hey, hey!</i>

470
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:39,629
<i>- It's a video.</i>
<i>- Hi!</i>

471
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:40,362
<i>Yeah!</i>

472
00:32:40,386 --> 00:32:43,372
- Hei!
- Halo!

473
00:32:43,635 --> 00:32:47,720
Today we're drinking by ourselves.

474
00:32:48,954 --> 00:32:50,793
Hey, Geon-oh.

475
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:53,282
<i>Hey, I'm Byeong-mu! Are you drunk?</i>

476
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:54,146
<i>It's my turn.</i>

477
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,345
Oh, right.

478
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:56,722
Hey, you're drunk.

479
00:32:56,746 --> 00:32:59,243
- She's drunk.
- Yeah.

480
00:32:59,267 --> 00:33:00,909
- Drunk.
- Yang Byeong-mu.

481
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,622
Yeah?

482
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,674
What do you live for?

483
00:33:04,891 --> 00:33:06,545
<i>Hey, what do you live for?</i>

484
00:33:07,255 --> 00:33:09,648
<i>I can't live like this.</i>

485
00:33:09,672 --> 00:33:10,727
Why?

486
00:33:10,751 --> 00:33:12,234
I failed the CSAT.

487
00:33:13,462 --> 00:33:15,747
You can just retake it.
That's no reason not to live.

488
00:33:15,771 --> 00:33:17,521
So today, I quit my academy.

489
00:33:18,021 --> 00:33:20,417
Hey, so is your dream
to retake the exam?

490
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:21,741
<i>No.</i>

491
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:25,350
<i>My dream is to be the strongest</i>
<i>nurse in the country.</i>

492
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,434
<i>Male nurse.</i>

493
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:29,676
What on earth?

494
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,494
I hate it.

495
00:33:31,518 --> 00:33:33,323
Then what's your dream?

496
00:33:34,142 --> 00:33:35,987
Me? I...

497
00:33:37,437 --> 00:33:41,114
Oh, I'm going to be
a super successful cop...

498
00:33:41,641 --> 00:33:43,471
...like Geon-oh's dad.

499
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:46,609
<i>Hey, in 10 years,</i>
<i>call me Detective Yang.</i>

500
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:47,888
Detective Yang?

501
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,033
Hey, Geon-oh.

502
00:33:50,057 --> 00:33:51,126
Yeah.

503
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,574
What's your dream?

504
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:57,124
<i>I don't have a dream.</i>

505
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,770
What?

506
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,881
My dream is not having a dream.

507
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:03,448
Geez, you're so annoying.

508
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:04,694
Hey, Shim Bo-yeong.

509
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:06,812
<i>Then what's your dream?</i>

510
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,549
What will you be doing in 10 years?

511
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:11,781
Marriage!

512
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,242
<i>I'm going to meet an awesome husband,</i>

513
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:18,495
have a pretty daughter
that takes after me...

514
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:22,494
...and move far, far away from here.

515
00:34:23,024 --> 00:34:24,324
Sounds good.

516
00:34:26,174 --> 00:34:27,559
Okay.

517
00:34:27,777 --> 00:34:29,498
- Hey, we're all out.
- Give me that.

518
00:34:29,522 --> 00:34:31,044
- We're out of booze?
- Yeah.

519
00:34:31,068 --> 00:34:33,994
I'll go get some really
expensive stuff from home.

520
00:34:34,018 --> 00:34:35,715
- Just wait here.
- Okay.

521
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,495
What's going on?
Geon-oh, Geon-oh.

522
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,473
- Hey, hey, hey, Geon-oh, Geon-oh.
- Yeah?

523
00:34:42,642 --> 00:34:45,375
- The most...
- <i>The most...</i>

524
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,388
<i>- Expensive...</i>
<i>- Expensive...</i>

525
00:34:47,412 --> 00:34:49,932
One in your house. Go bring it.

526
00:34:49,956 --> 00:34:51,026
Okay!

527
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:53,207
I'll bring you
the most expensive alcohol.

528
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:55,133
Bring us something good.

529
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:57,004
Bring a lot.

530
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,393
- Hurry back.
- Come back quickly.

531
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:10,704
This is fun.

532
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:18,127
Father! Father!

533
00:35:58,037 --> 00:35:59,388
Give it to me.

534
00:36:04,498 --> 00:36:06,068
Where did you find this?

535
00:36:06,092 --> 00:36:07,388
Who gave it to you?

536
00:36:08,305 --> 00:36:09,678
Give it to me.

537
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:15,321
You saw the video in here, right?

538
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:18,401
The suspect you've been
so desperate to find...

539
00:36:18,425 --> 00:36:20,187
Were you shocked because
they were your friends?

540
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,170
Damn it.

541
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:25,744
You scared? Are you scared?

542
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:30,455
Scared that your friends betrayed you
and set you up?

543
00:36:32,909 --> 00:36:34,868
Stop talking nonsense.

544
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:38,127
I've spent my entire life with them.

545
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:40,606
It was thanks to them...

546
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:43,052
Thanks to the memories,

547
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:45,727
I endured that hellish prison
for 10 years.

548
00:36:48,093 --> 00:36:50,700
So I'm going to handle this from now on,
so you just mind your own business.

549
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:51,788
Oh...

550
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:53,867
So that's why for 10 years,

551
00:36:53,891 --> 00:36:57,513
not a single friend came to visit you.

552
00:36:57,537 --> 00:36:59,335
And where are you going with this?

553
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,475
Surely you're not
going to the chief, right?

554
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:04,995
Get out.

555
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:06,389
Let go.

556
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:10,968
His son is about to become a suspect.

557
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:12,974
Do you really think the chief
will take your side?

558
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:34,316
SHIM BO-YEONG

559
00:37:47,804 --> 00:37:48,876
Detective!

560
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:57,840
SHIM BO-YEONG

561
00:38:04,648 --> 00:38:07,100
<i>Of her belongings,</i>
<i>only her underwear was missing.</i>

562
00:38:07,124 --> 00:38:09,732
She was wearing a bra,
but no panties.

563
00:38:09,756 --> 00:38:11,482
Only her panties were missing?

564
00:38:11,506 --> 00:38:15,445
<i>DNA Analysis Report</i>
<i>So we can't rule out sexual assault, right?</i>

565
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:20,148
Who gave this to you?

566
00:38:20,814 --> 00:38:22,078
Geon-oh.

567
00:38:22,102 --> 00:38:24,944
I think Geon-oh had it
for the past 10 years.

568
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,344
<i>Jeong-woo!</i>

569
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:29,530
Jeong-woo?

570
00:38:29,554 --> 00:38:30,997
It's uncle.

571
00:38:33,768 --> 00:38:37,287
If you go and tell the chief
everything now,

572
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:38,914
your case will never be reopened.

573
00:38:40,354 --> 00:38:41,521
What will you do?

574
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,084
Uncle.

575
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:54,824
What are you doing here?

576
00:38:55,038 --> 00:38:56,561
Oh, well, this bastard...

577
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:59,834
I mean, someone broke
into Goh Jeong-woo's home.

578
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:02,142
Someone broke into your house?

579
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:05,628
You should've called me right away.

580
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,214
Did anything go missing?

581
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,061
No.

582
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:10,440
Did you see their face?

583
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:11,896
I didn't.

584
00:39:13,911 --> 00:39:15,925
They hit him on the head with a pot
and ran off.

585
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:17,631
But there are no CCTVs here.

586
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,491
So I think it'll be difficult
to catch the culprit.

587
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,178
I'll handle this quietly
and report back to you privately.

588
00:39:25,356 --> 00:39:26,478
All right.

589
00:39:27,853 --> 00:39:30,174
- You're okay with that, right?
- Yes.

590
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,280
- See you at the station.
- Yes, sir.

591
00:40:11,549 --> 00:40:13,157
Hello?

592
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,548
Why? What happened?

593
00:40:23,536 --> 00:40:25,048
What did they find?

594
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:29,214
A bag...

595
00:40:31,225 --> 00:40:32,621
Books.

596
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:34,828
A pencil case.

597
00:40:36,786 --> 00:40:38,132
Is that all?

598
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:46,153
It's nothing. Don't worry, okay?

599
00:40:56,729 --> 00:40:59,727
<i>I'll head out first.</i>
<i>Keep your promise.</i>

600
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:04,984
Hey, get up.

601
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:08,621
Geez, get up.

602
00:41:12,885 --> 00:41:15,382
What? What is it?

603
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:17,372
They found Bo-yeong's bag.

604
00:41:18,948 --> 00:41:20,208
What?

605
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,594
What did they find?

606
00:41:27,513 --> 00:41:29,003
What do we do?

607
00:41:29,027 --> 00:41:30,616
Isn't this going to be a problem?

608
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,178
What problem?

609
00:41:32,426 --> 00:41:33,771
Did we do anything wrong?

610
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:35,221
They found Bo-yeong's bag, right?

611
00:41:35,245 --> 00:41:38,126
That's not evidence, you idiot.

612
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:40,305
There's no evidence.

613
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:44,074
Remember, we don't know anything.

614
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:48,705
Got it?

615
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,808
Hey.

616
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:01,281
<i>Someone broke into my house.</i>

617
00:42:02,682 --> 00:42:04,133
What will you do?

618
00:42:04,207 --> 00:42:05,607
Let's go check it out.

619
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:06,826
You said we'd pretend
not to know anything.

620
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,928
I don't want to go.

621
00:42:07,952 --> 00:42:10,421
We need to confirm with our own eyes.

622
00:42:15,715 --> 00:42:18,406
Act natural. Just act natural, okay?

623
00:42:18,753 --> 00:42:22,593
No one's going to help
Goh Jeong-woo anyway.

624
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:28,407
Geon-oh isn't in his right mind.

625
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:31,154
Maybe he's lost his mind like Su-oh.

626
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:33,277
No way...

627
00:42:33,337 --> 00:42:36,260
It's probably just because
he's been abroad for so long.

628
00:42:36,352 --> 00:42:39,948
If you live overseas for a long time,
does it mean you can act like a psycho?

629
00:42:40,612 --> 00:42:43,199
He doesn't fear his elders
because we're so nice to him.

630
00:42:43,281 --> 00:42:45,328
What if he causes more trouble?

631
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:47,552
Chief Hyeon will take care of it.

632
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:48,706
Just wait.

633
00:42:48,707 --> 00:42:50,813
Why are you always taking Gu-tak's side?

634
00:42:50,837 --> 00:42:52,374
You act like we're his lackeys.

635
00:42:58,673 --> 00:43:00,706
I told you to move out.

636
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:03,625
If the chief really told you
to kick me out,

637
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:05,939
I'll go speak with him directly.

638
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:08,267
Geez, why are you being like this?

639
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:11,794
If Chief Hyeon says no, then it's a no.

640
00:43:16,424 --> 00:43:18,584
I guess you'll have to move out.

641
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:21,605
Hey, does Gu-tak own this place
or something?

642
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:23,492
I'm the boss here.

643
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:26,167
Yes, of course.
You're the only boss here.

644
00:43:26,191 --> 00:43:27,779
So couldn't you let me
stay a few more...

645
00:43:27,803 --> 00:43:30,954
No, just until next month?

646
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:34,047
I doubt you'll find a tenant right away.

647
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:36,537
Ha Seol.

648
00:43:36,561 --> 00:43:39,441
Why don't you just go back to Seoul?

649
00:43:39,604 --> 00:43:41,788
Want me to give you money for fuel?

650
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,357
No, no, no.

651
00:43:45,778 --> 00:43:49,492
You can stay here
as long as you like, okay?

652
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:52,641
And leave when you want to leave.

653
00:43:56,072 --> 00:43:57,779
Thank you.

654
00:44:00,635 --> 00:44:01,859
Can we really do that?

655
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:03,424
Why not?

656
00:44:03,618 --> 00:44:06,991
I'm the owner of Mucheon Garden!

657
00:44:08,288 --> 00:44:10,714
You think people will see this here?

658
00:44:10,738 --> 00:44:13,676
- No one can see this location.
- I'll do it again.

659
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,094
Over here.

660
00:44:17,761 --> 00:44:18,978
Local elections!

661
00:44:19,002 --> 00:44:22,415
New Millennium! People's Party!
Let's win!

662
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:28,784
Thank you all for your hard work today.

663
00:44:30,246 --> 00:44:33,312
Gosh, the honorable Congresswoman Ye.

664
00:44:33,393 --> 00:44:37,191
These upcoming elections
are a bloody, brutal jungle.

665
00:44:37,215 --> 00:44:38,402
But you'll show us, right?

666
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:39,821
What jungle?

667
00:44:39,949 --> 00:44:42,942
I think of it as a zoo. I'm excited.

668
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:46,992
People give me some encouragement
for my bright future ahead.

669
00:44:47,016 --> 00:44:50,029
You are truly dependable,
Governor Ye Yeong-sil.

670
00:44:50,053 --> 00:44:51,404
Please excuse me.

671
00:44:54,906 --> 00:44:56,173
SEVEN UNREAD MESSAGES

672
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:57,153
THIS IS THE INFORMATION FOR TODAY'S AGENDA
ALL OF TODAY'S AGENDA HAS BEEN COMPLETED

673
00:44:57,178 --> 00:44:58,081
THERE IS AN EVENT AT 10 AM TOMORROW

674
00:45:11,074 --> 00:45:15,261
What an honor to know
that Choi Na-gyeom is from Mucheon.

675
00:45:16,121 --> 00:45:19,334
You must not remember me.

676
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,483
I did volunteer work here
when I was in 12th grade.

677
00:45:24,144 --> 00:45:25,786
You must all be busy with studies...

678
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,478
...but you've come to volunteer.

679
00:45:27,502 --> 00:45:29,703
Have some ice cream first.

680
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:31,120
- Thank you.
- Sure.

681
00:45:32,074 --> 00:45:32,810
Hallo.

682
00:45:32,834 --> 00:45:34,567
- Cool, give it to me.
- Here you go.

683
00:45:44,752 --> 00:45:46,829
Oh, you did?

684
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:51,741
It's odd that I didn't recognize
such a beautiful woman.

685
00:45:54,424 --> 00:45:56,135
You kind of do seem familiar.

686
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:59,214
You haven't changed at all, Director.

687
00:45:59,274 --> 00:46:01,980
Still as charming and humorous as ever.

688
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:03,929
I'll take that as a compliment.

689
00:46:03,953 --> 00:46:05,408
So what brings you here?

690
00:46:07,696 --> 00:46:09,419
You know Jeong-woo, right?

691
00:46:10,029 --> 00:46:11,288
Goh Jeong-woo.

692
00:46:15,404 --> 00:46:17,040
Is he a patient here?

693
00:46:17,181 --> 00:46:18,573
No.

694
00:46:19,086 --> 00:46:22,981
Jeong-woo's mother
is in the VIP room here.

695
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:24,645
Oh, right...

696
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:26,534
Nurse Shin's friend's mom?

697
00:46:26,558 --> 00:46:27,698
Yes.

698
00:46:27,776 --> 00:46:31,969
I'd like to transfer her
to a hospital in Seoul.

699
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,780
- Director!
- Oh, honey.

700
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:38,248
I didn't know you had a guest.

701
00:46:38,272 --> 00:46:39,656
I'm sorry.

702
00:46:40,191 --> 00:46:43,277
Hello, Congresswoman!
It's nice to meet you.

703
00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:45,786
I'm a fan.

704
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:47,954
Oh, I see.

705
00:46:54,654 --> 00:46:56,561
You even went to the ER?

706
00:46:56,585 --> 00:46:58,121
Hey, let me see your injuries.

707
00:46:58,145 --> 00:47:00,581
No, it's time to disinfect your wound, right?
I'll do it for you.

708
00:47:01,676 --> 00:47:03,366
It's okay, Min-su.

709
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:05,308
Jeong-woo, you can clean that up now.

710
00:47:05,332 --> 00:47:06,518
I've finished.

711
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:09,631
- Byeong-mu.
- Yeah.

712
00:47:10,163 --> 00:47:12,223
You can help me, right?

713
00:47:12,526 --> 00:47:14,873
Of course, man, I'm a cop.

714
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:15,795
Just trust me.

715
00:47:15,819 --> 00:47:17,979
Yeah, trust Byeong-mu.

716
00:47:21,612 --> 00:47:23,111
Jeong-woo,

717
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:26,455
we actually came here
because we have something to tell you.

718
00:47:26,479 --> 00:47:29,001
We wanted to talk to you face-to-face.
That's why we're here.

719
00:47:36,668 --> 00:47:37,931
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

720
00:47:38,179 --> 00:47:40,303
GOH JEONG-WOO
<i>We're only 30.</i>

721
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:42,764
<i>You're smart and bright,</i>

722
00:47:42,788 --> 00:47:44,564
<i>so you can study again</i>
<i>and go to college.</i>

723
00:47:44,588 --> 00:47:46,102
<i>You can even study abroad.</i>

724
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,723
<i>We'll help you.</i>

725
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:51,190
Can I really leave here...

726
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:54,033
...with peace of mind?

727
00:47:54,057 --> 00:47:57,700
Hey, that's all up to you.

728
00:47:57,724 --> 00:47:59,158
I still envy you.

729
00:47:59,182 --> 00:48:01,578
Na-gyeom cares about you so much.

730
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:05,264
Take your mom and go to Seoul
with Na-gyeom.

731
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,923
Once you move hospitals,
your mom will wake up in time.

732
00:48:09,034 --> 00:48:13,187
So do it for yourself and for your mom.

733
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:15,246
Leave for Seoul with Na-gyeom.

734
00:48:15,555 --> 00:48:17,191
I'm totally in favor of that.

735
00:48:19,979 --> 00:48:21,445
But...

736
00:48:24,597 --> 00:48:26,841
Bo-yeong and Da-eun...

737
00:48:31,926 --> 00:48:34,384
What will they say
when they look down on us from above?

738
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:43,212
They'll resent me, right?

739
00:48:43,556 --> 00:48:45,959
Hey, don't think like that.

740
00:48:47,412 --> 00:48:49,624
You've already paid for your sins.

741
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:52,151
Hmm?

742
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,328
Hey, hey,

743
00:48:56,352 --> 00:48:59,024
it's all in the past.
Why keep bringing it up, Jeong-woo?

744
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:00,739
It's okay for you to let it go now.

745
00:49:00,763 --> 00:49:02,204
Just forget it.

746
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:04,592
Yeah, forget it.
Let's forget everything.

747
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,576
Yes, sir.

748
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,256
It's not that I didn't go to work.
I'm working out of the office.

749
00:49:14,348 --> 00:49:17,708
Yes. I'll head back right away.

750
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,123
I guess that station
can't operate without you.

751
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:21,679
Of course, man.

752
00:49:21,703 --> 00:49:24,120
- I should get going.
- Me too.

753
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:29,694
Jeong-woo.

754
00:49:29,859 --> 00:49:32,505
Think about it, okay?

755
00:49:37,543 --> 00:49:39,485
I met Geon-oh.

756
00:49:40,999 --> 00:49:42,435
What?

757
00:49:44,517 --> 00:49:46,739
Do you know what Geon-oh
is up to these days?

758
00:49:48,908 --> 00:49:53,313
Well... We haven't kept
in touch with him...

759
00:49:53,337 --> 00:49:56,191
After we went to the army,
he went abroad to study right away.

760
00:49:56,215 --> 00:49:57,396
We lost touch.

761
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:00,622
- I don't even know how he's doing.
- Yeah.

762
00:50:01,797 --> 00:50:03,197
I need to get going. Let's go.

763
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:05,118
Okay. Hey, we're off.

764
00:50:23,284 --> 00:50:24,900
They left.

765
00:50:53,365 --> 00:50:55,292
I'll deal with Byeong-mu myself.

766
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:09,212
Yes, it's urgent.

767
00:51:10,493 --> 00:51:12,347
I'll do it myself.

768
00:51:13,332 --> 00:51:14,632
Okay.

769
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,200
Bye.

770
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,751
Byeong-mu!

771
00:51:30,243 --> 00:51:32,665
Let's go get hangover soup. Yeah?

772
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:35,144
My stomach hurts so much.

773
00:51:36,484 --> 00:51:37,974
Okay.

774
00:51:44,577 --> 00:51:47,991
That sounds great!
The Mucheon PR ambassador!

775
00:51:50,512 --> 00:51:52,579
I didn't think you'd agree
to it so willingly.

776
00:51:52,603 --> 00:51:54,333
I look forward to working with you.

777
00:51:54,357 --> 00:51:57,354
Congresswoman, please speak comfortably.

778
00:51:57,378 --> 00:52:00,211
It's an honor for me
to meet you like this.

779
00:52:00,235 --> 00:52:02,651
I'll speak casually when we meet again.

780
00:52:03,026 --> 00:52:04,283
Please do.

781
00:52:04,977 --> 00:52:07,170
I'll get going now.

782
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:08,833
Okay.

783
00:52:12,572 --> 00:52:13,930
Director.

784
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:16,211
Please take care...

785
00:52:16,881 --> 00:52:18,164
...of Jeong-woo's mother.

786
00:52:18,188 --> 00:52:20,198
Of course. Since you're asking.

787
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:32,247
"Jeong-woo"?

788
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:35,731
I've heard that name before.
Jeong-woo...

789
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,487
Goh Jeong-woo.

790
00:52:41,312 --> 00:52:42,879
Goh Jeong-woo?

791
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:46,238
The Goh Jeong-woo from 10 years ago?

792
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:53,745
He was recently released from prison...

793
00:52:54,343 --> 00:52:56,003
...and his mother got hurt.

794
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:01,331
What should we have for dinner?

795
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:12,985
Ha Seol.

796
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:14,295
Have you seen Geon-oh?

797
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:15,879
I just got here myself.

798
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:18,016
But were you discharged already?

799
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,831
The doctor said you needed to eat well
and get plenty of sleep.

800
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:28,881
They must be super close.

801
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:44,025
Were you really high school classmates
with Choi Na-gyeom?

802
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,252
Yes.

803
00:53:45,276 --> 00:53:46,821
Was she this pretty in high school?

804
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:48,741
Oh, gosh. Her? Pretty?

805
00:53:48,765 --> 00:53:51,672
I'm a real big fan. Can you get me
on a video call with her just once?

806
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:54,371
- Please.
- Hey, just once.

807
00:53:55,503 --> 00:53:57,054
Stop being ridiculous! Geez.

808
00:53:57,078 --> 00:53:58,389
- You're done, right?
- Yes.

809
00:53:58,413 --> 00:53:59,524
Let's go pay.

810
00:53:59,525 --> 00:54:00,774
Let's go. It's on me.

811
00:54:00,798 --> 00:54:02,905
- Hey, call her.
- Right now?

812
00:54:02,929 --> 00:54:04,346
- Try it.
- She'll be really busy.

813
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:07,312
Just try it.

814
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,414
I'm here on an errand for Su-oh.

815
00:54:10,438 --> 00:54:13,168
I was going to contact you
once I found it.

816
00:54:21,268 --> 00:54:22,854
Hey, wait.

817
00:54:22,985 --> 00:54:24,774
Don't you hear something strange?

818
00:54:36,743 --> 00:54:38,043
Geon-oh.

819
00:54:38,907 --> 00:54:40,434
<i>Are you in there?</i>

820
00:54:40,458 --> 00:54:41,880
Jeong-woo.

821
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,198
Why are you locked in here?

822
00:54:45,625 --> 00:54:47,087
<i>Jeong-woo...</i>

823
00:54:54,669 --> 00:54:56,219
Thank you for the food.

824
00:54:56,243 --> 00:54:57,129
Goodbye.

825
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:59,385
- Oh, hey, I left my phone.
- Okay.

826
00:55:02,684 --> 00:55:03,963
What are you doing?

827
00:55:03,987 --> 00:55:05,727
Huh? Oh...

828
00:55:05,823 --> 00:55:07,090
My phone.

829
00:55:07,114 --> 00:55:08,760
Oh, okay.

830
00:55:08,784 --> 00:55:12,195
Hey, is Choi Na-gyeom
or Kim Bo-ra more popular?

831
00:55:12,584 --> 00:55:14,616
- Sorry?
- I like Kim Bo-ra.

832
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:15,909
Let's go.

833
00:55:31,387 --> 00:55:32,844
Geon-oh.

834
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:34,705
Are you okay?

835
00:55:34,828 --> 00:55:36,415
Jeong-woo...

836
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:42,666
- Please call an ambulance.
- Oh, okay.

837
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,210
No.

838
00:55:45,366 --> 00:55:46,844
You can't.

839
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:55,357
Is this urgent?

840
00:55:55,381 --> 00:55:56,545
No, no.

841
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,235
What do you think of Team Head Noh?

842
00:55:58,259 --> 00:56:01,142
He's unpredictable but...

843
00:56:01,696 --> 00:56:04,905
...he gets the job done.

844
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:07,804
He's good at his job?

845
00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:13,111
But I wonder if being good at his job...

846
00:56:13,308 --> 00:56:17,165
...means he's digging into closed cases
to make a name for himself.

847
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,557
Sorry, what do you mean?

848
00:56:23,903 --> 00:56:26,965
The skeletal remains that were found
after 10 years.

849
00:56:27,638 --> 00:56:29,134
Team Head Noh is
from the Major Crime Unit.

850
00:56:29,158 --> 00:56:31,491
Do you think he'd let
such a big case go?

851
00:56:32,641 --> 00:56:35,062
He'll need to get promoted
in order to return to his old unit.

852
00:56:35,086 --> 00:56:37,685
Then he needs at least something
as big as this.

853
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,816
Wait, that means...

854
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,578
He won't give up on reopening this case!

855
00:56:43,353 --> 00:56:47,198
But even if we do reopen it,
there's nothing to come out of it.

856
00:56:47,458 --> 00:56:50,071
Isn't it just us
that will suffer in the end?

857
00:56:51,854 --> 00:56:54,488
Geez. We're short on manpower as it is.

858
00:56:54,805 --> 00:56:56,491
Gosh, that punk...

859
00:57:01,882 --> 00:57:06,753
I'll tell Byeong-mu
to start monitoring him.

860
00:57:07,348 --> 00:57:10,948
And I'll contact you right away
if anything happens.

861
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:16,597
Yes.

862
00:57:16,621 --> 00:57:18,561
I'm on my way back after lunch.

863
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:22,580
Oh, okay. Of course.
As you command, Section Chief.

864
00:57:22,604 --> 00:57:24,152
I got it. Okay.

865
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,849
- Hey, you scared me!
- Gosh, you scared me.

866
00:57:28,873 --> 00:57:30,631
You turned around so suddenly.

867
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,804
What's going on?

868
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:35,218
Well...

869
00:57:35,242 --> 00:57:38,203
I have work to do,
so you guys head on first.

870
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:39,836
Yes, take care.

871
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,984
- Yeah.
- Are you going somewhere?

872
00:57:42,008 --> 00:57:43,317
Huh?

873
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,616
- Why?
- No, I was just curious.

874
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:47,007
When will you be back?

875
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:50,124
Hey, are we dating or something?

876
00:57:50,148 --> 00:57:52,137
- Huh? Geez.
- No, no...

877
00:57:52,161 --> 00:57:53,766
Go inside and get to work.

878
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:55,408
Yes, sir.

879
00:57:55,432 --> 00:57:56,732
Okay.

880
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,690
Geez.

881
00:58:32,227 --> 00:58:33,535
I'm sorry.

882
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:35,843
I'm in a hurry.
Can you move out of the way?

883
00:58:35,867 --> 00:58:37,232
I'm sorry!

884
00:58:39,441 --> 00:58:41,712
I think he's losing me on purpose.

885
00:58:41,736 --> 00:58:43,471
Where could he be going?

886
00:59:04,112 --> 00:59:06,211
I think he's heading towards Wonju.

887
00:59:06,291 --> 00:59:07,611
Wonju?

888
00:59:08,759 --> 00:59:10,304
Why Wonju?

889
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:15,217
You know what happened
in the warehouse that day.

890
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:16,984
Please tell me.

891
00:59:17,008 --> 00:59:18,370
I'm sorry, Jeong-woo.

892
00:59:18,394 --> 00:59:19,827
- Geon-oh...
- I'm sorry.

893
00:59:19,851 --> 00:59:22,031

01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:42,050
<i>I'll get to the bottom of this.</i>

01:04:42,263 --> 01:04:45,696
<i>Just don't do a freaking thing.</i>

952
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,422
<i>Just say what you want to say.</i>

953
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:49,057
<i>I miss Bo-yeong.</i>

954
01:04:51,336 --> 01:04:52,485
<i>Me too.</i>

955
