Pro golfer Lee Sung-bin remains missing

2
00:01:05,784 --> 00:01:07,819
since last week,

3
00:01:07,886 --> 00:01:11,656
while his friends were all found dead

4
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,258
during a trip.

5
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:17,295
The police are canvasing
the home of a missionary

6
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:21,065
as testified by the survivor
from Lee's group,

7
00:01:21,132 --> 00:01:25,003
and 2 prime suspects were captured,

8
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,806
and are being investigated.

Here we go!

13
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,216
- Yong-joon, help me!
- You guys are chumps.

14
00:02:45,884 --> 00:02:49,054
You wanted to see Sung-bin,
how could you sleep so much?

15
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:53,825
I worked extra shifts
for this trip, I'm so tired.

16
00:02:53,892 --> 00:02:57,328
Your neck was all bent back
like a zombie.

17
00:02:57,395 --> 00:02:58,830
Dang...

18
00:02:58,897 --> 00:03:00,298
Did Sung-bin see me?

19
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:02,333
He wasn't the only one.

20
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,902
- Damn...
- That one.

21
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:06,271
- This?
- Yeah.

22
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:27,425
Holy crap, so creepy.

23
00:03:30,595 --> 00:03:32,864
It'll take all damn day to check out.

24
00:03:32,931 --> 00:03:35,266
- I'll do it quickly.
- Sung-bin, I'll chip in.

25
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:37,302
It's okay.

26
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:40,672
I want to kiss you.

27
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:47,645
So cute!

28
00:03:47,712 --> 00:03:49,848
What's your name?

29
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:53,151
My name is Bonggu, what's yours?

30
00:03:53,718 --> 00:03:55,320
His name is Bonggu?

31
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:02,527
What are you doing? I said I'm okay!

32
00:04:02,594 --> 00:04:03,661
Let go of me!

33
00:04:03,728 --> 00:04:04,929
Mi-na!

34
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:07,298
What's with you?

35
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:08,966
Back off, man.

36
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:12,671
Hey! Piss off!

37
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:22,247
What... what are you looking at?

38
00:04:23,748 --> 00:04:26,651
Who are you kids?

39
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:31,489
What is it?

40
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,492
Why...

41
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:39,731
are you messing with my brother?

42
00:04:42,634 --> 00:04:45,937
What's up?

43
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:49,307
- Sung-bin?
- Yeah?

44
00:04:49,641 --> 00:04:52,110
I'm all right, let's just leave.

45
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:56,047
Yeah, let's get out of here...

46
00:04:59,484 --> 00:05:01,119
Don't let me ever see you again.

47
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:04,456
Let's go, baby.

48
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,226
Come on!

49
00:05:10,195 --> 00:05:11,929
They totally looked like the type

50
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:14,332
who kidnap girls using the puppy.

51
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,467
No way...

52
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:17,769
You saw them,

53
00:05:17,836 --> 00:05:19,437
they only bought tools

54
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:20,972
that looked like murder weapons.

55
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,641
Mi-na could've been in trouble
if it wasn't for Sung-bin.

56
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:28,813
They were ex-cons for sure.

57
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,481
I've never seen anyone

58
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:33,017
uglier than Byung-jo.

59
00:05:33,084 --> 00:05:36,654
He's handsome by comparison.

60
00:05:36,721 --> 00:05:40,091
You're really hot, be confident!

61
00:05:40,158 --> 00:05:42,126
- Ow, that hurts!
- You're a hottie!

62
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:43,728
- Come here!
- Hey! Stop!

63
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:55,473
Rotten luck...

64
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:59,143
Didn't you hear Sung-bin
screaming at you to stop?

65
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,112
I heard...

66
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:05,183
Byung-jo is a loser

67
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:07,418
who can't even drive.

68
00:06:08,586 --> 00:06:12,190
Jason, I've never seen
a dead goat, let's take a selfie!

69
00:06:12,257 --> 00:06:13,624
Okay!

70
00:06:13,691 --> 00:06:15,693
Goat-killer has to be in the shot.

71
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:18,696
- Hey, don't...
- Come on, loser!

72
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:21,099
Okay, three, two, one, bam!

73
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,734
- One more.
- One, two...

74
00:06:22,801 --> 00:06:27,572
Shouldn't we bury that goat?

75
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:30,809
Bury that thing?

76
00:06:31,876 --> 00:06:33,511
Then just leave it there?

77
00:06:37,148 --> 00:06:38,249
Mi-na.

78
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:42,120

Sang-gu...

80
00:07:16,988 --> 00:07:23,094
didn't I tell you to always
mind your own business.

81
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:25,263
Well, I just...

82
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:30,434
She fell in front of me,
was I supposed to ignore her?

83
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:32,937
We got mixed up

84
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:35,373
with ungrateful idiots too many times.

85
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,442
Mind your business.

86
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:41,112
I look a bit much, right?

87
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:44,615
You're so handsome,
don't you dare say that!

88
00:07:44,682 --> 00:07:48,453
Dressed up, and you're hotter
than a movie star!

89
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,323
But not as handsome as you.

90
00:07:53,157 --> 00:07:55,626
Our style's different, yeah?

91
00:07:55,693 --> 00:07:59,197
I'm... tough handsome style,

92
00:07:59,264 --> 00:08:02,066
you're sexy handsome style.

93
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:07,004
Is that right?

94
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,973
What's Bonggu's style?

95
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:11,142
Bonggu is...

96
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:13,611
paw-sitively handsome style?

97
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:16,647
Bonggu, it must be nice
to be so handsome.

98
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,416
"I love it that you guys
are handsome too."

99
00:08:20,151 --> 00:08:21,185

100
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:28,593

00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,607
Yes, for sure.

- Sir?

112
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:27,385
- Go check that sack.
- Me, sir?

113
00:09:27,452 --> 00:09:28,720
Go!

114
00:09:29,387 --> 00:09:32,023
I'd appreciate it
if you could step aside.

115
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,591
No, to the right.

116
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,460

117
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,562
- Get going.
- Okay.

00:09:49,974 --> 00:09:50,841
What the!

119
00:09:50,908 --> 00:09:54,746
What? Was I right?

120
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:58,582
It's a goat carcass.

121
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,651
- Whose?
- Goat.

122
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:03,487
- Go-what?
- Goat, a black goat.

123
00:10:03,554 --> 00:10:04,388
Why?

124
00:10:04,455 --> 00:10:07,425
I don't know why it's black,
it's a black goat.

128

out of the way!

00:12:25,263 --> 00:12:27,431
villagers were so grateful

160
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:30,601
that they built him
a Western-style home.

161
00:12:30,668 --> 00:12:33,137

00:14:04,662 --> 00:14:06,030
Let's sign right away.

185
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:10,001
- It's the best!
- All right!

186
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:14,071
- Thank you!
- Hey, hey, stop it!

187
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,242
Here I go!

188
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:22,846
Stop that!

189
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:23,914
Hey!

190
00:14:24,749 --> 00:14:26,584
Have a dip!

191
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:40,931
Dude, let us know
when the barbecue's ready!

192
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:42,900
Those jerks...

193
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,037
I was trying to lowball him,
how could you just bite...

194
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:48,706
I feel so good today.

195
00:14:48,773 --> 00:14:52,209
You would have peed your pants
if you buy another home!

196
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:54,044
Aren't you happy?

197
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:56,714
It's our home that
we saved 10 years for.

198
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,715
What's there to be happy?

199
00:14:57,782 --> 00:14:59,784
It's too old and needs to be gutted.

200
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,852
We can get to it little by little.

201
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,055
Oh yeah, we have to do
a prayer to the gods!

202
00:15:05,122 --> 00:15:06,023
To commemorate our new home.

203
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,994
Forget it! Use that time
to hammer some more nails!

204
00:15:11,128 --> 00:15:12,163
Jeez...

205
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:14,131
What the hell?

206
00:15:15,733 --> 00:15:18,736
There are wasps...

207
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:20,738
Looks like they are welcoming us.

208
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:25,743
Cut the crap,

209
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,978
find the wasp nest and torch it.

210
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:33,984
Bro!

211
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,293
You okay?

212
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,562
Let's start with that tomorrow.

213
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:47,198
Yeah, let's do that.

214
00:15:51,135 --> 00:15:52,870
Are you going to stay there all day?

215
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:55,705
Nope.

216
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:10,821
Sang-gu.

217
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:13,958
Fetch me a crowbar.

218
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,935
It's got a basement?

219
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,537
Sweet!

220
00:16:28,672 --> 00:16:30,174
Watch your head.

221
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,077
What's this space used for?

222
00:16:36,213 --> 00:16:37,982
The atmosphere here is heavy.

223
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,229
What?

224
00:16:53,697 --> 00:16:54,832
What is it?

225
00:17:01,172 --> 00:17:03,040
Why are you freaking out?

226
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:03,941
And you?

227
00:17:04,008 --> 00:17:05,643
You screamed first!

228
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:08,345
Oh, because of that.

229
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:17,354
You freaked out over this?

230
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:20,357
Why is there a drawing on the ground?

231
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,993
Maybe the previous resident drew it.

232
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:28,065
It's so good,
maybe Baker was a painter.

233
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:29,567
It's a sculpture.

234
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,038
Wait a minute.

235
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:43,180
Isn't this a gun?

236
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:44,247
It is.

237
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:52,890
This is a real gun.

238
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:56,794
It's got bullets too.

239
00:18:05,402 --> 00:18:08,372
Heck, these must be made of silver.

240
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,074
Looks expensive.

241
00:18:11,242 --> 00:18:14,245
It's got to be precious.

242
00:18:15,246 --> 00:18:16,947
Let's get that realtor...

243
00:18:18,148 --> 00:18:20,184
to give it to the previous owner.

244
00:18:20,251 --> 00:18:21,452
Yeah, we should.

245
00:18:27,992 --> 00:18:29,760
Let's go bury the goat.

246
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,735
This is better than
tossing it in the trash.

247
00:18:38,802 --> 00:18:43,440
Goaty, fly to heaven
and live a good life.

248
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:46,143
What heaven?
When you're dead, that's it!

249
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,378
Bro, you're so cold!

250
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:50,047
You figured that out now?

251
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,819
Let's check out the lake
before sun down and fish.

252
00:18:55,886 --> 00:18:56,820
Fish?

253
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,322
That sounds nice!

254
00:19:07,231 --> 00:19:08,332
Here.

255
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:14,538
It's quite chilly at night.

256
00:19:18,008 --> 00:19:19,008
Do you want to wear this?

257
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:21,478
Can I?

258
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:27,384
Thanks.

259
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,523
- Mi-na.
- Yeah?

260
00:19:33,324 --> 00:19:36,226
Did you know there was a ghost here?

261
00:19:37,361 --> 00:19:38,429
Ghost?

262
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:42,099
This is my grandfather's hometown,

263
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,135
a girl haunted by a ghost

264
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:50,507
ran on all fours at night
and attacked villagers.

265
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:52,610
Really?

266
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:58,248
So the villagers captured her...

267
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,924
Father, why are you doing this to me?

268
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,293
I'm scared.

269
00:20:14,431 --> 00:20:15,633
Father...

270
00:20:17,401 --> 00:20:21,738
Wretched beast protected by
the loathsome army,

271
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:23,207
show yourself!

272
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:45,228
I am Baphomet!

273
00:20:45,295 --> 00:20:49,099
I came here to take you
pathetic beings to hell!

274
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,468
Your plan has completely failed,
Baphomet!

275
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:52,803
Only torment will...

276
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:58,842
Why did this ignorant Yankee
come all the way here?

277
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,784
In the name of the father,

278
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:11,021
and of the son, and of the holy spirit!

279
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:14,491
I order you, Baphomet,
be gone from this land!

280
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:28,138
Villagers called the ghost
that haunted the girl

281
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,840
"Demonic Goat" from that day on.

282
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:33,444
I'm sure she wasn't really haunted.

283
00:21:35,612 --> 00:21:37,715
I don't believe it myself,

284
00:21:38,282 --> 00:21:43,120
but I heard my great-uncle
passed away because of her.

285
00:21:43,954 --> 00:21:44,788
Sister...

286
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:46,557
Don't move, Yohan!

287
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,204
<i>Lee Won-Hee <i>1932-1956</i>
Sung-bin's Great-uncle</i>

288
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,276
Dang, so what happened
to the Demonic Goat?

289
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:07,877
What happened was…

290
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:13,150
Dumb humans, I will burn
you all in hell fire!

291
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:18,155
Hot, so hot!

292
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:20,557
So damn hot! Burning!

293
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:42,746
Excuse me, sir?

294
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,148
Shut up!

295
00:22:47,217 --> 00:22:49,787
So he fired a silver bullet
to her head.

296
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,287
Oh no...

297
00:22:52,256 --> 00:22:54,291
For this reason,

298
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:58,962
my grandfather makes me
carry a talisman.

299
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:00,797
Here.

300
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:05,369
He bought it from
a good shaman for $10,000.

301
00:23:07,437 --> 00:23:08,939
This is $10,000?

302
00:23:09,373 --> 00:23:11,408
- Sure.
- Wow...

303
00:23:14,611 --> 00:23:17,881
I sold the property as you asked,
I hope there's no problem.

304
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:20,128
That place has so many
terrifying rumors...

305
00:23:20,417 --> 00:23:22,486
Those are just old rumors.

306
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,488
Don't worry.

307
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:27,657
Anyway, I need to go away for a while.

308
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:29,226
What for?

309
00:23:29,293 --> 00:23:32,029
With so many defects,
if more problems surface,

310
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,998
those guys might really kill me.

311
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:36,567
Kill you?

312
00:23:37,134 --> 00:23:39,035
Was there a problem during the signing?

313
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,238
Sister, don't even think about
meeting them.

314
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:42,673
What kind of people were they?

315
00:23:43,807 --> 00:23:45,742
They lifted me up and spun me around!

316
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:03,927
<i>66 years and 6 months later...</i>

317
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:07,264
<i>unlock the gates of hell
with a sacrificial goat...</i>

318
00:24:18,008 --> 00:24:19,376
Does he like me?

319
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:26,883
Don't you think...

320
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,319
Mi-na is the ugliest girl
that Bo-ra brought to us?

321
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,223
She went to a crappy college,
and works to pay for the tuition.

322
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:36,093
Why is that important?

323
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,295
So long as she's cute and nice.

324
00:24:39,663 --> 00:24:45,502
She's perfect to toy with
before I fly off to the States.

325
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,305
You got a weird taste,

326
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:49,907
she's too dull for me.

327
00:24:50,874 --> 00:24:53,577
Bo-ra's bringing girls for me,

328
00:24:53,644 --> 00:24:55,579
it's a courtesy to get a taste.

329
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,748
When did you ever care about courtesy?

330
00:24:58,815 --> 00:25:00,217
Where's Bo-ra?

331
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,054
Where is she?

332
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:07,557
Bro.

333
00:25:08,392 --> 00:25:12,829
Like you said, we're handsome,
but why can't we get girlfriends?

334
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,470
It's because you didn't
put your heart in it.

335
00:25:20,537 --> 00:25:23,807
Once you do, you'll get one in no time.

336
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:25,375
Do we lack anything?

337
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:29,713
We got a house, a truck,
and very attractive.

338
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:47,130
Girlfriend is one thing,

339
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:50,600
let's just make some
female friends quickly.

340
00:25:51,101 --> 00:25:53,003
Party of 3 sounds nice, no?

341
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:55,238
Good to play card games.

342
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,008
And order take-out food too.

343
00:25:58,075 --> 00:25:59,376
What else, what?

344
00:25:59,776 --> 00:26:00,777
A female person...

345
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:08,952
<i>Mi-na</i>

346
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:15,425
<i>You have 9 missed calls</i>

347
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:17,961
Your call cannot be connected...

348
00:26:22,766 --> 00:26:24,968
Dammit!

349
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,238
What was that?

350
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,775
You there!

351
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,287
Bro!

352
00:27:23,193 --> 00:27:24,327
Jae-pil!

353
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:28,198
Bro!

354
00:27:52,222 --> 00:27:54,558
It's that girl from the market earlier.

355
00:27:55,225 --> 00:27:57,660
Hey there, wake up!

356
00:27:57,727 --> 00:27:59,996
Try to wake up!

357
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:01,865
- Bro!
- Yeah?

358
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:04,434
Is she dead?

359
00:28:12,542 --> 00:28:15,979
Don't just sit there,
do a mouth-to-mouth!

360
00:28:16,046 --> 00:28:17,647
Mouth-to-mouth?

361
00:28:17,714 --> 00:28:18,581
With my mouth?

362
00:28:18,648 --> 00:28:20,350
Hurry!

363
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:24,754
She's dying! Hurry up!

364
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:26,689
Go on!

365
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,003
You're up!

366
00:28:48,078 --> 00:28:51,214
- She's coming back!
- Where the hell am I?

367
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,417
Move, pricks!

368
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,000
Are they...

369
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,769
Aren't those guys at the mart?

370
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:17,874
What do we do, baby?

371
00:29:17,941 --> 00:29:19,242
Dammit!

372
00:29:20,944 --> 00:29:22,245
So doomed...

373
00:30:05,889 --> 00:30:07,857
- Kidnapped?
- Yeah!

374
00:30:07,924 --> 00:30:09,859
Those hillbillies from earlier
kidnapped her!

375
00:30:09,926 --> 00:30:12,795
I knew they were up to no good.

376
00:30:12,862 --> 00:30:14,397
Why did she just bolt out of here?

377
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:15,965
If something happens to her,

378
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:18,101
we'll get so much crap!

379
00:30:18,168 --> 00:30:19,502
What do we do, Sung-bin?

380
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,938
Let's call the cops first.

381
00:30:24,307 --> 00:30:25,408
My phone...

382
00:30:26,343 --> 00:30:28,111
It was in the jacket I gave to Mi-na.

383
00:30:29,546 --> 00:30:31,815
- But that...
- What the heck?

384
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:42,825
Look at this prick.

385
00:30:42,892 --> 00:30:45,395
Getting high too.

386
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:48,064
He's a piece of crap!

387
00:30:48,898 --> 00:30:51,067
We could make a mint
selling this to the TV station.

388
00:30:52,168 --> 00:30:54,738
<i>Golfer Lee Sung-bin Golfing
While High on Drugs</i>

389
00:30:58,308 --> 00:30:59,776
Dammit!

390
00:31:02,545 --> 00:31:04,314
Dude, call my phone!

391
00:31:04,381 --> 00:31:05,381
Okay!

392
00:31:05,682 --> 00:31:07,317
I got no signal!

393
00:31:07,384 --> 00:31:08,952
Mine doesn't work either!

394
00:31:09,019 --> 00:31:10,520
Dammit! Mine too!

395
00:31:10,587 --> 00:31:12,322
We're so dead if it leaks!

396
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:14,224
You can't play in the States either!

397
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,092
Dammit!

398
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,561
Don't I know that?

399
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,965
Dude! While we look for Mi-na,

400
00:31:22,032 --> 00:31:23,566
go fetch the police!

401
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,068
- Now!
- Yeah, okay!

402
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:29,672
Put her in the truck!

403
00:31:29,739 --> 00:31:31,541
What if the hospital's closed?

404
00:31:31,608 --> 00:31:33,009
Let's just go!

405
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,622
Push harder!

406
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,203
You have to do this now?

407
00:32:05,075 --> 00:32:06,242
I hope it gets leaked

408
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:09,279
and they get totally doomed!

409
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,314
Hooray!

410
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:31,434
Sung-bin's going to come at me again...

411
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:58,361
Stupid goat!

412
00:33:03,032 --> 00:33:04,734
You crazy goat!

413
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:06,669
Do I look like a loser to you?

414
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:08,571
Do I look like one?

415
00:33:13,109 --> 00:33:17,414
Loser!

416
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,922
Loser!

417
00:33:54,617 --> 00:33:58,388
Damn, so hot...

418
00:35:39,022 --> 00:35:40,690
You're awake?

419
00:35:48,865 --> 00:35:49,866
Where you going?

420
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,070
Going home, are you?

421
00:36:11,788 --> 00:36:14,157
Are you nuts?

422
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,394
No, no, wait...

423
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,499
Stop it, you pricks!

424
00:36:23,566 --> 00:36:27,136
Stay away from me!

425
00:36:27,203 --> 00:36:28,871
Mommy, help me!

426
00:36:28,938 --> 00:36:30,440
Holy crap!

427
00:36:34,177 --> 00:36:35,345
I'm so scared...

428
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:46,356
Hungry?

429
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:52,695
I grilled it with my torch.

430
00:36:52,762 --> 00:36:54,564
I don't know if you'll like it.

431
00:36:55,531 --> 00:36:56,733
Thank you.

432
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,602
Did you really have to
cook her breakfast?

433
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:04,407
Do you know how much trouble
we got into to rescue you?

434
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:08,744
Kids nowadays show gratitude
by making a hole on one's head!

435
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:10,346
She was startled.

436
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:15,418
I'm sorry, he may seem prickly,

437
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:17,053
but he's really a warm person,

438
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,130
be a little understanding.

439
00:37:18,154 --> 00:37:22,625
No, I'm the one sorry
for misunderstanding...

440
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:24,427
I'm really sorry!

441
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:27,730
Forget it, if you're okay, get going!

442
00:37:27,797 --> 00:37:29,666
We got a lot of work to do.

443
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,735
But you're my lifesaver,

444
00:37:32,802 --> 00:37:34,904
if you give me your number,
I'll buy you dinner...

445
00:37:34,971 --> 00:37:37,740
010-7105-717...

446
00:37:37,807 --> 00:37:39,408
- Once more...
- Shall I do it for you?

447
00:37:39,475 --> 00:37:40,475
Hey!

448
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:44,213
You want to let a student
buy you a meal?

449
00:37:46,282 --> 00:37:47,617
You're right.

450
00:37:48,618 --> 00:37:50,586
I'm so rude at times...

451
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:54,323
But couldn't I get her name?

452
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:57,326
I'm Kim Mi-na.

453
00:37:57,827 --> 00:38:00,830
I see, you're Kim Mi-na...

454
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,567
I'm Park Sang-gu, Mi-na.

455
00:38:06,135 --> 00:38:08,337
My brother is Kang Jae-pil.

456
00:38:08,404 --> 00:38:09,839
We're carpenters.

457
00:38:09,906 --> 00:38:11,641
He's my brother from another mom.

458
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:13,476
You idiot!

459
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,380
How could you be so crude
in front of a girl?

460
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:19,881
Apologize.

461
00:38:20,983 --> 00:38:24,120
I'm sorry, Mi-na, I think I messed up.

462
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:27,123
If I offended you,
allow me to apologize.

463
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:31,627
No, it's okay...

464
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:44,807
Don't worry about treating us,
consider this our dinner.

465
00:38:45,475 --> 00:38:47,410
Bro, come eat with us.

466
00:38:47,477 --> 00:38:51,147
You guys have plenty.

467
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:53,716
- Dig in.
- Okay.

468
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:56,753
Thank you for the meal.

469
00:39:01,324 --> 00:39:05,661
Wow, it's goddam...
I mean, it's amazing.

470
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,996
Is that right?

471
00:39:07,663 --> 00:39:08,931
Try this one too.

472
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,736
This house is the only place
left to search.

473
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,607
It's so eerie like a killers' hideout.

474
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:21,077
Yong-joon, go check it out.

475
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:22,744
Me?

476
00:39:23,212 --> 00:39:25,448
Dammit, then should I?

477
00:39:27,884 --> 00:39:29,285
Don't look at me!

478
00:39:30,686 --> 00:39:31,754
Damn you.

479
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,192
- Can I not go?
- You stupid...

480
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:58,481
What are you doing?!

481
00:40:01,784 --> 00:40:04,720
Stop it! Don't do that!

482
00:40:08,624 --> 00:40:11,393
I'm serious!

483
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,395
I'll do the dishes!

484
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:14,764
I said I'll do it.

485
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,733
Why are you making me feel so bad?

486
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:22,103
All right.

487
00:40:23,072 --> 00:40:24,574
Let's do it together then.

488
00:40:25,575 --> 00:40:27,009
Very well, let's do it together.

489
00:40:27,977 --> 00:40:29,245

Those jerks from yesterday,

00:43:51,881 --> 00:43:54,149
don't they rub you the wrong way?

509
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,485
How could they look so shady
but not have any priors?

510
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,654
They seemed like good people.

511
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:01,690
They even removed roadkill, why?

512
00:44:02,191 --> 00:44:05,194
That's why you'll never make it.

called in Major Crimes?

514
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,431
No clue.

515
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:11,767
"Ghost Eyes", man, that's who I was.

516
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:14,670
Even ghosts didn't mess with me.

517
00:44:14,737 --> 00:44:15,905
Do you know why?

518
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:18,640
When I look at them like this,

519
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:21,577
I can tell who's a ghost and who's not.

520

Holy crap, ghost!

00:44:25,815 --> 00:44:26,815

What the heck is this jerk?

527
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:43,499
- Stay back!
- What?!

528
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,568
Why? Why?

529
00:44:46,335 --> 00:44:49,705
- The goat went maa...

00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:52,608
It screamed 'Loser'!

532
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:57,846

You have to go, right?

536
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:13,605

537
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:15,431

00:46:29,772 --> 00:46:31,607
What's with your face?

550
00:46:31,674 --> 00:46:34,043
I... I...

551
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,064
I told you to get rid of
the wasp nest, didn't I?

552
00:47:02,504 --> 00:47:07,910
This is how serial killers
show off their kills.

553
00:47:08,978 --> 00:47:10,446
We can't handle these guys.

554
00:47:11,146 --> 00:47:12,481
Let's head back.

555
00:47:12,548 --> 00:47:16,185
Head back where?
We have to get our revenge!

556
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:17,519
Do you not see this?

557
00:47:18,153 --> 00:47:20,422
They're absolute psychos!

558
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,193
Let's go get those guys.

559
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,260
Sung-bin...

560
00:47:26,562 --> 00:47:28,697
It doesn't matter
if they're killers or devils,

561
00:47:28,764 --> 00:47:31,300
I have to find my phone!

562
00:47:31,367 --> 00:47:32,768
Yes! Let's go!

563
00:47:32,835 --> 00:47:35,404
Let's get those psychos.

564
00:47:36,071 --> 00:47:37,573
You've never seen horror movies?

565
00:47:38,407 --> 00:47:41,076
This is how we all get killed!

566
00:47:43,912 --> 00:47:45,581
Easy, go easy!

567
00:47:45,648 --> 00:47:46,648
All right.

568
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:48,250
That hurts!

569
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:50,719
Put this on your face.

570
00:47:51,954 --> 00:47:54,289
The site must be really bad.

571
00:47:54,356 --> 00:47:55,600
Shouldn't we really do some prayers?

572
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:57,026
Forget it!

573
00:47:58,227 --> 00:47:59,595
The site was bad to begin with.

574
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:04,366
By the way, I met your friends
in front of the house.

575
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,868
- My friends?
- Yeah.

576
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,837
It looked like they came for you,

577
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:11,974
but they ran away
when they saw the wasps.

578
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:14,076
Is that right? That's great then.

579
00:48:14,143 --> 00:48:16,178
You could just wait for them here!

580
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:18,147
Why the hell for?

581
00:48:18,947 --> 00:48:20,482
We'll tell your friends you left.

582
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:23,986
All right.

583
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:25,820
No need to get angry.

584
00:48:29,725 --> 00:48:31,860
I wasn't angry.

585
00:48:31,927 --> 00:48:32,927
You were.

586
00:48:33,595 --> 00:48:35,431
It's because I got stung.

587
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:39,335
Fine, fine, fine.

588
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:42,971
Whether you wait or not,

589
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:45,607
do whatever you want, ma'am.

590
00:48:48,177 --> 00:48:49,545
What do you want to do, Mi-na?

591
00:48:51,647 --> 00:48:54,416
I'll wait here until they come.

592
00:48:54,483 --> 00:48:56,218
And I can help you with your work too.

593
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,654
You don't need to help.

<i>Housecleaning Mix Vol. 5</i>

595
00:49:16,672 --> 00:49:20,642
You're so good at everything!

596
00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:23,846
I always wanted to take up art.

597
00:49:25,514 --> 00:49:27,683
Very nice!

598
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:30,118
Let's take a photo.

599
00:49:30,185 --> 00:49:30,919
Photo?

600
00:49:30,986 --> 00:49:31,986
Yeah, selfie.

00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,420
<i>Jae-pil & Sang-gu's Home and Bonggu</i>

602
00:49:34,189 --> 00:49:35,958
One, two, three!

603
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:46,401
What are you making?

604
00:49:46,468 --> 00:49:51,206
It's a planter to grow
lettuce and artichoke.

605
00:49:53,175 --> 00:49:54,376
Can I try?

606
00:49:55,377 --> 00:49:57,913
- But it's dangerous.
- I want to try.

607
00:49:58,947 --> 00:50:02,551
Hold tight, and aim it here,
pull the trigger.

608
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:06,021
Eh? It's not working.

609
00:50:06,422 --> 00:50:10,726
It's an old compressor,
it unplugs often.

610
00:50:11,894 --> 00:50:13,128
It'll work now.

611
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:15,898
It works!

612
00:50:25,607 --> 00:50:26,607
Aren't I good?

613
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:31,646
Help with what?!

614
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:33,449
They're just fooling around!

615
00:50:34,817 --> 00:50:39,288
Yo, Park Sang-gu,
how could you do this to me?

616
00:50:39,888 --> 00:50:41,256
You like her that much?

617
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:45,394
You love her enough
to kick me to the curb?

618
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:49,364
Answer me!

619
00:50:55,771 --> 00:50:58,207
Fotget you all!

620
00:51:19,561 --> 00:51:21,430
How is it in the back?

621
00:51:22,264 --> 00:51:25,100
The chainsaw killer is very hyped up.

622
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:27,302
The post-murder adrenaline
must be in overdrive.

623
00:51:29,438 --> 00:51:31,039
This guy's worst.

624
00:51:31,106 --> 00:51:33,509
He's forcing Mi-na to
make her own coffin.

625
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:39,548
She's crying while
making her own coffin?

626
00:51:40,082 --> 00:51:40,782
What's wrong?

627
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:43,418
I think something went in my eye.

628
00:51:43,986 --> 00:51:44,987
Let me see.

629
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:51,593
Is that good?

630
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,395
Uh, yeah, that did it.

631
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:56,698
No more nailing,
you did plenty already.

632
00:52:04,172 --> 00:52:06,875
What is he doing?

633
00:52:09,177 --> 00:52:11,279
One, two, three!

634
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:12,881
One, two, three!

635
00:52:13,649 --> 00:52:17,519
He's photographing
the entire murder process!

636
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:20,756
This planter looks like a coffin!

637
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:27,563
They must've escaped
from an insane asylum!

638
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,002
Yong-joon and I'll take him,

639
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:37,772
Jason, you avenge your girl's killer.

640
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:40,809
Then we get my phone back,
can you do that?

641
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:46,048
Don't worry.

642
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:51,253
One shot, one kill.

643
00:53:30,425 --> 00:53:31,426
Sung-bin.

644
00:53:38,467 --> 00:53:40,535
Mi-na's friends are here.

645
00:53:46,441 --> 00:53:47,776
Attack!

646
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:05,559
Sung-bin...

647
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:37,459
Are you...

648
00:54:38,493 --> 00:54:39,494
Blood!

649
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:54,843
Die!

650
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:01,183
Who are you? What happened?!

651
00:55:02,517 --> 00:55:05,020
Get out of there!

652
00:55:05,887 --> 00:55:08,256
Oh my god!

653
00:55:09,791 --> 00:55:11,226
I'll cover him for now...

654
00:55:13,228 --> 00:55:14,629
What are we supposed to do?

655
00:55:15,330 --> 00:55:16,407
What in the world is going on?

656
00:55:16,431 --> 00:55:19,801
Sang-gu! Sang-gu!

657
00:55:19,868 --> 00:55:20,802
What is it?

658
00:55:20,869 --> 00:55:22,303
- Sang-gu!
- Bro, what is it?

659
00:55:22,370 --> 00:55:23,938
We got a big problem!

660
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:27,676
While I was looking away,

661
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,211
some guy jumped

662
00:55:30,278 --> 00:55:34,082
into the wood chipper by himself!

663
00:55:34,149 --> 00:55:36,317
Why'd someone jump
into the wood chipper?

664
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:37,819
How should I know?

665
00:55:37,886 --> 00:55:39,326
It's not like he gave me a heads-up!

666
00:55:42,324 --> 00:55:46,128
So, is he dead or alive?

667
00:55:46,895 --> 00:55:49,097
- Tomato paste...
- Tomato paste?

668
00:55:49,564 --> 00:55:52,167
He's shredded like tomato paste!

669
00:55:59,574 --> 00:56:01,009
What is that?

670
00:56:01,743 --> 00:56:03,223
Look over there, there's another one.

671
00:56:07,749 --> 00:56:10,452
Mi-na! Mi-na!

672
00:56:22,464 --> 00:56:23,899
A bite mark...

673
00:56:36,578 --> 00:56:39,214
So, everyone left to look

674
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:41,216
for your kidnapped friend at night?

675
00:56:42,417 --> 00:56:43,985
They didn't leave to rescue her...

676
00:56:44,052 --> 00:56:46,388
- Yes?
- But they still left.

677
00:56:47,622 --> 00:56:50,025
You guys got balls...

678
00:56:53,395 --> 00:56:54,429
Wait a minute!

679
00:56:57,232 --> 00:56:59,501
You said there were 2 kidnappers?

680
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,940
Did they have a weird looking dog?

681
00:57:06,007 --> 00:57:07,209
Yes, that jerk!

682
00:57:07,742 --> 00:57:10,312
Those jerks, I knew it.

683
00:57:11,046 --> 00:57:13,181
- Officer Nam!
- Yes?

684
00:57:13,248 --> 00:57:15,317
We're moving out! Let's go!

685
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:17,686
Get over here.

686
00:57:36,638 --> 00:57:37,638
How is she?

687
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:39,674
She must've gotten a lot of shock.

688
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,279
Rightly so.

689
00:57:45,013 --> 00:57:47,782
We should report this first, right?

690
00:57:49,951 --> 00:57:51,953
If we do,

691
00:57:53,521 --> 00:57:55,490
one bad move could get us locked up.

692
00:57:55,557 --> 00:57:58,326
Why do we go to jail?

693
00:57:58,393 --> 00:57:59,694
That's what this looks like.

694
00:57:59,761 --> 00:58:01,796
If we tell cops

695
00:58:01,863 --> 00:58:03,274
that these kids just killed themselves,

696
00:58:03,298 --> 00:58:05,567
do you think they'll believe us?

697
00:58:06,201 --> 00:58:08,346
They could have come here
to really just commit suicide.

698
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:10,105
Mi-na jumped into the lake
last night too.

699
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:13,274
Does she look like
someone who'd kill herself?

700
00:58:13,341 --> 00:58:15,677
She devoured her meal

701
00:58:15,744 --> 00:58:17,345
and played so well with you.

702
00:58:17,412 --> 00:58:18,613
Right...

703
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,750
And why'd suicidal kids
try to attack you?

704
00:58:22,384 --> 00:58:24,319
Yeah, they jumped at me.

705
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:25,553
It looks to me,

706
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:30,391
Mi-na and her friends,

707
00:58:30,458 --> 00:58:33,995
they might all be part of a cult.

708
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:36,064
You know that thing,

709
00:58:36,131 --> 00:58:40,368
giving themselves up to be a sacrifice.

710
00:58:40,435 --> 00:58:41,502
Mi-na was the sacrifice.

711
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:42,670
And she fled.

712
00:58:42,737 --> 00:58:44,272
Yes, she betrayed them.

713
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:47,709
Maybe not?

714
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:54,282
What if it was a bucket list
or something.

715
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:58,153
Like "kill someone before dying".

716
00:59:00,355 --> 00:59:04,059
That's possible,
kids are crazy these days.

717
00:59:08,797 --> 00:59:10,098
Maybe a YouTuber?

718
00:59:10,865 --> 00:59:12,200
Creator...

719
00:59:20,909 --> 00:59:21,977
Dammit...

720
00:59:34,889 --> 00:59:36,224
- What the...
- Sorry about that.

721
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:53,408
Yong-joon...

722
00:59:53,475 --> 00:59:57,479
Pricks, what the hell went on here?

723
00:59:59,948 --> 01:00:02,484
Captain, there's something
you need to see in the back!

724
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,289
Looks like someone dug this
to bury a body secretly.

725
01:00:09,691 --> 01:00:12,794
All the pieces are falling into place,

726
01:00:12,861 --> 01:00:15,130
don't you think?

727
01:00:18,867 --> 01:00:21,202
Crazy psycho...

728
01:00:23,038 --> 01:00:25,707
They were totally having
a slaughter party!

729
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:30,045
Take it!

730
01:00:34,182 --> 01:00:35,049
Those pricks...

731
01:00:35,116 --> 01:00:36,518
Holy crap!

732
01:00:37,285 --> 01:00:39,320
They're very intelligent psychos.

733
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:41,456
Do not underestimate them.

734
01:00:41,523 --> 01:00:42,523
Sung-bin...

735
01:00:45,293 --> 01:00:46,871
Hey, hey, what was that for?
Please calm down!

736
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:49,097
What took you so long?

737
01:00:49,164 --> 01:00:51,299
The goat went crazy!

738
01:00:51,366 --> 01:00:52,834
Don't give me that nonsense!

739
01:00:52,901 --> 01:00:53,968
Stop it!

740
01:00:54,035 --> 01:00:56,704
Getting worked up
won't solve this case!

741
01:00:57,872 --> 01:00:59,040
I'm the one solving it.

742
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,109
Christ...

743
01:01:01,709 --> 01:01:03,278
Do you know where those pricks are?

744
01:01:04,045 --> 01:01:05,847
I don't know, I passed out.

745
01:01:07,715 --> 01:01:11,052
But I'm certain they've laid traps

746
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:12,820
for us to walk in.

747
01:01:12,887 --> 01:01:13,888
Trap?

748
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:16,291
- Officer Nam.
- Yes?

749
01:01:17,025 --> 01:01:18,726
I'll take a look inside,

750
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:20,995
go back to the car with them.

751
01:01:24,032 --> 01:01:25,032
Let's go.

752
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,203
Goddamn jerks...

753
01:02:00,268 --> 01:02:01,969
When we go to jail,

754
01:02:02,036 --> 01:02:04,072
who's going to feed Bonggu?

755
01:02:04,139 --> 01:02:05,173
Let's turn ourselves in,

756
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,140
and ask them to cut us some slack.

757
01:02:06,207 --> 01:02:09,010
Turn ourselves in for Bonggu?

758
01:02:09,577 --> 01:02:12,814
Then while you talk to the cops,

759
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:14,816
I'll pull out the guy
in the wood chipper.

760
01:02:14,883 --> 01:02:15,650
It'll look disgusting.

761
01:02:15,717 --> 01:02:17,518
Just let it be!

762
01:02:17,585 --> 01:02:18,762
You'll only add more fingerprints

763
01:02:18,786 --> 01:02:21,055
and give them extra evidence!

764
01:02:21,122 --> 01:02:24,926
Covering their tracks...

765
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:27,262
I'll talk to them.

766
01:02:27,962 --> 01:02:29,482
You just stay quietly beside me, okay?

767
01:02:29,998 --> 01:02:30,999
Okay.

768
01:02:31,733 --> 01:02:33,001
Booyah!

769
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:40,808
Don't move, jerks!

770
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:43,011
You psychotic pricks!

771
01:02:43,878 --> 01:02:45,180
What's that?

772
01:02:46,514 --> 01:02:49,083
You goddamn perverts!

773
01:02:49,150 --> 01:02:51,853
I told you not to cause any trouble!

774
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:53,687
Hands up and come out!

775
01:02:56,491 --> 01:02:57,491
Out!

776
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,996
Get out, go on!

777
01:03:05,934 --> 01:03:07,401
Don't move.

778
01:03:07,468 --> 01:03:09,804
Mr. Police, look at
the crime scene calmly...

779
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:12,307
Shut the hell up!

780
01:03:12,674 --> 01:03:13,674
Get down on the floor!

781
01:03:16,444 --> 01:03:17,679
Hands up!

782
01:03:18,213 --> 01:03:20,515
Hands on your hips!

783
01:03:20,949 --> 01:03:23,017
Hands behind your hips!

784
01:03:25,787 --> 01:03:28,723
You thought you could fool Ghost Eyes?

785
01:03:29,857 --> 01:03:32,393
I knew you two were up to no good.

786
01:03:34,262 --> 01:03:35,863
Be careful there!

787
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:37,232
Shut your mo...

788
01:03:43,304 --> 01:03:45,039
You didn't fix the column yet?

789
01:03:55,683 --> 01:03:57,018
You jerks...

790
01:03:57,085 --> 01:04:00,154
You laid... a trap...

791
01:04:01,623 --> 01:04:04,259
Trap... Taid a lrap...

792
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,495
- Stay back!
- Are you okay?

793
01:04:08,963 --> 01:04:10,898
Stop! Stay back!

794
01:04:28,082 --> 01:04:29,250
Captain!

795
01:04:33,087 --> 01:04:35,590
It's a trap, get backup...

796
01:04:38,326 --> 01:04:39,627
Fire! Fire!

797
01:04:41,429 --> 01:04:43,765
This is bad! I'm on fire!

798
01:04:44,565 --> 01:04:47,268
Water! Over here! Help!

799
01:04:51,939 --> 01:04:53,374
Thank you, sir!

800
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:56,277
Bro, out of the way!

801
01:04:56,344 --> 01:04:58,045
Water, water!

802
01:04:58,112 --> 01:04:59,280
It's almost extinguished!

803
01:05:03,117 --> 01:05:04,719
Stay away!

804
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:18,832
Bro...

805
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,601
What happened...

806
01:05:21,469 --> 01:05:22,470
Sang-gu,

807
01:05:23,338 --> 01:05:27,575
didn't I tell you not to put
the thinner in plastic bottles?

808
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:30,011
<i>Paint Thinner
Do Not Drink</i>

809
01:05:33,414 --> 01:05:37,218
You there! You're not dead yet!

810
01:05:38,152 --> 01:05:39,821
You crazy devils!

811
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:42,824
No, I'm not dead yet!

812
01:05:45,993 --> 01:05:47,595
Sang-gu! Run!

813
01:05:47,662 --> 01:05:48,863
Die!

814
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:55,736
Don't get worked up,

815
01:05:55,803 --> 01:05:57,972
let's talk about this!

816
01:05:58,039 --> 01:05:59,974
Shut up, you killers!

817
01:06:05,346 --> 01:06:08,249
Our home's getting destroyed!

818
01:06:08,316 --> 01:06:10,718
So much trouble after saving
a drowning girl!

819
01:06:15,490 --> 01:06:18,492
But we're glad at least
he's not dead, right?

820
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,362
Who the hell cares!
He's about to kill us!

821
01:06:23,197 --> 01:06:25,967
That's Bonggu, right?

822
01:06:29,637 --> 01:06:31,139
Is this your dog?

823
01:06:33,241 --> 01:06:34,942
Give up and come out!

824
01:06:35,476 --> 01:06:38,246
Or this dog gets it!

825
01:06:40,214 --> 01:06:41,214
- Bro!
- What?

826
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:43,484
Those guys kidnapped Bonggu!

827
01:06:45,753 --> 01:06:48,656
Bonggu is innocent!

828
01:06:48,723 --> 01:06:50,825
He's threatening to kill him!

829
01:07:00,668 --> 01:07:02,537
Come on out...

830
01:07:09,911 --> 01:07:11,245
What was that?

831
01:07:15,183 --> 01:07:16,451
Holy crap!

832
01:07:25,293 --> 01:07:26,294
I killed him.

833
01:07:27,895 --> 01:07:29,096
Bonggu!

834
01:07:33,768 --> 01:07:35,102
Bro, now!

835
01:07:52,954 --> 01:07:54,054
- Sang-gu!
- What?

836
01:07:54,121 --> 01:07:55,156
- There!
- You jerk!

837
01:07:58,826 --> 01:08:00,061
How dare you!

838
01:08:01,462 --> 01:08:02,964
Get that prick!

839
01:08:07,969 --> 01:08:10,171
Bro, did you rescue Bonggu?

840
01:08:10,738 --> 01:08:11,939
Sang-gu...

841
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:13,908
Sang...

842
01:08:15,276 --> 01:08:16,477
Sang-gu!

843
01:08:19,146 --> 01:08:20,181
Mi-na!

844
01:08:21,582 --> 01:08:23,751
What's happening here?

845
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:25,319
The thing is...

846
01:08:26,153 --> 01:08:29,657
that guy who was electrocuted,
he's alive!

847
01:08:32,927 --> 01:08:34,495
Jae-pil, where did you go?

848
01:08:35,196 --> 01:08:38,299
Bro! Bonggu!

849
01:08:38,733 --> 01:08:44,605
<i>Gonjiam</i>

850
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:46,774
Oh Lord...

851
01:08:53,814 --> 01:08:54,982
Father!

852
01:08:55,449 --> 01:08:57,151
Child-Murdering Yankee, Go Back Home!

853
01:08:57,218 --> 01:09:00,120
Father Baker, please don't leave!

854
01:09:00,187 --> 01:09:02,189
I'm the one who ruined the exorcism...

855
01:09:02,857 --> 01:09:05,392
When the demon returns,

856
01:09:05,459 --> 01:09:08,763
you will be the only one
capable of stopping him.

857
01:09:09,463 --> 01:09:10,998
God will help you.

858
01:09:11,065 --> 01:09:13,200
Father...

859
01:09:16,203 --> 01:09:18,139
What are you saying?

860
01:09:19,473 --> 01:09:21,876
I don't know English.

861
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:30,717
Father!

862
01:09:31,052 --> 01:09:33,921
Excuse me? Mr. Baker!

863
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:35,823
Please don't leave!

864
01:09:35,890 --> 01:09:37,491
Excuse me?

865
01:09:37,558 --> 01:09:40,494
Hello! Mr. Baker!

866
01:09:41,062 --> 01:09:43,631
Hey!

867
01:09:53,874 --> 01:09:56,577
Book, Father Baker's book!

868
01:09:57,244 --> 01:09:58,813
Over there...

869
01:10:07,922 --> 01:10:10,758
Doctor! Father is awake!

870
01:10:11,759 --> 01:10:15,496
66 years and 6 months later,

871
01:10:15,563 --> 01:10:19,367
5 malignant spirits
will sacrifice a goat,

872
01:10:20,101 --> 01:10:22,536
and open the gates of hell,

873
01:10:22,603 --> 01:10:26,173
and they too will be sacrificed,

874
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,742
and with the help of a fool

875
01:10:28,809 --> 01:10:31,345
who can't distinguish good from evil,

876
01:10:31,412 --> 01:10:36,384
Baphomet will rise
and light the world on fire.

877
01:10:44,258 --> 01:10:46,193
This is for Bo-ra!

878
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:48,262
This is for Yong-joon!

879
01:10:48,329 --> 01:10:50,631
This is for Jason!

880
01:10:51,132 --> 01:10:52,767
Boys...

881
01:10:53,668 --> 01:10:55,970
We really didn't kill them.

882
01:10:57,605 --> 01:10:59,106
Please stop hitting me...

883
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:03,344
I'm going to make you
spit blood and die.

884
01:11:05,613 --> 01:11:06,747
Bro!

885
01:11:07,815 --> 01:11:09,150
Bonggu!

886
01:11:11,786 --> 01:11:12,920
Jae-pil!

887
01:11:19,293 --> 01:11:20,427
Sang-gu!

888
01:11:20,494 --> 01:11:21,929
Sir!

889
01:11:21,996 --> 01:11:24,231
You thought you could mess with me?

890
01:11:24,298 --> 01:11:25,833
Sang-gu...

891
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,701
Sung-bin!

892
01:11:27,768 --> 01:11:30,871
These men aren't what you think.

893
01:11:31,572 --> 01:11:33,207
We misunderstood them.

894
01:11:33,274 --> 01:11:35,576
They're just ordinary people!

895
01:11:35,643 --> 01:11:37,277
You didn't see our dead friends?

896
01:11:37,344 --> 01:11:40,881
But... they didn't kill them,

897
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:44,452
they were all accidents!

898
01:11:44,985 --> 01:11:48,289
It tears me apart
that they were killed...

899
01:11:50,291 --> 01:11:52,359
They all died while looking for me.

900
01:11:52,993 --> 01:11:54,128
Moron...

901
01:11:58,599 --> 01:12:00,434
We didn't come looking for you,

902
01:12:02,169 --> 01:12:04,338
we came back for this.

903
01:12:04,405 --> 01:12:07,875
This is far more important
than a loser like you.

904
01:12:08,809 --> 01:12:09,910
Buddy.

905
01:12:10,511 --> 01:12:12,813
Aren't you being too rude
to your friend?

906
01:12:13,414 --> 01:12:14,515
Friend?

907
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:16,517
Who's friend?

908
01:12:19,754 --> 01:12:22,956
Losers are always so delusional.

909
01:12:23,023 --> 01:12:26,860
That's why you get backstabbed
by your so-called friends.

910
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:28,863
Stupid idiots!

911
01:12:35,936 --> 01:12:39,206
Idiot? You think you're different?

912
01:12:39,273 --> 01:12:42,609
If I leak this, you're the one doomed.

913
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:46,580
Damn you, rising star!

914
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:52,219
Lee Sung-bin, hope you fail!

915
01:12:54,355 --> 01:12:57,625
Did you just get backstabbed?

916
01:13:02,129 --> 01:13:04,031
Goddammit...

917
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:11,872
Ghost, ghost!

918
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:14,975
Ghost! Sung-bin, ghost!

919
01:13:15,042 --> 01:13:16,343
Are you kidding me?

920
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:19,580
Where's my phone?

921
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:21,982
It's the Demonic Goat!

922
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:41,802
Bo-ra?

923
01:13:42,403 --> 01:13:43,403
What? Bo-ra?

924
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,840
That's not Bo-ra, it's a ghost...

925
01:13:46,507 --> 01:13:47,508
Mi-na,

926
01:13:49,343 --> 01:13:50,711
is your friend sick?

927
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:12,366
What's with her?

928
01:14:14,802 --> 01:14:16,503
What's the matter with you?

929
01:14:17,504 --> 01:14:19,273
Miss, what's wrong?

930
01:14:31,218 --> 01:14:32,386
Bo-ra...

931
01:14:38,726 --> 01:14:41,428
Loser!

932
01:14:41,495 --> 01:14:43,997
Are they out of their minds?

933
01:14:44,064 --> 01:14:46,734
Ghost... Demonic Goat!

934
01:14:47,668 --> 01:14:51,004
Bo-ra is haunted by Demonic Goat...

935
01:14:51,071 --> 01:14:54,508
I thought the old fart
was pulling my leg...

936
01:14:55,676 --> 01:14:58,045
I have to get out of here!
I need to go!

937
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,986
Did he just say "ghost"?

938
01:15:07,655 --> 01:15:08,989
I'm not sure...

939
01:15:09,723 --> 01:15:11,225
Forget ghosts!

940
01:15:12,059 --> 01:15:15,095
They got high together,
that's what happened.

941
01:15:15,896 --> 01:15:17,598
Come on, untie me!

942
01:15:17,665 --> 01:15:19,199
Oh yeah! Bro!

943
01:15:30,844 --> 01:15:32,913
Where's the truck key...

944
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:42,923
They claim innocence,

945
01:15:43,524 --> 01:15:45,025
and yet they have a gun?

946
01:15:45,092 --> 01:15:46,427
Bonggu!

947
01:15:48,862 --> 01:15:50,297
Bro, where's Bonggu?

948
01:15:50,898 --> 01:15:52,699
Consider it lucky.

949
01:15:52,766 --> 01:15:54,668
If we were both taken,

950
01:15:54,735 --> 01:15:57,504
he'd have spit blood too.

951
01:15:57,571 --> 01:15:59,072
Don't worry too much.

952
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:01,608
He's smart enough to find his way home.

953
01:16:03,811 --> 01:16:04,578
What is it?

954
01:16:04,645 --> 01:16:08,782
Key! Give me the truck key,
your murderers!

955
01:16:08,849 --> 01:16:11,818
What's with you?
It's all a big misunderstanding!

956
01:16:11,885 --> 01:16:13,253
Shut up!

957
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,756
Just give me the damn key!

958
01:16:15,823 --> 01:16:16,824
Hey.

959
01:16:18,125 --> 01:16:21,962
Get your head together,

960
01:16:23,063 --> 01:16:24,665
you pathetic loser.

961
01:16:24,732 --> 01:16:27,167
Are you so desperate to die?

962
01:16:29,003 --> 01:16:30,304
Key!

963
01:16:30,738 --> 01:16:33,841
Mi-na, give this key to him.

964
01:16:34,475 --> 01:16:35,876
Tell him to get out of our home.

965
01:16:39,947 --> 01:16:41,115
Gents,

966
01:16:43,083 --> 01:16:44,251
I'm really sorry.

967
01:16:48,322 --> 01:16:49,757
Get lost, jerk!

968
01:16:50,224 --> 01:16:53,594
They say idiots stick together.

969
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,068
Byung-jo?

970
01:17:02,102 --> 01:17:03,103
Sung-bin?

971
01:17:09,877 --> 01:17:10,877
Outside.

972
01:17:14,648 --> 01:17:15,648
It's here.

973
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:17,518
What is it now?

974
01:17:18,185 --> 01:17:20,954
What's he yapping about now?

975
01:17:22,056 --> 01:17:24,425
Demonic Goat is here!

976
01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:55,055
You goddamn loser!

977
01:18:02,329 --> 01:18:03,430
Byung-jo...

978
01:18:03,931 --> 01:18:05,265
What's wrong?

979
01:18:09,136 --> 01:18:11,605
He must be haunted by a ghost too...

980
01:18:11,672 --> 01:18:15,109
I don't see any ghosts.

981
01:18:17,578 --> 01:18:18,779
Sung-bin.

982
01:18:21,081 --> 01:18:23,283
He wants you.

983
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:25,285
Get lost!

984
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:28,522
This!

985
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:34,094
This is a $10,000 talisman,
get the hell lost!

986
01:18:34,161 --> 01:18:36,563
A talisman is $10,000?

987
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:37,931
From a really good shaman.

988
01:18:37,998 --> 01:18:40,667
Be gone!

989
01:18:40,734 --> 01:18:42,302
Demonic Goat!

990
01:18:47,007 --> 01:18:48,642
It must be working.

991
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,216
You idiot.

992
01:19:02,055 --> 01:19:04,124
Die, jerk!

993
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:07,894
Die! Die!

994
01:19:07,961 --> 01:19:10,497
What do we do?!

995
01:19:11,732 --> 01:19:14,701
Byung-jo, stop it! Don't do it!

996
01:19:14,768 --> 01:19:16,803
Guys, stop it!

997
01:19:22,643 --> 01:19:24,478
Stop it already!

998
01:19:27,514 --> 01:19:30,250
Sang-gu! Toss him in here!

999
01:19:51,672 --> 01:19:54,774
Sang-gu, I think he's really haunted!

1000
01:19:54,841 --> 01:19:57,678
I told you we should've done a prayer!

1001
01:20:36,516 --> 01:20:38,652
Sung-bin! Sung-bin!

1002
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:39,820
Sung-bin!

1003
01:20:43,023 --> 01:20:44,057
Boys?

1004
01:21:14,621 --> 01:21:16,189
He has awakened.

1005
01:21:18,759 --> 01:21:22,596
Mr. Baker's drawing is mad.

1006
01:21:24,231 --> 01:21:27,334
Sang-gu, let's call a shaman.

1007
01:21:27,401 --> 01:21:30,203
Let's put on a big prayer.

1008
01:21:30,771 --> 01:21:32,406
I don't think that'll be enough.

1009
01:21:32,973 --> 01:21:36,977
Gents, I think it's best
that we get out of here.

1010
01:21:50,891 --> 01:21:52,225
Who are you?

1011
01:21:55,062 --> 01:21:58,031
There are two of you this time?
You vile beasts!

1012
01:22:00,434 --> 01:22:02,869
Release the girl at once!

1013
01:22:02,936 --> 01:22:03,936
Who are you?

1014
01:22:10,444 --> 01:22:13,547
Didn't it sound like
something came out?

1015
01:22:14,948 --> 01:22:15,948
Look over there!

1016
01:22:25,792 --> 01:22:27,494
It's Mi-na's friend, right?

1017
01:22:28,695 --> 01:22:30,163
Sung-bin?

1018
01:22:35,102 --> 01:22:36,837
Yohan...

1019
01:22:38,338 --> 01:22:39,406
Baphomet...

1020
01:22:40,674 --> 01:22:42,709
Return to where you came from.

1021
01:22:42,776 --> 01:22:45,112
Lord has not granted you
a place on earth!

1022
01:22:47,848 --> 01:22:49,616
Shut up!

1023
01:23:16,276 --> 01:23:17,276
My pants...

1024
01:23:19,312 --> 01:23:21,047
I'm sorry, Captain...

1025
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:25,419
So sorry...

1026
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:29,022
In the name of Jesus Christ,

1027
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:30,724
and of Jesus' mother Mary...

1028
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:31,925
Stop it!

1029
01:23:31,992 --> 01:23:33,626
allow us to defend ourselves

1030
01:23:33,693 --> 01:23:34,561
from Satan's temptation and tricks.

1031
01:23:34,628 --> 01:23:37,130
Evil beings will flee in our presence,

1032
01:23:37,197 --> 01:23:39,166
and Baphomet will disappear
from this land!

1033
01:23:44,104 --> 01:23:47,441
Give up and return to hell, Baphomet!

1034
01:23:48,408 --> 01:23:50,410
He must be no ordinary grandpa.

1035
01:23:58,919 --> 01:24:04,291
Growing older has not made you wiser.

1036
01:24:10,363 --> 01:24:13,733
Salt circle comes first

1037
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:16,870
in exorcism, Yohan.

1038
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:20,072
Excuse me...

1039
01:24:22,309 --> 01:24:24,110
Father! Father!

1040
01:24:25,612 --> 01:24:28,415
How are you? Fine, thank you, and you?

1041
01:24:28,482 --> 01:24:29,416
What?

1042
01:24:29,483 --> 01:24:30,950
I am a boy, you are a girl?

1043
01:24:31,017 --> 01:24:32,786
That prick...

1044
01:24:33,286 --> 01:24:38,158
I'll burn you all in hellish fire!

1045
01:24:41,595 --> 01:24:42,896
- Bro.
- Yeah?

1046
01:24:52,606 --> 01:24:56,576
You should die in hellish fire.

1047
01:25:02,148 --> 01:25:06,352
Fire! Captain, I'm so sorry!

1048
01:25:06,419 --> 01:25:09,089
Hurry, go! Go!

1049
01:25:14,594 --> 01:25:16,363
Watch his head.

1050
01:25:19,132 --> 01:25:21,034
- Father, are you okay?
- You okay, old man?

1051
01:25:21,101 --> 01:25:23,270
Bro, look over there.

1052
01:25:32,612 --> 01:25:35,849
My children, rise up!

1053
01:25:57,237 --> 01:25:58,237
What's going on?

1054
01:25:58,672 --> 01:26:01,341
Captain... How...

1055
01:26:11,718 --> 01:26:15,221
Sang-gu, bodies reanimated...

1056
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:19,025
Bro, we could all die.

1057
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:20,260
We should run.

1058
01:26:28,735 --> 01:26:29,769
Sang-gu.

1059
01:26:30,103 --> 01:26:32,138
I'll take on those guys,

1060
01:26:33,173 --> 01:26:35,375
take Mi-na and the old man out of here.

1061
01:26:36,276 --> 01:26:38,912
In the end, this is all my fault.

1062
01:26:40,914 --> 01:26:43,750
It was my idea to live a rustic life,

1063
01:26:45,218 --> 01:26:46,620
and I lured you...

1064
01:26:49,089 --> 01:26:50,924
and poured our savings
into this house...

1065
01:26:53,693 --> 01:26:56,796
without knowing it was haunted...

1066
01:26:59,232 --> 01:27:03,269
I want you to survive this,

1067
01:27:06,139 --> 01:27:07,207
and live a happy

1068
01:27:09,509 --> 01:27:11,277
and fulfilling life...

1069
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,980
Got it?

1070
01:27:16,249 --> 01:27:17,584
Where did he go?

1071
01:27:17,651 --> 01:27:20,220
Bro! Why aren't you coming?

1072
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:22,488
That jerk...

1073
01:27:22,555 --> 01:27:24,357
Behind you! Watch out!

1074
01:27:24,424 --> 01:27:25,424
Jae-pil, watch out!

1075
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:32,065
You evil pricks! Get out of my home!

1076
01:27:37,637 --> 01:27:38,805
Bro!

1077
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:41,608
Sang-gu!

1078
01:27:44,611 --> 01:27:45,611
Mi-na...

1079
01:27:48,114 --> 01:27:51,084
Thank you for being my friend...

1080
01:27:55,188 --> 01:27:56,188
Sang-gu...

1081
01:27:59,759 --> 01:28:00,759
Bro!

1082
01:28:03,630 --> 01:28:04,630
Sang-gu!

1083
01:28:08,368 --> 01:28:09,369
Hang in there!

1084
01:28:10,603 --> 01:28:12,472
Sang-gu! I'm so dead!

1085
01:28:13,306 --> 01:28:14,306
Dude!

1086
01:28:20,513 --> 01:28:22,082
Sang-gu!

1087
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:35,161
Gun...

1088
01:28:36,062 --> 01:28:38,465
You have to find Father Baker's gun...

1089
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:40,233
What?

1090
01:28:40,967 --> 01:28:42,602
It has a silver bullet...

1091
01:28:43,336 --> 01:28:45,872
Only that can destroy the devil...

1092
01:28:46,406 --> 01:28:49,409
Gun? That's...

1093
01:29:07,827 --> 01:29:10,029
Sang-gu!

1094
01:29:34,854 --> 01:29:35,555
Are you okay?

1095
01:29:35,622 --> 01:29:37,157
Why didn't you just leave me?

1096
01:29:37,891 --> 01:29:39,592
Where could I go without you?

1097
01:29:40,593 --> 01:29:48,868
Right, even if I go to hell,
I won't be lonely with you.

1098
01:29:51,204 --> 01:29:52,204
Is that right?

1099
01:29:57,744 --> 01:30:00,747
Sang-gu, he's coming.

1100
01:30:08,922 --> 01:30:12,458
You punk, pay me back for our home!

1101
01:30:15,495 --> 01:30:18,731
Your turn to spit blood!

1102
01:30:31,578 --> 01:30:33,913
That was amazing!

1103
01:30:33,980 --> 01:30:35,415
It totally was!

1104
01:30:39,285 --> 01:30:40,285
Bro!

1105
01:30:41,554 --> 01:30:43,189
How could you?

1106
01:30:43,256 --> 01:30:44,357
You st...

1107
01:30:58,605 --> 01:30:59,606
Gun...

1108
01:31:05,945 --> 01:31:07,013
Dammit!

1109
01:31:10,483 --> 01:31:11,684
It's busted?

1110
01:31:18,725 --> 01:31:21,127
Bonggu! Bonggu!

1111
01:31:21,194 --> 01:31:23,963
Bonggu, where have you been?

1112
01:31:45,318 --> 01:31:47,887
Trashy country hicks.

1113
01:31:49,188 --> 01:31:51,324
Before I send you to hell...

1114
01:31:59,032 --> 01:32:00,033
Crap...

1115
01:32:02,268 --> 01:32:03,403
You have!

1116
01:32:04,170 --> 01:32:05,638
The right to!

1117
01:32:06,673 --> 01:32:07,673
Remai...

1118
01:32:13,780 --> 01:32:15,949
Before I send you to hell,

1119
01:32:17,183 --> 01:32:20,319
I'll tell you the truth

1120
01:32:20,386 --> 01:32:21,586
that only you're oblivious to.

1121
01:32:23,723 --> 01:32:28,328
You two are...

1122
01:32:29,729 --> 01:32:31,531
ugly as hell.

1123
01:32:35,435 --> 01:32:36,469
Lie!

1124
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,272
Bro, that's a lie, right?

1125
01:32:39,806 --> 01:32:44,210
Sang-gu! Do not believe
what the devil tells you!

1126
01:32:44,277 --> 01:32:45,544
Lie!

1127
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:47,513
I don't believe it!

1128
01:32:51,284 --> 01:32:54,587
Time to go to hell!

1129
01:32:54,654 --> 01:32:57,490
If you have to kill, kill me first!

1130
01:32:57,557 --> 01:32:58,925
Put it down!

1131
01:33:00,259 --> 01:33:01,294
Mi-na!

1132
01:33:13,573 --> 01:33:18,878
The one bound to hell
isn't them, but you.

1133
01:33:20,013 --> 01:33:22,515
If you don't want
a silver bullet in your head!

1134
01:33:24,484 --> 01:33:25,852
Put that down.

1135
01:33:48,441 --> 01:33:51,544
You're really scaring me.

1136
01:33:53,846 --> 01:33:56,783
We're friends, right?

1137
01:33:59,052 --> 01:34:01,120
What a load of crap.

1138
01:34:13,132 --> 01:34:16,402
Stupid wench, die!

1139
01:34:27,313 --> 01:34:30,816
Stop laughing,
you're uglier than a goat!

1140
01:34:30,883 --> 01:34:32,418
Pull the trigger!

1141
01:34:38,324 --> 01:34:39,759
Go to hell.

1142
01:35:01,848 --> 01:35:03,149
Mommy!

1143
01:35:08,821 --> 01:35:10,690
What the heck is that?

1144
01:35:43,923 --> 01:35:46,792
Sang-gu, what just appeared
and disappeared?

1145
01:35:48,427 --> 01:35:50,096
It looked like a human hand.

1146
01:35:54,967 --> 01:35:57,236
- Bonggu!
- Bonggu!

1147
01:35:57,970 --> 01:35:59,338
Where were you?

1148
01:36:00,173 --> 01:36:01,741
Bonggu's back!

1149
01:36:03,676 --> 01:36:05,511
Bonggu, are you hurt?

1150
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:09,448
My Lord...

1151
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:22,995
<i>Baphomet will rise</i>

1152
01:36:23,062 --> 01:36:25,564
<i>and light the world on fire</i>

1153
01:36:25,631 --> 01:36:28,100
<i>Lord will send 3 angels</i>

1154
01:36:28,167 --> 01:36:33,706
<i>to fight against Baphomet</i>

1155
01:37:06,472 --> 01:37:08,107
2 suspects accused of killing

1156
01:37:08,174 --> 01:37:11,076
a group of college students

1157
01:37:11,143 --> 01:37:13,612
were released and all charges dropped.

1158
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:15,681
We have the exclusive interview.

1159
01:37:15,748 --> 01:37:18,517
Those students jumped out,

1160
01:37:18,584 --> 01:37:20,419
and just killed themselves.

1161
01:37:20,486 --> 01:37:21,954
One was electrocuted,

1162
01:37:22,021 --> 01:37:24,456
another jumped into our wood chipper.

1163
01:37:24,523 --> 01:37:26,625
And one jumped into this planter,
right into nails...

1164
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:28,093
They all did it to themselves!

1165
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,429
We wanted to help them at first.

1166
01:37:30,496 --> 01:37:33,532
No, not help them commit suicide!

1167
01:37:33,599 --> 01:37:36,435
Why are you pestering us?

1168
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:39,739
We've been investigated
so many times over this!

1169
01:37:40,273 --> 01:37:42,675
My pants burned a bit,

1170
01:37:42,742 --> 01:37:45,344
but they really did save me.

1171
01:37:45,411 --> 01:37:47,155
<i>Officer's Testimony was Crucial
to Their Release</i>

1172
01:37:47,179 --> 01:37:48,179
Captain...

1173
01:37:48,681 --> 01:37:53,953
A dashcam footage
was leaked to social media,

1174
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:56,689
which has sparked
a heated debate online.

1175
01:37:56,756 --> 01:38:01,627
Everyone, I've seen
the devil from hell.

1176
01:38:02,228 --> 01:38:04,230
A hand dropped down from sky...

1177
01:38:04,297 --> 01:38:07,366
Please, always do good things,

1178
01:38:07,433 --> 01:38:09,068
and go to heaven.

1179
01:38:09,135 --> 01:38:11,637
