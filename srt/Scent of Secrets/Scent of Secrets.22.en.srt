1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm going to get medicine from Feng Chen.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,440
Mother.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,400
Feng Chen is not a good person.

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,120
I know.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,240
You think

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,600
I can't really tell you apart?

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
I had hoped

8
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,080
to live out my life in peaceful confusion.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,200
But now it seems

10
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,000
heaven won't grant me that chance.

11
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:46,000
Mother.

12
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,120
You've suffered for these ten years.

13
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,440
I pretended to be foolish only to protect you completely.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,720
The Feng household has always been a den of wolves and tigers.

15
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,240
And Feng Chen is no saint either.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,360
I feared he might plot against you.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,599
I also feared he might lead you astray.

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,840
Feng Chen,

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,080
now I wish I could kill him with my own hands.

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,360
The debt of enmity follows one

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,200
and must eventually be repaid.

22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,240
The most important thing now is to quickly save Yun'er.

23
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,320
I'm afraid Feng Chen will find this place soon.

24
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,160
I worry you can't handle him alone.

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:27,840
Mother,

26
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,080
don't worry.

27
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,920
I will protect you all completely.

28
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,880
It's best to be cautious in everything.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,200
Goods are hated when discarded on the ground, no need to hoard them for oneself.

30
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,320
Strength is hated when not exerted from oneself, no need to use it for selfish purposes.

31
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Therefore, schemes are closed off and do not arise.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,640
Theft and robbery do not occur.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
Thus, outer doors are not locked.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,240
This is called the Great Unity.

35
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,240
Mother,

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,720
why are these

37
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,440
horizontal,

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,160
vertical,

39
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,120
left-falling,

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,720
and right-falling strokes incomplete?

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,520
Yun'er,

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,520
do you remember

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,360
the four methods of character creation I taught you before?

44
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,120
I remember,

45
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,079
pictographs, ideographs, compound ideographs, and phonetic-semantic compounds.

46
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,079
Yun'er, you're so clever.

47
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,880
But remember,

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,800
no matter which method is used,

49
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,000
each character has its own structure.

50
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,520
These alone are not complete enough.

51
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,440
Mother,

52
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,040
there are so many characters.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,000
These characters are so small.

54
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,720
Heaven is clear, Earth is turbid.

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,960
Heaven moves, Earth is still.

56
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,760
Yang is clear, Yin is turbid.

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,320
Yang moves, Yin is still.

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,760
Observe the heart within,

59
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,079
the heart is without a heart.

60
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,600
Observe the form without,

61
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,560
the form is without a form.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,280
Observe objects from afar,

63
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,200
objects are without objects.

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,160
Observing emptiness is also empty.

65
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,160
Emptiness is without emptiness.

66
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,560
That which is empty is already non-existent.

67
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,840
Non-existence is also non-existent.

68
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,320
Non-existence of non-existence is also non-existent.

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,520
Profound and eternally tranquil.

70
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,480
The true constant responds to things.

71
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,720
The true constant attains its nature.

72
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,360
Always respond, always be still.

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,800
Such tranquility.

74
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,560
Gradually entering the true way.

75
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,080
To transform all living beings.

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,720
This is called attaining the Way.

77
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,040
Those who can comprehend it

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,800
can transmit the sacred way.

79
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,480
Yun'er,

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,600
you're finally awake.

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,560
You can't push me away anymore.

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,159
No matter what happens from now on,

83
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:00,480
I won't let you leave my side even for a moment.

84
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,840
You're hugging me too tight.

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,080
I can't breathe.

86
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,520
Okay,

87
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,000
I won't push you away.

88
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,760
Could they be deliberately fabricating lies?

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,080
This paperweight, apart from its uneven bottom,

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,760
has nothing special about it.

91
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,640
Guards!

92
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,040
That's wonderful.

93
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,560
That's wonderful.

94
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:11,600
Mother,

95
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,800
what's so wonderful?

96
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,640
Childhood sweethearts,

97
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,920
a match made in heaven.

98
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,480
I thought you were going to say...

99
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,600
A perfect match indeed.

100
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,480
Yun'er is truly as beautiful as a celestial maiden.

101
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
As for you...

102
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,440
Since Mother dislikes me so much,

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
I'll go wash the dishes.

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,560
I won't bother Mother.

105
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,920
Your mother was as beautiful as you when she was young.

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,640
But what she hated most was how people

107
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,680
only talked about her appearance.

108
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,600
She despised how people

109
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,040
could only see a woman's beauty,

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,720
but failed to see

111
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,320
a woman's intellect and abilities that are no less than a man's.

112
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,320
She often told me

113
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,600
that women can also be concerned about the country and its people.

114
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,560
She said

115
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,440
she would surely accomplish great things.

116
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
My mother has always been a person who never admits defeat.

117
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,040
When she first taught me,

118
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,880
she told me about

119
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,320
a world of great harmony,

120
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,840
where people live in peace,

121
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,520
and the court is just and clear.

122
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,240
Hmm.

123
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,120
It's a pity

124
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,440
that people only remember her

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,280
as the most beautiful woman in the capital,

126
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
but they don't know

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,200
she was also a hero with grand ambitions.

128
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,760
What about you?

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,520
Me?

130
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,440
Well...

131
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,880
My story is worth telling too.

132
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,159
However,

133
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
we'll have plenty of opportunities in the future.

134
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,440
For now,

135
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,800
I'm going to make you a bowl of chicken soup.

136
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,920
Once you've fully recovered,

137
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,400
you'll have the strength to defeat Feng Chen.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,360
Sanxiang Teahouse.

139
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,520
Exchange the bronze paperweight for Hong Guo.

140
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,840
I guess your sister Yun'er

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,200
will come to rescue you with the bronze paperweight.

142
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,760
Bah!

143
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,800
I know

144
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,680
you want to kill me

145
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,160
because I killed your lover.

146
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,360
Benefactor,

147
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,080
sentimental people

148
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,280
all have weaknesses.

149
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,400
Xiao Wei's weakness is you.

150
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,840
He Xiao's weakness is Si Tu Wan Nan.

151
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,600
Mo Ze's weakness is actually Yun'er.

152
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Only beasts like you don't have any.

153
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,640
We do have weaknesses,

154
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,200
but our bones are strong.

155
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,440
Success is built on the bones of many.

156
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
No matter how tough you are,

157
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,160
you're no match for the blades of my Imperial Guard,

158
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,160
or the firearms of the Artillery Camp.

159
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,320
I've already sent someone to deliver the message.

160
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,200
Once I get the other paperweight,

161
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
you can prepare to die

162
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,800
for your weakness.
