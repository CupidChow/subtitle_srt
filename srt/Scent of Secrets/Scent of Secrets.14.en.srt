1
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,360
Yun'er,

2
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,040
how did you find these folding screens?

3
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,200
I gathered information through the teahouse.

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,520
The Xi Shi screen is in the Jia mansion.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
The Diao Chan screen is in the treasury of the Northern Prince's villa.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,680
But the Wang Zhaojun screen,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
why is it in the constabulary?

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,360
The Wang Zhaojun screen

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,840
was originally in the mansion of Minister Cao's son from the Ministry of War.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,120
If we were to involve him,

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,760
it would surely be difficult to resolve.

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,640
So I devised a plan to make him bring it out.

13
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,240
We should really thank Brother Feng for accommodating us.

14
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,720
Then, the Imperial Consort screen at Brother Feng's mansion...

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,920
How did you obtain it?

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,160
Four years ago, I led troops to seal off the mansion of the Minister of Revenue.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,040
I discovered this screen among a pile of stolen goods.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,240
So I ordered it to be hidden without reporting it.

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
thinking that one day,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,400
perhaps it could be used as bait

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,640
to lure Qing Gui out.

22
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,120
Come.

23
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,040
Brother Feng,

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll go get the screen and the lens,

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,120
then I'll come find you at the Feng residence.

26
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,640
Yun'er,

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,520
your gunshot wound hasn't fully healed yet.

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,240
Let me take you back.

29
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
No need.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,960
Yun'er,

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,360
do you remember when we were children?

32
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,200
I don't remember clearly.

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,600
Sir,

34
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:32,960
sir,

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,280
sir,

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,640
according to our spies,

37
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,440
Miss Qing Dai was taken home in a carriage.

38
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,240
A carriage?

39
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,000
Whose carriage?

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,039
I heard it's Lord Feng from the Imperial Guard.

41
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Brother Feng.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,759
Why is it gone?

43
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,400
Could it be her?

44
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,880
Sister Qingdai, is that you? Are you back?

45
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,480
Sister Qingdai.

46
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,440
Is your injury getting any better?

47
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,079
I've been worried about you.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,320
These past few days,

49
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,600
Xiao Wei has been coming to ask me

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,800
about your and Lord Mo's whereabouts.

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,880
Has only Xiao Wei been here?

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,920
Were there no other guests?

53
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,720
With you not at home,

54
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,600
I couldn't manage the Ming He tea and pastries,

55
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,520
so I closed the shop.

56
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,760
If there are any losses in the shop,

57
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
I can compensate for them.

58
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,560
You took my folding screen

59
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,920
to exchange for silver with your benefactor.

60
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,920
Our benefactor is not a bad person.

61
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,640
There must be a misunderstanding.

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,680
Misunderstanding?

63
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,880
A misunderstanding made him burn down the Situ mansion?

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,440
A misunderstanding made him kill my mother?

65
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,760
My biggest mistake was accepting you as my sister.

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,280
Our benefactor must have his reasons that he can't speak of.

67
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,560
Reasons he can't speak of?

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,120
Your benefactor is the Green Ghost Bandit.

69
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,079
Don't you know that?

70
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,440
Qingdai.

71
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,160
Don't call me sister.

72
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,040
I don't have a sister like you.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,680
Hongguo.

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,840
I am Xiao Wei.

75
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,720
Has Qingdai returned?

76
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm no longer your sister.

77
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,640
I've never been here either.

78
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,880
Do you understand?

79
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,200
The other three folding screens were stolen by Qing Gui.

80
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,560
What?

81
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,000
What should we do now?

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
Where is the Guifei screen?

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,800
I see.

84
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,840
So the secret manual of the world-shaking Cuiyan Palm

85
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
is hidden within these Four Beauties screens.

86
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,120
The techniques from the other three sets of screens

87
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,080
I've already memorized.

88
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,120
Do they think

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,480
taking away the screens can stop me?

90
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,080
I suspect the fire at Sanxiang Teahouse before

91
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
was also set by Qing Gui.

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,040
It seems he's been targeting me for a while.

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,880
We need to find a way to lure him out.

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,000
Otherwise,

95
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
he's in the shadows while we're exposed.

96
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,840
We'll never have the upper hand.

97
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Greetings, benefactor.

98
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,159
Any unusual movements?

99
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,920
There's one troubling matter.

100
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,400
Please advise, benefactor.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,720
Sister Qing Dai

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,200
has already

103
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,120
formed an alliance with Feng Chen from the Imperial Guard.

104
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,920
It seems we have no choice but to act.

105
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,840
Can we avoid harming Sister Qing Dai?

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,880
Blue demon.

107
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,760
Give me the folding screen.

108
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
That's not something you should take.

109
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
You've finally shown up.

110
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,880
I can give you the folding screen,

111
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,080
as long as you tell me

112
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,760
where you took Si Tu Wan Nan ten years ago.

113
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,600
The dead are gone, the living go on.

114
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,000
You needn't worry too much.

115
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,120
You killed her.

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,680
Who are you?

117
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,400
How do you know Minghe Sanren's kung fu?

118
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,920
Put down the screen.

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,720
This figure and footwork...

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
why does it seem so familiar?

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,240
Sister.

122
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,400
Sister.

123
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,440
Big brother.

124
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:45,960
A Ze.

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,360
Miss Qing Dai.

126
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,560
What happened to her?

127
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,800
She encountered the Green Ghost on her way home.

128
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,640
She was injured.

129
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,000
The Green Ghost is still in the city.

130
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,360
I'm really not comfortable sending her home.

131
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,800
Can you take care of her for me first?

132
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,080
Don't worry.

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,120
It's just that...

134
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,400
It's now the Hour of the Pig.

135
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
Where are you going?

136
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,360
To catch ghosts.

137
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,080
Benefactor,

138
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,360
how is Sister Qing Dai?

139
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,400
Is she hurt?

140
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't worry.

141
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:29,880
She's fine.

142
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,400
Someone is protecting her.

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:36,919
It's just that...

144
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,760
She knows that Si Tu Wan Nan is dead.

145
