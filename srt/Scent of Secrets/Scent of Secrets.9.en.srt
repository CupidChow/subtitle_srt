1
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,680
This time when I went to the bamboo forest in the western mountains,

2
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,400
the ground was uneven,

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,040
and there were many weeds.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,720
If I had worn a skirt,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,640
I would have been covered in bites.

6
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,640
Moreover,

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,720
if I encountered any trouble,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,360
whether it was fighting or dodging,

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,560
it would have been very inconvenient.

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,320
Theoretically,

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,680
girls from wealthy families never leave their homes,

12
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,640
and only wear skirts.

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,880
As for girls from poor families,

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,440
they have to work in the fields,

15
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,760
so they can only wear pants.

16
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:42,920
Qing Dai,

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,840
you're quite down-to-earth.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,240
If the Situ mansion were still standing,

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,720
perhaps I would only wear skirts.

20
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,760
But now, I do business during the day

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,320
and steal at night.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Who would have thought of living such a life?

23
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,080
Qing Dai,

24
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,480
you're just taking back what rightfully belongs to you.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,760
This isn't stealing.

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,360
We'll see if one day

27
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,039
I can return to my original life.

28
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,800
In that life,

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,960
is General Mo included?

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:19,800
Senior brother,

31
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:20,920
what are you looking at?

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,160
I'm looking to see if there are any ghosts in broad daylight.

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,320
Senior brother,

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,280
I'm afraid you might be suffering from hysteria.

35
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,000
How could there possibly be ghosts in broad daylight?

36
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,160
This Miss Hongguo is being far too forward.

37
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,560
it's only been a few days since we last saw her,

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,039
and she's already taken up with another man.

39
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,479
Junior brother, I fear you might have an eye problem.

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,280
That person's silhouette is clearly Miss Qingdai.

41
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,160
Alright,

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,600
senior brother,

43
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,560
stop looking.

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Our master said

45
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,240
if we lose the Diaochan screen again this time,

46
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,280
we'll both face severe punishment.

47
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
Do you know why I like staying in the firearms unit?

48
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,440
You like the sound of firearms

49
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
and the smell of gunpowder.

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Not entirely.

51
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,479
I prefer having a clear target.

52
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,080
A hit is a hit,

53
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
a miss is a miss.

54
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,680
Once you've fired, there's no room for regret.

55
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,680
Senior brother, why don't we bring firearms this time,

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
just in case?

57
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,160
I'm going to pursue a girl,

58
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,600
not to capture bandits.

59
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,120
Senior brother, you want to...

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,920
I want to make one last attempt.

61
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,280
Another year, another Beginning of Autumn.

62
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,960
Your daughter has come to see you.

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,840
It really is Sister Yun'er.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,880
Do you remember

65
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,560
the courtyard where we used to catch cicadas at home?

66
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,080
But now, it has turned into ruins.

67
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,520
I've never been able to dye the sky-water blue again.

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,720
All these years,

69
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,040
I've often dreamed of you.

70
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,760
But in my dreams,

71
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,480
you've never spoken to me.

72
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,040
Rest assured,

73
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,320
I will definitely find the mastermind behind this.

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,320
I'll uncover the truth of what happened back then

75
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,200
and avenge you.

76
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,079
Who's there?

77
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,560
Help! Someone!

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
Help! Save me!

79
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,800
Help! Someone!

80
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,920
Stop yelling.

81
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,840
We're in the middle of nowhere.

82
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,640
No one's coming to save you.

83
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
If it's money you want, I can go get it for you.

84
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,920
Help! Save me!

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,720
What if we want to ravish you instead?

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,360
Come on, men!

87
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:58,680
Come on!

88
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,760
Take this woman back for me.

89
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,440
Help! Save me!

90
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,320
Go!

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,400
Listen, buddy,

92
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,720
you'd better scram.

93
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
Even heroes need weapons to save damsels in distress.

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,640
How dare you!

95
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,920
I used to hurt people every time I acted.

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
later, I learned to use my brain instead.

97
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,920
The firearm is my weapon of choice.

98
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,000
because it can be controlled.

99
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,880
If you harm her today,

100
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,880
don't blame me for what happens.

101
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,960
Thank you, Lord Mo.

102
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,440
Are you hurt?

103
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,120
It's just a flesh wound.

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,920
it's nothing.

105
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,159
but you,

106
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,720
you need to go back and treat your wounds quickly.

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,000
Qing Dai,

108
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:04,880
sister.

109
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,600
Yun'er.

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,720
Um...

111
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,040
Lord Mo.

112
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,400
You go first.

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,520
Why did you follow me today, Lord Mo?

114
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,880
I wanted to confirm your identity.

115
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,000
Well,

116
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
have you confirmed it?

117
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,159
I have.

118
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,120
Put me down.

119
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,920
No matter what you've confirmed,

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,800
or what you might have suspected,

121
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,120
I won't admit to anything.

122
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,680
It's alright.

123
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,760
I know you must have your reasons that are difficult to explain.

124
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,960
I want to tell you,

125
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
no matter what happens,

126
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,560
I'm on your side.

127
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,840
Right or wrong?

128
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,960
I believe in you.

129
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,640
For the rest of the way,

130
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,920
I'll walk back by myself.

131
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,680
I can carry you home.

132
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,360
Thank you,

133
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,880
but that won't be necessary.

134
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,880
Yun'er, why are you back so late?

135
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,320
Why are you sleeping here?

136
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,880
what's going on?

137
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,680
why are you injured again?

138
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,280
I encountered a few suspicious men in black.

139
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,720
Mo Ze was there,

140
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,280
so I didn't intervene.

141
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,680
He saved me.

142
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,560
Oh.

143
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,880
I didn't expect he'd be so capable.

144
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,880
Why are you dressed like this?

145
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,840
Oh,

146
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,600
I was planning to set fire to the police station

147
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,960
and then retrieve the Diao Chan screen during the chaos.

148
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,440
Where's this smoke coming from?

149
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,000
I didn't start any fire!

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,440
Quick, come put out the fire!

151
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,440
Hurry, find someone to put out the fire!

152
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,480
The Sanxiang Teahouse is on fire!

153
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,440
Hurry, go put out the fire!

154
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,320
Senior,

155
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
quickly bring people to put out the fire!

156
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,480
The Sanxiang Teahouse is on fire.

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,600
Could this be their scheme?

158
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,440
I just escorted Boss Qing Dai back to the teahouse.

159
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,600
The fire definitely wasn't set by them.

160
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,320
Okay.

161
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:48,920
Let's go.

162
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:49,600
Yes.

163
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
Why are you so foolish?

164
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,320
Which is more important, possessions or lives?

165
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,679
without these tools to make a living,

166
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,200
how can I run the teahouse?

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
It's my livelihood!

168
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,240
You still have me.

169
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,400
We can rebuild.

170
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,600
But no matter how we rebuild,

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
it can never be restored to its original state.
