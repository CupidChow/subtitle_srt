1
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,520
Reporting to the two officials,

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,440
The rebel Feng Chen was shot in the abdomen,

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,960
but his life is not in danger.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,440
As for his Nightmare Palm technique,

5
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,080
it has been treated by Miss Qing Dai.

6
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
He has now been imprisoned in the imperial dungeon

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,960
awaiting interrogation.

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,720
Good.

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,840
The case of the Blue Demon has been solved.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,920
Commander Mo,

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,280
you've put righteousness above family ties.

12
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,920
You deserve the highest merit.

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,200
Thanks to Commander Mo for sending me the message.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,040
I had long suspected there was something wrong with Feng Chen,

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,400
but I never imagined

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,400
he would try to control all court officials with his demonic palm technique.

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
It's even more despicable than the Blue Demon thief from years ago.

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
Both of you, sirs, have a profound sense of justice.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,080
My master and junior brother

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,240
in the underworld

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,480
should be able to rest in peace now.

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,720
Tomorrow,

23
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,320
I will report to the imperial court

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,680
to exonerate General He

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,200
and clear his name.

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,800
I will also recommend you, Commander Mo, for a commendation.

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
You will take over General He's position as the commander-in-chief.

28
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,600
Not only should we commend Commander Mo,

29
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,800
but also Commander Xiao and Miss Qing Dai.

30
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,640
She is my lifesaver, after all.

31
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,000
Thank you both, sirs.

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,640
Oh, by the way,

33
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,760
where is Miss Qing Dai now?

34
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,000
Thank you, Sister Yunr.

35
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,800
It's been so long since I've had this lotus tea.

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,680
This matter has come to an end.

37
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,880
What are your plans for the future?

38
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,760
Sister Yunr, do you want me to leave?

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,120
Sit down.

40
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
I want to leave this place of right and wrong.

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,600
But hasn't everything been settled?

42
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,560
Feng Chen has been brought to justice.

43
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,560
The truth has come to light.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,880
You and Brother Mo

45
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,600
have also become a couple.

46
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,160
If I stay here,

47
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,600
I can only be the owner of Sanxiang Teahouse.

48
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,120
Qing Dai.

49
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
But I want to be Yunr again.

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,640
No matter who you are,

51
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:38,960
from now on,

52
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,240
I'll still be your little sister, Hong Guo.

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,680
Is that okay?

54
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:43,960
No matter where you go,

55
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,680
as long as you and Brother Mo

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,160
don't mind me tagging along.

57
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,720
Uncle He,

58
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,360
I am Qing Dai.

59
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,840
I buried you next to my mother.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,600
You two, master and disciple,

61
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
can now reunite in the afterlife.

62
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,640
Rest assured,

63
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,240
I have mastered the hundred-word mantra of the Nightmare-Crushing Palm,

64
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,720
and destroyed the Four Beauties Screen.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,760
No one will ever use it again.

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,320
Master,

67
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,640
I am Mo Ze.

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,600
I have resigned from my position in the patrol unit,

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,200
and I didn't take over the firearms unit.

70
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,000
Please forgive me.

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,680
There are more suitable candidates now.

72
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,240
I just want to go to a new place with Yun'er,

73
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,640
and start a new life.

74
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,880
Benefactor,

75
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,600
I am Hong Guo.

76
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,880
I will come to see you every Qingming Festival.

77
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,120
I won't be wandering anymore.

78
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,640
I have a family now too.

79
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,480
The life-saving kindness you showed me years ago,

80
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
I will always remember in my heart.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,159
Xiao Wei,

82
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,280
you must be watching me from somewhere, right?

83
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,680
Thank you, Xiao Wei.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,240
It was you who made me understand

85
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
what it feels like to be loved.

86
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,040
From now on, I will live well with this love.

87
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,480
Oh, right.

88
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,000
If you run short of money over there,

89
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,040
you must come to me in a dream.

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,800
I won't be stingy with you, I promise.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,880
They have gone ahead of us,

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,040
so we should also look forward.

93
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,680
Let's go for a drink.

94
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,640
You young people go by yourselves.

95
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,040
As for me,

96
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,840
I need to go home and try the lotus tea

97
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
that my daughter-in-law gave me.

98
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,920
What about the wine?

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,520
Yun'er can't drink alcohol.

100
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,120
Oh, oh, oh,

101
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,160
now you're calling her Yun'er directly.

102
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,760
Let's make an exception today.

103
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,920
I've had someone deliver some wine.

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,920
The wine is here.

105
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,840
This is yours.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,840
Two jars in total.

107
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:32,560
Thank you.

108
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,920
The wine is here.

109
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,800
Give it to me.

110
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,360
Where do we plan to go next?

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Let's go to Jiangnan.

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,280
I've never been there.

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,440
We can go boating on the lake,

114
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,880
and fish from the bridge.

115
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
Or maybe Saibei,

116
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,920
galloping on horseback,

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,560
free and unrestrained.

118
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,280
Come on,

119
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,720
cheers!

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,600
Cheers!

121
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:21,560
How many children do you two plan to have?

122
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,960
Maybe two,

123
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,840
a boy and a girl.

124
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,680
We'll choose good names for them.

125
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,280
That's not for you to decide.

126
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,760
Whether to have children or not,

127
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,440
and how many to have,

128
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,240
I'll be the one to decide.

129
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:44,680
Linghua.

130
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,080
Those eating snacks, drink.

131
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,320
Those swaying, drink.

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,600
Hit.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,320
You two, drink.

134
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,080
Come on.

135
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,840
It's my turn.

136
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Wangchun.

137
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Those facing east, drink.

138
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm now taking over the Imperial Guard.

139
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,559
If you could pass on the Crushing Nightmare Palm technique to me.

140
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,559
I promise to spare your life.
