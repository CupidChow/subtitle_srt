1
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,760
Senior Brother,

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,400
take it.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,280
Senior Brother,

4
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,800
come.

5
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:30,680
come.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,320
go.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,080
Senior Brother,

8
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,240
go.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,480
The patrol officers are coming soon.

10
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,880
We can't waste time here.

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,680
The person I'm waiting for hasn't arrived yet.

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,320
I know you're waiting for your benefactor.

13
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,120
But he really didn't harm Miss Situ.

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,280
The truth from ten years ago

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,080
is not what you think.

16
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:05,160
Then tell me,

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,560
what exactly happened ten years ago?

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,360
You should go.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,080
This matter doesn't concern you.

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,200
Sister Yun'er,

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,600
go.

22
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm no longer your sister.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:48,840
Your Excellency,

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,680
news has arrived.

25
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
The bronze paperweight from the Imperial Guard has been stolen.

26
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,640
Is there any word on the thieves?

27
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,280
Commander Feng says

28
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,080
it was done by people from the Sanxiang Teahouse.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,200
Alright,

30
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,520
I understand.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,480
You may go.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,040
Yes, sir.

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,160
How are you?

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,120
Are you hurt?

35
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,720
I heard from Brother Feng that you went to catch Qing Gui.

36
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,440
I was worried about you.

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,600
Xiao Wei will be here with people in no time.

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,000
Why aren't you resting at the Feng mansion?

39
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Why did you steal this paperweight that has nothing to do with you?

40
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,640
This paperweight looks very similar to the one in my mother's study.

41
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,560
That night when Qing Gui broke into the Feng mansion,

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
it was to steal this.

43
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,480
How can you say it has nothing to do with me?

44
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,320
The dead are gone.

45
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
The Situ mansion is now in ruins.

46
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,640
Do you want to spend your whole life consumed by hatred?

47
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
I thought you understood me.

48
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,360
Yun'er,

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,560
let's look forward together.

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,400
Forget about Qing Gui.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Let's go to a new place

52
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,480
and build a new home together, okay?

53
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,640
If I were just Qing Dai,

54
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,040
perhaps I could run away with you.

55
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,200
But I have always been Situ Wannan's daughter.

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,160
All these years, I've been searching for Qing Gui.

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,640
Now he has finally appeared.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,960
We're about to catch him.

59
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,640
I can't possibly give up now.

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,240
What about for me?

61
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,079
Mo Ze,

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,840
As long as we can catch the Blue Ghost,

63
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
we can avenge my mother

64
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,000
and your father.

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
We can uncover all the truth from back then.

66
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,960
Why are you asking me such questions

67
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,080
at such a crucial moment?

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,120
What if the truth isn't what you think it is?

69
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,760
Then tell me, what is the truth?

70
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,560
You can still leave now,

71
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,640
otherwise you'll have no chance once the patrol officers come in.

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,440
I almost forgot,

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you're also from the patrol.

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,440
Since you consider me a colonel from the patrol,

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,680
then you must be the person we're after.

76
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,800
Hand over the paperweight now

77
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
and surrender.

78
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,320
I'll notify Xiao Wei immediately

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,480
to ensure you're treated with respect.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,680
Go in and take a look.

81
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,640
If there's anything unusual,

82
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,880
report to me immediately.

83
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,960
Go.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,000
We've been friends,

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,880
let's not ruin our relationship.

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,080
Although my surname is Mo,

87
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,840
I'm actually the second young master of the Feng family in the south of the city.

88
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
My family is well-off,

89
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,560
and I hold a salaried position in the government office.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,400
Though I may not be as handsome as Pan An,

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,720
I'm still a decent-looking gentleman.

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,920
If I catch the Blue Ghost

93
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
and avenge your family,

94
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,280
would you marry me?

95
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,480
I'm fond of you,

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
not because you resemble someone else,

97
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,159
but simply because I like you.

98
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,680
Only in long illness do you know who truly loves you,

99
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,840
and only when deeply drunk do you know whom you love.

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,480
What I owe you

101
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,480
might not be repaid even in the next life.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,920
We've been good friends.

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,320
If I don't catch the Blue Ghost,

104
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,960
our previous engagement will be null and void.

105
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,040
You're only guilty of theft.

106
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
If you return everything,

107
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,560
I can treat it as if you've turned yourself in.

108
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,200
Then it'll be either flogging or exile.

109
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,080
At least you can keep your life.

110
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,960
Go to the Imperial Guard and inform Lord Feng.

111
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,560
Hmm.

112
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,159
Yes.

113
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,000
I live solely to catch the Green Ghost.

114
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,400
otherwise, ten years ago,

115
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,640
I would have followed my mother.

116
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,040
Since Lord Mo insists on handling this officially,

117
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,200
I won't shamelessly cling on.

118
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,400
If I wanted to leave,

119
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
you absolutely couldn't catch me.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
If I choose to stay,

121
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,800
without your firearm,

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,120
you're no match for me either.

123
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,880
My Lord, General He has entered the teahouse.

124
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,159
Are you here for tea or on official business, sir?

125
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,840
if it's for tea,

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,520
I'm afraid

127
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,240
we're closed today due to personal matters.

128
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,960
Please come back another day, sir.

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,760
You must be the owner of this teahouse,

130
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Miss Qing Dai, correct?

131
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,080
I am He Xiao, the Superintendent of the Artillery Camp.

132
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,280
We were supposed to meet at your wedding with my apprentice,

133
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,120
but I didn't expect it to be here.

134
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,320
This humble one pays her respects to General He.

135
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,320
General He must be joking.

136
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,280
I have no relationship with Master Mo.

137
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,600
That's even better.

138
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,080
Hand over the bronze paperweight.

139
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,520
I can negotiate with the commander of the Imperial Guard.

140
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
I'll spare your life.

141
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
I didn't expect

142
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,480
General He, who usually plays with swords and spears,

143
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,640
would be so interested in items

144
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,720
from a scholar's study.

145
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,640
This thing,

146
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,240
it's a treasure in his study,

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,200
but in your hands, it's stolen goods.
