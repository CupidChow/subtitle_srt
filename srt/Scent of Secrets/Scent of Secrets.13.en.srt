1
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,440
Trap.

2
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,800
Feng Chen.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,320
He's the commander of the Imperial Guard.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,080
His power is not below mine.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,960
The Blue Ghost managed to escape unscathed.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,800
Don't you have any suspicions at all?

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,240
Even alerted the Artillery Camp.

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,160
No wonder the Blue Ghost looked

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,320
as if he was prepared.

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,200
You've already ruined my plans.

11
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,120
Don't cause me any more trouble.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,880
No wonder.

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,520
Feng Chen scolded me harshly.

14
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,080
He said I ruined his plans.

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,040
Alright.

16
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,400
Where's Moze?

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,440
Is he hanging out at the teahouse again?

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,960
Senior Brother,

19
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,720
Senior Brother, he...

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,560
He's been kidnapped by the Blue Demon.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,400
What's going on now?

22
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,480
Master, please calm down.

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,200
I'll investigate right away.

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,960
I'll definitely give you an answer tomorrow, Master.

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,840
Master, Madam.

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,120
We've arrived.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,280
Come, take it slow.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,760
Why does this form of address feel so awkward?

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,600
I feel like I've aged a few more years.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's get used to it first.

31
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,720
When we get married later,

32
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,120
you'll hear it even more.

33
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,759
Who said I'm marrying you?

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,080
But we've already been intimate.

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
You're mine for this lifetime.

36
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,240
You still want to escape?

37
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,680
At that moment,

38
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,200
I just felt that kiss was appropriate.

39
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,479
if you think when a man kisses a woman,

40
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,560
the woman must marry him,

41
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,640
how cheap would that make women?

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,160
I've never thought you were cheap.

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,560
Then how can I get you to marry me?

44
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,480
Don't we have a bet?

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,160
Let's talk about it after you catch the Green Ghost Thief.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,400
Yun'er,

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,400
It really hasn't changed at all.

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,840
Mother,

49
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,560
I'm back.

50
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,200
Young Master Chen is back.

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,600
Come.

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,760
Come in and have a seat.

53
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,320
Mother,

54
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,600
I am Aze.

55
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,480
Young Master Chen is joking with me again.

56
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
My Aze is only this tall.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,200
Aunt Mo,

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
Wan Nan,

59
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,400
it's been so many years since we last met.

60
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,079
why did you come without notice?

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,320
Come in and have a seat.

62
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,960
come on, come on.

63
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,960
let's go inside, I'll make you some tea.

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,000
Please, come in.

65
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,760
What happened to Aunt Mo?

66
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,040
Dementia.

67
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,880
It's been almost ten years now.

68
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Back then, my father was harmed by the Blue Ghost.

69
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,080
My mother became depressed due to excessive grief.

70
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,480
And I was adopted by my master into the Firearms Camp.

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,440
I didn't have time to accompany her.

72
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,160
Over time, she became like this.

73
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,360
Young Master Chen,

74
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,280
Wannan, please have some tea.

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,079
This tea,

76
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,320
is still the Longjing tea picked before the rain,

77
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,520
that Young Master Chen brought back last time.

78
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,640
Does Young Master Chen come here often?

79
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
As long as my elder brother is in the capital,

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,520
he comes back once a month.

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
It's really good tea.

82
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
Thank you, Aunt Mo.

83
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,720
We haven't seen each other for over ten years,

84
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,960
why have you become so distant with me?

85
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,720
Wannan.

86
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,720
Mother,

87
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,280
Miss Wannan is not feeling well.

88
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll take her back to her room to rest first.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
Aze,

90
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,360
you found Yun'er?

91
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,040
Who was the other Blue Ghost yesterday?

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,960
Why did Qingdai save him?

93
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,560
Where could they possibly escape to?

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,080
Counting money is still easier.

95
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:49,920
Lord Xiao,

96
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
why are you haunting me?

97
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
Where on earth did they go?

98
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,960
They eloped, okay?

99
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,000
Eloped?

100
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,560
They went to Concubine Mo's small courtyard in the western suburbs.

101
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,920
I was just talking nonsense.

102
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,200
Besides,

103
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,280
they

104
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,200
haven't reached the stage of meeting parents, have they?

105
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm not joking with you.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Our master is really angry.

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,040
The consequences will be severe.

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,720
Your master isn't my master.

109
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,080
So what if he's angry?

110
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,280
What's it got to do with me?

111
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,000
Fine.

112
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,720
Then give me five orders of osmanthus cakes.

113
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
To go, please.

114
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Now it does concern you.

115
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,960
I'm sorry.

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,880
The boss isn't here.

117
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,080
We really don't have any.

118
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,360
This is the most peaceful and free day I've had in ten years.

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,520
This is also the happiest day I've had in ten years.

120
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,640
Sister Yun'er,

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,440
You're still the same as when you were little,

122
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,440
always imitating the way I speak.

123
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,200
I'm telling the truth.

124
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,000
For the past ten years,

125
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,520
I've either been practicing martial arts

126
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,280
or training with firearms.

127
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,320
Whenever I had the chance,

128
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,400
I was searching for the Situ family.

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
I believe you.

130
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,360
So all these years,

131
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,600
how did you manage?

132
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
All these years,

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,360
I've been wandering around.

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,320
Until I met Hong Guo.

135
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,680
We opened the Sanxiang Tea House together.

136
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
Does she know your identity?

137
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,400
She does.

138
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,560
She's the daughter of the Situ family's housekeeper.

139
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,720
She's the one Qing Gui saved back then.

140
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,080
Then isn't she by your side...

141
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,560
I trust her.

142
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,920
These years, with her companionship,

143
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,000
I've been especially happy being Qing Dai.

144
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:48,640
Do you...

145
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,360
mind that my identity is Qing Dai?

146
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,120
No matter who you are,

147
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,600
you'll always be my sister Yun'er.

148
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,280
Sister Qingdai.

149
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,600
Young Master Chen is here to see you.

150
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,640
Aunt.

151
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,920
Young Master Chen is still sleeping inside.

152
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,680
It's Mo Ze inside.

153
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,600
A fleeting dream of Wushan, lost souls can't return home.

154
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,120
A ghost-slaying sword still gleams cold.

155
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,080
A Ze is a child who understands both reason and people.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,920
I hope you won't let him down.

157
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,640
Aunt.

158
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
Rest assured.

159
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,400
I will never let Mo Ze down in this lifetime.

160
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,880
But there are some things

161
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,760
I have to do.
