1
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,280
Brother Feng has been so helpful to our teahouse.

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,320
I wonder if there's anything we can do to help?

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,160
Indeed, there is one favor I'd like to ask.

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,360
Since Qing Gui has already set his sights on this place,

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,520
I would trouble Miss Qing Dai

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,480
to help me deliver a message.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,360
Tell him that the last Guifei screen

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,560
is with me, Feng.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,400
At that time, I will be alone

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,400
at the Feng residence,

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,440
waiting for his arrival.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,240
Brother,

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,640
I want to go too.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,880
You're going back to the patrol camp tonight.

15
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,960
Stay put and behave yourself.

16
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,600
When I catch the Green Ghost,

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,000
I'll make sure you get credit for it too.

18
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,240
I know

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,120
about the bet between you two.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,840
Senior,

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,720
I've already notified the patrol camp and the firearms camp.

22
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,920
If the Blue Demon dares to come,

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,000
make sure he never leaves alive.

24
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,720
You go ahead first.

25
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,000
Wait for me for the time it takes an incense stick to burn.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,640
Understood.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,840
Senior,

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,800
you look a bit nervous.

29
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,360
Haven't we already confirmed

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,800
that Miss Qing Dai isn't the Blue Demon?

31
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,480
I'm afraid the Blue Demon might harm her again.

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,440
Do you really think

33
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,760
that Feng Chen is alone at home?

34
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Aren't you afraid that the Imperial Guard might be setting a trap?

35
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm more afraid of missing that newly emerged Green Demon.

36
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,200
Then why not let me go find our benefactor?

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,320
We don't know if it's real or fake yet,

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,320
friend or foe.

39
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,840
It's too dangerous.

40
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:46,880
Oh, right.

41
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,120
What about the Green Demon mask we brought back from the auction house?

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,640
It's in the evidence room.

43
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,880
Why are you asking about this, senior?

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,600
Big brother wants to draw the snake out of its hole.

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,440
I need to lend him a hand.

46
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,000
Young Master Feng has gone to great lengths with his arrangements.

47
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
there are no traps set,

48
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,440
nor any executioners present.

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,840
I must admit, I'm a bit puzzled.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,760
I hear you have three of the Four Beauties screens.

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,080
Only the Guifei screen is missing.

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:05,800
I, Feng,

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,520
have come to present you with a treasure.

54
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,720
Young Master Feng, you're truly sincere.

55
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,960
The Blue Ghost Thief must be very familiar

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,280
with the Four Beauties screens.

57
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,520
Surely you can identify

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,600
which one is genuine.

59
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,360
What if I choose incorrectly?

60
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,280
Then you won't be able to leave.

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,440
Thank you, Young Master Feng.

62
00:03:59,160 --> 00:03:59,800
Please wait, esteemed hero.

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,160
What is it?

64
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,800
Has Young Master Feng changed his mind?

65
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,360
I wouldn't dare, your honor.

66
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,760
It's just that...

67
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,560
I have another treasure from the Situ family

68
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,080
that I'd like to invite you to appreciate together.

69
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,760
I've seen your mother a few times at Aunt Mo's house before.

70
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,040
Her beauty was unforgettable.

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,240
Yun'er.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,520
I heard about the Situ family long ago.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,960
After that big fire,

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
no one survived.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,800
So when I saw you at the teahouse,

76
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,159
I was in a daze.

77
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,200
But then I heard you had a bet with Mo Ze.

78
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,480
I knew you were just like me,

79
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,360
seeking revenge for your family by finding the Green Ghost bandit.

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,280
Brother Feng,

81
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,320
do you have confidence in defeating the Green Ghost's Nightmare Palm?

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,440
As long as I can catch the Green Demon Thief,

83
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
I don't care if I lose my life.

84
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,760
I wonder if Yun'er has any method to counter it.

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:16,560
Now, these four screens are in our hands.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,680
I have also discovered the secret within them.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,360
It's worth a try.

88
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,400
What have you done to my brother?

89
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,880
You're not the Green Demon.

90
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,560
Mo Ze.

91
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,560
Who are you?

92
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,680
Don't move.

93
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,560
How come it's you?

94
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,680
I'll tell you when we get back.

95
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,800
Surround them.

96
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,720
Why are there two Green Ghosts?

97
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,480
Nobody move.

98
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,040
Who's there?

99
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,800
Who fired the shot?

100
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,520
It's the real Green Ghost.

101
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Surrender immediately.

102
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,320
Hand over the screen.

103
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:08,840
If you dare,

104
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,480
come and get it.

105
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,600
After them!

106
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,240
Quick, chase them!

107
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,800
Chase!

108
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,360
Yes.

109
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:34,760
Hold on.

110
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,080
Last time, you took a military beating for me.

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
This time, we're even.

112
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,640
What I owe you

113
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,880
I might not be able to repay even in the next life.

114
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,640
Though love is said to be the best medicine,

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,960
gunshot wounds still need actual medicine.

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,200
Bear with it a little longer.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,360
Xiao Wei will surely bring people to search.

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,720
After you've rested a bit,

119
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,960
we'll have to leave.

120
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,840
If he dares to come,

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
I certainly won't be nice to him.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,040
The more we act like this,

123
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
aren't we just drawing attention to ourselves?

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,880
Where are you planning to go?

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,800
My mother has a courtyard in the western suburbs.

126
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,800
Except for my elder brother and Xiao Wei,

127
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,520
No one knows.

128
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,360
The Blue Demon case is already being investigated by the Imperial Guard.

129
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,800
Didn't Mo Ze tell you?

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,880
My senior is still recovering from his injuries.

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,480
I didn't expect the Blue Demon would escape either.

132
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,200
Before coming here,

133
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:16,960
I borrowed a fire squad

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,000
from my master.

135
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,600
So you even alerted the Firearms Battalion.

136
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,160
Too many people involved, too much gossip.

137
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,600
No wonder the Blue Demon seemed

138
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,680
like he was prepared in advance.

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,080
Brother Feng, I know I made a mistake.

140
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,400
But I just wanted to

141
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,000
help you get revenge.

142
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,720
Oh, right,

143
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,559
the Blue Demon was shot this time.

144
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,440
He couldn't have gone far.

145
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
I'll lead a team to chase him now.

146
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,159
You've already ruined my plans.

147
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,240
Don't cause any more trouble for me.

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,720
Master,

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,760
You had the entire Firearms Battalion at your disposal,

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,000
and you couldn't even catch one person.

151
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,360
You've really made me proud, haven't you?

152
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,440
Your disciple is incompetent.

153
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,840
But the Blue Demon was shot,

154
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,160
and I returned the screen to Brother Feng.

155
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,360
So you're saying I should reward you,

156
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,000
is that right?

157
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,640
I wouldn't dare, Master.

158
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,800
Didn't you realize that the Feng mansion was a trap?

159
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,760
A trap?
