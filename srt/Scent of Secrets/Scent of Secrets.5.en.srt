1
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,240
The pain of losing one's entire family

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,800
is soul-crushing and heart-wrenching.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,720
Day and night, I long to kill Qing Gui with my own hands.

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,520
If I catch Qing Gui,

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,720
what will you do?

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,640
If you can catch Qing Gui,

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,080
I'll do whatever you say.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,000
Alright.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:39,760
Miss Qing Dai,

10
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,720
although my surname is Mo,

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,440
I am actually the second young master of the Feng family in the south of the city.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,360
My family is well-off,

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,720
and I hold a salaried official position in the government office.

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,120
Though I may not be as handsome as Pan An,

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,280
I am still a presentable young man.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
If I catch Qing Gui

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,200
and avenge your family,

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,280
would you marry me?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
Although I am just a woman,

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,840
the man I marry must be honest and upright.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,920
I also refuse to be anyone's substitute.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,960
You're not a substitute.

23
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,960
You are you.

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,000
Alright.

25
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,800
Then I'll wait for your good news, Lord Mo.

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,520
I wonder if Miss Qing Dai has time tomorrow?

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,000
What instructions do you have, Lord Mo?

28
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,800
I want to make amends for offending Boss Qing Dai today.

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,200
As for tomorrow's matters,

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,200
let's discuss them tomorrow.

31
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,440
Then it's settled.

32
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,840
Little Mo Ze.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,320
Don't blame me.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
Your Honor,

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
At Sanxiang Teahouse, both women denied any connection to Qing Gui.

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,440
Master Mo and the owner of Sanxiang Teahouse

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,400
made a bet with marriage as the stake.

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,360
I see.

39
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,320
Continue the investigation.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,920
Yes, sir.

41
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,360
The bet

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,560
is marriage.

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,680
Sister Qing Dai,

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,800
you're not really going to agree to him, are you?

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,640
so you're just going to

46
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,880
commit to a lifelong marriage so easily?

47
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
It's also a temporary measure.

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,040
If

49
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,960
he can really make the Green Ghost Bandit appear,

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,360
or rather, your Green Ghost Hero,

51
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,520
won't you be able to see your benefactor?

52
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,800
This Lord Mo has a prosperous official career,

53
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,000
and his financial luck is not bad either.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,600
He might be a suitable husband.

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,600
However,

56
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,960
why does he always think you're Sister Yun'er?

57
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,960
Do you think I'm her?

58
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,600
Whether you are her or not,

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,880
you're my sister Qingdai now.

60
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,160
The latest intelligence,

61
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,680
the Zhaojun Screen

62
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,000
is in the shop at the Northern Prince's villa.

63
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,560
I can't protect it alone.

64
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,720
Those mechanical incenses you invented

65
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,080
will rust and become ineffective if not used soon.

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
That's right.

67
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,200
I can place an incense burner in the treasury.

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,680
Even if Qing Gui steals this screen,

69
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,640
he will definitely be poisoned.

70
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,960
We'll follow the clues

71
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,480
and surely find him.

72
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,120
Have someone deliver this letter

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,760
to the owner of Sanxiang Tea House, Qingdai.

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,720
You.

75
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
Are you writing a love letter to someone?

76
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,040
Is she really Qing Gui or Yun'er?

77
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
We'll find out soon enough.

78
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,760
Lord Mo invited me to go shopping.

79
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,560
Why is the street completely empty?

80
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,240
Qing Gui has been appearing frequently lately.

81
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
With more people, it's inevitable that she could blend in.

82
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,840
It threatens Miss Qing Dai's safety.

83
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,240
So I rented out the entire street.

84
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,200
Only the shops that interest the lady are open.

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,800
Miss Qing Dai can shop to her heart's content.

86
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,680
That's quite thoughtful of you.

87
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,600
I'd like to try that one.

88
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,640
Colonel Mo,

89
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I've been waiting for a long time.

90
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,640
I just want one.

91
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,080
An enamel rouge box.

92
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,840
How about it?

93
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
This is the last one.

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,680
If I don't win this time,

95
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,040
it means this rouge box and I are not meant to be.

96
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,480
See? It was meant to be.

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,840
Could you please get it for me?

98
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,240
Northern Border Attire.

99
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,520
Could the Prince's villa be nearby?

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,600
Miss,

101
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,360
what would you like?

102
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,200
Boss,

103
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,360
did you see

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,480
two Northerners enter the shop just now?

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,000
Yes,

106
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,159
they're in the back.

107
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,000
Who's staying in the backyard?

108
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
The Northern Prince.

109
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,360
They say he's here to sue for peace,

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
and to search for treasures while he's at it.

111
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,760
Miss Qing Dai,

112
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,120
what brings you here?

113
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,080
Miss Qingdai,

114
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,400
what's wrong?

115
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,720
Are you feeling unwell?

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,720
It's nothing.

117
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,120
Perhaps the mixed scents in the shop were too strong.

118
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,960
I had trouble breathing for a moment.

119
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,640
That's good then.

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,280
Did you find any spices you liked just now?

121
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
No.

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
I was looking for some frankincense.

123
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,480
But this fragrance is too precious.

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,960
The shop assistant said it's only produced in the Northern Territories.

125
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,440
I haven't seen it in the capital city yet.

126
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
The prince from the Northern Territories is in the capital.

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,440
I don't know if he has a way.

128
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,960
Really?

129
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
Do you have a way to introduce me to him?

130
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,960
There is a way.

131
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
However, he's leaving the capital tomorrow.

132
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm afraid there's not enough time.

133
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:54,840
Be careful.

134
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Are you hurt?

135
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,720
It's nothing.

136
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,880
Thank you, Lord Mo.

137
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,760
With me here, I won't let you come to any harm.

138
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
I, A Ze, swear.

139
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,400
I will never let Sister Yun'er be harmed again in this lifetime.

140
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,000
That's what you get for peeping on someone bathing.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,440
serves you right for peeping.

142
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,600
Stop hitting me.

143
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,400
that'll teach you to look.

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,080
I'm innocent.

145
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,880
It's not fair.

146
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,400
Miss Hongguo,

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,640
I wasn't peeping on you while you were bathing.

148
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,760
I came here to apologize to you.

149
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,480
Apologize?

150
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,200
What do you have to apologize for?

151
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,320
That day,

152
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,120
I accidentally put my arm around your waist.

153
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,320
Men and women should maintain proper distance.

154
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,760
I've been looking for a chance to apologize to you.

155
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,600
but I couldn't find the opportunity.

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,040
Finally today,

157
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,440
your senior and your boss are both away.

158
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,960
So I...

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,520
I just...

160
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
You just, you just...

161
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,320
What do you mean by 'you just'?

162
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,040
You just took advantage of no one being around

163
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,760
to peep on a woman bathing, didn't you?

164
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,480
I swear on my ancestors,

165
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,880
I, Xiao Wei, would never do such a despicable thing.

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Who knows if your ancestors can control you?

167
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,840
You want to apologize, right?

168
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,360
Show me something tangible.

169
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,240
Hong Guo.

170
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,440
I've decided to retrieve the Wang Zhaojun screen tonight.

171
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,800
No way.

172
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,800
We haven't prepared anything.

173
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,520
There's no time left.

174
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,960
The Northern Prince is leaving the capital tomorrow.

175
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,080
Tonight is our last chance.

176
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
You're completely lawless.

177
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,960
First, you meddled with the Situ family's old case.

178
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,840
Then you got involved with an older merchant woman.

179
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,320
it's all very unclear.

180
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,720
Are you trying to anger me to death?

181
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,280
No.

182
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:54,920
Senior brother,

183
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,840
Ah,

184
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,159
you're not planning to wait for your sister Yun'er anymore, are you?

185
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,600
How do you know she isn't?

186
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Ten years have passed.

187
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,200
Appearances can change,

188
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,120
but some things never change.

189
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,160
Why is this so heavy?

190
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,320
This must be a large treasure the prince bought.

191
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,440
Come on,

192
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,920
don't worry about it so much.

193
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,160
Let's go.

194
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:22,960
Let's go drink.

195
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:23,560
Let's go.

196
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,760
I can place an incense burner in the treasury.

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Even if the Green Ghost steals this screen,

198
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,039
he will definitely be poisoned.

199
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,120
We'll then follow the clues to track him down.
