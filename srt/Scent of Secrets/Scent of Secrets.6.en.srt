1
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,720
Sister Qingdai.

2
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,200
Let's go.

3
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,560
How's it going?

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,040
We've taken inventory of everything in the treasury.

5
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,480
We found that only a Zhaojun folding screen is missing.

6
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:46,800
Also,

7
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,600
we found this at the scene.

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,400
Black feather arrow.

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,240
It's the Blue Demon.

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
Go inform Commander Mo.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,760
Yes, sir.

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,400
The thief has been affected by my poisonous incense.

13
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,200
My poisonous incense has the effect of weakening muscles and softening bones.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,480
He won't get far.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,240
Commander Mo,

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,480
we just received news

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,080
that the Zhaojun folding screen has been stolen.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,400
Hey.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,680
Lord Mo,

20
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,880
trespassing on private property

21
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,039
isn't in accordance with the law, is it?

22
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,000
Is she inside?

23
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,759
Who is Lord Mo referring to?

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,400
Hey.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,160
I'm carrying out official duties now.

26
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,640
If you insist on delaying,

27
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,680
the jail at the patrol station

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,560
can also accommodate women.

29
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,120
You men

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,240
always use your power to bully others.

31
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
This 'carrying out official duties' excuse

32
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,760
I've heard twice in a month.

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,800
Let me tell you,

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
I, Hong Guo, am not the kind of woman

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,080
who can be easily intimidated.

36
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,960
Excuse me.

37
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:13,920
Hey.

38
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,560
Hey.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,800
Ah ah ah ah!

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
How come it's you?

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,720
Senior,

42
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,320
what are you doing here?

43
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
Weren't you supposed to catch the Green Ghost?

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,840
Why are you here?

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,400
I added some fish mint juice to the poison incense.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,680
I added some fish mint juice to the poison incense.

47
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,840
I thought I could definitely catch the Green Ghost by following the scent.

48
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,320
But unexpectedly, I fell into the lake halfway through.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,079
Fortunately, I met the owner of Qingdai at the camp entrance.

50
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,240
She saw I was uncomfortable from being wet.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,200
So she invited me in to take a warm bath.

52
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,440
Senior, you also know

53
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,200
that our camp doesn't heat water at night.

54
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,400
So...

55
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,960
Is she alright?

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,840
Who?

57
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,280
Senior fellow apprentice,

58
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,079
where are you going?

59
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,800
Your Excellency,

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
we've received news from our secret informant.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,480
The Zhaojun Screen

62
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,360
has been stolen.

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
When did this happen?

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Tonight.

65
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,640
Was Commander Mo from the patrol division at the scene?

66
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,000
He only visited Sanxiang Teahouse tonight.

67
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,000
I see.

68
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,200
You may leave.

69
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,400
Are you alright?

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about, Lord Mo.

71
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,200
This is my home.

72
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,920
If you'd like some tea,

73
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,680
please visit the teahouse tomorrow.

74
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,720
It's almost 10 p.m. now.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,120
Miss Qingdai, your makeup

76
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,720
is even more beautiful than during the day.

77
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
You've changed your clothes too.

78
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Yet you look so weary.

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,880
Are you trying to hide something?

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,920
Did you go out tonight?

81
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
Lord Mo, you're overthinking.

82
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,400
I've always been fond of beauty.

83
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,920
It's perfectly normal for me

84
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,600
to have exquisite makeup in the evening.

85
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,440
Red Fruit and I just returned from the teahouse after settling accounts.

86
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,240
I also heated some bath water for your junior fellow apprentice who fell into the water.

87
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,920
Lord Mo, you've come to visit late at night

88
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,880
and are questioning me like this again.

89
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,520
Do you have new suspicions about me?

90
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,200
This is

91
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Benzoin.

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,280
I was looking for some benzoin,

93
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,240
but this fragrance is too precious.

94
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,760
The waiter said it's only produced in the Northern Territories.

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,040
I haven't seen it in the capital city before.

96
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Where did you find it?

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,480
I was stubborn before,

98
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,920
mistaking you for Sister Yun'er.

99
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,000
I was rash.

100
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,440
I forced you into an engagement using the Blue Ghost without permission.

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,280
I overstepped my bounds.

102
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,680
Everything I did was based on my own will.

103
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,720
I never asked for your opinion beforehand.

104
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:56,760
I apologize to you.

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:00,720
The engagement...

106
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,520
If you don't want it, let's forget about it.

107
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,280
But there's one thing I want you to know.

108
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:05,680
I have feelings for you.

109
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,880
Not because you resemble someone else,

110
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,360
but simply because I like you.

111
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,280
You don't need to answer me.

112
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,880
I've also been quite offensive before.

113
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm telling you,

114
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,480
I just want to cherish the present.

115
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,960
I'm afraid something unexpected might happen later,

116
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,720
and I might not have the chance to let you know.

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,040
Lord Cao,

118
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,520
Lord He,

119
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,480
Commander Feng,

120
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,680
regarding the theft of the Wang Zhaojun screen,

121
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,760
the Emperor already knows.

122
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,080
Do you two gentlemen have any clues?

123
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,360
Lord Cao, please take a look.

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,680
The Blue Ghost has appeared.

125
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,280
To be precise,

126
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,040
it has been around for some time.

127
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
The Xi Shi screen of Censor Jia

128
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,200
was indeed stolen by this person.

129
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,160
Why wasn't this matter reported to the court?

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,320
I insisted on suppressing it.

131
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,960
The current situation is unstable.

132
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,440
If news of the Blue Demon's appearance were to spread,

133
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,520
I fear it would be exploited by those with ulterior motives.

134
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,600
Lord He speaks wisely.

135
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,480
Please be seated, gentlemen.

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Who are the two kneeling in the courtyard?

137
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,840
They are my disciples.

138
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,360
Because they failed to protect the Wang Zhaojun screen,

139
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,320
we've come specifically to ask Lord Cao to punish them.

140
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,159
The Blue Demon has appeared.

141
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,760
Now is the time we need all the help we can get.

142
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,400
I think rather than punishing them,

143
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,360
we should let them redeem themselves through meritorious service.

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,800
Lord Feng's words are very true.

145
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,040
one more person investigating the case

146
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,800
means one more chance to catch the Blue Demon.

147
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,320
Come and thank Lord Cao now.

148
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,840
Thank you, Lord Cao.

149
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,320
Senior brother,

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Senior brother.

151
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,040
Don't be angry.

152
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,360
Master is doing this for our own good.

153
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,520
Look,

154
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,320
just now he and Brother Feng played good cop,

155
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,040
bad cop,

156
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,160
making that Cao Daren

157
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,080
unable to say a single word against us.

158
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,360
I can see that.

159
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,520
If you can see that, why are you still angry?

160
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,120
It's nothing.

161
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,760
Isn't today payday?

162
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,040
Go to the accounting office and collect my salary for me.

163
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,720
It's all because of this Green Ghost.

164
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,680
I forgot about it.

165
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,520
I'll go first.

166
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,200
Ten years ago, I was still a brigadier general.

167
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,560
The massacre of the Situ family shocked the entire nation back then.

168
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,920
The court tried every means to catch him,

169
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,880
but couldn't find even a trace.

170
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,040
The Green Ghost case has wide-ranging implications.

171
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
It's extremely complex.

172
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,440
I would like to request Cao Daren to send a confidential memorial to His Majesty,

173
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,760
asking for more time.

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,560
I think, rather than waiting for our doom,

175
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,120
we should find a way to lure out the Green Ghost.

176
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,640
Otherwise, even if His Majesty gives us more time to investigate,

177
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
it would be of no use.

178
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,960
Does Feng Daren have any brilliant ideas?

179
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,520
This time when the Green Ghost appeared,

180
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
he didn't seek wealth,

181
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,920
nor did he take lives.

182
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,760
The only thing he took was that folding screen.

183
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,800
If we use this as bait,

184
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,680
we will surely catch the Green Ghost.

185
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,960
Feng Daren is absolutely right.

186
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:31,000
I suddenly remember that my son is fond of antiques.

187
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,799
A few days ago, he brought back a small inkstone screen.

188
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,240
It has a painting of the beautiful Diao Chan on it.

189
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,760
It must be one of the Four Beauties screens.

190
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,400
Indeed.

191
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,640
If we can catch the Blue Demon,

192
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,640
I am willing to bring it out.

193
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,080
Then many thanks to Lord Cao.

194
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,160
General He,

195
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,400
since the Blue Demon wants that folding screen so badly,

196
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,040
your patrol division should grant his wish

197
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,560
and put on a show

198
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,720
to lure the tiger from the mountain.
