1
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,800
You've known all along that she is Situ Yuner.

2
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,880
You've also admitted your own identity.

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,200
Right?

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,280
A Ze, let me explain.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:25,960
No need to explain.

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,720
I've said before,

7
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,480
we were always on different paths.

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,320
Since you don't believe that the master is Qing Gui,

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,560
I suppose you already know the truth.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,880
Between us,

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,920
there's nothing left to say.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,520
Brother Feng,

13
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,120
I will explain everything about Qing Gui to you clearly.

14
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,239
Report to the imperial court

15
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,239
that the Imperial Guard

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,039
has already uncovered Qing Gui's true identity.

17
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,680
We have both witness testimony and physical evidence.

18
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,400
Soon,

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,120
he will be apprehended and brought to justice.

20
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,520
Yes.

21
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,320
General He has told you the whole truth,

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,720
hasn't he?

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,440
You must think I'm ridiculous,

24
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:43,759
don't you?

25
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,840
I've been obsessed with revenge for so many years,

26
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,360
only to find out in the end

27
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,960
that the enemy I imagined was my own mother.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,000
Even your father

29
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,720
was killed by my mother.

30
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
Your mother was just acting as a righteous hero.

31
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,680
My father got what he deserved.

32
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,320
Do you hate me?

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,360
What wrong have you done?

34
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,440
I only resent the unfairness of fate.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,040
That forces us to live in this world with such identities.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,280
if I still want to be with you,

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,200
would you be willing?

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,920
A Ze,

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,520
if we were to be together,

40
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,920
the pain in the future would outweigh the happiness.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,560
perhaps separating

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
is the best for us.

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,480
You're still so clear-headed.

44
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,840
I shouldn't have had hope.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,920
Let's take care of ourselves.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,440
Yun'er.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
Benefactor.

48
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,560
Young lady.

49
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
Thank you for saving me.

50
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
You flatter me, Benefactor.

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,760
If you hadn't saved my life back then,

52
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Hong Guo would have perished in the fire at the Situ mansion long ago.

53
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,159
My junior sister repeatedly urged me back then,

54
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,520
to never let her daughter

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,440
follow the same desperate path as her.

56
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,560
But now...

57
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,280
It's all my fault.

58
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,120
I didn't tell Yun'er the truth earlier,

59
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,880
which led her to seek revenge

60
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,760
by learning the Soul-Crushing Palm technique.

61
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,120
This is not your fault.

62
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,800
Back then,

63
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
if you had arrived before Ming He San Ren

64
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,760
and rescued Sister Yun'er,

65
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,880
there wouldn't be these misunderstandings now.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,160
No.

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,080
I never regret saving you.

68
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,640
Now that Yun'er knows the truth,

69
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,680
she won't blame me either.

70
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,400
However, the backlash of the Soul-Crushing Palm technique is not to be underestimated.

71
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,240
In the future,

72
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,640
you must remind her

73
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,800
not to use it again.

74
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,200
Benefactor.

75
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,480
I've been hit twice by the technique.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,080
All the meridians in my body are severed.

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,760
My time is running out.

78
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
In these final moments,

79
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,200
let me stay with my junior sister.

80
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,600
You should go.

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,760
Is there no way in this world to counter the Soul-Crushing Palm?

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,000
There's no need.

83
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,200
Time is short.

84
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,960
You must not take any more risks.

85
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,320
No.

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
There must be a way.

87
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,200
Benefactor, you must know.

88
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,160
Please tell me quickly.

89
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,560
If one is struck by the Soul-Crushing Palm,

90
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,640
and can learn its inner cultivation method in time,

91
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,440
then one's life can be protected.

92
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
This method is engraved on two paperweights.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,159
One is in my possession now.

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,400
The other one

95
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,240
is with Feng Chen.

96
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
The paperweight is with Sister Qing Dai.

97
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,760
Benefactor, please wait here for me.

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,840
I'll go fetch it right away

99
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,800
to save your life, Benefactor.

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,560
Xiao Wei.

101
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,480
You seem to have a death wish.

102
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,600
Xiao Wei.

103
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,080
Have you fallen under some evil spell?

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
The master said,

105
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,920
intruders

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,960
will be killed without mercy.

107
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,920
Xiao Wei.

108
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:39,840
What's wrong with you?

109
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm glad I didn't hurt you.

110
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,520
Xiao Wei.

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,159
Wake up!

112
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,080
Xiao Wei.

113
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Senior Brother,

114
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,600
Drink this first.

115
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,200
it will calm your nerves.

116
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,720
Senior Brother,

117
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,320
what happened?

118
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,320
why am I here with you?

119
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
Hong Guo said you were hit by the Nightmare Palm technique.

120
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
Your soul was captured.

121
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
You almost killed her.

122
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,919
Ah.

123
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,600
Is she alright?

124
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,200
She said you eventually injured your own heart meridian.

125
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
You forced yourself to wake up.

126
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,960
Thank the Bodhisattva.

127
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:54,560
Fortunately, I didn't hurt her.

128
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
Otherwise, I would have had to give my life to make amends.

129
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,240
Yesterday, at the Sanxiang Tea House,

130
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,800
you identified the master as Qing Gui.

131
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,760
What?

132
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,680
