1
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,000
Maybe we've met before.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,000
Brother,

3
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,080
San Xiang Tea House is crowded with customers every day.

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,960
Miss Qing Dai is very busy.

5
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,960
Miss Qing Dai is not in a hurry.

6
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,320
Why are you in such a rush, kid?

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,360
Although I grew up in the capital,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,840
there were some unfortunate events in my family when I was young,

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,720
so we all moved away from the capital.

10
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,920
What kind of events?

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,400
To be honest with you,

12
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,120
my family was massacred ten years ago.

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,120
I was the only survivor.

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,080
I've been living in hiding until now,

15
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,720
just to seek revenge.

16
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,040
Do you remember who your enemy is?

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,600
I work in the Imperial Guard.

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,360
Maybe I can help you investigate.

19
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:55,760
Qing Gui.

20
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,200
I never thought Miss Qing Dai and I

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,080
would have the same enemy.

22
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,720
Could it be that you also...

23
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,120
That's right.

24
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,000
Many years ago,

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,520
my late father was killed by Qing Gui.

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,039
Let me

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
see if you're human or ghost.

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,520
My condolences, Lord Feng.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
Recently, the Blue Demon has been appearing frequently.

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,400
it has caused quite a stir.

31
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sure it will be caught soon.

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,640
I hope your words come true, Miss Qingdai.

33
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
and indeed, we are preparing

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,039
to catch the turtle in the jar.

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:39,960
Stop, stop!

36
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,160
Xiao Wei.

37
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,400
What brings you to the kitchen?

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,039
My senior said you were looking for me.

39
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,120
Your senior must have tricked you.

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,080
I didn't look for you at all.

41
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,880
Oh.

42
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,360
There's water over there.

43
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,440
Go wash up.

44
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,480
And you?

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,120
These are molds I made based on the shapes of Sanxiang Tea House pastries.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,040
I made these molds.

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,000
This will make it much easier for you to make pastries.

48
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,240
Look.

49
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,160
A rabbit.

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,280
A monkey.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,440
How did you know I was born in the Year of the Pig?

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
I didn't know that.

53
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,800
I just thought you two looked alike, that's all.

54
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,240
I hope Lord Feng catches the Green Ghost soon.

55
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
and avenges those who died unjustly.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have other matters to attend to,

57
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,240
so I'll take my leave now, gentlemen.

58
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
Thank you for the lotus tea, madam.

59
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,280
The color is clear and bright,

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,200
with a unique fragrance.

61
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,520
It's truly a specialty of Sanxiang Teahouse.

62
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,440
You flatter me, Lord Feng.

63
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
You've noticed it too, haven't you?

64
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
Brother, you mean...

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,079
This woman has

66
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,720
everything to do with the Green Ghost.

67
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,280
Not only does she resemble a descendant of the Situ family,

68
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,760
but Xiao Wei also mentioned

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,920
that the screen you retrieved for Lord Jia

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,520
had the scent of this tea.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:46,920
Brother,

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
I've already investigated the matter of the screen.

73
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
It has nothing to do with her.

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,880
Moreover,

75
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,120
she doesn't have the scar on her left shoulder like Sister Yun'er.

76
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
You're defending her with every word.

77
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,440
It seems you've fallen deeply in love with her.

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Your bet.

79
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,680
I can ignore it,

80
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,440
but it concerns Qing Gui.

81
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,200
I hope you don't do anything foolish.

82
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,600
Father's revenge

83
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,560
must be avenged.

84
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,279
You know what,

85
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,640
this looks more appealing than handmade ones.

86
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,720
Once it's launched,

87
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,000
the profits will definitely double.

88
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,800
What's got you so happy?

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,320
Did you find money on the ground?

90
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,840
Something like that.

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,880
Look.

92
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
Is this the result of you and Lord Xiao

93
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:37,760
spending half a day in the kitchen?

94
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
So,

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,960
when we make more money,

96
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,040
can I get a 20% cut?

97
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,000
Why don't you give Lord Xiao 20% then?

98
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,880
He should earn as much as he can for me.

99
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,280
He'd better deliver that Four Beauties screen directly to me.

100
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,840
If it were that easy,

101
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,280
I could give you this teahouse.

102
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,920
So, Feng Chen from Gongwei Si suddenly appeared

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
also because of the screen?

104
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,880
Qing Gui has also harmed the Feng family.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
He also has a deep-seated grudge against Qing Gui.

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,520
My benefactor is truly not a bad person.

107
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,920
What the truth is,

108
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
we'll know once we gather all four parts of the Four Beauties screen.

109
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,400
However,

110
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,200
we must be extra cautious in our future actions.

111
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,880
So, when will we act next?

112
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,280
Tonight.

113
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,440
Brother,

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
do you think Brother Feng,

115
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,680
why did he make us so conspicuously

116
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,880
transport screens into the police station?

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,520
To inform the Blue Ghost of this news,

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,320
and catch him like a turtle in a jar.

119
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh.

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
Brother Feng's thoughts are truly complex.

121
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,800
No wonder he's been able to control the Imperial Guard for so long.

122
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,320
I wonder if tonight

123
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
the Blue Ghost will appear.

124
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,280
Perhaps

125
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
he's nearby watching us.

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,720
The screen is in that box.

127
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,680
Why don't we take action?

128
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,400
The real screen

129
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,080
has already been sent to the police station by him.

130
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
What's in this box is just bait planted by Feng Chen.

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,760
I didn't expect

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,880
Feng Chen's trap strategy

133
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,680
to be a chain of schemes.

134
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,440
This person is truly cunning.

135
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,920
Let's go back first.

136
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,480
We need to think this through carefully.

137
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,880
Mm-hmm.

138
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,480
Let's go.

139
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,200
Mother.

140
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,200
Mother.

141
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,880
Mother.

142
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
Mother.

143
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,600
Mother.

144
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,440
Who's there?

145
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,400
Sister Yun'er, you had another nightmare.

146
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,680
Today is the anniversary of my mother's death.

147
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,000
I need to go to West Mountain.

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,040
But now Feng Chen and Mo Ze

149
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
both suspect your identity.

150
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
If you rashly leave the city,

151
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,160
what if they discover you?

152
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
What will you do if you're exposed?

153
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
If I don't go,

154
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,560
I won't be able to sleep at night.

155
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Moreover,

156
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,240
even if they discover me,

157
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,520
I have other excuses.

158
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,440
Then I'll go with you

159
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,680
to keep an eye on you.

160
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,680
If neither of us is at the shop,

161
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,920
it would be even more suspicious.

162
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,200
Besides,

163
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,640
what if your Mr. Xiao

164
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,960
comes looking for you?

165
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,200
Ah,

166
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,520
senior brother.

167
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,880
Guan guan go the ospreys

168
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,560
On the islet in the river.

169
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
The modest, retiring, virtuous, young lady:

170
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,360
For a gentleman there is a good mate.

171
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,360
Senior brother, you jest.

172
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
She's no lady.

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,560
How is Hong Guo not a lady?

174
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,480
She...

175
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,520
When did I mention her?

176
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,680
No,

177
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,280
what does this have to do with being a lady?

178
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,720
We can easily test if it's her or not.

179
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,800
Come with me to the teahouse now.

180
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,560
If you dare to look her in the eye,

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,680
then it's not her.

182
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
A true man's ambition lies in the four corners of the world.

183
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,160
How could I be entangled in romantic affairs?

184
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,600
A good daughter has ambitions beyond her hometown.

185
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,760
I won't be entangled in these petty romances.

186
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,320
Besides,

187
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,080
his meager salary

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,360
doesn't make him a desirable husband.

189
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,120
Moreover,

190
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,880
the screen is still with us.

191
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,919
They're all suspects.

192
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,360
We can't let our guard down.

193
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,520
Sister Qingdai,

194
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,600
If you were a man,

195
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,880
I would definitely marry you.

196
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,400
Stop talking nonsense.

197
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,880
Any news from the patrol camp?

198
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,760
So you disguised yourself as a man to enter the patrol camp

199
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,640
just to steal something?

200
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,520
Do you think I'm stupid,

201
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,640
or that Mo Ze is?

202
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm not Zhu Yingtai,

203
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
and he's not Liang Shanbo.

204
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,600
If we were to meet face to face,

205
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,880
we'd recognize each other instantly.

206
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,160
But

207
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,640
your disguise is also easy to see through.

208
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,120
However,

209
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,680
one would still need to get close to tell.
