1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,960
The Green Demon comes to test people.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,880
Playing with lamp shadows in the deep of night.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,680
Ten years ago,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,240
a masked expert stirred up trouble in the imperial court.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,160
Especially corrupt officials

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,920
trembled at the mention of demons.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,560
The Green Demon's Nightmare Palm,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,000
one strike to confuse the mind,

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,960
two strikes to sever the heart's pulse.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,120
Those hit by one strike were as if hypnotized,

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,880
entering a memory illusion,

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,240
controlled by the attacker.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,920
Until a great fire at the Situ mansion,

14
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,800
after the whole family was burned,

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,040
the Green Demon vanished without a trace.

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,880
The Situ family was the imperial tutor's family.

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
They had a daughter named Situ Wan'nan,

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,530
known as the capital's most beautiful woman.

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,960
The emperor bestowed many treasures,

20
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,720
all hidden in her chambers.

21
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,440
It's said

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,720
after the Green Demon burned down the Situ mansion,

23
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,320
he took the most precious glass lens,

24
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,240
the Four Beauties screen, and the bronze paperweight.

25
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,240
He also abducted Situ Wan'nan.

26
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,040
The beauty's fate remained unknown,

27
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,240
the treasures' whereabouts a mystery.

28
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,120
For ten years,

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,720
these stories became topics of casual conversation.

30
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,640
And this is where our story begins.

31
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,090
Senior Brother,

32
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,600
Brother,

33
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,200
why did you bring the musket box?

34
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
The Four Beauties screen will appear tonight.

35
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,920
The Blue Demon will surely show up.

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,440
Oh.

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,200
I borrowed a few more from the artillery camp.

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,360
distribute them to our brothers.

39
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,039
Just in case.

40
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:27,900
What about you?

41
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,000
I have this one.

42
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,800
And the special musket you made for me.

43
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,660
Saving your life is not a problem.

44
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,400
Handsome.

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,289
The next item up for auction

46
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,960
is the legendary glass lens.

47
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,360
It is said to have belonged to

48
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Situ Wannan, the most beautiful woman in the capital.

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
It really is my mother's glass lens.

50
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,600
The starting bid

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,440
is five hundred taels.

52
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,360
So expensive.

53
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,080
I only brought a total of one thousand taels.

54
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,320
Looks like I need to make a bid now.

55
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,280
Six hundred taels.

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,479
Eight hundred taels.

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,690
One thousand taels.

58
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Five thousand taels.

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,500
Five thousand taels, going once.

60
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,460
How dare you steal my belongings!

61
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,520
Five thousand taels, going thrice.

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Sold!

63
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,880
The next item up for auction

64
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,240
is our grand finale.

65
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,640
This item is none other than one of the Four Beauties screens,

66
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,880
the Xi Shi screen.

67
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,930
The starting bid

68
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,280
Five thousand taels.

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,079
The patrol is investigating.

70
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,920
Everyone stay where you are.

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,560
The patrol is investigating.

72
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,220
Don't move!

73
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,900
Don't move!

74
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,360
Senior.

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
I have something to do. You go ahead.

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,520
Hurry!

77
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,930
The Green Ghost Bandit.

78
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,570
Brother,

79
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,600
The Blue Demon thief has escaped.

80
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,000
This mask was left at the scene.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,720
And a pouch.

82
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,000
Blue Demon, Blue Demon.

83
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,760
At least the Xi Shi screen wasn't stolen.

84
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,000
You bunch of scoundrels!

85
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,880
if you had come any later,

86
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,280
I would have lost my life.

87
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,780
And you all as well.

88
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
How dare you disrupt my plans!

89
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll deal with you later.

90
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,760
We're about to go do business at the teahouse.

91
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,960
You look so dejected.

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,000
Aren't you afraid of scaring away the customers?

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,920
Yesterday

94
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,159
I ran all over the place,

95
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:42,600
used over a dozen silver needles to put out lights,

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,860
all together, at least

97
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,140
three taels of silver.

98
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,640
We also lost a mask.

99
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,240
And all we got was one large Fire Qi Pearl.

100
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,700
We've suffered a big loss.

101
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,500
This young master is so generous.

102
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,560
I wonder if he's married?

103
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,720
This treasure...

104
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,900
if I could give it to my beloved as a token of love,

105
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,800
I'd be willing to pay ten thousand taels for it.

106
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,560
This glass lens is no ordinary fire pearl.

107
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,180
We still made a profit.

108
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,360
But...

109
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,280
That Xi Shi screen...

110
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,040
The Xi Shi screen is just one of the Four Beauties screens.

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,080
The Four Beauties screens have been scattered around the world for ten years.

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,810
It's not that easy to find them.

113
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,800
So,

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,130
to obtain it, we must put in a lot of effort.

115
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,000
Oh, right.

116
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,980
How's the investigation I asked you to do going?

117
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,659
Last night,

118
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,120
that brave,

119
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,880
tall man...

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
A handsome man.

121
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,600
He seems to be the newly transferred colonel of the patrol camp.

122
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,530
His name is Mo Ze.

123
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,240
He's not only wealthy,

124
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,640
but also has a powerful background.

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,800
His master is General He Xiao, the admiral of two camps.

126
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,560
And his elder brother?

127
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,520
Is Feng Chen, the commander of the Imperial Guard.

128
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,440
Oh my, oh my!

129
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,160
Senior apprentice brother!

130
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,520
Why are you carrying around a Blue Demon mask for no reason?

131
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,200
Senior,

132
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,400
this is important evidence.

133
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,240
It's said that

134
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
this Blue Demon thief

135
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,520
kidnapped Si Tu Wan Nan back then.

136
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,440
it's clearly a man.

137
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,800
However,

138
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,960
look at this mask, the craftsmanship is so delicate.

139
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,760
And then,

140
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,720
it's also a personal item of a lady from a noble family.

141
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,850
I'm afraid he won't show up.

142
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,010
I came to the police station just to investigate him.

143
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,920
It's also for my sister Yun'er.

144
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,840
Thank you, Sister Yun'er, for saving me.

145
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,200
if it weren't for Sister Yun'er,

146
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,600
I would have fallen to my death.

147
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,659
Mother would never have forgiven me.

148
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,000
It's alright.

149
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,530
You still have your sister.

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
Sister Yun'er is so kind.

151
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,400
When I grow up,

152
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
I'll protect Sister Yun'er too.

153
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,040
Do you know?

154
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,240
A Ze was almost disabled because of you.

155
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,760
You hiccup when you're nervous.

156
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,360
And you say you're not lying.

157
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,720
Four Beauties Screen.

158
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,200
To take something with ease.

159
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,000
Shoot this paper to the Jia mansion with a black-feathered arrow.

160
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,680
Only by startling the snake can we lure it out of its hole.

161
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,600
No matter who it is,

162
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,720
no one can stop me.

163
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,680
Senior fellow apprentice,

164
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,440
I remember the case file mentioned

165
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,560
that before the Blue Demon Bandit appears,

166
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,360
he always shoots a black-feathered arrow first

167
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,560
to notify the target.

168
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,159
That night, we only found a mask.

169
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
The Blue Demon Bandit has resurfaced after ten years.

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,760
This is a sign from heaven for me.

171
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,960
Which restaurant made these pastries?

172
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,760
Such exquisite craftsmanship.

173
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
Sanxiang Teahouse.

174
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,409
Sanxiang Teahouse.

175
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,920
It seems I need to pay a visit to Sanxiang Teahouse.

176
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,200
The Three Fragrances Tea House indeed has three fragrances.

177
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,730
first is the lotus leaf tea,

178
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
second is the vegetarian pastries,

179
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
third is the precious seal incense.

180
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,240
I've long grown accustomed to my new identity as the owner of Qingdai.

181
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,160
Unexpectedly,

182
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,010
I encountered an old acquaintance again.

183
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,960
But before uncovering the truth of those years past,

184
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,160
I can only be Qingdai.

185
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,520
I cannot reveal my true identity to him.

186
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,720
Wan Nan.

187
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,280
Wan Nan.

188
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,840
A Ze is naughty.

189
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,760
I know.

190
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,929
This isn't Yun'er's fault.

191
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,840
Aunt Wan Nan,

192
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,440
it's not Sister Yun'er's fault.

193
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,240
I insisted on climbing the tree.

194
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,960
He must have forgotten who I am.

195
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,040
He probably doesn't care about what happened back then anymore.

196
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
For the sake of their close sibling relationship,

197
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,490
let's just forget about it.

198
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
This teahouse is located in a bustling area.

199
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,020
People from all walks of life come and go.

200
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,920
We'll surely find some clues

201
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,700
to uncover the truth of what happened back then.
