1
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,000
Just...

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
She knows that Situ Wannan is dead.

3
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,920
Junior sister.

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,280
junior sister,

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:28,680
junior sister.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,240
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,400
I came too late.

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,680
Look at this fire.

9
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,560
It's burning so fiercely.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,560
It's as if it's going to burn through the sky.

11
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Do you know who started this fire?

12
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,360
I lost control while practicing the Crushing Nightmare Palm.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,240
I burned down the Situ mansion.

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,320
over thirty lives in the entire household

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,600
perished in the flames.

16
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,240
No, that's not true.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,240
Don't say such things.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,039
None of this is your fault.

19
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,200
It's all because of the Crushing Nightmare Palm.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,120
You learned the Crushing Nightmare Palm

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,200
to punish corrupt officials,

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,080
restore justice to the world,

23
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,840
and bring peace to the people.

24
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,480
The people of the world?

25
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,479
I couldn't even protect my own family.

26
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,720
How can I have the audacity to protect the people of the world?

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,280
Did you tell her?

28
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,200
Then she must think you're the murderer.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,120
I'd rather let her misunderstand.

30
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,039
That's not right.

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,280
You have to tell her the truth.

32
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,479
Tell her the truth?

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,080
Can she handle it?

34
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,280
Let her hate me.

35
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,600
having someone to hate,

36
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
gives her a reason to live on.

37
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,720
You should go now.

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,840
I have guests coming soon.

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
Then I'll take my leave.

40
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,240
A Ze.

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,120
A Ze.

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,720
You're awake.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,760
How are you feeling?

44
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,720
Brother Feng,

45
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
why are you here?

46
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,200
A Ze brought you here.

47
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,360
He said you encountered the Blue Ghost on the way.

48
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Where is he?

49
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
He went after the Blue Ghost.

50
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,240
How can he face the Blue Ghost alone?

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,520
No,

52
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,040
I need to find him.

53
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,280
He was upset seeing you hurt.

54
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,320
he felt uneasy.

55
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,280
He's just looking for an excuse to vent.

56
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,440
Don't worry.

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
This brother of mine,

58
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,480
although impulsive in his actions,

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,920
he's got a good head on his shoulders.

60
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
That's good.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
I fought with the Blue Ghost.

62
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
I didn't have the upper hand at all.

63
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,240
Moreover,

64
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,400
the Imperial Consort's screen has fallen into his hands.

65
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,040
It doesn't matter.

66
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,040
That screen was just to lure him out.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,800
Miss Qing Dai,

68
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,520
when you fought with the Blue Ghost yesterday,

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,079
did you notice anything?

70
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,840
His martial arts skills are very high.

71
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,120
And,

72
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,680
the technique is very familiar.

73
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,280
It's like it's from my master's lineage.

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Your master,

75
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,280
Minghe Sanren?

76
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,440
Yes.

77
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,800
But I also find it strange.

78
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,240
I've never heard my master mention having a male disciple.

79
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,440
The Blue Ghost's identity is unknown.

80
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,000
His martial arts are so powerful.

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,240
The vengeance for my late father and the entire Situ family,

82
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,000
I don't know when it can be avenged.

83
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,200
Perhaps,

84
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,480
the Crushing Nightmare Palm can deal with him.

85
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
You're here.

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Have a seat.

87
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,120
It seems you already knew

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,880
I was coming.

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:56,920
Tell me,

90
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,440
how did you recognize me?

91
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,160
Master,

92
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,640
your Moon Shadow Step technique,

93
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,680
I've watched it for so many years,

94
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,720
I couldn't possibly forget.

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,600
From the sound of it,

96
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,600
you're here to arrest me.

97
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,160
So, you don't plan to explain yourself?

98
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,160
Master.

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,800
I heard you really like the Minghe tea from Sanxiang Tea House.

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,960
I've brewed some for you.

101
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,800
Try it.

102
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,280
Master,

103
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,080
you are loyal and righteous,

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,360
always putting the court and the people first.

105
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,400
I don't believe you're the Green Ghost.

106
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
I just don't understand

107
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,040
why you're pretending to be him,

108
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,560
and why you want that Four Beauties screen.

109
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
Since you want to know the truth,

110
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,160
there's no need for me to hide it anymore.

111
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,320
I did all this

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,160
for the public good,

113
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,720
for the stability of the realm.

114
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,320
Personally,

115
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,560
it's for my junior sister Situ Wannan's daughter,

116
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,480
Yun'er.

117
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,240
It's done.

118
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,040
Thank you,

119
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,840
Miss Qing Dai.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,120
Brother Feng, there's no need to thank me.

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,840
We both carry deep grudges,

122
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,520
and we agreed to deal with the Green Ghost together.

123
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,600
Now that I've taught you the Crushing Nightmare Palm,

124
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
I've done what I should.

125
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,120
Now,

126
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,160
no matter how skilled the Green Ghost is,

127
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,440
he won't be able to defeat us.

128
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,240
But his whereabouts are unknown.

129
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,000
We don't know when he'll appear again.

130
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
There's no need to worry.

131
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,240
I have a plan.

132
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,920
This...

133
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,400
Brother Feng, are you sure you want to do this?

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,200
As long as we can find the Green Ghost,

135
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
this small sacrifice is nothing.

136
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,600
I'll follow your lead, Brother Feng.

137
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,840
This is the truth from ten years ago.

138
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,680
Inside the Four Beauties screen

139
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,160
lies the secret of the Crushing Nightmare Palm.

140
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,040
I absolutely cannot let it fall into the wrong hands

141
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,160
and bring harm to the people.

142
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,880
As for you and Situ Yun'er,

143
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,840
this is your fate.

144
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,240
Heaven doesn't want you to be together.

145
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,600
I know it's hard for you to accept right now,

146
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,400
but this is the will of heaven.

147
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,520
One cannot go against heaven's will.

148
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,840
If you do, it won't end well.

149
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,760
Ten years ago, it was the Green Ghost.

150
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,240
Now, it's you and Situ Yun'er.
