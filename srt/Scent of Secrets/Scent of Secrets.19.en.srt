1
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,850
I identified Master as the Blue Ghost.

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,220
How could I possibly identify Master as the Blue Ghost?

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,600
That's not right.

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,450
I didn't see Master yesterday.

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,620
What's your last memory then?

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,680
Yesterday,

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,200
after senior brother went upstairs.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,260
Brother Feng came shortly after.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,640
He said

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,480
he needed to talk to me about something.

11
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,440
Then he pulled me

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,640
to the side.

13
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,760
And then,

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,760
I don't remember anything after that.

15
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,520
He came yesterday with people from the Imperial Guard,

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,800
just to arrest Master.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,480
He was convinced that Master is the Blue Ghost.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,440
This matter

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,970
is related to Brother Feng.

20
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,739
But he's your own brother.

21
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:08,050
That doesn't stop him from hiding things from me.

22
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,180
After all, he's kept secrets from me before.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,840
Junior sister,

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,120
we'll see each other again soon.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,900
How could this happen?

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,039
My mother is not the Blue Demon.

27
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,570
She can't be the Blue Demon.

28
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,640
My mother...

29
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,200
She's not the Blue Demon, right?

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,080
She's not.

31
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,120
You're back.

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,340
Mm-hmm.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,800
Come in.

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,440
How is General He?

35
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,610
Hong Guo, tell me the truth.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,060
Our benefactor, he...

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,530
He's severely injured.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,440
If we can't find a way to save him,

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,010
he might not make it through the night.

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,680
It's all my fault.

41
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,440
He doesn't blame you.

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,079
He said,

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
if he had told you the truth earlier,

44
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,360
you wouldn't have been driven to desperation

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,760
and learned the Nightmare Palm technique.

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
He's a good man.

47
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,560
But I've taken the wrong path.

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,490
There's no turning back for me now.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,850
This is the only way.

50
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,640
Hong Guo.

51
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,080
I said a lot of hurtful things to you before.

52
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,400
I even wanted to end our sisterhood.

53
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,459
It was all my fault.

54
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,120
If you want to hit me or scold me,

55
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,050
I'll take it all.

56
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,370
But Hong Guo,

57
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
can you please not leave me?

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,130
You're the only family I have left.

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,000
How could you think that?

60
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
If anyone's at fault,

61
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,380
it's me for keeping secrets from you.

62
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,400
Don't worry.

63
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,680
I'll stick with you for life.

64
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,240
If I left the teahouse,

65
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,560
eating, drinking, and everything else

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,560
would cost money.

67
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,280
As someone who loves money so much,

68
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,340
how could I possibly take such a loss?

69
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,560
Indeed.

70
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,680
Oh, right.

71
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
Do you still have that paperweight?

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,460
It's still with me.

73
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,120
Brother Feng didn't take it.

74
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,640
That's great!

75
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,240
Our benefactor can be saved now.

76
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,560
Yun'er,

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,159
take the paperweight.

78
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,320
I'll go prepare the car.

79
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,380
We'll go rescue General He together.

80
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,090
Alright.

81
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,360
How do you feel?

82
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,240
About what I told you,

83
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,370
you must be careful.

84
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
Keep a close eye on Feng Chen.

85
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,010
If there's any sign of trouble,

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,480
tell me immediately.

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,060
Don't worry, senior brother.

88
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,260
It concerns our master's safety.

89
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,130
I won't take it lightly.

90
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,090
Senior brother,

91
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,460
what do you plan to do next?

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,650
Go to the cave in West Mountain.

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:32,760
Hurry!

94
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,960
Benefactor.

95
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,760
General He.

96
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
General He.

97
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,820
Junior sister.

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,840
Why are you here?

99
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,400
General He.

100
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I am Yun'er.

101
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
The daughter of Si Tu Wan Nan.

102
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,620
Junior sister.

103
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,040
I've let you down.

104
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,280
I couldn't stop Yun'er.

105
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,050
It's I who have let you down.

106
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,420
General He.

107
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,680
I've brought the paperweight.

108
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,480
Hong Guo said.

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,450
Do you have a way to counter this Soul-Crushing Palm?

110
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,480
We should act without delay.

111
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,680
Let's try it quickly.

112
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
What's wrong?

113
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,280
The paperweight you brought

114
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
is a fake.

115
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,970
That's impossible.

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,530
This paperweight was given to me by Feng Chen.

117
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,500
Could it be that

118
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,690
he has been deceiving me all along?

119
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,400
Feng Chen is a man of deep schemes.

120
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,940
He's also obsessed with power plays.

121
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,160
His eagerness to pin the Blue Ghost's crimes on me this time

122
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,760
is certainly not as simple as avenging his father.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,360
From now on,

124
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,600
stay away from him.

125
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
Don't let yourself be harmed by him.
