1
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,040
Lord Feng, as per your instructions,

2
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,000
we have arranged people to monitor the teahouse.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,600
Keep an eye on the movements of the police station.

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,040
Don't let Mo Ze discover us.

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,560
Mother,

6
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:30,280
I feel

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,440
I'm getting closer and closer to the Green Ghost Bandit.

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,920
I will definitely uncover the truth from back then.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,840
Qing Dai,

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,720
although your wounds are healing quickly,

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,880
this wine, however,

12
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,740
you should still drink less of it.

13
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,920
Qing Dai, that scar of yours...

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,140
I got it from playing too rough as a child.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:01,960
Qing Dai,

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,080
this glass lens,

17
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,610
what's so special about it?

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,130
Why did you go to such lengths to get it?

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,260
You wouldn't understand.

20
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,880
It belonged to an old friend of mine.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,640
Oh no.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,000
What's wrong?

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,260
Does this scent seem familiar to you?

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,240
It's the fragrance of shell ginger.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,360
This table screen has the scent of shell ginger.

26
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:43,289
The curved screen at the Jia mansion must have it too.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,160
Xiao Wei and Mo Ze have both drunk shell ginger tea.

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,720
You've even crossed paths with him.

29
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
This scent is unique.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,380
He certainly won't forget it.

31
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Qing Dai,

33
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,680
before I went to get the screen the day before yesterday,

34
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,410
I took a bath with shell ginger.

35
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,760
What's the use of saying all this now?

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,820
We need to come up with a plan quickly.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,240
Come here.

38
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,120
Mo Ze will definitely come to investigate.

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,360
Go to the teahouse right away.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,320
act according to the situation.

41
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,520
And muddy the waters while you're at it.

42
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,079
Later, go get the evidence of the Ming He tea.

43
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,960
Hong Guo will certainly use her skills.

44
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,090
You must be careful.

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,400
Don't worry, senior brother.

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,280
Leave it to me.

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,680
Is that Hong Guo?

48
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm bathing.

49
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,680
Come in directly.

50
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,240
Boss Qing Dai,

51
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,040
it's me,

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,680
Mo Ze.

53
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,730
I didn't expect you to come so quickly.

54
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,530
I apologize for the intrusion.

55
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
Have I disturbed you, Miss Qingdai?

56
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,960
General Mo is my savior.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,930
Please, come in.

58
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,380
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

59
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,500
Let me help you.

60
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,040
Lord Mo, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?

61
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,170
Is there something I can help you with?

62
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,490
I was concerned about your injury.

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,820
So I brought some medicine from the palace for treating external wounds.

64
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,280
Thank you, Lord Mo.

65
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,640
However,

66
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,960
Hongguo has gone to the teahouse for business.

67
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,420
There's no one to help me change my dressing.

68
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,140
I wonder if Lord Mo could help me change my dressing?

69
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,720
Didn't you help me change it the other night?

70
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,360
Let's change it here in the bathtub.

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Miss Qingdai,

72
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,920
If you're accusing me of being a thief based solely on the scent of lotus tea,

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,320
isn't that a bit hasty of you, Officer Xiao?

74
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,960
The Three Fragrances Tea House has at least 80 customers every day, if not a hundred.

75
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,159
Wouldn't that make everyone a suspect?

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,320
If you're not a thief,

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,170
why won't you let me search?

78
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,440
Fine.

79
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,159
As long as you have a search warrant,

80
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:58,360
I'll take you to the kitchen right away.

81
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,080
Aren't you officials supposed to uphold the law?

82
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,120
Or has the world changed?

83
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,380
Are the laws issued by His Majesty no longer to be followed?

84
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,880
Such treasonous words!

85
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,080
Don't talk nonsense.

86
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,410
I have another suggestion.

87
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,600
Produce 100 taels,

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,200
and I'll consider it as good as a search warrant.

89
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,840
I'll take you to the kitchen immediately.

90
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,840
If not,

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,980
then there's nothing to discuss.

92
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,680
You're quite a vulgar woman.

93
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,480
And you, sir, seem like a pauper.

94
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,380
Goodbye, and don't let me detain you.

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,960
It seems we won't be able to find the lotus tea as evidence.

96
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,240
Since we can't find any evidence,

97
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,170
I'll just take a thief back with me.

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:43,680
Hey.

99
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
You don't know martial arts, do you?

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,000
What martial arts would a maid like me know?

101
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,960
If you want to take advantage of me, just say so.

102
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,240
Useless man.

103
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,970
Poor and lecherous.

104
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,120
I am lecherous.

105
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,810
Aren't you leaving yet?

106
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,240
I suppose Hong Guo is safe now.

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,180
I'll come up with another plan when I wake up.

108
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,240
Boss Qing Dai, you're awake.

109
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,640
Since Lord Mo didn't come to see me for this reason,

110
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,920
what brings you here, Lord Mo?

111
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,370
The fragrance of ming tea is exclusive to San Xiang Tea House, isn't it?

112
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,520
In this capital,

113
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,540
we are indeed one of a kind.

114
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,480
Last night, when I confronted the Green Ghost Bandit,

115
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,340
he had the scent of ming tea on him.

116
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,720
You suspect that I

117
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,340
am the Green Ghost Bandit?

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,610
Senior Brother.

119
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,360
Regardless of whether Hong Guo admits it or not,

120
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,320
bring the evidence to me when the time comes.

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,450
I'll bluff Qing Dai.

122
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,800
Hong Guo has already confessed.

123
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,159
You pretended to be the Green Ghost Bandits

124
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:42,159
and stole the Four Beauties screen.

125
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,040
Pretend?

126
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,680
Green Ghost Bandits?

127
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,080
I suppose Lord Mo suspects me because of this glass lens,

128
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,960
doesn't he?

129
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,650
All these twists and turns,

130
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,340
let's not bother anymore.

131
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
It was you that day,

132
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,560
Indeed it was.

133
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,120
I did go to the black market auction that day.

134
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
This glass lens

135
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,160
was also intentionally stolen by me from you, sir.

136
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,000
Are you trying to charge me with theft, sir?

137
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,760
This glass lens was originally a treasure of the Situ family.

138
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,160
And you still claim you have no connection to the Situ family?

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't understand.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,360
Lord Mo,

141
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,090
why do you insist on linking me to the Situ family?

142
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,040
I have some savings from running my teahouse.

143
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,480
The world is in chaos these days.

144
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,640
I want to collect rare treasures like the glass lens

145
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,760
to preserve their value.

146
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
As for the Blue Ghost Bandit you mentioned,

147
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,090
how do you explain that?

148
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,620
I have nothing to explain.

149
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,400
Back then, the Blue Ghost Bandit caused havoc in the imperial court,

150
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,260
creating panic among the people.

151
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,820
My family was implicated as a result.

152
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,300
We fled as a family,

153
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,240
but who knew we would encounter a plague on the way.

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,080
I'm the only one left.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,340
I didn't expect Miss Qingdai to have such a background.

156
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,200
You...

157
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,780
Do you want to avenge your family?
