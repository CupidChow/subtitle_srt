1
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,920
This thing,

2
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,520
it's a treasure in the study,

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,480
but in your hands, it's stolen goods.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,400
I'm now in charge of the police force,

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,320
and it's my responsibility to recover stolen property.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,920
General He, you're mistaken.

7
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:31,360
This paperweight

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,600
is a personal possession of my family.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,920
It was stolen by the Blue Ghost thief ten years ago.

10
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,400
Now,

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,680
it's simply being returned to its rightful owner.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,520
It can't be considered stolen goods.

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,320
Just give the item to Master.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,200
I'm begging you.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,680
I don't deserve such a plea from you, Lord Mo.

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,560
I simply wish to protect what's mine.

17
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:56,880
You're an official.

18
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,080
She's a thief.

19
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,960
Yet you're doing such disgraceful things.

20
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
Step aside.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,040
No!

22
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,360
Master.

23
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,600
You can't hurt her.

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
You're still so stubborn.

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,240
Is that so?

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,080
I have already cut ties with her.

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
I won't have anything to do with her from now on.

28
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,360
Please, Master, let her go.

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,000
Fine.

30
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,520
As long as she hands over the paperweight.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,520
I won't give her any trouble.

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,720
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,560
Sir,

34
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,320
General He has already entered the teahouse.

35
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,479
Form up.

36
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,920
Head to Sanxiang Teahouse immediately.

37
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,120
Yes, sir.

38
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,520
What are you doing?

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,240
I just have some suspicions.

40
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,200
It is you, after all.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,040
Green Ghost.

42
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,360
How did you figure it out?

43
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,680
This paperweight belongs to the Imperial Guard.

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,600
It has nothing to do with you, General.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,320
You came here so quickly,

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,120
not to catch the thief,

47
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
but only for the paperweight.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,520
You're afraid

49
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,320
that the paperweight would be taken by someone from the Imperial Guard,

50
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,320
and wouldn't reach your hands, right?

51
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,720
Moreover,

52
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,280
your moves just now

53
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,320
were identical to those of the Green Ghost I fought the other night.

54
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,520
If you say you're not the Green Ghost,

55
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,120
who would believe you?

56
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,160
You truly are Situ Wannan's daughter,

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,480
just as clever as she was.

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,040
How dare you mention my mother!

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,360
Today,

60
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
I'll take your life

61
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,080
in exchange for all those who died unjustly in the Situ household.

62
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,840
Nightmare-Crushing Palm.

63
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,000
Senior Brother,

64
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,680
I have one request for you.

65
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:22,600
Go ahead.

66
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,280
Whatever you say, I'll agree to it.

67
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200
If

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,400
my daughter is still alive,

69
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,800
you must protect her at all costs.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,480
Don't let her end up like me,

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,720
on a path of no return.

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,320
I understand.

73
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,640
I understand.

74
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,079
Rest assured, I will protect her with my life.

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,440
Senior Brother,

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,400
help me remove this mask.

77
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,079
I want to leave this place

78
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,800
with my true face.

79
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,280
Alright.

80
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,760
How can this be?

81
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,080
How can this be?

82
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,240
My mother is not the Green Ghost.

83
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
She can't possibly be the Green Ghost.

84
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,080
My mother was killed by the Green Ghost.

85
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,240
How could she possibly be the Green Ghost?

86
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Yun'er.

87
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,200
General He,

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,600
my mother is not the Green Ghost,

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,480
is she?

90
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
She's not.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,720
She was only acting for the common people.

92
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,680
she had no selfish desires.

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,920
It's just that she was too eager to improve her skills,

94
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,080
which led to the tragic massacre of the entire Situ family.

95
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,520
General He,

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,320
long time no see.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,720
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,840
Of course, it's to retrieve the

99
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,880
bronze paperweight from the Imperial Guard.

100
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,640
And also

101
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,800
to arrest the Green Ghost who stole the paperweight.

102
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,160
You're out of luck then.

103
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,240
There are no green demons here.

104
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,440
And certainly no bronze paperweight you mentioned.

105
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
Then I, Feng, am confused.

106
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,160
General He rushed here,

107
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,040
not for the paperweight,

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
nor for the green demons.

109
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
So what did you come for?

110
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,200
Why I came?

111
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,240
Find out yourself.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,280
I have important matters to attend to.

113
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
I'll take my leave now.

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
General He,

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
don't be in a hurry to leave.

116
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,320
You haven't seen the Blue Demon,

117
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,200
have you, my man?

118
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,440
I have.

119
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,680
Xiao Wei,

120
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Lieutenant Colonel Xiao said

121
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,680
he saw with his own eyes

122
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,640
after the Blue Demon stole the bronze paperweight from the Imperial Guard,

123
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,520
he sneaked into the Sanxiang Teahouse

124
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,640
intending to harm the innocent people there.

125
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,520
Lieutenant Colonel Xiao,

126
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,680
Yes.

127
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,120
Not exactly.

128
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,200
Yes.

129
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,080
Then did you see the true face of the Blue Demon?

130
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,760
General He,

131
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,080
is the Blue Demon.

132
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:23,920
Xiao Wei,

133
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,440
do you know what you're saying?

134
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,120
He Xiao, the Superintendent of the Firearms Brigade,

135
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,840
is

136
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,480
the Blue Demon who has plagued the world for ten years.

137
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,080
Today, we have both witnesses and evidence.

138
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,320
Arrest him!

139
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:36,840
Yes.

140
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,680
Wait.

141
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,920
Brother Feng.

142
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
I can testify.

143
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,159
General He is not the Green Ghost.

144
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,360
What evidence do you have?

145
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,120
I...

146
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,560
Brother Feng.

147
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,360
The Green Ghost is indeed someone else.

148
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:58,760
Who?

149
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,240
Since Miss Qingdai can't explain,

150
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,080
I can only rely on my own judgment.

151
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,840
Feng Chen.

152
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,640
Do you really think bringing these people can keep me here?

153
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
General He,

154
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,880
the entire teahouse is surrounded by my men.

155
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,440
I advise you to save your strength for the imperial prison.

156
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,560
Feng Chen,

157
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,560
why are you trying to harm me?

158
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,560
Harm you?

159
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,080
Hahaha!

160
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,840
You are a wanted criminal of the imperial court.

161
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,680
I'm just following orders.

162
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,480
Watch my sword!

163
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,280
After them!

164
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,159
Mo Ze!

165
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
Wake up!

166
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,640
Mo Ze!

167
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,000
Feng Chen!

168
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
How did you learn the Nightmare Palm technique?

169
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,600
You don't need to know.

170
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,000
Master!

171
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,480
Stop them!

172
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,120
Master!

173
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,600
Chase them!

174
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,840
Yes!

175
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,160
Brother!

176
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
What do you mean?

177
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,080
He Xiao is the Green Ghost.

178
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,039
He's the murderer who killed our father.

179
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,200
Master is not the Green Ghost.

180
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,080
Xiao Wei saw it with his own eyes.

181
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,520
After He Xiao stole the bronze paperweight,

182
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,640
he sneaked into the Sanxiang Teahouse.

183
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,799
I know

184
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,559
it's hard for you to accept right now,

185
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,760
but that's the truth.

186
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,160
Xiao Wei was also

187
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,040
a disciple raised by He Xiao since childhood.

188
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,960
He has no reason to frame He Xiao.

189
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,920
Impossible.

190
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,480
Xiao Wei.

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,760
Xiao Wei.

192
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,520
What happened to him?

193
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,960
Brother Feng,

194
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,440
May I have a word with you?

195
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
There's no one else here.

196
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,440
Just say what you want to say.

197
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,880
You still don't believe He Xiao is Qing Gui, do you?

198
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:10,200
Is that so?

199
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,720
Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,440
Yun'er,

201
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
Although He Xiao is A Ze's master,

202
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,680
he's the one who killed my father

203
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,000
and murdered your entire Situ family.

204
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,400
We've finally caught him after so much effort.

205
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,440
You can't let your soft heart

206
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,320
destroy everything we've worked for.

207
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,640
So you've planned this all along.
