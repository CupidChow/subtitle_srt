1
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,800
I just want you to know

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,280
no matter what,

3
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm fond of you.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,200
It's not because you resemble someone else.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,760
I simply like you for who you are.

6
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm telling you this

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,880
because I want to cherish the present moment.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,200
I'm afraid something unexpected might happen in the future,

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,960
and I might never have the chance to let you know.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,400
My father was the butler for the Situ family.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,600
Ever since I can remember,

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,480
I've known Miss Yun'er from the Situ family.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,640
She would take me on the swing,

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
and she would give me delicious treats.

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,280
But ever since that big fire,

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,520
I've been left all alone.

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,320
Hong Guo,

18
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,200
Hmm?

19
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,720
come here.

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,040
I have something to tell you.

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,960
Actually,

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,880
I am Miss Yun'er from the Situ family.

23
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,080
What?

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,640
You are Miss Yun'er?

25
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,600
Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:25,640
Then why did you keep it from me for so long?

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,280
What I've been doing is too dangerous.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,360
I didn't want to involve you too much.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,440
If something happened to me,

30
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,200
not knowing my identity,

31
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,600
you wouldn't have much burden when leaving.

32
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,520
How could you think like that, Yun'er?

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,960
When my father was at the Situ family years ago,

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,479
you even let him be the butler.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,960
You've been kind to me since I was little.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
You provided me with everything I needed.

37
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,479
Just for this kindness alone,

38
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,480
even if you asked for my life,

39
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,120
I, Hong Guo, would be willing to give it.

40
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Silly girl,

41
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,080
what would I do with your life?

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,080
You are my only family left in this world.

43
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,720
Miss.

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,640
From now on,

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
we are sisters.

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,160
Mm-hmm.

47
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,120
Sister Qing Dai.

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,240
I know you're looking for the Green Ghost,

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
to find out what happened to your mother.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,640
But have you ever considered

51
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,880
that your mother might have really eloped with the Green Ghost?

52
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,400
I know

53
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,600
you still remember the Green Ghost's life-saving grace.

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,200
Don't worry,

55
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,840
if the Green Ghost is innocent,

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
I won't wrongly accuse him.

57
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,880
But if he really hurt my mother,

58
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
I will end him with my own hands.

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,040
As long as we find all four Beauty Screens,

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,920
the truth will come to light.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,160
However,

62
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,840
will the Green Ghost really show up

63
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,320
for just a few screens?

64
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,079
The technique of the Nightmare Palm is hidden in these four Beauty Screens.

65
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,880
The Green Ghost will surely be tempted by it.

66
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,880
I can't believe it's true.

67
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,680
I thought it was just a rumor.

68
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,360
This is what my master told me.

69
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,480
I haven't actually seen it myself.

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,640
However,

71
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
once we gather all four Beauty Screens,

72
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,840
we'll know for sure.

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,040
Don't worry,

74
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:40,520
Sister Qing Dai.

75
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,520
I'll find the whereabouts of the third screen as soon as possible.

76
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:48,800
Sister Qing Dai,

77
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,840
the person who made you decide to reveal your identity to me,

78
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,240
it wouldn't happen to be Commander Mo from the patrol, would it?

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
Are you drinking to drown your sorrows?

80
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,960
Or are you practicing your marksmanship?

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Brother,

82
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:27,960
why are you here?

83
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,560
My little brother is getting married,

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,040
how could I, as your older brother, not come to see?

85
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,120
That was just a joke.

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,720
Brother, you don't need to take it seriously.

87
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:39,840
I'm not taking it seriously,

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,600
but as your older brother, I should at least know

89
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
what kind of woman has captured your heart so.

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,760
Come, let's go to the Sanxiang Tea House.

91
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,920
I've heard their lotus leaf tea is exquisite.

92
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:51,960
Brother,

93
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,920
lotus leaf tea should be brewed with spring water collected in the early morning

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
for the best taste.

95
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,720
Why don't we go another day?

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,360
Alright,

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,600
let's go tomorrow then.

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,159
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

100
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,159
Miss Hong Hongguo.

101
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
I, I, I...

102
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,520
this month's salary.

103
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
Lord Xiao, your credit is quite good.

104
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,440
You pay what you owe.

105
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,240
It won't be hard to borrow again.

106
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,520
Remember for next month too.

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,600
So punctual, aren't you?

108
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,520
Otherwise, I'll go to the police station

109
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,720
and tell everyone about how you took advantage of me.

110
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,680
That's not...

111
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,080
You...

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,360
If Lord Xiao finds it difficult,

113
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,320
I have other ways too.

114
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,560
Alright.

115
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,600
It's not that I'm unwilling to part with the money.

116
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,720
You have other methods?

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,840
I'd like to hear about them.

118
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,000
Lord Xiao,

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,320
if there are any other

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,760
ways for me to make money,

121
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,200
that could work too.

122
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,800
Miss Hongguo,

123
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,600
you really

124
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,120
only love money.

125
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,080
If I didn't love money,

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
do you think I'd love you instead?

127
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,159
The weather is dry,

128
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,240
be careful with fire.

129
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,680
The weather is dry,

130
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,080
be careful with fire.

131
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,760
Well,

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,320
I...

133
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes?

134
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
I was just patrolling and passed by here.

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,680
I saw the lights were still on in the teahouse,

136
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,320
so I came in.

137
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,200
I'm going on duty.

138
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
There's no need to be nervous.

139
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,240
I'm just here to have some tea.

140
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,480
You jest, brother.

141
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,720
What do I have to be nervous about?

142
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
The owner, Qing Dai, will be here soon.

143
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,200
I apologize for keeping you waiting.

144
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,240
I'll serve tea for both of you right away.

145
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,600
The proprietress looks like someone I used to know.

146
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,520
Wan Nan.

147
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,280
Aren't you being a bit too strict with Yun'er?

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,760
She lied to protect A Ze.

149
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
Her intentions were good.

150
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,400
Zhi Zhen,

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,920
a parent's love for their child

152
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,280
is to plan for their future.

153
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,200
I see Yun'er is already lying at such a young age.

154
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,960
Who knows what she'll be like when she grows up?

155
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,640
You've already taught Yun'er very well.

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,240
Ah.

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,680
It's a pity A Ze is born of a concubine.

158
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,840
He can't be raised in the Feng household.

159
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,840
His manners are still not as good as A Chen's.

160
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,480
I think A Ze is quite fine.

161
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,320
Why don't we make him my son-in-law in the future?

162
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,679
That mouth of yours!

163
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,320
Brother Feng Chen.

164
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,520
I'm fine.

165
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,440
It doesn't hurt anymore.

166
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,640
This is the white medicine from the palace.

167
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,440
It wouldn't be good for a girl to have scars.

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,560
Yun'er thanks Brother Feng Chen.

169
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,240
It's my fortune to resemble Your Excellency's old friend.

170
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,680
It's my blessing.

171
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,640
I heard you're from the capital.

172
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,920
Where exactly do you live there?
