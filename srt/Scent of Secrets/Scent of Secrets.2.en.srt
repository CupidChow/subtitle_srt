1
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,400
Good.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,360
Qing Dai, the owner, is not only stunningly beautiful,

3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,640
but her tea dance

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,960
is also unparalleled in the world.

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,800
Indeed.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,080
This San Xiang Tea House

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,720
is truly a paradise on earth.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,480
Marvelous, marvelous.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,240
I wonder what kind of man

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,960
would be worthy of the beautiful Qing Dai.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,240
Such unparalleled beauty.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:43,320
May I ask, miss,

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,200
are you the owner of this tea house?

14
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,240
I am indeed, Qing Dai at your service.

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,720
Then, are these purses and pastries

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,840
items from your shop?

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,920
This pastry is indeed from my shop.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:08,920
However, this pouch...

19
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,039
I've never seen it before.

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,640
And who might this gentleman be?

21
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,360
This is my...

22
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,160
I am Colonel Xiao's fellow disciple.

23
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,039
Mo Ze.

24
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,320
I've just been assigned to the patrol division.

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,080
I found this pastry quite special,

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,400
so I followed the aroma here.

27
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,200
Ah, so you're Colonel Mo from the patrol division.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,000
I mustn't be remiss in my hospitality then.

29
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,240
This way to the private room, sir.

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,520
Hey.

31
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,759
A private room for one hour, fifteen taels.

32
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,680
Fifteen taels?

33
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,960
This is robbery!

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,360
My monthly salary is only ten taels.

35
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,680
Lord Mo, it's an honor to have you visit on your first day in office.

36
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,759
It's truly our tea house's privilege.

37
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,360
Here's our Baozhuanxiang incense for you.

38
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,800
Baozhuanxiang?

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,200
When burned, this incense resembles ancient seal script,

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,320
as if dragons and phoenixes are dancing.

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,320
That's how it got its name.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,639
The Green Ghost thief appeared last night.

43
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,560
I wonder if the young lady has seen...

44
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,079
The ancients spoke of the ten virtues of appreciating incense.

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,800
It has the virtue of purifying the body and mind,

46
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
and finding tranquility amidst leisure.

47
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,720
Master Mo's heart today

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,280
seems far from tranquil.

49
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Master Xiao,

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,240
Master Jia asked me to deliver this paper to Colonel Mo.

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
My senior is busy.

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
You can give it to me.

53
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,680
Master Jia says you should strengthen your vigilance.

54
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,840
I'll take my leave now.

55
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
The Four Beauties screen, easily obtained.

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,000
The Blue Demon Bandit.

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,520
I also know that Yi De is deeply moved by spirits and gods.

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,800
I wonder, miss,

59
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,720
do you think this bandit is a demon or a god?

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,280
My knowledge is limited,

61
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,280
I can only interpret based on the words.

62
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,000
Since he calls himself the Blue Demon Bandit,

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,880
he should be a demon, I suppose.

64
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,360
You hiccup when you're nervous.

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
And you say you're not lying.

66
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,400
I truly feel

67
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,240
Boss Qing Dai,

68
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,000
you are very similar to a sister I've lost contact with.

69
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,680
I wonder if Boss Qing Dai remembers this scar.

70
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
Don't hit sister.

71
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,600
General Mo is so affectionate.

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,200
If I were that old friend of yours,

73
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
I probably wouldn't have the heart to deceive you.

74
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,840
This teahouse is full of all sorts of people.

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,880
I wonder if Qing Dai, the owner,

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
has ever heard the customers mention

77
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
the Situ mansion

78
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,920
and the great fire from ten years ago.

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,760
Mother.

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,200
Mother.

81
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,720
Mother.

82
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,040
Colonel Mo doesn't seem to be here for tea tasting today.

83
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,800
It's more like he's here to investigate a case and search for someone.

84
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,240
If you suspect me of anything,

85
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,000
you're welcome to present evidence and take me in for questioning.

86
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,400
But if you're here to see an old acquaintance,

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
please don't tease this humble woman.

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,360
Madam Qing Dai, please don't misunderstand.

89
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,840
I may be a few years older than you, sir,

90
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,160
but I'm not yet desperate to get married.

91
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
This lotus tea

92
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,480
leaves a lingering fragrance

93
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,120
that is truly unforgettable.

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,680
Senior Brother,

95
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,560
This was sent by Inspector Jia's messenger.

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
They want us to strengthen our vigilance.

97
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,600
Senior Brother,

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,040
are you alright?

99
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,720
What the hell?

100
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,320
She's not a ghost.

101
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,560
But she has a guilty conscience.

102
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,640
I'll tell you more when we get back.

103
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,800
Now, let's hurry to the Jia residence.

104
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,160
The Xi Shi screen is stolen goods from the black market.

105
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,800
I have already turned it in.

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,280
It's not with me.

107
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
You want to search my Jia mansion?

108
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,160
What do you take me for?

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
The Xi Shi screen is indeed a crucial item.

110
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,080
Since Qing Gui has already sent a note,

111
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,680
he will certainly appear.

112
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,680
This concerns your safety, Lord Jia.

113
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,120
How dare you!

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,720
Are you saying I've embezzled stolen goods?

115
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Let me tell you,

116
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,520
catching Qing Gui is the responsibility of your patrol division.

117
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,040
If anything happens to me,

118
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,200
it's because your patrol division failed to handle the case properly.

119
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,840
But...

120
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,240
Senior,

121
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,680
But what?

122
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,159
Ah,

123
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,200
you've been transferred from the firearms division to the patrol division.

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,480
Next stop,

125
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,000
it should be time for you to gain experience in your elder brother Feng Chen's Imperial Guard, right?

126
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,880
Since Qing Gui will come to my mansion,

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,040
you can handle it yourselves.

128
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,200
Show them out.

129
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,320
The more you try to hide it, the more obvious it becomes.

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,560
There must be something fishy going on.

131
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,120
What do you mean by 'fishy'?

132
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,840
The owner of Sanxiang Tea House.

133
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,920
She looks like Yun'er.

134
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:10,960
I see.

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,840
if she is who we think she is,

136
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,520
then she's not hiding anything.

137
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,000
if she denies being that person,

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,280
then she must be hiding something.

139
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,600
Let's not worry about her for now.

140
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
If we can catch the Blue Demon tonight,

141
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,000
and uncover the truth from ten years ago,

142
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,960
I'll definitely make her confess.

143
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
Help! Someone come quickly!

144
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,400
Catch the thief!

145
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,080
I'm afraid we can't catch up with him by just chasing.

146
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,160
Why hasn't this girl kept up?

147
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,800
Qing Dai,

148
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:39,679
Hong Guo!

149
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,360
Hurry, let's go!

150
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,559
Let's go!
