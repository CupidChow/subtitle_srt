1
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,720
I'll go find him right away.

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,240
There's no need.

3
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:23,920
Come.

4
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,360
Kneel down.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,160
Mother.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,120
After your mother's death,

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,680
I followed her last wish

8
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,080
and buried her here.

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
I thought that in this lifetime,

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,280
I would never be able to bring you here to pay respects to her.

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,920
But heaven has eyes,

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
and finally allowed you mother and daughter to reunite.

13
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
Sister,

14
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,080
I can say that I

15
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,200
have comforted your spirit in heaven.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,000
Yun'er,

17
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,039
don't blame your mother.

18
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,240
She was one of the rare good women in this world.

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,880
She had a heart

20
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,400
that many men

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,320
could not match in chivalry and righteousness.

22
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:44,120
She could face heaven and earth with a clear conscience,

23
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,640
and was worthy of the common people.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,720
She only took one wrong step,

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,640
which was to wrong

26
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
the people of your Situ family.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,480
General He,

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,600
I don't blame my mother.

29
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
My mother's heart was filled with concern for the world.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,840
I have no reason to blame her.

31
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
General He.

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,360
General He.

33
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,400
Lord Feng.

34
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,760
Over here.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,079
I'll go check it out.

36
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,560
Those behind, follow up!

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,440
Everyone, follow!

38
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,640
Miss Hong Guo,

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,960
if you don't step aside,

40
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,079
don't blame me if my blade doesn't discriminate.

41
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,640
If you want to fight, then bring it on.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,320
I'm not afraid of you at all.

43
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
If you want to get in today,

44
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,920
you'll have to step

45
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,480
over my dead body.

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,480
Xiao Wei.

47
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,480
Hong Guo.

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,640
Don't be afraid.

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,280
My senior disciple brother has been telling me to follow you.

50
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,640
I've already left him a hidden trail.

51
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,600
They'll be here soon.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Ah, Xiao Wei,

53
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,720
why are you doing this?

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,720
It was you who controlled me with the Dream Crushing Palm,

55
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,040
making me falsely accuse my master

56
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,160
of being the Green Demon, wasn't it?

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,120
I was doing this for your own good.

58
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,520
I, Xiao Wei,

59
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,680
hate nothing more

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,560
than ungrateful people.

61
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,000
Xiao Wei.

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,320
So you're choosing to be my enemy now.

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,160
When you used me

64
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,920
to frame my master,

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,520
we already became enemies.

66
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
Xiao Wei!

67
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,200
You two,

68
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:19,120
guard this place.

69
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,959
The rest of you,

70
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800
come with me.

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,640
Yes.

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:28,760
Xiao Wei.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Hong Guo.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Don't be afraid.

75
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,280
Does it hurt?

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,000
A little.

77
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,920
It doesn't hurt at all.

78
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,400
Let's go see a doctor.

79
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,159
You'll be fine after taking medicine for a couple of days.

80
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,400
Hong Guo.

81
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:49,840
Hong Guo.

82
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
I seem to have no strength left.

84
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,520
What do you want to do now?

85
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,680
I'll be with you for all of it.

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,360
I've always had a problem.

87
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,640
I'm afraid to make eye contact with the girl I like.

88
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,800
Now I just want to

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
take a good look at her.

90
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,280
look at her eyes,

91
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,000
her nose,

92
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,960
her mouth.

93
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,880
I want to

94
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,360
carefully

95
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,520
remember her face in my heart.

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
Why are you in such a hurry?

97
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,120
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

98
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,440
This is my salary for two months.

99
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,680
you said

100
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,440
you like money,

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
so I haven't spent any of it.

102
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,920
But...

103
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,040
it seems

104
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
it's not enough to repay what I owe you.

105
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,320
But, but...

106
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,520
I think

107
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I'm running out of time.

108
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,680
You promised to give it to me every month.

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,400
If you don't keep your word,

110
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,720
I'll remember it for the rest of my life.

111
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Alright.

112
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,120
Okay,

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,040
Hong Guo,

114
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm sorry.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,800
Xiao Wei.

116
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,360
Xiao Wei.

117
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
Xiao Wei.

118
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
You don't look well.

119
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,080
I know medicine.

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,640
Would you like me to take your pulse?

121
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,960
You went to great lengths to form an alliance with me,

122
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,280
just to get the Nightmare-Crushing Palm technique from me.

123
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,360
You acted so well.

124
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,080
I didn't see through it at all.

125
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,720
I thought you were like me,

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,880
just for revenge.

127
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,720
Qing Gui is already dead.

128
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,080
And you are Qing Gui's daughter.

129
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,360
If I really wanted revenge,

130
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:34,960
do you think

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,960
you could escape involvement?

132
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,200
Since you've already achieved what you wanted,

133
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,360
why are you here?

134
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,600
Naturally,

135
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,520
I want to make a deal with you.

136
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,440
Xiao Wei.

137
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,680
Xiao Wei.

138
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,480
Who?

139
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,840
Feng Chen.

140
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,280
Where is he?

141
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,799
Stay here with him.

142
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,799
wait for me to come back.

143
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,640
Move aside if you don't want to die.

144
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,680
The master has ordered,

145
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,280
kill all intruders without mercy.
