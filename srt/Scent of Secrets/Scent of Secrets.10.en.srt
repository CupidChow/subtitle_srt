1
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,000
Fire! Help!

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,040
Not enough water!

3
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,640
Bring more water, quick!

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,320
Coming, coming!

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,000
Hurry up!

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:20,920
Senior.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,400
May I ask you, boss,

8
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
did you see the arsonist?

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't see anyone.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,240
I just got back to the teahouse.

11
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,200
I can testify.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,560
From the time I escorted Miss Qing Dai back to the teahouse

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,320
until I heard the gong,

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,440
it was no more than half an incense stick's time.

15
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,400
This teahouse,

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,160
is someone missing?

17
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,200
We need more people!

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,280
They're here!

19
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:21,600
Report, sir.

20
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,400
A black-feathered arrow was found.

21
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,320
Return to guard duty.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Yes, sir.

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,039
Don't worry, sister.

24
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,400
I'll definitely catch the Blue Ghost.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,200
Don't forget our bet.

26
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,800
Be careful.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,720
Where's Hong Guo?

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,080
Where did Hong Guo go?

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,000
You go save people.

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:41,800
I'll guard the treasure.

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,800
Bring it here.

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,520
Hong Guo.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,480
Hong Guo.

34
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:16,880
Hong Guo.

35
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,160
Hong Guo.

36
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,320
Hong Guo.

37
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,560
Hong Guo.

38
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:28,880
Hong Guo.

39
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,920
Hong Guo.

40
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,000
Xiao Wei.

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,240
It's good that you're alright.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,480
Don't you know there's a fire?

43
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,400
I was so worried about you.

44
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,240
Didn't you know?

45
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,000
I held my breath for too long just now.

46
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,280
I have no strength left.

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,560
The situation is urgent.

48
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
Please forgive me for being rude.

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,840
Mo Ze, the Deputy General of the Patrol Camp,

50
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,040
has been inefficient in his duties,

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,880
disregarded the law and discipline,

52
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,880
and left his post without permission.

53
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,840
He is suspended from duty for self-reflection

54
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
to await further results.

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,720
Gentlemen,

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,480
Lord Xiao,

57
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,240
what does this mean?

58
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,360
This is my private residence,

59
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,079
not an inn,

60
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:46,920
and certainly not a clinic.

61
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,079
You're arranging for Lord Mo to stay here,

62
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,680
isn't that inappropriate?

63
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,480
Sister Qingdai,

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,440
the doctor said

65
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,200
my senior needs a quiet place to recuperate.

66
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,200
You see, the patrol station

67
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
is busy with official duties every day,

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,320
with people coming and going.

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,160
It's not quite suitable.

70
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,920
Then he can go back to his own home, can't he?

71
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,280
Or if not,

72
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,280
he can go to Lord Feng's house.

73
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Can't Lord Feng's multi-courtyard house accommodate him?

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,360
Well, the Imperial Guard Office

75
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
is at least ten li away from the patrol station.

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,279
If there's an emergency at the patrol station

77
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
and they need to consult with my senior,

78
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,000
This place is the most suitable.

79
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,680
Don't worry.

80
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,280
any expenses incurred here

81
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,520
will be covered by Lord Feng.

82
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,880
I thought Lord Xiao was a reasonable person.

83
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Since that's the case,

84
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,800
I'll find someone to talk to you.

85
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,280
Who are you going to bring?

86
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,840
I'll say the same thing to anyone.

87
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Look,

88
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,159
whether it's a favor

89
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,040
or business,

90
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:38,600
how do you see it?

91
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:38,960
Hong Guo

92
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,240
Ouch, it hurts so much!

93
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,360
Is anyone there?

94
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,760
Hello? Anyone?

95
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,880
It's killing me!

96
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,040
Is somebody there?

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,480
Sister!

98
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,080
Who are you calling sister?

99
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
You, of course.

100
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,360
Qing.

101
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:12,960
No, that's not right.

102
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,640
Sister Yun'er.

103
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,480
If you keep calling me that,

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,120
I'll have someone carry you back.

105
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,920
Sister, you're so heartless.

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,840
Ten years ago, you left without saying goodbye.

107
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,560
I was hurt because of you.

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,360
I became homeless.

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
You don't have an ounce of compassion.

110
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,040
It hurts so much.

111
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Didn't Xiao Wei apply medicine for you?

112
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,720
His hands are good for tinkering with strange inventions.

113
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,800
I wouldn't dare let him experiment on me.

114
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,880
Then you'll have to bear with it.

115
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,280
Where are you hurt?

116
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,159
Down there.

117
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,600
Here?

118
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:00,800
Lower.

119
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,640
Here?

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Even lower.

121
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,040
My butt.

122
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,960
Ah!

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
It hurts.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,920
What's going on here?

125
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,560
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,200
Excuse the interruption.

127
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,480
Please, carry on.

128
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
Well, um...

129
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,960
I need to go tidy up in the kitchen.

130
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:34,800
Sister.

131
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,080
I want to eat lotus seed and lily bulb pastry.

132
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,640
That's a food only available during the summer solstice.

133
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,400
Would you like some osmanthus sweet potato pastry?

134
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
Stop right there.

135
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,200
Come here.

136
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
What was that just now?

137
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't overthink it.

138
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,360
I was just helping Mo Ze change his bandages.

139
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh.

140
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,880
Not calling him Lord Mo anymore?

141
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,120
calling him by his first name now, huh?

142
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Hong Guo,

143
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
if you have so much free time,

144
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,240
go keep an eye on the teahouse renovation progress.

145
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,240
If we don't open soon,

146
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
I won't have money to pay your salary.

147
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,560
Alright, boss.

148
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,320
But, you really kept him at home?

149
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,600
What if he discovers something?

150
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,760
He's already discovered more than we imagined.

151
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,640
If he dies in our house,

152
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,480
you and I will spend the rest of our lives in prison.

153
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,800
We're more likely to lose our lives.

154
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
Unless he's on your side,

155
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,320
otherwise...

156
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,040
He is...

157
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,000
He is...

158
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,800
I didn't expect that Lord Mo's hands

159
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,800
besides holding a firearm usually,

160
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,760
could also toss a wok.

161
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,120
If I hadn't been adopted by my master,

162
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,080
my dream would have been to become a chef.

163
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,120
Why?

164
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,200
Because my sister Yun'er is a picky eater.

165
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,280
Back then, I wanted to cook for her for the rest of my life.

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Two people in one house,

167
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
three meals a day, four seasons a year,

168
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,400
holding hands,

169
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,919
growing old together.

170
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,400
You bought wine too?

171
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,240
The teahouse reopens tomorrow.

172
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,400
Let's celebrate in advance.

173
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,040
I can't drink alcohol.

174
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,040
Why?

175
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,440
Won't you do me the honor, sister?

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,080
If I drink, it will definitely go to my head.

177
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
and after that,

178
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
I don't know what I might do.

179
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,520
I heard my mother say something once.

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
You mean Aunt Mo?

181
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:05,840
Yes.

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,320
She said,

183
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
Only in long illness do you know who truly loves you.

184
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,040
Only when deeply drunk do you know who you truly love.
