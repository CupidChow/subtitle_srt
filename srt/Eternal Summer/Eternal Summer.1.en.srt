1
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,541
<i>Jonathan, hurry.</i>

2
00:01:19,625 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>Jonathan Kang.</i>

3
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:26,750
<i>Jonathan, hurry up!</i>

4
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:33,166
Hurry!

5
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,500
Wait for me!

6
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:36,916
I'm waiting.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,416
Wait!

8
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
-Wait already!
-Don't run like that. It's dangerous!

9
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,625
<i>Shane, do you still remember?</i>

10
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:50,541
<i>Our relationship started from an order.</i>

11
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,916
<i>Ever since I saw you,</i>

12
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:01,916
<i>I knew you were different</i>
<i>from anyone else.</i>

13
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>But I was not brave.</i>

14
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:08,083
<i>Not brave enough to stand by you.</i>

15
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:10,916
<i>Who can tell me?</i>

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,875
<i>What planet do we live on?</i>

17
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:15,208
<i>Earth.</i>

18
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,625
That's right. Earth is a planet.

19
00:02:18,708 --> 00:02:21,250
Planets rotate around stars.

20
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,750
So, our sun is a star.

21
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:31,291
Ms. Lee, here's the new transfer student.

22
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:32,458
Alright, thank you.

23
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,416
Everybody, this is the new
transfer student from Taipei.

24
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,166
Let's give her a warm welcome.

25
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,458
You can sit over there for now.

26
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:51,000
We'll ask her to introduce herself later.

27
00:02:51,083 --> 00:02:52,416
Okay, back to class.

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,416
Besides stars and planets,
there are also comets.

29
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,791
Every time a comet
visits our solar system,

30
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,583
it brings unexpected surprises.

31
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,041
When a comet visits,

32
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:04,916
it usually brings a beautiful spectacle.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,708
Like what we call shooting stars.

34
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:10,916
Jonathan, have you ever been to Taipei?

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's right. We make a wish.

36
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:17,500
We wish for Mommy and Daddy's health

37
00:03:17,583 --> 00:03:19,458
or to become a good student.

38
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,916
Everyone can make his own wish.

39
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,333
Remember that…

40
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:24,958
Shane Yu, what are you doing?

41
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:26,708
Both of you, stand up!

42
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:36,166
<i>The rabbit hops and hops</i>

43
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,625
<i>Then it runs off</i>

44
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:42,041
<i>And disappears</i>

45
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,500
Stop!

46
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,125
Stop looking outside.

47
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,166
Shane Yu scared the new student so much
that her family decided to transfer again.

48
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,083
If you don't behave,

49
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,750
you will be punished too, like Shane.

50
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:57,125
Yunxuan Lee and Chiawei Yan,
stop looking outside.

51
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,750
Let's repeat the song.

52
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,166
Three, two, one, sing!

53
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,708
<i>The rabbit hops and hops</i>

54
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,708
<i>Then it runs off</i>

55
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,166
<i>And disappears</i>

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,083
<i>The rabbit boasts</i>

57
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,083
<i>I'm the fastest</i>

58
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,791
Jonathan Kang, sing again.

59
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:35,833
<i>He's very naughty</i>
<i>and gets into trouble all the time.</i>

60
00:04:35,916 --> 00:04:37,958
I sent him to see the doctor before.

61
00:04:38,041 --> 00:04:39,541
The doctor suggested that

62
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:44,291
if he can pair up with another student,
it will help modify his behavior,

63
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:45,291
and he won't feel like
making trouble all the time.

64
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:46,375
Everybody, stand!

65
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,750
Attention!

66
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,791
Salute!

67
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:54,041
Good morning, Teacher.

68
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,333
Sit down.

69
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:58,916
Jonathan Kang,
Ms. Lee wants to see you in her office.

70
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:03,208
Please do your best for him.
Thank you so much.

71
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,000
-I see.
-Thank you. I'll be leaving now.

72
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,083
You're welcome.

73
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes, Teacher?

74
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,291
Come here.

75
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:16,458
I want you to do something for me.

76
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:19,250
Teacher knows that you are a good student,

77
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,125
and Shane… Well, I would like

78
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:24,000
to ask you
to become his little guardian angel,

79
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:25,750
to help him and become friends with him.

80
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,791
This way, I believe, very soon,

81
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:32,750
Shane will become a good student like you.

82
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,750
Will you do this for me?

83
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:43,541
"Every time I face a challenge

84
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,958
and feel defeated,

85
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:50,416
my friend will say to me…"

86
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,458
Good morning.

87
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:55,916
"'Tell me. What is your problem?

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,416
Let me help you.'

89
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:04,208
Every time I hear this,

90
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:07,416
my courage comes back to me.

91
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,000
I am no longer scared,
I am no longer defeated.

92
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:18,291
No matter how great the difficulty,
I will not run away.

93
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:23,208
His words are as strong as shoulders."

94
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:25,125
May I join you guys?

95
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,083
Draw the portrait of the student
sitting across from you…

96
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,791
May I join your group?

97
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,083
…using your crayons.

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,833
May I join in?

99
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,625
Some students are doing very well.

100
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,000
Shane, why aren't you in a group?

101
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,541
Does anyone want Shane in their group?

102
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:47,333
Anyone?

103
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,416
Yes, Teacher.
I volunteer to team up with Shane.

104
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,958
Okay, Jonathan, you two make a team, then.

105
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,791
Let's go to the garden to play.

106
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,541
No way.

107
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,166
Jonathan Kang, you are my best friend.

108
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,958
Chiwen Huang, 78.

109
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:16,708
Anyone with less than 80,
step forward right now.

110
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,333
Jonathan Kang, 67.

111
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:27,833
Shame on you, class leader.
You've dropped so much.

112
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,166
Li Hanjue, 84.

113
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:42,166
I am not here to punish you,

114
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,583
but you've really done too poorly.

115
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:48,208
How can you feel good about yourself
with these grades?

116
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,750
How can you let me down?

117
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,041
I have guided you through these questions

118
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,916
again and again in class.

119
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,500
Here are the same questions on this exam,

120
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:59,416
and you can't even get a B.

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,250
Don't you know
how much effort I've spent on you?

122
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,208
And this is the result?

123
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,500
You know, Jonathan?

124
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,416
If you add my mark with yours,
we make a perfect 100.

125
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,375
<i>Since then,</i>

126
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,708
<i>I never stop wondering</i>

127
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,458
<i>if I was brave enough</i>

128
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,750
<i>to say "no" to the teacher,</i>

129
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,250
<i>what kind of me will I become?</i>

130
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,875
<i>Will I gain more</i>

131
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,958
<i>or lose more?</i>

132
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,666
Jonathan Kang!

133
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,791
Jonathan Kang!

134
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:53,958
Wake up!

135
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,875
Jonathan!

136
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,541
Jonathan!

137
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:05,041
I'm coming!

138
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,333
Jonathan!

139
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:09,583
Jonathan!

140
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,041
Jonathan!

141
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,291
Jonathan!

142
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,875
Hush, my family is still asleep.

143
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:16,791
Hurry up, or you'll be late for school.

144
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,958
Alright!

145
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,166
Oh, so you're here!

146
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,083
What?

147
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:12,625
Why are you looking so depressed?

148
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:15,083
Nothing. I'm just hanging.

149
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,000
You know?

150
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,916
My game went so bad after you left.

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,416
Like it has anything to do with me.

152
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,083
What are you doing?

153
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,166
Break time is over.

154
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,666
Come on!

155
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,666
-Let's go!
-What are you doing?

156
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,916
Let go!

157
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:30,000
Go away!

158
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,083
I don't want to tell you.

159
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,541
I won't tell you where I'm heading.

160
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,208
I'll save the money myself.

161
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,666
I will go to Taiwan. Hang up the phone.

162
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:15,416
Carrie, you can't just come
to Taiwan all of a sudden.

163
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,958
Your dad will be worried.

164
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,416
Why weren't you worried
when you dumped me in Hong Kong?

165
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,625
What was that?

166
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,000
Why weren't you worried
when you dumped me by myself in Hong Kong?

167
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,625
I did not dump you
by yourself in Hong Kong.

168
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,916
You've got your dad and auntie there.

169
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,875
Besides, you chose to go to
Hong Kong in the first place.

170
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,875
Alright, just eat slowly.

171
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,791
Good morning.

172
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,791
Good morning.

173
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,458
Okay, everybody, you can rest.

174
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:52,875
Before I start my speech today,

175
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,541
I would like to ask a student
to come on stage.

176
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,208
Senior class B, Miss Carrie Tu.

177
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,291
Carrie Tu, come up to the stage.

178
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,958
Carrie Tu.

179
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:16,958
Do you know why you are different
from all the other students?

180
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:27,708
Please take a good look at Miss Tu

181
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,916
and see why she is different from you all.

182
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,208
Fine. Since you do not know the answer,

183
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:36,916
let me tell you

184
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,583
by making her the same as the rest of you.

185
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,166
Quiet!

186
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,791
In future, I hope that every student

187
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,916
will follow the school regulations

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,708
on wardrobe and hair.

189
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,250
Carrie Tu, return to class.

190
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,250
Are you okay?

191
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:16,333
It's not a big deal.

192
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:18,125
The hair will grow back.

193
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,750
Don't think too much about it.

194
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,375
Yeah.

195
00:13:37,208 --> 00:13:38,375
Jonathan.

196
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,583
Wanna skip school and go to Taipei?

197
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,208
Where to?

198
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:47,375
Wait.

199
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,791
-Do you have enough?
-Yeah, should be.

200
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,125
Okay, should be enough.

201
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:53,208
Alright.

202
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,666
-Where to?
-Two tickets to Taipei.

203
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:07,208
I wanted to ask you…

204
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:08,416
Don't peep. Go away!

205
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,833
Sorry.

206
00:14:10,666 --> 00:14:12,208
-I just wanted to ask.
-What?

207
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:13,791
What if we get caught?

208
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:14,791
They won't.

209
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:16,916
Don't peak.

210
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,875
Cover me.

211
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,791
Hush.

212
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,541
Let me see.

213
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,916
You look nice.

214
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:09,500
Okay?

215
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,666
Jonathan, how many girlfriends
have you had?

216
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,500
Never, and you?

217
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,166
So many.

218
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,375
No way.

219
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:36,625
Let's go!

220
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,791
Let's stay in Taipei tonight?

221
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,041
Wait for me.

222
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,000
Hush.

223
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:46,833
How do we begin?

224
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:51,583
You first.

225
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,083
Take off your clothes.

226
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,666
The following are some common traits
of the solubility of alkali.

227
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,125
First, it has a bitter taste
and a splendid look.

228
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:20,416
Second, it turns red litmus paper blue.

229
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,375
Third, with acid, it will compose salt.

230
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,791
Scientists in the early days

231
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,458
distinguished a substance
according to these common traits.

232
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:30,041
<i>THEORY OF TRANSGENDER</i>

233
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,416
-My God, you're so slow.
-No, I'm not.

234
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,791
Hurry. Let's go.

235
00:21:40,416 --> 00:21:41,791
Hold on for me.

236
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,458
-Jonathan, you know what?
-What?

237
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,500
Which university are you
planning to go to?

238
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,583
You're not getting into any university.
Why do you ask?

239
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,875
But I made it to high school this far.

240
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:52,291
You just got lucky.

241
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,166
Maybe I'll be lucky again this time.

242
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,583
It will take a miracle
for you to pass the exam.

243
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,000
If I can help the school team
win the championship,

244
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,416
I'll be recommended to a university
regardless of the exam.

245
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,125
Fine, then. I'll flunk the exam,

246
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,083
and you can go to university
all by yourself.

247
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:03,583
Why do you say things like that?

248
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:04,625
Sit tight.

249
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,333
What?

250
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,333
Didn't we agree to go to
the same university together?

251
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,375
We'll see.

252
00:22:27,458 --> 00:22:28,666
Why do you say that?

253
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:31,333
Look.

254
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,791
Hey!

255
00:22:34,458 --> 00:22:35,583
Hey!

256
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:38,416
Hey!

257
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,083
What now?

258
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:46,458
Who's that?

259
00:22:46,541 --> 00:22:48,375
Nobody. None of your business.

260
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:49,750
Says who?

261
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,583
Don't go after her!

262
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,125
Why not?

263
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,000
Stop it, Shane.

264
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,541
You don't know her anyway.

265
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,166
Shane.

266
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,250
Come on!

267
00:23:01,291 --> 00:23:03,041
Let's go. Stop goofing around.

268
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,875
Come on. Go back now.

269
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,416
Shane.

270
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,291
Stop it, Shane!

271
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,000
Stop it!

272
00:23:13,083 --> 00:23:14,125
Shane, let's go!

273
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:16,916
Shane, let's go!

274
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,083
Let's go, Shane.

275
00:23:24,791 --> 00:23:26,083
Shane, let's go!

276
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:28,541
Shane, let's go!

277
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,208
Why did you do that? It's dangerous.

278
00:23:49,291 --> 00:23:50,333
Why did you provoke her?

279
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,500
I did not!

280
00:23:51,583 --> 00:23:53,416
What's up with you?
You don't even know her.

281
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,625
It's just for fun. Nobody got hurt.
Just for fun.

282
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:57,041
What fun?

283
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:00,041
Jonathan, let's go get a drink.

284
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:03,958
Her Chinese is funny.
She's from Hong Kong?

285
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:11,750
Aren't you guys sitting
a little too close?

286
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:12,791
Not at all.

287
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,125
Jonathan, come sit over here.

288
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,416
Okay.

289
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,583
You stay. I'll move.

290
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,708
So, how did you two meet?

291
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:27,833
The school paper.

292
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:29,250
School paper?

293
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:30,791
That's so lame.

294
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,041
I'm leaving.

295
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:34,083
Carrie.

296
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:39,583
She's weird.

297
00:24:41,333 --> 00:24:42,208
What?

298
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:43,125
Really!

299
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:48,250
You're such an ass!

300
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:54,333
-Did you prepare for the English exam?
-Yeah, so?

301
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:58,375
-You eat first. Don't wait for me.
-Okay.

302
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:00,583
-I haven't even started reviewing.
-You're kidding!

303
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:02,458
-What are you going to do?
-Help me, then.

304
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:04,083
How can I help you?

305
00:25:04,166 --> 00:25:05,500
I don't understand it myself.

306
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,708
What are you going to do?

307
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:10,291
Use my secret notes.

308
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,416
-Don't get me involved again.
-Have some more.

309
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,041
Thank you.

310
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,208
Jonathan, eat some more.

311
00:25:18,291 --> 00:25:19,541
Okay, thanks.

312
00:25:22,166 --> 00:25:23,000
Don't be shy.

313
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,083
Mom.

314
00:25:25,416 --> 00:25:26,458
I'm going upstairs.

315
00:25:29,458 --> 00:25:31,666
-It's okay. You go ahead and eat.
-Oh, okay.

316
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:39,541
Just leave it. I'll wash up.

317
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:40,791
I'll take care of it.

318
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:43,375
-Okay, thank you. I'll go upstairs now.
-Just leave it there.

319
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:12,541
Shane, didn't you say you wanted to study?

320
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:21,541
"Shane, didn't you say
you wanted to study?"

321
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:23,166
What?

322
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,541
If you're not going to study, I'm leaving.

323
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,291
Jonathan, Carrie's here.

324
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:23,000
What are you doing here?

325
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:25,208
Nothing. I'm just bored.

326
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,416
Jonathan.

327
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,708
Yeah?

328
00:28:31,791 --> 00:28:33,583
Can I ask you something?

329
00:28:34,083 --> 00:28:35,500
What?

330
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,750
That good friend of yours, Yu…

331
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:38,833
Shane Yu.

332
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,750
Yeah, Shane.

333
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,541
Are you in love with him?

334
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,666
We're just really good friends.

335
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,083
Don't you want to tell him?

336
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:29,625
Don't worry.

337
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:32,041
I won't tell anyone.

338
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:46,125
Carrie. I'm so sorry.

339
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:55,875
Did you see Jonathan?

340
00:29:55,958 --> 00:29:57,041
Nah.

341
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,458
Anybody see Jonathan?

342
00:30:20,541 --> 00:30:21,375
Nah.

343
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:22,875
Oh well, thanks

344
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:37,125
Did you…

345
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:44,958
Forget it. It's nothing.

346
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,666
Hey!

347
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:50,041
Hey!

348
00:30:51,333 --> 00:30:53,083
I didn't see him.

349
00:30:53,708 --> 00:30:54,666
Oh.

350
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,041
If you want to go, just go.

351
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,083
Hey.

352
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,625
Offense!

353
00:32:40,791 --> 00:32:42,250
Stop looking. Let's go!

354
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,083
I didn't!

355
00:32:58,625 --> 00:32:59,875
Oh!

356
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,250
Are you alright?

357
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,750
Thank God, you're fine.

358
00:33:05,833 --> 00:33:07,041
You didn't get hurt, right?

359
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,083
Should be alright.

360
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,416
Excuse me. Make way.

361
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,791
Are you alright?

362
00:33:33,875 --> 00:33:35,375
No big deal.

363
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:36,666
Where's the school nurse?

364
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,791
I don't know. Not here yet.

365
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:39,916
Oh.

366
00:33:42,916 --> 00:33:44,583
Why did you disappear?

367
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,291
Well, I just got bored.

368
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:52,541
What were you and that girl talking about?

369
00:33:54,458 --> 00:33:57,541
I said what were you
and that girl talking about?

370
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,000
Nothing, really.

371
00:33:59,083 --> 00:34:00,333
Why do you care?

372
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,666
Why won't you tell me?

373
00:34:06,416 --> 00:34:07,458
Tell you what?

374
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,666
It's not important.

375
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,541
If it's not important,
why can't you tell me?

376
00:34:11,625 --> 00:34:13,083
Just small talk.

377
00:34:14,416 --> 00:34:15,625
Are you going to tell me or not?

378
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:20,500
I don't want to.

379
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,708
Fine. She was just saying that--

380
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:36,875
I don't want to hear anymore.

381
00:34:37,958 --> 00:34:38,833
Shane.

382
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,458
Shane.

383
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:45,958
Get on the bus.
We have to get to the game.

384
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:47,708
Hurry.

385
00:34:47,791 --> 00:34:54,041
DINGDONG BUS

386
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,833
Go for it!

387
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,666
Excuse me.

388
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:37,750
Shoot, it's raining!

389
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:38,750
It's raining.

390
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:48,291
I have to get some things.

391
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,875
Why did you come see me play?

392
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:00,166
I had nothing else to do.

393
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,333
Are you here to do an interview
for the school paper?

394
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,625
Hey!

395
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,083
Where are you going?

396
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,958
Will you stop following me!

397
00:39:11,041 --> 00:39:12,291
Who's following who?
I'm just here for my stuff.

398
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:13,958
Then, just get your stuff and go!

399
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,708
Why are you going in there?
That's not the exit.

400
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:18,083
Just mind your own business
and stay away from me, okay?

401
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:20,083
Don't go inside other people's classrooms.

402
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:21,583
Let me go!

403
00:39:24,208 --> 00:39:25,458
Be reasonable!

404
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:26,916
I'm just trying to be polite.
Why are you throwing a tantrum?

405
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,250
It's all because of you!

406
00:39:28,791 --> 00:39:30,250
What does it have to do with me?

407
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,666
I just knew you for a few days,
and you're yelling at…

408
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:22,708
Sorry.

409
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,625
I didn't mean to say those things.

410
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,166
I got dumped recently.

411
00:41:15,291 --> 00:41:16,791
Carrie.

412
00:41:17,375 --> 00:41:19,125
How did you get to know Jonathan?

413
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,375
The school paper.

414
00:41:21,458 --> 00:41:23,083
I talked to him first.

415
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,875
Why didn't he tell me that?

416
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,875
He does not have to
tell you everything, right?

417
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:31,833
I know that.

418
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,125
Does he like you?

419
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:37,291
I don't think so.

420
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,791
Then, what are we?

421
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:46,958
What are we? What?

422
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:50,041
What do you think we are?

423
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:53,833
What do you think, what?

424
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:55,458
Be my chick?

425
00:41:55,541 --> 00:41:57,083
What chick?

426
00:41:57,166 --> 00:41:58,375
You don't understand?

427
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:00,000
Chick.

428
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:01,708
Be together, girlfriend, boyfriend.

429
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:19,625
If you get into university,
I'll be your girlfriend.

430
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:25,125
Are you rejecting me?

431
00:42:26,166 --> 00:42:27,416
You know my grades suck.

432
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:32,208
Yes, I'm rejecting you.

433
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:35,500
Anyway,

434
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:37,875
if you can get into university,
we'll be together.

435
00:43:36,875 --> 00:43:38,583
Look!

436
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:42,041
How about you?

437
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,958
So you'll settle for a private university?

438
00:44:06,375 --> 00:44:08,916
I can always cram for a re-exam
at the same time.

439
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:33,125
Jonathan, wake up!

440
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:38,125
Wake up, wakie!

441
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,208
Jonathan.

442
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,291
Hey!

443
00:44:48,833 --> 00:44:50,708
Jonathan.

444
00:44:53,166 --> 00:44:54,458
Jonathan!

445
00:44:56,083 --> 00:44:57,291
I'm coming.

446
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:05,958
My God, you're finally awake.

447
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,416
You've been studying late?

448
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,291
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

449
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,291
I'm having my first practice.

450
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,625
Can you come with me?

451
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,125
Why should I accompany you?

452
00:45:30,208 --> 00:45:31,625
I've got another exam
to review for tonight.

453
00:45:32,208 --> 00:45:33,500
Please.

454
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:35,083
-Just come for a little bit.
-No.

455
00:45:38,333 --> 00:45:40,333
-Give it to him.
-Here!

456
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:41,750
-Don't be blocked.
-Give it to him.

457
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:43,041
-Hurry.
-Your back!

458
00:45:43,125 --> 00:45:45,333
One on one.

459
00:45:51,041 --> 00:45:52,000
-Hold that for me.
-Up there!

460
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,250
Hold the ball.

461
00:46:17,166 --> 00:46:18,500
Grab the ball.

462
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:19,583
Defense.

463
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:35,541
Jonathan!

464
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:37,791
I'll see you after class.

465
00:46:45,916 --> 00:46:49,250
Farewell. The works about farewell.

466
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:51,333
First of all, the two poems are

467
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:55,208
"Seeing a Friend Off", by Li Bai,
and "Shi Chang An Jun", by Wang Anshi.

468
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:57,375
As a theme

469
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,916
from two different works,

470
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:03,833
we can see that in Li Bai's work,

471
00:47:03,916 --> 00:47:06,166
from the beginning,

472
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,333
he used green mountains and white water
to connect to floating clouds and sunset.

473
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,666
As for Wang Anshi's work,

474
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,291
he used "together" and "split",

475
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,708
to contradictory work as contrast,

476
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:21,791
which makes the two poems so different.

477
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,208
Time's up. Pass the exam papers forward.

478
00:48:25,375 --> 00:48:27,666
Stop writing. Pass it forward.

479
00:48:29,166 --> 00:48:31,500
Put down your pens
and pass the papers forward.

480
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,458
-I can cover you for the Chinese exams.
-Really? Sure.

481
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:46,541
Sorry.

482
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:47,583
No problem.

483
00:48:48,791 --> 00:48:52,041
-My math…
-I'll count on you.

484
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:00,500
You just finished?

485
00:49:03,333 --> 00:49:05,416
Yeah, I was just hanging out.
Now, I'm waiting for Jonathan.

486
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:08,708
Really?

487
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:12,000
He's coming out. Bye!

488
00:49:13,041 --> 00:49:14,125
Jonathan!

489
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:16,875
Hey.

490
00:49:17,958 --> 00:49:19,708
Hey, didn't you hear me?

491
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,875
Why are you ignoring me?

492
00:49:24,958 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm not.

493
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:28,791
No? Then come eat with me. I'm starving.

494
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:29,958
But I…

495
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,125
You know.

496
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,166
My senior jawed me today.

497
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,458
Why?

498
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:41,166
There are these girls
who come and watch me play.

499
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:42,208
Yeah, right.

500
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:47,041
Our faculty is organizing a ball.
Wanna come?

501
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:51,875
We'll see.

502
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:56,291
That girl's hot.
Not like the girls in my class.

503
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:58,166
So big and muscular.

504
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,666
They could probably kill me
with one slap on the face.

505
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:06,791
There's a nice girl in my class.

506
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
You like her.

507
00:50:10,583 --> 00:50:11,916
Uh.

508
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Oh.

509
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,708
It's so hot today.

510
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:22,333
Didn't we agree to meet for lunch?

511
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:25,458
Why weren't you there?
I even went to your class to look for you.

512
00:51:28,666 --> 00:51:29,708
Hey!

513
00:51:29,791 --> 00:51:30,916
What?

514
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,333
I'm talking to you.

515
00:51:34,166 --> 00:51:35,583
Didn't we agree to meet for lunch?

516
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,166
Stop cramming. Let's chat!

517
00:51:47,375 --> 00:51:48,416
Hey!

518
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:54,500
Not again.

519
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,500
I have an exam to study for.

520
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:58,916
Then why didn't you meet me for lunch?

521
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,166
We had a deal.

522
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:01,666
I was busy, okay?

523
00:52:05,708 --> 00:52:06,958
Stay over on that side.

524
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:28,583
You're ignoring me.

525
00:52:34,916 --> 00:52:35,958
Shane.

526
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:41,958
Earthquake!

527
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:13,875
I can't get through.

528
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:15,708
Me neither.

529
00:54:19,375 --> 00:54:20,625
I'll use the payphone.

530
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,083
Mom, are you alright?

531
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:40,041
Shane.

532
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:42,750
Are you alright?

533
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,333
Oh, yeah.

534
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:47,541
I'm with Jonathan.

535
00:54:49,833 --> 00:54:52,875
Then, be careful.

536
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:56,708
I'll help you clean up the stuff tomorrow.

537
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:02,916
Alright, I'll be careful.

538
00:55:04,666 --> 00:55:05,791
Nothing more to add.

539
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:09,000
Bye.

540
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,625
What's this?

541
00:55:31,125 --> 00:55:34,083
News photography. My new assignment.

542
00:55:34,166 --> 00:55:37,000
The title is "Capturing the Real World".

543
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,125
Real, like what?

544
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:40,458
The professor didn't say exactly.
Don't touch!

545
00:55:40,541 --> 00:55:42,333
The professor didn't tell us
what to photograph.

546
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:45,583
He just said,
"Photograph whatever you want."

547
00:55:46,583 --> 00:55:48,750
Then why not call it
"Photograph Whatever You Want"?

548
00:55:55,625 --> 00:55:56,666
Shane.

549
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:57,666
Yeah?

550
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,041
Don't you think
we should tell Jonathan about us?

551
00:56:03,791 --> 00:56:04,958
Why?

552
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:10,666
I just feel like
I'm lying to him when I see him.

553
00:56:15,166 --> 00:56:16,541
Maybe not right now.

554
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,625
Wait until he finishes his exams.

555
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:23,458
Oh.

556
00:56:47,166 --> 00:56:48,583
Why did you call me?

557
00:56:48,666 --> 00:56:50,500
I'm so bored. Hang out with me.

558
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:51,791
I have to go to the cram school.

559
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,083
Let's go.

560
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,083
I have an exam.

561
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:00,916
Let's go.

562
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,000
Go.

563
00:57:10,708 --> 00:57:12,083
I beg you!

564
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,208
CARRIE CALLING

565
00:57:50,375 --> 00:57:53,208
Jonathan, are you home?

566
00:58:15,250 --> 00:58:16,583
Jonathan.

567
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:58,041
CARRIE CALLING

568
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:10,791
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>
<i>to a voicemail box.</i>

569
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,708
CHEER UP!

570
00:59:45,875 --> 00:59:47,416
Why is it pouring like this suddenly?

571
00:59:48,541 --> 00:59:49,791
Move over.

572
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,958
Move over a little.

573
00:59:59,916 --> 01:00:03,375
Carrie just called
while we were riding the bike.

574
01:00:07,791 --> 01:00:09,166
You've been hanging out with her recently?

575
01:00:15,958 --> 01:00:17,500
So, you're like boyfriend-girlfriend?

576
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:28,875
Look, I'm sorry.

577
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:31,583
I know Carrie used to be your girlfriend,

578
01:00:32,416 --> 01:00:34,666
but then she started to come see me
play basketball games.

579
01:00:35,291 --> 01:00:36,708
I know you guys were together before.

580
01:00:36,791 --> 01:00:38,083
The school paper thing.

581
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:41,541
I didn't go out with her in high school.

582
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:43,666
She said

583
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,291
she would only go out with me
if I make it to university.

584
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,333
Shane.

585
01:00:50,958 --> 01:00:52,083
I need to ask you something,

586
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:53,541
and I want you to give me
an honest answer.

587
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,541
Carrie is my good friend.

588
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:01,708
Do you really like her,

589
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:05,875
or are you just fooling around with her?

590
01:01:14,291 --> 01:01:15,750
I really like her.

591
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:23,166
I wanted to tell you before,
but I know you're preparing for exams.

592
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,583
I was worried that it would affect you.

593
01:01:26,708 --> 01:01:30,791
If you give me another chance,
I would tell you right away.

594
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:38,750
I'm going. Why don't you go see her?

595
01:01:38,833 --> 01:01:40,625
Jonathan, what is it?

596
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:41,833
What are you?

597
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:49,708
Jonathan!

598
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:11,958
Hello?

599
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,541
Shane.

600
01:04:16,791 --> 01:04:18,166
What?

601
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,500
Slow down.

602
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:31,666
How did he find out?

603
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:37,708
Uh.

604
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,708
<i>A new message.</i>

605
01:06:06,791 --> 01:06:07,958
<i>Hello, Jonathan?</i>

606
01:06:08,541 --> 01:06:09,708
<i>This is Shane.</i>

607
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,708
<i>You turned off your phone.</i>

608
01:06:11,791 --> 01:06:13,500
<i>I couldn't reach you.</i>

609
01:06:15,125 --> 01:06:16,500
<i>Anyway,</i>

610
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:19,333
<i>I just want to let you know</i>

611
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:22,666
<i>I'm sorry. I really didn't mean it.</i>

612
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:25,791
<i>You're really important to me.</i>

613
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:31,916
<i>Anyway, please call me</i>
<i>when you get this message.</i>

614
01:06:52,166 --> 01:06:53,458
Jonathan.

615
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:00,333
What?

616
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:01,541
Sit down.

617
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,500
You can tell someone to take your shift.

618
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:13,583
Our faculty ball is tonight.
You wanna come?

619
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,541
Shane, are you coming with us
or getting there yourself?

620
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,916
I don't think I'll go after all.

621
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,666
Why not? You said you would.

622
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,583
Why not all of a sudden?

623
01:07:33,666 --> 01:07:34,708
Party's no fun if you're not there.

624
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:36,791
Jonathan's busy tonight.

625
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:38,250
I have to take him home.

626
01:07:38,333 --> 01:07:39,625
What? We're still going
even if we have to work tonight.

627
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:41,500
Let's all go together.

628
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:43,958
Yeah, you go.

629
01:07:44,041 --> 01:07:45,375
I'll go home by myself.

630
01:07:45,458 --> 01:07:46,708
See? He can take care of himself.

631
01:07:46,791 --> 01:07:47,875
You should come with us.

632
01:07:47,958 --> 01:07:50,250
-Come on.
-Please.

633
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,333
Stop being so…

634
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,416
Stop being so difficult. Just come!

635
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,166
It's going to be fun.

636
01:07:56,250 --> 01:07:57,375
Fine. How about this, then?

637
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:58,666
What?

638
01:07:59,458 --> 01:08:01,375
I'll go if Jonathan goes.

639
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:02,750
Jonathan, come with us.

640
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:03,750
Please, Jonathan, please come.

641
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:05,041
Hey! Don't drag me into this.

642
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,958
Would you stop wondering?

643
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,625
Come. It's going to be fun.

644
01:08:10,708 --> 01:08:12,166
-Don't be a party pooper.
-It'll be fun!

645
01:08:12,250 --> 01:08:13,791
Please, I beg you.

646
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:15,208
Please come.

647
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,625
Don't let us down.

648
01:08:16,708 --> 01:08:18,666
Stop thinking. Just say yes.

649
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,916
Please.

650
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,333
Alright, I'll go.

651
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:33,000
The turtle races against the hare
and the pig is the referee.

652
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:33,916
Who wins?

653
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
The turtle.

654
01:08:35,083 --> 01:08:35,958
You're a pig yourself.

655
01:08:36,041 --> 01:08:38,666
No, you are pig!

656
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:41,333
My friend's here.

657
01:08:41,416 --> 01:08:42,291
I'll be right back.

658
01:08:42,375 --> 01:08:44,000
Okay, later.

659
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:51,750
Why do you look so bored?

660
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:54,416
Nothing. You go have fun.

661
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,500
We'll have fun together.

662
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:57,541
Carrie's joining us later.

663
01:08:57,625 --> 01:08:58,875
She can be your company.

664
01:09:00,541 --> 01:09:02,833
How about if we play a game?

665
01:09:07,208 --> 01:09:08,416
What game?

666
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:10,958
Those girls over there
were just teaching me

667
01:09:11,041 --> 01:09:12,416
a "choose one out of two" game.

668
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:13,958
You have to choose one out of the two

669
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,125
or you have to tell the truth.

670
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:17,958
I don't want to play.

671
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:19,125
Come on.

672
01:09:19,208 --> 01:09:20,208
I don't want to play.

673
01:09:21,250 --> 01:09:22,500
I don't care. I'll start first anyway.

674
01:09:23,291 --> 01:09:24,625
Your dad or your mom?

675
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:26,958
Both.

676
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,791
You have to choose one.

677
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,291
My mom.

678
01:09:32,375 --> 01:09:33,333
Hair or eyebrows?

679
01:09:34,416 --> 01:09:35,416
Whose?

680
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,458
Yours, of course.

681
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,125
Hair.

682
01:09:41,208 --> 01:09:42,666
Tits or ass?

683
01:09:44,666 --> 01:09:46,250
Ass.

684
01:09:46,333 --> 01:09:47,708
Brains or body?

685
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,416
Brains.

686
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:55,333
Liar! You think I don't know
the real answer to that?

687
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:57,500
Now, it's your turn to ask me.

688
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:00,375
-Nah.
-Just ask.

689
01:10:00,458 --> 01:10:01,875
I don't know what to ask.

690
01:10:04,625 --> 01:10:06,000
Alright.

691
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:09,416
-Black or white?
-What?

692
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,791
-Black or white?
-Black.

693
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,166
-Fruit or cake?
-Fruit.

694
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:18,125
-Cat or dog?
-Dog.

695
01:10:21,125 --> 01:10:22,166
Go on!

696
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,416
Okay, let me think.

697
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,250
Bring it on.

698
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,916
Me or Carrie?

699
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,416
What?

700
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:42,666
I'm going to the washroom.

701
01:10:49,875 --> 01:10:50,875
Where's Jonathan?

702
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,125
Jonathan.

703
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,208
Shane, Carrie.

704
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:43,000
I'm busy tomorrow. I have to go.

705
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:47,250
What's up with you?

706
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:51,666
Nothing. You guys have fun.
I'm busy tomorrow. I have to go.

707
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,083
What do you want me to do?

708
01:11:54,166 --> 01:11:56,083
I really have to study for tomorrow!

709
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,583
And so many other things. I'm really busy.
There's so much to do. I have to go.

710
01:11:59,666 --> 01:12:01,916
If you go, Carrie's going to think
you're upset.

711
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:02,958
It's been so long
since the three of us can get together

712
01:12:03,041 --> 01:12:05,208
and have some fun.
Why do you have to act this way?

713
01:12:08,625 --> 01:12:11,291
Shane, I mean it.

714
01:12:11,375 --> 01:12:13,750
We don't have to be
with each other all the time.

715
01:12:13,833 --> 01:12:16,500
You've got your life, I've got mine.

716
01:12:16,583 --> 01:12:17,708
It's all the same for me.

717
01:12:17,791 --> 01:12:19,541
It's not a problem at all.

718
01:12:19,625 --> 01:12:21,583
Besides, aren't we best friends?

719
01:12:21,666 --> 01:12:24,708
What can't you tell me?
Are you hiding something from me?

720
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:35,625
Best friends?

721
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:41,541
Fine. Let me tell you this.

722
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:43,958
I…

723
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,750
I never volunteered to be your friend.

724
01:12:48,666 --> 01:12:51,833
In childhood, the teacher forced me to.

725
01:12:52,750 --> 01:12:54,416
I never wanted to be friends!

726
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,291
Hello?

727
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,041
Yes.

728
01:14:20,791 --> 01:14:22,333
That's right. I know him.

729
01:14:29,166 --> 01:14:30,291
Keys.

730
01:15:00,541 --> 01:15:01,916
Let's go.

731
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:23,083
What?

732
01:17:28,541 --> 01:17:29,541
What?

733
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:32,583
What are you doing?

734
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,208
What?

735
01:17:41,875 --> 01:17:43,875
Are you drunk or something?

736
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:50,416
What the hell are you doing?

737
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,333
Are you losing your head?

738
01:17:57,541 --> 01:18:00,291
Shane, are you messing with me?

739
01:19:37,750 --> 01:19:38,833
Hello?

740
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:40,666
<i>Is this Carrie?</i>

741
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:43,416
<i>This is Jonathan.</i>

742
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,541
<i>Shane is at my place now.</i>

743
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:47,333
<i>Do you want to come here?</i>

744
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:51,041
<i>Can you promise me one thing?</i>

745
01:19:52,916 --> 01:19:56,583
<i>No matter what happens,</i>
<i>you guys have to always stay together.</i>

746
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:01,291
You're awake.

747
01:20:06,916 --> 01:20:08,333
Where's Jonathan?

748
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,958
I don't know.

749
01:20:10,041 --> 01:20:13,083
He called me this morning
and told me you're here.

750
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:15,291
So I came.

751
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:18,000
And he was gone already.

752
01:20:31,791 --> 01:20:33,541
You can't see the ocean in Taipei.

753
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,958
-You know?
-What?

754
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:43,541
When I was a child,
I was the kind everybody hated.

755
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:45,583
You still are.

756
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:52,125
I'm serious.

757
01:20:52,958 --> 01:20:54,625
I was a real troublemaker.

758
01:20:55,791 --> 01:20:58,625
One time, I don't know why,
but I suddenly took a pair of scissors

759
01:20:58,708 --> 01:21:01,166
and cut the hair of the girl
sitting in front of me.

760
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:04,625
The teacher was so furious.

761
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:06,666
You know what she did to me?

762
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:14,458
She sent me and my desk
and chair to the middle of the field

763
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:17,916
and forbid me from having class
with the others.

764
01:21:19,666 --> 01:21:22,708
Everybody was scared to be my friend.

765
01:21:31,458 --> 01:21:33,708
Even now,
I'm still afraid of that feeling.

766
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,375
Then Jonathan came along.

767
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,666
No matter what trouble I got myself into,

768
01:21:46,291 --> 01:21:47,958
he would still stick with me.

769
01:21:52,083 --> 01:21:54,208
He was my only friend.

770
01:22:11,541 --> 01:22:13,166
Then you came along.

771
01:22:19,875 --> 01:22:22,166
I cannot lose any one of you.

772
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:34,583
We've really grown up.

773
01:22:39,166 --> 01:22:40,500
When you grow up,

774
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:43,625
everything changes.

775
01:25:40,583 --> 01:25:42,541
<i>Is this Carrie? It's Shane.</i>

776
01:25:47,958 --> 01:25:49,416
Where did you get the car?

777
01:25:50,041 --> 01:25:51,833
Some senior on the team.

778
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:52,958
Drive carefully, then.

779
01:25:53,041 --> 01:25:54,625
Don't crash the car.

780
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:57,375
Taking trains is more convenient.

781
01:25:57,458 --> 01:25:59,083
Why must you insist on driving?

782
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,041
Since we're traveling south,

783
01:26:06,125 --> 01:26:08,333
it's better to drive than queue
for train tickets.

784
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,875
You can book tickets online now.

785
01:26:11,958 --> 01:26:13,375
There's no need to queue.

786
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:36,750
Shane, where are we?

787
01:26:36,833 --> 01:26:38,375
Why did you bring us here?

788
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:40,500
Shane Yu.

789
01:26:41,791 --> 01:26:42,916
Shane!

790
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,333
Jonathan.

791
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,375
Yeah?

792
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,833
Wanna take a walk?

793
01:26:58,791 --> 01:27:00,166
I'm going, then.

794
01:27:11,416 --> 01:27:12,666
You really don't want to go?

795
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:15,333
You go. I'll wait for you guys in the car.

796
01:27:35,166 --> 01:27:38,416
You know what? I've been thinking.

797
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:43,416
Maybe I'm too used to
having Jonathan by my side.

798
01:27:44,750 --> 01:27:46,875
Too used to having both of you
take care of me.

799
01:27:51,750 --> 01:27:52,708
Carrie.

800
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,000
Will we lose each other in the future?

801
01:28:04,458 --> 01:28:06,833
Did I mess everything up?

802
01:28:07,708 --> 01:28:09,750
Am I the one who messes everything up?

803
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:24,625
Hey!

804
01:28:27,916 --> 01:28:29,125
Shane.

805
01:28:29,791 --> 01:28:31,833
I think we should not see
each other anymore.

806
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:36,791
What?

807
01:28:36,875 --> 01:28:40,833
I mean, it's not your fault.

808
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:43,666
It's my own problem.

809
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:47,333
Let's not see each other anymore.

810
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:51,166
I mean it.

811
01:28:51,916 --> 01:28:53,750
There are so many things you don't know.

812
01:28:58,375 --> 01:28:59,541
Shane.

813
01:29:01,916 --> 01:29:03,375
-What are you doing?
-Stop fighting!

814
01:29:03,458 --> 01:29:05,166
No, stop it!

815
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,125
What are you doing?

816
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:08,083
-Stop it!
-What is it?

817
01:29:16,666 --> 01:29:18,041
Stop fighting!

818
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:23,625
Just say it, okay?

819
01:29:28,458 --> 01:29:29,750
I'll wait in the car.

820
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:51,041
Sorry.

821
01:29:51,625 --> 01:29:53,291
I shouldn't say it like that.

822
01:29:56,708 --> 01:29:59,541
I just want to know
if you really meant what you said.

823
01:30:00,291 --> 01:30:01,583
I don't know.

824
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,916
What do you mean you don't know?

825
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:04,958
I…

826
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:12,208
Aren't we best friends?

827
01:30:13,166 --> 01:30:15,041
What can't you tell me?

828
01:30:20,333 --> 01:30:21,416
Shane.

829
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:24,375
You said best friends
can tell each other anything.

830
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:26,708
Fine.

831
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:29,708
Then I really want to know

832
01:30:31,041 --> 01:30:34,875
if you'll still be my friend
after you hear my secret.

833
01:30:40,416 --> 01:30:41,500
Shane.

834
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:44,750
You're not just a friend to me.

835
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,500
I really love you.

836
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:04,916
Wait!

837
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:08,458
I have a secret for you, too.

838
01:31:15,291 --> 01:31:17,000
Mrs. Yu,
your son's attention deficit disorder

839
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:20,333
can be improved through group interaction.

840
01:31:20,416 --> 01:31:22,875
Help him find some kids

841
01:31:22,958 --> 01:31:24,166
to play with him.

842
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:28,375
That way, I believe his condition
will slowly improve.

843
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:33,583
I always knew you were forced
by the teacher.

844
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,750
I always knew you didn't volunteer
to be my friend.

845
01:31:50,375 --> 01:31:53,000
At first, I wanted to hurt you
and get you into trouble, too.

846
01:31:55,208 --> 01:31:57,375
But then I realized that I couldn't do it.

847
01:32:01,416 --> 01:32:03,166
I'm really too lonely.

848
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,333
Jonathan Kang.

849
01:32:16,291 --> 01:32:18,166
You really are my best friend.
