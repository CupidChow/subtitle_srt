(If any exists in reality,
it is by coincidence.)

00:00:09,959 --> 00:00:11,080
Gosh.

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,879
My gosh.

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,349
- This...
- I can't believe it.

7
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:25,520
Mr. Governor!

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,230
Mr. Governor!

9
00:00:28,391 --> 00:00:29,481
Here.

10
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,071
The design is finally out.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,440
Check it out. Goodness.

12
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:37,190
Isn't it adorable?

13
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:40,177
Is this supposed to be cute?

14
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:44,870
Come on, Mr. Kwon. Kids
these days value uniqueness.

15
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:48,540
You'd be surprised by the profit
earned through licensed merchandise.

16
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,556
If only that'd be
the case for us.

17
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,251
By the way, what about
the monks who complained?

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,881
They gave some ridiculous reasons
as to why it shouldn't be excavated,

19
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,720
but the county office will
put the complaints to rest.

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,181
Don't worry.

21
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,946
Who knew Jinyang-gun was
home to such treasure?

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,287
Tell me about it. Shall we?

23
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:10,020
Mr. Kwon, we'll talk
about this later.

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,207
All right, I get it.

25
00:01:13,231 --> 00:01:15,070
My gosh.

26
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,940
- Over here.
- We're here.

27
00:01:34,848 --> 00:01:37,848
What... It's huge.

28
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,171
Yes, it is.

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,629
What's that around the eyes?

30
00:01:51,062 --> 00:01:52,918
That should be cleaned.

31
00:01:52,942 --> 00:01:54,903
- Right, of course.
- There.

32
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,033
Is that discoloring
or a blindfold?

33
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,403
It seems more like a blindfold.

34
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:00,952
Won Seok!

35
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:03,991
- Yes, sir?
- That over the eyes.

36
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:07,372
Remove it without damaging
it and keep it neatly stored.

37
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,501
Yes, sir.

Shoo.

46
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,701
Shoo!

47
00:04:06,951 --> 00:04:08,832
Won Seok, what are you up to?

48
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,177
Sir.

49
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:13,201
I told you to pick up the pace
but yet you're still here.

50
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,842
The discovery has
turned many heads,

51
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:20,752
so keep it on the down low,

52
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:23,632
and move it to a
secure location.

53
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:25,051
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:27,051
That cloth as well.

55
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,892
Got it, sir.

56
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,721
Here.

57
00:04:35,481 --> 00:04:38,101
You dare take my
money with one hand?

58
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:42,111
Are you kidding me?

59
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:48,491
Darn it.

60
00:04:55,911 --> 00:04:57,681
Look at the gaze it's
holding. How impressive.

61
00:05:09,092 --> 00:05:10,301
Head back inside.

62
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:12,811
Can't you stay home today?

63
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,731
I'm getting a bad feeling.

64
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:18,522
What do you mean?

65
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,902
I had an eerie dream last night,

66
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,861
and my stomach hurts.

67
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:27,861
It's why I told
you to stay inside.

68
00:05:28,152 --> 00:05:29,822
Stop being a worrywart
and head back.

69
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:32,241
Tell the baby to have
a good day at least.

70
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:41,832
Your mom's not feeling too good,
so don't trouble her today.

71
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:43,421
I won't be gone long.

72
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:45,421
See you.

73
00:05:47,671 --> 00:05:49,931
- Get home early.
- I will.

74
00:06:04,361 --> 00:06:06,548
Yes, we have fine weather today.

75
00:06:06,572 --> 00:06:08,572
Why don't we kick off
the day in a good mood?

76
00:06:25,712 --> 00:06:27,551
Darn it. Are you kidding me?

77
00:07:20,392 --> 00:07:22,101
Get in. You're running late.

78
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:27,902
Get in.

79
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:31,116
You will have to wait for
the bus for 30 minutes.

80
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,282
Do you want to be
told off again?

81
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,462
You're not under
arrest, you know.

82
00:07:52,012 --> 00:07:53,762
Sit in the passenger seat.

83
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:56,051
Anyone would agree
that I'm under arrest.

84
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,681
Isn't it nice to have your
mom drive you to school?

85
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,748
We can talk on the way...

86
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,349
Just don't drop me
off at the front gate.

87
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:18,452
Yes, sir. And we're off.

88
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:29,041
("Monthly Mystery")

89
00:08:41,472 --> 00:08:45,311
In 1915, while attempting
to restore Seokguram,

90
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:48,811
Japan introduced a construction
technique that was new at the time.

91
00:08:49,811 --> 00:08:51,071
One that uses cement.

92
00:08:52,152 --> 00:08:55,152
Cement was paved everywhere
to prevent humidity,

93
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:59,411
but it led to condensation and
moss on the inner walls and statue.

94
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,137
Only a temperature drop of 1Â°C

95
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,622
can slow down the movement
of water molecules.

96
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:07,267
That it could lead
to condensation

97
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,421
was a fact known by people
even 1,000 years ago.

98
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:13,027
But those who excavated the
relics 1,000 years later

99
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,301
were clueless to say the least.

100
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:17,972
Students,

101
00:09:18,681 --> 00:09:20,143
some relics or
events from the past

102
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:24,681
might be better
off to stay buried.

103
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,142
If that is something we can't
understand or interpret,

104
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:33,691
That is all for today.

105
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:35,417
Until next week's class,

106
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:38,362
study on the religious
architecture of Goryeo.

107
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:40,622
You will be tested.

108
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:43,282
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?

109
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:46,411
Hello.

110
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:50,372
What are you learning lately?

111
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,728
Cultural assets.

112
00:09:52,752 --> 00:09:55,382
Cultural assets? How boring.

113
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,243
- Is it Professor Min Young Soo?
- Seriously.

114
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:59,222
Professor Min doesn't know this.

115
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:01,012
The real mystery of Asia.

116
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:03,931
That has all our history.

117
00:10:04,311 --> 00:10:07,642
If you subscribe to it, it'll
lead you to the whole new world.

118
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,311
- It literally means a new world.
- Gosh.

119
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:12,441
- Any questions?
- That's odd.

120
00:10:12,772 --> 00:10:13,902
Any questions?

121
00:10:14,571 --> 00:10:16,441
Is the first month free?

122
00:10:17,112 --> 00:10:18,441
The first month is free,

123
00:10:18,992 --> 00:10:20,661
- but you're free to pay.
- What?

124
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,571
You can pay for the first month.

125
00:10:22,701 --> 00:10:23,911
What's this?

126
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:25,701
- Hello.
- Hello.

127
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,502
Darn it.

128
00:10:27,951 --> 00:10:29,752
Hey. Young man. Look.

129
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,101

131
00:10:36,341 --> 00:10:39,198
- Young Soo. Come on.
- I told you to be here on time.

132
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,222
I didn't tell you
to solicit here.

133
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:44,142
I'm here already. It's like
killing two birds with one stone.

134
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:45,561
Why did you want to see me?

135
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:46,931
Follow me.

136
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,892
You didn't have to throw it.

137
00:10:51,691 --> 00:10:54,167
- "Monthly Mystery" subscription?
- Yes.

138
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,482
- People actually pay for that?
- Yes.

139
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:59,417
It's all about subscription now.

140
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:00,612
You should create an account.

141
00:11:01,242 --> 00:11:02,637
What's this on your back?

142
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:04,321
Don't touch it.

143
00:11:04,532 --> 00:11:06,661
It's the symbol of the
Tatars in Mongolia.

144
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:09,048
Keep it close to you, and
it'll bring you money.

145
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:10,937
Did a sorcerer draw it?

146
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,671
No, it was 10 dollars on eBay.

147
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:14,171
My goodness.

148
00:11:15,421 --> 00:11:16,541
Hang on.

149
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:19,671
Why did you call me many times?
Why did you want to see me?

150
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,341
There are people
who want to see you.

151
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,681
Me? Who?

152
00:11:32,022 --> 00:11:34,902
Sorry for barging in like this.

153
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,321
We were in such a rush.

154
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:41,782
My name is Sung Won. I work at
Jecheon Order Buddhism Research Lab.

155
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,451
And he is...

156
00:11:43,992 --> 00:11:45,742
My name is Il Ju.

157
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:48,242
Okay. Why did you
want to see me?

158
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,291
- Monk Sung Won.
- Yes.

159
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,921
I found something
interesting here.

160
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,961
I wanted to hear your opinion
regarding that matter.

161
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,012
- This is true.
- Pardon?

162
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,262
- This is true.
- Oh, not that.

163
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:06,681
Here.

164
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:10,262
We think this statue of
Buddha was discovered

165
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:15,311
at the old site of Ho ran Temple
which was built in Goryeo Dynasty.

166
00:12:15,522 --> 00:12:18,732
That temple had a statue
of Buddha haunted by evil.

167
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,508
Yes, you're talking about
the haunted Buddha statue.

168
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,782
Yes. That is correct.

169
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,628
According to "Eou yadam",

170
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:27,742
even after it was sealed,
misfortune did not stop.

171
00:12:28,242 --> 00:12:32,372
So they built another statue of
Buddha to stop the strange events.

172
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:36,002
Then what is the problem?

173
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,711
In short,

174
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,091
there is an initial
haunted Buddha statue,

175
00:12:41,591 --> 00:12:46,431
and we believe that is
the one in your magazine.

176
00:12:47,012 --> 00:12:49,578
When we heard the initial
haunted Buddha statue

177
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,352
was excavated in Mount Cheonbo,

178
00:12:51,681 --> 00:12:54,311
we tried to stop
them from excavating.

179
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,022
But the county office handled
it with more haste than caution.

180
00:12:57,482 --> 00:12:59,022
So where is it now?

181
00:12:59,152 --> 00:13:01,772
We are doing our
best to find it.

182
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:05,701
The initial haunted Buddha statue
has the most vicious evil spirit.

183
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:07,862
We must find it as
soon as possible.

184
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:10,911
And this is the photo
when it was found.

185
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:15,661
We are here to ask you if you
can look up what it says here.

186
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,051
It's in Tibetan.

187
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:29,262
He used to be

188
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:33,198
a promising genius in
ancient Buddhism studies.

189
00:13:33,222 --> 00:13:34,642
I see.

190
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:37,732
You see,

191
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:40,522
I could find what it means,

192
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:45,152
but lately, I'm into something.

193
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,508
I don't know if I'll
have time for it.

194
00:13:47,532 --> 00:13:49,282
I know you're not busy.

195
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,872
You work at a company.

196
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:55,767
He works at a nice place
and gets paid monthly.

197
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,291
But I'm a freelancer.

198
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,502
- Yes.
- Time is money.

199
00:13:59,961 --> 00:14:01,807
So I need to get
paid for my research.

200
00:14:01,831 --> 00:14:04,358
Hey. Don't you rip off monks.

201
00:14:04,382 --> 00:14:05,647
It is okay.

202
00:14:05,671 --> 00:14:07,567
- We must pay him.
- Pardon?

203
00:14:07,591 --> 00:14:08,921
It is okay.

204
00:14:09,051 --> 00:14:11,198
We will pay you as
much as you want.

205
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:14,561
But since this is an urgent
matter, please hurry up.

206
00:14:14,852 --> 00:14:15,907
Yes.

207
00:14:15,931 --> 00:14:17,642
- Venerable Sung Won.
- Yes.

208
00:14:20,232 --> 00:14:21,522
Here is my business card.

209
00:14:22,311 --> 00:14:23,691
I thought you were
giving me money.

210
00:14:24,732 --> 00:14:27,011
Please give us a call
once you find something.

211
00:14:27,441 --> 00:14:28,418
Okay.

212
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,862
We will get going now.

213
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,321
Okay.

214
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,849
I noticed

215
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,081
you are wearing the Tatars'
sorcery pattern t-shirt.

216
00:14:36,331 --> 00:14:37,581
You know this?

217
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,331
Yes. I have the same
one in long sleeves.

218
00:14:42,171 --> 00:14:43,187
Cheers.

219
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:44,502
Venerable Sung Won.

220
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:46,608
Please take good care of it.

221
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:47,801
Come on.

222
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:53,392
Just do it for them. Why
would you ask for money?

223
00:14:54,142 --> 00:14:55,551
I need to make a living.

224
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:58,142
The conference is
tomorrow. You should come.

225
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:00,522
No thank. I'm busy.

226
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,191
I know it's your birthday.

227
00:15:06,152 --> 00:15:07,652
It's the day Ha Young died.

228
00:15:09,821 --> 00:15:11,282
Are you going
there with Soo Jin?

229
00:15:14,742 --> 00:15:16,372
Seriously.

230
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,524
It's time for you to
get your acts together.

231
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,911
You're two talented researchers.

232
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:23,848
One is hiding in the country.

233
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:25,041
The other one is doing this.

234
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,752
What is wrong with you guys?

235
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:29,897
Let me know if you need a job
in the research association.

236
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:31,277
A lot of people still want you.

237
00:15:31,301 --> 00:15:32,931
Whatever. Stop talking nonsense.

238
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:34,448

For your birthday.

241
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,272
It's charcoal made of a
tree struck by lightning.

242
00:15:41,772 --> 00:15:43,522
It'll keep demons away from you.

243
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:47,232
This is so childish.

244
00:15:47,691 --> 00:15:49,571
You must move on.

245
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,872
Young Soo. I'm already dead.

246
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,411
Thank you.

Yes.

251
00:16:36,201 --> 00:16:37,951
She'll be going to school.

252
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:40,992
She'll like it.

253
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,372
That's popular
among kids that age.

254
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,632
Gosh. This isn't working.

255
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,012
Is that for Dad's birthday?

256
00:17:00,642 --> 00:17:02,892
I'm going to record
my voice for Dad.

257
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:04,732
What are you going to say?

258
00:17:05,351 --> 00:17:07,958
If you press it once,
it makes a sound.

259
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,442
- If you press it twice...
- I know.

260
00:17:12,151 --> 00:17:13,321

Hello.

290
00:23:04,673 --> 00:23:06,712
Hey, Won Seok.
You're late today.

291
00:23:07,172 --> 00:23:09,722
Yes, I had a lot of work today.

292
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:12,682
Can I get a rolled
omelet and soju?

293

Will that be enough?

By the way, is your
mother doing okay?

295
00:23:22,391 --> 00:23:25,732
Her backaches are chronic,
so it's always the same.

296
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:31,047
She has a hard-working son, so
I'm sure she feels reassured.

297
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:32,282
Right, well...

298
00:23:53,301 --> 00:23:55,391

something wrong with your eyes?

No...

Gosh, why is it raining so much?

301
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:08,151

304
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:14,821
Maybe you should see a doctor.

- Won Seok.
- No, I'm fine.

306
00:24:19,412 --> 00:24:21,081

wouldn't do this.

- I told you I don't have any!

- Give me some money.
- Stop it!

319
00:25:27,022 --> 00:25:28,192

327

- Hey! That's enough!

- Let go of me!

But it's good. Try it.

335

I don't want any.

336
00:26:37,591 --> 00:26:41,641

persons case...

you do volunteer work?

we created a software that
is able to do profiling.

me when I talk to you.

347
00:27:04,242 --> 00:27:05,371
Give it back.

348
00:27:05,912 --> 00:27:07,662
- What is it?
- Give it back.

349
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,712
- Should I meet your teacher?
- Give it back.

350
00:27:11,621 --> 00:27:12,791

351
00:27:14,252 --> 00:27:15,962

until the weekend.

While they were in
a nursing facility,

356
00:27:40,071 --> 00:27:42,258
they left suddenly at 3am.

357
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:43,742
Okay. I'll be there.

00:28:17,401 --> 00:28:20,151
Why must I take on the
burden when she's sick?

362
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,282
The hospital fees alone are
a couple thousand a month.

363
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,662
Why do I have to
pay for all of that?

364
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,371
What is that?

365
00:28:30,581 --> 00:28:32,267
Why?

366
00:28:32,291 --> 00:28:33,871
Gosh darn it!

367
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:37,188
- What is he...
- I'm going to kill everyone!

368
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:38,381
(Taxi)

369
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:40,672
Oh, my gosh!

370
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:48,141
What's up with him?

371
00:28:50,012 --> 00:28:51,262
That startled me.

372
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:54,982
(Jinyang Police,
Chunggeum Patrol Station)

373
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:01,942
(Police)

374
00:29:10,742 --> 00:29:11,871
My gosh.

375
00:29:36,772 --> 00:29:38,482
- What's going on?
- You're here.

376
00:29:41,772 --> 00:29:43,071
Isn't that Won Seok?

377
00:29:44,151 --> 00:29:47,087
Why would you have him
handcuffed? He's such a good guy.

378
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:50,571
He beat up the owner
of a downtown bar.

379
00:29:50,662 --> 00:29:51,952
What?

380
00:29:53,331 --> 00:29:54,791
That softie did?

381
00:29:54,831 --> 00:29:57,252
Don't come closer! Don't!

382
00:29:57,912 --> 00:30:00,267
Stay away from me, Dad!

383
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,922
Stay away! Darn it!

384
00:30:04,212 --> 00:30:05,551
What's wrong with him?

385
00:30:14,811 --> 00:30:15,851
Won Seok?

386
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:18,601
Won Seok?

387
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,861
Won Seok, are you okay?

388
00:30:24,272 --> 00:30:25,361
Won Seok?

389
00:30:27,861 --> 00:30:28,952
Won Seok.

390
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:48,398
Don't move! Hold him down!

391
00:30:48,422 --> 00:30:49,472
Okay!

392
00:30:51,262 --> 00:30:52,472
Darn it.

393
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,222
Don't just stand there!
Call an ambulance!

394
00:31:08,442 --> 00:31:09,782
What's wrong with him?

395
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:12,111
We'll have to get to
the hospital first.

396
00:31:12,361 --> 00:31:14,718
We've never had a
patient like him,

397
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:16,702
so it's really hard to say.

398
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:38,601
See you later, okay?

399
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:47,111
(Jung Ha Young)

400
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:50,861
Ms. Lee!

401
00:31:52,492 --> 00:31:54,032
Ms. Lee!

402
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:59,202
So you were home.

403
00:31:59,242 --> 00:32:01,541
Yes. What brings you here?

404
00:32:01,662 --> 00:32:06,631
The whole town is in a panic because
of the black rain from yesterday.

405
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,027
Everyone's gathering
at the county office

406
00:32:10,051 --> 00:32:11,462
to discuss what to do.

407
00:32:11,631 --> 00:32:12,762
Let's go together.

408
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,158
I already have plans today.

409
00:32:16,182 --> 00:32:19,238
But it's best to attend.

410
00:32:19,262 --> 00:32:23,077
We don't even know if we'll
get compensated for this mess.

411
00:32:23,101 --> 00:32:27,127
It would be nice if someone
intellectual like you could join us.

412
00:32:27,151 --> 00:32:29,732
Come on, let's go. Or do
you have to leave right now?

413
00:32:29,901 --> 00:32:31,458
Not right now, but...

414
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,888
Great. I'll treat you to
lunch on our way back,

415
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,202
so let's hear what
they have to say. Okay?

416
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:59,488
The unexpected weather from
yesterday in Jinyang-gun

417
00:32:59,512 --> 00:33:02,022
caused traffic accidents
and damage to the farms.

418
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:05,708
Last night, a taxi driver
surnamed Kim ran into a guardrail

419
00:33:05,732 --> 00:33:08,311
on the main road of Jinyang
and passed away on the spot.

420
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:12,111
The number of nearby farms damaged
by the rain is also increasing.

421
00:33:12,442 --> 00:33:13,877
Police said they inquired

422
00:33:13,901 --> 00:33:16,087
the National Institute
of Environmental Research

423
00:33:16,111 --> 00:33:19,071
to determine the cause of
last night's unusual weather.

424
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:26,412
Good morning, residents
of Jinyang-gun.

425
00:33:27,002 --> 00:33:29,648
In a short while, a meeting will
be held at the county office

426
00:33:29,672 --> 00:33:31,978
- regarding yesterday's black rain.
- Go park the car, okay?

427
00:33:32,002 --> 00:33:34,898
We understand you are busy,
but this is for our town.

428
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:40,722
So your attendance will
be highly appreciated.

429
00:33:41,551 --> 00:33:44,022
- I repeat.
- Let's go, Ms. Lee.

430
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:49,418
The meeting regarding the
black rain will start shortly.

431
00:33:49,442 --> 00:33:53,337
Your attendance will
be highly appreciated.

(Jinyang-gun Cultural Festival:

434
00:34:03,702 --> 00:34:04,992
A Buddha statue?

435
00:34:06,871 --> 00:34:08,412
What's wrong, Ms. Lee?

436
00:34:11,251 --> 00:34:13,921
That Buddha statue
is our town's mascot.

437
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:17,171
It'll be put on
display over there.

438
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:20,698
The town's making a
big deal out of it,

439
00:34:20,722 --> 00:34:22,801
expecting tourists to flood in.

440
00:34:23,051 --> 00:34:26,142
- To attract tourists?
- Yes. Didn't you know?

441
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:27,852
Deok Soon?

442
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:32,497
- Gosh, ma'am.
- How are things over at your place?

443
00:34:32,521 --> 00:34:34,457
It's a total mess.

444
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:37,992
The whole farm is black now.

445
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:41,162
This is truly unbelievable.

446
00:34:41,821 --> 00:34:44,622
Who in the world will
compensate for all of this?

447
00:34:46,372 --> 00:34:49,727
- I didn't see that coming.
- Me neither.

448
00:34:49,751 --> 00:34:52,832
We understand you are busy,

449
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:55,357
but this is for our town.

450
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,988
- So your attendance...
- The kids got drenched in rain.

451
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,857
Will be highly appreciated.
