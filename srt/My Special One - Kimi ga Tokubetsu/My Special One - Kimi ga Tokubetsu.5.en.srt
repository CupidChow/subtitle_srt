"I will never fall in love again."

00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:11,720
I will never fall in love again.

00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,725
[narrator] This is actress Emika Nanase.

5
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,937
She has starred in several
hit movies and TV dramas.

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:24,149
She's the number-one up-and-coming actress
with both beauty and acting skills.

7
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:28,528
I can't hide my feelings anymore!

00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:34,451
I don't need a pumpkin carriage
or glass slippers.

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,453
I'll come to you.

11
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,333
So cute! Emika Nanase is so precious!

12
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,336
Agreed. Even girls would fall for her!

13
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,504
-[giggling]
-Totally!

14
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,714
[Emika] Wow, thanks!

15
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,094
But... things never really
work out the way I want.

16
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:56,431
The title of the new TV series
has been confirmed.

17
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:58,642
-I'll leave the project plan here.
-Okay.

18
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:02,104
Your co-star has been decided, too.

19
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,356
I look forward to working with you!

20
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,024
Likewise.

Their Troublesome Romance"?

22
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,118
Eh...

23
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:19,162
"The co-star and romantic interest is..."

24
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,709
What?!

25
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:34,720
I'll do anything and everything you want.

26
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:40,142
[Sahoko] What I want to do
with Kota right now is...

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:59,453
Not good. This won't do!

28
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,121
As a gloomy nerd,

29
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:04,583
I'm nowhere near ready
to kiss a super idol!

00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,097
Hello?

33
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,974
Sahoko, it's an emergency!

34
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,852
Emergency? What happened?

35
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:28,190
Actually, my drama series is
starting soon,

36
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,816
and my co-star is...

37
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:31,818
KANATO ASUMA AS REN HIIRAGI

38
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,903
Kanato?

39
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,656
And he's your romantic interest!

40
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,908
It's your opportunity to get closer!

41
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,827
That's right!

42
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:48,460
But... Kanato doesn't see me that way.

43
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,420
Is that so?

44
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,758
Until now, I've been trying
to hide my feelings for him

45
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,427
by pretending to be his easygoing friend.

46
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,763
Wow. You really are an actress.

47
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,935
Emika, you must be
very experienced in love.

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,728
What?

49
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,898
Oh... Yes.

50
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,526
I guess. What's wrong?

51
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,991
[hesitantly] Actually...

52
00:03:21,827 --> 00:03:23,120
With Gorilla...

53
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,539
-Gorilla?
-Oh, right...

54
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,959
I don't want to expose his identity,
so I'll call him that publicly.

55
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,795
[chuckling] I see.

56
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,757
It was already presumptuous of me
to fall for him,

57
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,134
but now we're even dating.

58
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,470
I'm well aware that I'm undeserving
of this relationship, but...

59
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,975
Hey, Sahoko.

60
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,143
Sahoko?

61
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,603
The thing is,

62
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:54,776
he's kissed me on the cheek before,
but beyond that...

63
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,906
I mean, about that...

64
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,786
I was wondering if there is any way
for us to reach that point.

65
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,330
"That"?

66
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,291
You mean kissing?

67
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,959

NOTE: SAHOKO FORGOT ABOUT
THE KISS AT THE SHRINE

69
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:18,091
Well, for a gloomy nerd like me
who hasn't learned the ways of dating,

70
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,093
it feels like a long road
with no end in sight.

71
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:26,057
So, I'd like to receive guidance from you,
someone experienced in the art of love.

72
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:28,435
-Guidance?
-I'm begging you!

73
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,648
Okay, I got it.

74
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,026
[sighs]

75
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,528
Well, let's both do our best.

76
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,990
Thank you very much! Let's do our best!

77
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,535

the popular actress began to give
love advice to the gloomy nerd.

86
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,837
Dates should be simple,
like just watching a movie together.

87
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,755
It lets you get close naturally.

88
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:40,882
Also... A planetarium would be good.

00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,884
EMIKA'S FLIRTING TIP NO. 1
GO PLACES YOU CAN GET CLOSE

90
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,678
The public ones aren't as crowded.

91
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,513
I see.

92
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,351
Then, try offering your hand to him
when the movie reaches the climax.

93
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,398
If you hold hands,
you might get in the mood to kiss!

94
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:01,236
Holding... hands?

95
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,322
EMIKA'S FLIRTING TIP NO. 2
REACH OUT YOUR HAND AT THE RIGHT TIME

96
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:06,199
Okay, I'll do my best!

97
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,247
You should always
have a natural smile during dates.

98
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,249
Make sure to practice thoroughly.

99
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:22,299
Once you've closed the distance,
get close to his face and gaze up at him.

EMIKA'S FLIRTING TIP NO. 3
ALWAYS SMILE! LOOK UP AT HIM

101
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,474
Aren't you forgetting something?

102
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,727
Something like that.

103
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,147
[hesitates] So cute!

104
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:40,650
But... But wait...

105
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,154
I think that might be
too difficult for me...

106
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,157
Don't say that! Just practice doing it.

107
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,121
Okay.

108
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,625
Aren't you forgetting something?

109
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,378
Aren't you forgetting something?

Aren't you forgetting something?

trying to pick a fight.

[Emika] Congrats!

118
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:33,411
I start filming the drama
with Kanato today!

119
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,039
I'll do my best to get closer to him!

-[gasps] I see! All the best!
-[crew members] Good morning!

[Emika] You can do it!

122
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,010
[Kanato] Morning.

123
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,264
First day, huh?

124
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,642
Yeah. Hope everything goes well.

125
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,687
[Emika] He looks so good in a suit!
Thank you!

126
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,563
He looks so cool, as always.

127
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,524
I love him, I love him, I love him!

128
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,775
HIS FACE IS A WORK OF ART

129
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,361
Hey, your voice doesn't sound
too good today.

130
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:07,862
Did you drink too much?

131
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:11,533
Wrong, I just slept
with the air conditioner on.

132
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,326
I don't drink every night, you know.

133
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,745
I see. My bad.

134
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:21,209
[Emika] Oh, man, he really
doesn't see me that way at all.

135
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,920
Well, I'm looking forward
to working with you.

136
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,672
Got it.

137
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,928
[crew members] Good morning!

138
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,056
[chattering indistinctly]

139
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,895
[Emika] But... I swear I'll get closer
to Kanato during the filming!

140
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,404
[Kota] I'm so excited.

141
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,618
[Sahoko] When the movie begins
and we get into the mood...

142

Now, it's time to solve the mystery.
Now, it's time to solve the mystery.

144

-Emika.
-Yes?

145
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,423
Here's the updated script.

146
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,134
-The story's getting really juicy!
-Really?

147
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,511
-I'm counting on you.
-Likewise.

148
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,519
[Emika] "Ren grabs Tsubasa
by her shoulders, turns her towards him,

149
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:23,063
and kisses her."

150
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,319
"Ren grabs Tsubasa by her shoulders,
turns her towards him, and kisses her."

151
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,571
Oh, my god!

152
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,158
Wait... Hold on. What?

153
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:36,993
Hold on a second!

154
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:41,414
A kiss scene with Kanato?

155
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,250
Awesome!

156
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,336
Oh, God, what do I do? What now?

157
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,390
Try offering your hand to him
when the movie reaches the climax.

158
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,437
If you hold hands,
you might get in the mood to kiss!

159
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,084
[Sahoko] This is so difficult!

160
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:37,262
[sniffles]

161
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,685
That was a good movie.

162
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,605
Despite their difference in status,

163
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:50,567
the prince and the heroine fell in love
across time and space.

164
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:55,655
I can't help but see ourselves in them...

165
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:05,498
[Sahoko] All right! I did it!

-What?

168
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,055
I thought the prince died in the shipwreck
for sure, but he survived...

169
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,100
I'm glad it was a happy ending.

170
00:11:26,186 --> 00:11:28,855
[crying] I...

171
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,775
I wouldn't be able to do it!

172
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,986
[kids] Why's he crying?

173
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:37,989
[Kota] Sorry.

174
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,748
[Sahoko] Not good.
He's not in the mood for kissing at all.

175
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,835
I want to talk about my thoughts
for the next five hours.

176
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,922
-Okay, let's go somewhere and...

00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,257
Gimme a sec.

178
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,220
It's from Tsuyuguchi.

179
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,516
What? We have a last-minute filming?

180
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,519
-I'm really sorry, Sahoko.
-It's okay.

181
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,356
I'll make this up to you!

182
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,107
-I'm really sorry!
-It's okay.

183
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:14,484
[Kota] Really sorry!

184
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,867
[Sahoko sighs] What a shame.

185
00:12:25,787 --> 00:12:27,121
Next time, for sure!

186
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:28,915
I'LL TRY AGAIN ON OUR NEXT DATE!

187
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,628
[Emika] On my end, the drama filming
is progressing smoothly.

188
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,135
We're definitely growing closer
as castmates, but...

189
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,399
I'm making no progress
whatsoever romantically!

190
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:55,942
[sighs]

191
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,193
[Kanato] Emika.

192
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,280
The director revised part of the script.

193
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,447
Really?

194
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,952
-It's for this section, scene number 16.
-Okay.

195
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,833
What? Is there something on my face?

196
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,503
No, just realizing how big
your eyes are up close.

197
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,588
DISAPPOINTED

198
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,969
You mean I have bulging eyes?
Like an alien?

199
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,472
I get it.
I look like an eyeball monster, don't I?

200
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,017
I didn't say that.

201
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,893
You're right. I'm sorry.

202
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,356
When I was a child, a boy made fun of me
and said I had bulging eyes.

203
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,111
I'm still a little
self-conscious about it.

204
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,992
Sometimes, I even put on makeup
to make my eyes look smaller.

205
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,076
Really?

206
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,620
But you have such pretty eyes...

207
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,459
Anyway, that boy must have
had a crush on you.

208
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,379
Guys sometimes pick on girls they like
to get a reaction out of them.

209
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,719
Emika, I think
you look adorable as you are.

210
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,932
Anyway, about this scene...

211
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,519
He says we need to stare at each other.

212
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,814
Yeah, just like this.

213
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,488
[Emika] I'm so happy!

214
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:29,118
I never knew I'd feel so happy to hear
the person I like say I'm fine as I am!

215
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,496
[phone vibrating]

216
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,541
How are things going at the shoot?

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,795
[Emika] I managed
to secure another date with Kota!

218
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,839
I'll do my best
and keep your advice in mind!

219
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,181
Sorry, Sahoko.

220
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:56,020
Those tips I gave you
are just things I heard from others.

221
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,066
EMIKA! KOTA ASKED ME ON A PARK DATE!
I HOPE WE GET TO KISS!

222
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,235
-[Kota] Will you?
-I'm opening it. Ta-da!
-[Kota] Will you?
-I'm opening it. Ta-da!

223
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,778
Wow, amazing! [laughs]

224
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,364
-I did my best to make this.
-Wow!

225
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,491
It looks so good.

226
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,952
It's nice and quiet here.
There aren't many people.

227
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,037
-Right.
-We can just relax.

228
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,122
Yeah.

229
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,834
I'm sneaking in a bite!

230
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:21,504
Wow, it's delicious! [chuckles]

231
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:26,884
Get closer to his face
and glance upwards to him.

232
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,011
I'm so happy.

233
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:38,437
Sorry.

234
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,940
I'm sorry for not asking first!

235
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,401
I won't do it again, so don't glare at me!

236
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,781
[sighs] No, I wasn't glaring at you.

237
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,077
-What? You don't hate me?
-I don't.

238
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,203
-No?
-No.

239
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,788
-Really?
-Really.

240
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:58,541
Thank goodness! [laughs]

241
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,294
[Sahoko] This isn't working.
I should give up on kissing.

242
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,463
I suddenly remembered
what you did back then.

243
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:09,802
During my scandal,
didn't you walk around with a demon mask?

244
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,059
[yelling] LiKE LEGEND! Chin up!

245
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:18,728
We're rooting for you!

246
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,771
-Stay positive!
-[Kota] If not for your support,

247
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,649
I might have given up.

248

I saw your dancing. You're really good.

251
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,982
No, this isn't good enough.
The other kids are way better.

252
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:10,029
I see. I think you look cool
because you danced as hard as you could.

253
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,906
No way, I suck.

254
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,327

I've done this for many years.

260
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:58,369
Hmm, but I actually prefer
the kind of dance you were doing.

261
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,582
It's not about skill and techniques.

262
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,751
The best dancers
are the ones who dance their heart out.

263
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,922
So, your dancing was really awesome!

264
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:15,219
-Got it. Thanks!
-Yeah. [chuckles]

265
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,931
All the best. See you.

00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,766
-See you.
-You can do it!

267
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:36,032
When I was a kid, there was a time
I made my dance instructor angry.

268
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,329
"Why do you only care about
dancing perfectly?"

269
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:44,832
"You should dance in a way
that moves people!"

270
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,378
I didn't understand
what he meant back then,

271
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,006
but I think I get it now.

272
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:57,053
Even if you're bad or make a mistake,

273
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,264
it's more important
to dance with all your heart.

274
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,603
I'm sure that kid will realize
that soon enough.

275
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:11,233
I want to do my best
so that kids like him look up to me.

276
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:23,204
You're really incredible, Kota.

277
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,793
I...

278
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,754
I feel small next to you.

Both you and Emika...

280
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,177
You two work so hard
to be someone people admire.

281
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:40,930
Sometimes I wonder
if it's really all right

282
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,100
for someone insignificant like me
to stay beside you.

283

Sahoko.

284
00:19:56,737 --> 00:20:01,742
I can do my very best because I know
you're always cheering for me.

285
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,288
The fact that I can dance
and sing for everyone

286
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,291
is because I know you're right beside me.

287
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,587
So please...

288
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,132
don't ever say that again.

Yes. You've been a great help, Emika.

Sorry.

Actually, those tips weren't mine.

It was all stuff I learned
from romance comics and movies.

303
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,049
To tell you the truth, I...

304
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,307
I've never been in a relationship.

305
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,853
I've been chasing after Kanato
this entire time,

306
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,692
so I've never gone out with anyone else.

307
