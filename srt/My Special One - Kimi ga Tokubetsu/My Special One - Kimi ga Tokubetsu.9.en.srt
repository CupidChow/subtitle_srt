00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,629
THE DAY BEFORE LiKE LEGEND'S
7TH ANNIVERSARY LIVE CONCERT

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,714
Good work.

3
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:07,090
Good work.

4
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,259
All right, guys!

5
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,054
Let's do our best
for tomorrow's live concert...

6
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,305
Wait.

7
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,726
Tsuyuguchi, are we using the same video
as the previous concert?

8
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:18,977
Yeah, that's right.

9
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,480
Can't we come up with something else?

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,235
Well, we weren't able to film new footage
due to all the schedule conflicts.

11
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,863
Still, I don't think it's right
to use the same video.

12
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:33,492
We're short on time,
so I don't think we have a choice.

13
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,370
[Itsuki] That reminds me, Yu.

14
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,624
We haven't uploaded a new YouTube video
in a while. What should we do?

15
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,002
-I have a few ideas in mind.
-What?

16
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,837
-Just look forward to it.
-Seriously?

17
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:48,423
-[chuckling] What is it?
-[Itsuki] Tell us!

18
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:50,259
-[Yu] It's a secret.
-[Kota] No way!

19
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,190
[Sahoko] Believe it or not,
I, Sahoko Wakaume,

20
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:08,193
have joined LiKE LEGEND's cooking staff

21
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,863
for their 7th anniversary live concert!

22
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,996
[Sahoko] I'm so grateful to Kota.

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:23,000
He knows how to bring out the girl in me
when we're together.

24
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:28,922
I'll do all I can to repay him,
even if just a little.

25
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,678
But what can I do to help?

26
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,731
I'm drawing a blank.

27
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,983
Let's think again
after I return to the hotel.

28
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,864
What was Kota's room number again?

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,369
[Sahoko] If I go to his room...

30
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,955
Welcome, Sahoko.

31
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,208
We might do this...

32
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,919
-[Kota] Whoo!
-[Sahoko] ...or that...

33
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,921
Yay! [chuckles]

34
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,381
[Sahoko] ...or other sorts of things!

35
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,593
Sahoko.

36
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,055
Now, I'll...

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,101
[Sahoko] Don't get ahead of yourself,
Sahoko Wakaume!

38
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,687
This overnight trip is just for work!

39
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,191
As the sixth member of LiKE LEGEND,

40
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,486
I must focus on making
the most delicious food for them!

41
00:02:33,195 --> 00:02:35,906
Sorry. I called you here
and ended up being late myself.

42
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,325
Don't be.
I should apologize for the inconvenience.

43
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,371
Yu, you're going to take me
to the hotel, right?

44
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,664
That's right.

45
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:48,502
By the way, there's something
we'd like you to help with.

46
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,504
-You need help?
-Right.

47
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:54,466
We'd like you to help us out
for our YouTube video.

48
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,470
I see... Sure, if I can be of any help.

49
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,847
Really? Thanks!

50
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,140
In that case...

51
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,518
-Here you go.
-What?

52
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,186
PRANK IS A SUCCESS!

53
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,481
[clears throat] So,
could you take these two things

54
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,693
and sneak into Kota's room tonight?

55
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,404
Excuse me?

56
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:17,072
[both laugh]

57
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:19,282
-[chuckles] This isn't funny.
-I mean, you look great.

58
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,951
-[Yu] It suits you.
-Right, it'll work.

59
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,202
-It suits me?
-[Yu] Let's go!

60
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,412
-It's perfect.
-What?

61
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,497
DRAMA "MY SPECIAL ONE"

62
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,374
[♪ opening theme song playing]

63
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,367
DRAMA "MY SPECIAL ONE"

64
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,452
FINAL EPISODE

65
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,670
[Sahoko] The YouTube video
will be a wake-up prank.

66
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,925
Cameras have been installed
in various areas inside the room,

67
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:25,724
and my job is to barge into the room
with this signboard and handheld camera.

68
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,854
And of course, the target is Kota.

69
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,818
Still, can I really pull off
a wake-up prank?

70
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:43,366
But helping LiKE LEGEND with this
might be a good way to repay Kota.

71
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,244
[Yu over radio] All right. Go in, Sahoko!

72
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,871
Got it!

73
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,009
[lock beeps]

74
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:07,182
All right.
I can't wait to see his reaction.

75
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,143
-Our leader's a huge scaredy-cat.
-[both chuckle]

76
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,233
[Sahoko] Kanato and the others
will arrive later.

77
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,735
[Sahoko] All right.

78
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,378
[whispering] Now, I'm going to...

79
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:41,925
start the prank!

80
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,684
Good morning!

81
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:55,313
[in normal voice] Hello?

82
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:02,237
Pokey-poke!

83
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,075
[Kota groans softly]

84
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,119
[Sahoko sighs] Tickle time!

85
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,663
[Kota groans softly]

86
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:16,001
What now? He's not waking up at all.

87
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:20,171
[laughs] Kota's sleeping like a log!

88
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:21,256
Wait...

89
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,341
Wait, that room's...

90
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,053
All right. In that case...

91
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,768
This is my last resort.

92
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,357
Tickle, tickle, tickle! Come on, wake up!

93
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,402
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

94
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:47,991
Haru?

95
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,826
Sahoko...

96
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,495
[screaming]

97
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:56,833
-Why are you here?
-What's wrong, Sahoko? [panting]

98
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,714
What's going on?

99
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,092
No, wait!

100
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:08,136
You've got the wrong idea. Actually...

101
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:11,139
-It's for a prank video...
-You got me all flustered.

102
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,807
This is bad for my heart.

103
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,643
-[Kota] What?
-Hold on!

104
00:07:14,726 --> 00:07:16,728
It's not what it looks like. Actually...

105
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:18,355
Anyway, why are you two here?

106
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,358
-Stop feigning ignorance.
-What?

107
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,987
-What are you doing to my Sahoko?
-Kota!

108
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:28,073
-[Haru] I can't breathe...
-Kota! Please stop!

109
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,407
Haru's innocent!

110
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,494
How dare you make Sahoko say that!

111
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,664
-Stupid Haru! I hate you!
-[Haru] It hurts! It hurts!

112
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,249
-I hate LiKE LEGEND!
-[Haru] Hey, it hurts!

113
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,668
[Sahoko] Kota!

114
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,086
Look at this!

115
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,671
PRANK IS A SUCCESS!

116
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,715
Wait, what?

117
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,301
Seriously?

118
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,262
-See?
-[Yu] Kota, look at the camera.

119
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,098
Camera?

120
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,100
I think it's over there.

121
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:56,851
LiKE LEGEND
1 JANUARY 2025

122
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,353
Oh, I see.

123
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:04,526
This is a prank video I came up with
for our YouTube channel.

124
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,819
Sorry!

125
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,405
Haru didn't know anything.

126
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,490
[Kota] Really? Is that true?

127
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:16,162
Yu and Tsuyuguchi. Where are you guys?

128
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:19,290
I'll make sure
you two apologize to me later.

129
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,502
[both] Okay.

130
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,338
Jeez, don't scare me like that.

131
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:26,756
[softly] I'm sorry.

132
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,759
[chuckles softly] It's okay.

133
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,980
SHOW OUR GRATITUDE TO THE FANS
AND A MESSAGE FROM LiKE LEGEND

134
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,486
[both] We're truly sorry
for what we've done.

135
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,574
In short, you asked Sahoko
to do a wake-up prank on Kota

136
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,409
but mistook his room number for mine?

137
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,493
I'm really sorry!

138
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,246
Why did you ask Sahoko to help?

139
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:05,336
Actually, we tried to play a prank
on Kanato and Itsuki, but...

140
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,010
Where is he?

141
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,054
[Yu exclaims]

142
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,555
[Yu] The moment the door closed,

143
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,349
-Kanato put me in a stranglehold.
-Okay! I give up!

144
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:22,645
Anyone can see a prank coming when you
amp yourselves up right outside the door.

145
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,649
And Itsuki sprang a counter-prank on us.

146
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,040
[screams]

147
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,667
[Itsuki chuckling] Hear me out!

148
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:49,255
Tsuyuguchi mistakenly sent the message
about my prank to me instead.

149
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,883
You guys are so easy to read.

150
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,888
That's why we wanted someone else to help.

151
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,768
-We're really sorry.
-Sorry.

152
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,770
[both] Unforgivable!

153
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,355
Get 'em, guys!

154
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,233
[indistinct shouting, laughing]

155
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,654
-Wait, he ran off! Yu got away!
-[Tsuyuguchi] Hey!

156
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,364
[Kota] Yu! Yu!

157
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,492
-Wait!
-Hey!

158
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,540
-I said I'm sorry!
-[Kota] Seriously...

159
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,210
[Kota laughing]

160
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,045
That was so much fun!

161
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:32,132
-How was that even fun?
-[laughter]

162
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,844
Why are we making such a ruckus
the night before the live concert?

163
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,887
The concert's tomorrow. We should sleep.

164
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,430
-Right.
-[Kanato] Yeah.

165
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,849
[Itsuki] Let's sleep.

166
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,100
[Yu] Good night.

167
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,519
-Rest well, everyone. Good night.
-[all] Good night.

168
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:46,688
[all panting]

169
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,733
-Haru.
-Yeah?

170
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,193
Can we talk?

171
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,281
I saw the memo you wrote in your room.

172
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,782
Oh, that?

173
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,493
Were you brainstorming
about the live concert video?

174
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,953
Yeah.

175
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,788
I think it'll feel slightly different

176
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:06,541
if we at least rearrange
the previous video.

177
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,543
I guess you didn't like the original idea.

178
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,253
Well...

179
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:13,173
Since our fans are coming to our concert,

180
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:16,593
-I want them to have a special experience.
-I see.

181
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:19,220
It's a way for us
to thank them for their support.

182
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:20,305
I agree.

183
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,559
But it won't work out
unless we change the structure.

184
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,852
What?

185
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:29,522
The concert's tomorrow,
so I have to give it up.

186
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,774
-Sorry to worry you.
-It's okay.

187
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,068
-Well then, good night.
-Good night.

188
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:44,954
[sighs]

189
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:51,085
I should give this back to Yu.

190
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,050
LiKE LEGEND
1 JANUARY 2025

191
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,551
This video camera...

192
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,804
Don't tell me...

193
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,484
[beeps]

194
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,404
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

195
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:19,739
[Haru] No one is...

196
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,449
[laughing]

197
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,579
LiKE LEGEND Channel!

198
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,123
[laughing] This is funny.

199
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:33,086
Kota and the others are so adorable.

200
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,545
Haru's solo victory!

201
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,090
-Ta-da!
-Wow!

202
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,342
-Yay!
-[laughing]

203
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,510
Seriously?

204
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:46,516
[phone vibrating]

205
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,813
Sahoko?

206
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:56,901
Hello, I'd like to return
the prank camera.

207
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,363
Right. I'll come get it tomorrow.

208
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,240
Thanks.

209
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,787
Is something the matter?

210
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,581
Did something happen?

211
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,876
Did you guys perhaps have a fight
because of the prank?

212
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,211
No, that's not it.

213
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,589
Well...

214
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,928
Actually, for tomorrow's concert,

215
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,392
Haru wanted to make a special video
to express our gratitude to the fans.

216
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,895
But it didn't work out
since we're short on time.

217
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,732
Is that so?

218
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,817
Yeah.

219
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,445
Well, it can't be helped.

220
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,698
Sorry about that. Don't mind me.

221
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,536
Is that so...

222
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,000
Excuse me.

223
00:13:58,296 --> 00:13:59,422
Wow.

224
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,841
[audience cheering and applauding]

225
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,937
[Sahoko] I know
I shouldn't get carried away,

226
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,981
but I couldn't resist buying all these.

227
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,816
[light stick clicking]

228
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,112
Wait...

229
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:25,865
Hello, everyone!
I'm Kokoro Oyama, and I'm an idol.

230
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,158
Thank you for the support!

231
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,951
[director] Don't answer! You're a corpse!

232
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,412
You're...

233
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:38,252
Ah, hello, I'm Kokoro Oyama, and I joined
LiKE LEGEND's agency recently.

234
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,755
Wait, really?

235
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,842
Yes. I managed to come this far
because of my admiration for Kota.

236
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:48,679
Right, I'll have the time of my life
as part of the audience today.

237
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,975
Okay. Let's cheer for them
with all our might.

238
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,560
Right.

239
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:57,355
-[♪ intro music playing]
-[audience erupts in cheers]

240
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,861
[cheering intensifies]

241
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:04,946
[both] Wow!

242
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:06,864
[Kokoro gasps]

243
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,618
[Kokoro] Wow!

244
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,469
[cheering continues]

245
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,684
-[music stops]
-Hello! I'm LiKE LEGEND's Kota Kirigaya!

246
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,769
[audience erupts in cheers]

247
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,773
Many things happened this year.

248
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:47,071
We've caused some trouble
and also made our fans sad.

249
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,408
However,

250
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,828
thanks to all of your support,

251
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,081
we were able to stand on this stage again.

252
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,292
So,

253
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:03,796
we made a special video for all of you.

254
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,592
What? I thought they were short on time.

255
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,304
Ready, go!

256
00:16:12,263 --> 00:16:15,183
-[audience cheering]
-What are you doing?

257
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,436
Hey, that's from the prank!

258
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,814
-Wait! Hey!
-Hey!

259
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,108
I said I'm sorry!

260
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,029
-He can't laugh.
-Yu's sleeping.

261
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:30,323
[Yu chuckles]

262
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,533
All right!

263
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,204
[Kokoro laughs]

264
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,959
[Kota] Many things have happened.

265
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,591
But thanks to our fans,
we feel a lot better now.

266
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:53,304
We wanted everyone to see
how we're like offstage,

267
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,392
so, Haru and I
made this video this morning.

268
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:05,066
A staff member who's very important
to me and the other members

269
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,694
said this to me.

270
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,616
"Seeing LiKE LEGEND be their usual selves

271
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:19,038
is a special experience for me as a fan."

272
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,334
Well, it can't be helped.

273
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,629
Sorry about that. Don't mind me.

274
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,384
Is that so...

275
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,098
Wait, that reminds me.

276
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,768
Are you not using
the footage from this prank video?

277
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,563
Yeah... I don't think so.

278
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,482
-It failed anyway.
-Really?

279
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,026
That's such a shame.

280
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,612
What?

281
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,408
I apologize.

282
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,663
I was curious about
how you've been taking those videos,

283
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,750
-so, I watched them without asking.
-[chuckles softly]

284
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:08,921
-But they were really interesting.
-What?

285
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,675
It's not just the videos you took
for the YouTube channel.

286
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:18,973
I was able to see you all laugh,
get angry, or cry like your usual selves.

287
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:22,643
I couldn't take my eyes off the camera.

288
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,481
Seeing LiKE LEGEND be their usual selves

289
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,694
is a wonderful and special experience

290
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,071
for me as a fan.

291
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,159
Right...

292
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:42,371
Sorry, I forgot you have
an early day tomorrow.

293
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,293
All the best. Good night.

294
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,046
Got it. Good night.

295
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,428
Our usual selves...

296
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,015
I know you're here tonight,

297
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,977
so, you should know that you were
the one who made this video possible.

298
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,524
[Sahoko] I was able to repay Kota!

299
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,756
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

300
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,633
Thank you so much!

301
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:57,697
Now, please listen to our song,
"YOU ARE SPECiAL"!

302

-[audience cheering]
-[♪ group singing "YOU ARE SPECiAL"]

-[Itsuki] Thank you!
-[Yu] Thank you, everyone!

304
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,994
-[Itsuki] Thank you!
-[Yu] We love you!

305
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,080
-[Haru] Thank you!
-[Yu] Thank you for waiting for us!

306
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:16,757
[Sahoko] And with that, LiKE LEGEND's
7th anniversary live concert

307
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,926
ended as a great success.

308
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,140
[Kota] Help me, Sahoko!

309
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:25,558
[Sahoko] What's wrong?

310
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,270
I looked under the bed in my room
to grab my slippers,

311
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,983
and I found a talisman there! [sobbing]

312
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,402
I guess that's scary enough
to keep you up at night.

313
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,486
Yeah.

314
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,574
Kanato, Haru, Yu, or Itsuki
wouldn't stay with me.

315
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,369
You're the only one I can rely on, Sahoko.

316
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,333
[Sahoko] Wait a minute. That means...

317
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,463
Am I going to be alone with Kota
in this room until morning?

318
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,384
-[Kota] Sahoko.
-Yes?

319
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,886
[chuckles softly]

320
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:04,722
Thanks for today, as always.

321
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,390
What?

322
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,603
Thanks to you,
we had the best live concert ever.

323
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,481
You're welcome.

324
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,901
I'm glad to be able to help everyone,
even if just a little.

325
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,196
After all,
I am a LiKE LEGEND staff member now.

326
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:21,864
Right.

327
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,284
That's right! Sahoko, stand up.

328
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,119
-What?
-Just stand up.

329
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,204
Okay.

330
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,413
Close your eyes.

331
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,999
-What?
-Just listen to me!

332
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,711
-Okay.
-All right.

333
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,672
Hmm?

334
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:50,059
Done. Open your eyes now.

335
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:02,363
Thank goodness!
The size fits you perfectly. [chuckles]

336
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,532
Excuse me, what's this?

337
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,411
I bought this when I made up my mind
to visit your mother.

338
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,205
What?

339
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:17,002
In the future, there may be days
when I make you feel lonely.

340
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,509
But you should know that
I'm always thinking about you.

341
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,639
We're together, even when we're apart.

342
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,309
Just kidding!

343
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:35,020
I wanted something
that symbolizes our relationship, so...

344
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,231
See? I bought a matching pair.

345
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,784
[Sahoko sniffling softly]

346
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,203
What's wrong, Sahoko?

347
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,502
I'm just happy.

348
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:04,466
[sniffles] Me too.

349
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,887
Kota, I'll cherish you forever.

350
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:11,557
