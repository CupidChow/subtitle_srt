SET OF KOTA KIRIGAYA'S DRAMA
<i>TENSION! IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM</i>

00:00:05,214 --> 00:00:06,215
...BREAK TIME

3
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:09,801
I wanted to run my lines,
so I came to the interrogation room set,

4
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,762
and I found a pork cutlet rice bowl!

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:15,807
I thought it was just there
as a standard prop in police dramas,

6
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,770
but it turns out
that that was the director's lunch.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,313
That was so funny!

8
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,190
<i>-What's so funny about that?</i>
<i>-I don't get it.</i>

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,026
There's always a pork cutlet rice bowl
in interrogation scenes!

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,656
<i>He's been in a weird mood ever since</i>
<i>he chased after Sahoko yesterday.</i>

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,449
[speaking indistinctly, laughing]

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,534
<i>Kota.</i>

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,202
What?

14
00:00:35,953 --> 00:00:37,913
<i>Did something happen</i>
<i>between you and Sahoko?</i>

15
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,250
No, no, no. What do you mean?

16
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,544
<i>-You're so easy to read.</i>
<i>-</i>[chuckles]

17
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,337
<i>I'm surprised you can act.</i>

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,549
<i>-Anyone can see it.</i>
-Nothing happened, really!

19
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,175
[chuckling]

20
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:54,054
[Kota] <i>Actually, after I found out</i>
<i>about Sahoko's feelings...</i>

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,639
[Sahoko] Kota Kirigaya.

22
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:56,848
[hesitantly] I...

23
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,144
love you!

24
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,064
[chuckles]

25
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,358
Were you...

26
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,152
listening?

27
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,658
Good night!

28
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,704
[Kota] <i>I didn't want things</i>
<i>to become awkward between us,</i>

29
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:20,914
<i>-so I went after Sahoko.</i>
-Sahoko!

30
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,212
[Kota] <i>But instead of things</i>
<i>becoming awkward...</i>

31
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,339
I'm...

32
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,300
in love with you.

33
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,268
I've decided not to have
anyone special in my life.

34
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,812
Is that...

35
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,065
because you're an idol?

36
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,277
No, it's my personal decision.

37
00:01:51,153 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>I can't stop you from working on things,</i>

38
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,533
but I'm not gonna change.

39
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,578
Now that I know your feelings,

40
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,373
I have to break ties with you.

41
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,336
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:15,969
[Kota]<i> I ended up</i>
<i>saying goodbye to Sahoko.</i>

43
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,140
[Haru] <i>Something must've happened.</i>
<i>Tell us, Kota.</i>

44
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,643
<i>You'll feel better if you talk to us.</i>

45
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,978
<i>Tell us, Kota.</i>

46
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,189
<i>Just spill it, Kota Kirigaya!</i>

47
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>-No secrets between us.</i>
<i>-Say it, Kota.</i>

48
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:30,901
<i>-Spill it, spill it!</i>
<i>-Tell us!</i>

49
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,905
[all chanting] <i>Spill it! Spill it!</i>

50
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,033
Come on.
This is turning into an interrogation!

51
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,035
TSUYUGUCHI
EVERYONE, EMERGENCY MEETING

52
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,622
Wait, Tsuyuguchi says
we're having an emergency meeting.

53
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:49,044
"A newspaper publisher contacted me.
They are releasing this news tomorrow."

54
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,255
KOTA KIRIGAYA DUMPED HIS GIRLFRIEND
AND CAUSED HER DEATH?

55
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,091
[Kota] <i>I never expected</i>

56
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,427
<i>that this scandal would greatly impact</i>
<i>mine and Sahoko's fate.</i>

EPISODE 2

62
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,345
[reporters] Mr. Kirigaya!

63
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,515
[female reporter] Is it true
what's written in the article?

64
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,851
[male reporter]
Can we take it as the truth?

65
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:48,353
DID KOTA KIRIGAYA DRIVE HIS GIRLFRIEND
TO HER DEATH?

66
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:50,689
[man] Entertainers are a rotten bunch.

67
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:54,109
Stop running away
and just apologize already!

68
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,277
Am I right?

69
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:02,659
Keep this up,
and next time I see you will be in court.

70
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,411
[nervously] Okay.

71
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,164
Thanks for the food.

72
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,126
Thank you.

73
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,589
This has got to be fabricated.

74
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,222
I don't like this.
It feels like I'm running away.

75
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,350
I want to tell everyone the truth!

76
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,978
The truth?

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,606
"Rei liked me."

78
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,484
<i>But I couldn't return her feelings."</i>

79
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,069
Is that what you're going to say?

80
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:45,202
You've gotta think about
how Rei's parents must feel too.

81
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:47,954
[doorbell ringing]

82
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,624

[doorbell ringing continues]

84
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,630
FOUND KOTA KIRIGAYA'S HOUSE!

85
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,881
HE'S ON THE TOP FLOOR

86
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,716
They even found your home address.

87
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,343
[doorbell ringing continues]

88
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,263
Kota, you need to evacuate.

89
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,350
What?

90
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,271
Hey, you.

91
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,649
Were you on the top floor?

92
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:17,943
Hey.

93
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:21,905
[Kota] Ow!

94
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,786
It's rocking so much.

95
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,123
I'm scared. I can't see!

96
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:33,375
Quiet. Stop talking.

97
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,461
My hair's caught on the duct tape.

98
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,005
I can't take it off.

99
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,219
Is it better if I lie face down?

100
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,055
Or should I lie on my back?

101
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,724
-Just shut up already!
-Oh, no.

102
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,393
I need the toilet.

103
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,020
Hmm...

104
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,480
Where are we going?

105
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,023
To the agency?

106
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,484
You'll see when we get there.

107
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,529
What does that mean?

108
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,992
-That hurt! Are we there?
-[Kanato] Hello.

109
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,618
-[people chattering indistinctly]
-What?

110
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,287
Kanato?

111
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,080
Are we there yet?

112
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,832
Are we at the office?

113
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,250
Wait, you're scaring me.

114
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,295
I've brought you Kota Kirigaya.

115
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,379
We arrived?

116
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,093
[sighs]

117
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,305
Huh?

118
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,389
What's this?

119
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,141
What about the office?

120
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,561
Our homes and office are known.

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,773
Sahoko, can he hide out here for a while?

122
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,111
What?

123
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,364
[Kota] <i>I ended up living</i>
<i>at Sahoko's place.</i>

124

00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,746
<i>Right after I rejected her like that.</i>

126
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,914
<i>This is awkward.</i>

[chuckles softly]

129
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,754
Himari.

130
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,256
You're staying with us, right?

131
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,092
That's right! I'll be in your care.

132
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,345
Did you bring underwear?

133
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,639
Oh, no!

134
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,269
Here's your underwear.

135
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,147
Thank you.

136
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,902
Sorry for asking you
to help me buy something like this.

137
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:25,487
It's okay.

138
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,701
Wait, this many?

139
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:37,123
Well, I don't know which type you prefer,
so I got every type I saw.

140
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:41,503
Trunks, boxers, briefs, white briefs.

141
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:44,631
Even bikini briefs.

142
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:48,927
[chuckles nervously]

143
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,430
Thank you very much.

144
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,976
Which ones should I wear?
[chuckles softly]

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,480
I've prepared the bath,
so you can use it first.

146
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,235
Ah, Hima.

147
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,656
I was told that I could get water
from the fridge, but can I help myself?

148
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,950
-Sure.
-[chuckles] Thanks.

149
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,954
Hmm? What's wrong?

150
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,457
Kota, your face is as red
as the Red Demon.

151
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:20,959
THE RED DEMON THAT CRIED

152
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,211
No way. [chuckles]

153
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,213
Maybe I soaked too long.

154
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:28,383
-Do you have a fever?
-I'm not sure.

155

00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,434
I'm sorry to put you through
so much trouble.

158
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,815
You've done nothing wrong.

159
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,360
What if...

160
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,165
I were really like
how the article described me?

161
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,667
What?

162
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:09,424
You've only seen my good sides.

163
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,802
But I actually might be bad.

164
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,606
That's impossible.

165
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,360
I don't believe a word that article says.

166
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:34,115
There's no way
you can't care about people.

167
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,250
She's...

168
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,878
my childhood friend.

169
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,005
What?

170
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:52,092
Her name is Rei.

171
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:55,887
To me, Rei was...

172
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,598
<i>almost like family.</i>

173
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:00,850
<i>She was someone special.</i>

174
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,105
<i>Rei was a childhood friend</i>
<i>from the same building.</i>

<i>She was always there for me.</i>

177
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,152
<i>Even when my mom died,</i>

178
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:13,530
<i>she was there to hold me up.</i>

179
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:15,365
<i>She was irreplaceable.</i>

180
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,659
