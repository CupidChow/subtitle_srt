SAHOKO WAKAUME'S DREAM THEATER:
THIS REALLY HAPPENED

2
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:12,471
I'm Sahoko Wakaume,
an introverted university student.

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:16,433
One day, I met national icon Kota Kirigaya
at the restaurant my family runs.

4
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,727
Thanks for your support.

5
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,270
Love ya.

6
00:00:22,064 --> 00:00:26,485
You're so wrong to think
you can win anyone's heart!

7
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:29,446
I'll never be your fan, you narcissist!

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,325
TO KIMURA

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,493
KNOW YOUR PLACE

10
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:39,248
[Sahoko] After a painful heartbreak,
I've decided to never fall in love again.

11
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:43,001
CUTE BOYS ARE DEMONS BEHIND MASKS!
MAX ALERT AGAINST CUTE BOYS!

12
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,878
Sahoko!

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,213
Welcome back, Sahoko!

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,631
Whaddaya want with my girl?

15
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:49,758
I'm not letting you go tonight.

16
00:00:50,384 --> 00:00:54,096
[Sahoko] I fell deep in love with him,
so I decided to go all-out.

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,389
I'm in love with you.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,016
I'm not gonna change.

19
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,103
Now that I know your feelings,

20
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,023
I have to break ties with you.

21
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,441
[Sahoko] But it all came to naught.

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,029
[reporter] ...fueled speculation
about a breakup.

23
00:01:11,113 --> 00:01:12,239
-[scoffs]
-[TV turns off]

24
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,451
[Sahoko] He got involved in a scandal,
and I wanted to help him.

25
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:19,705
-So I hid my feelings and cheered for him.
-[Sahoko] You make people shine!

26
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,999
You make people smile!

27
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,543
So keep smiling!

28
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:26,628
Sahoko!

29
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,009
I finally realized,

30
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,346
I want you to be my closest supporter.

31
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,101
But...

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm--

33
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,063
I love you, Sahoko.

34
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,777
You're lying.

35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,655
This is a dream.

36
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:59,077
I'm not lying. And it's not a dream.

37
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:04,666
[Sahoko] My mind got all jumbled up,
and I couldn't process what he said.

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,876
[tape rewinding]

39
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,919
[Sahoko] But he probably said...

40
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,921
You're lying.

41
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,424
This is a dream.

42
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,801
Yeah, you're dreaming.

43
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,513
Sahoko, don't get the wrong idea.

44
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,479
I'll give you a very, very special dream!

45
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,607
[laughing maliciously]

46
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,786
[Sahoko] And just like that,
the curtains fell on my dream theater.

47
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:43,080
MEANWHILE, KOTA...

[laughing]

52
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,801
Hey, you ready to talk yet?

53
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,553
[chuckling] So you wanna hear it?

54
00:02:59,221 --> 00:03:01,682
It's almost time to shoot

55
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:04,434
Well, whatever shall I do? [laughs]

56
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:08,355
What are you talking about?
You said you had something to tell me!

57
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,940
I'm out of time, so speak!

58
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,777
Sorry, sorry.
Actually, I went to see Sahoko.

59
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,571
Sahoko...

60
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,283
Please be my special one.

61
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:23,662
Sahoko?

62
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,832
I'm asking you to go out with me.

63
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,086
What? Right, sure.

64
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,879
Wait, really?

65
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:35,966
Yes, of course.

66
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,759
I'll go wherever you want.

67
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,930
[laughing] All right! I did it! Yay!

68
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:45,475
And with that, I'm officially
in a relationship with Sahoko--

69
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,477
-Hold on!
-What?

70
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,354
Are you sure she agreed to that?

71
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,314
What do you mean?

72
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,776
She didn't seem happy at all
that you were asking her out.

73
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,487
Besides, what kind of answer
is "I'll go wherever"?

74
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,114
I'll go wherever you want.

75
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,283
Well, I see your point.

76
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,870
Don't you think
you should confirm things with her?

77
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,622
Okay, I will.

78
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,673
HOW ARE YOU, SAHOKO? WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

79
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:19,509
[Sahoko] Is he playing with my heart?

80
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,678
Or maybe...

81
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,849
-I love you, Sahoko.
-Was that really a confession?

82
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,398
Get a grip!

83
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,860
You should've learned your lesson,
Sahoko Wakaume!

NOTEBOOK OF REMINDERS

85
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,076
He said "I love you,"
but he meant it platonically!

86
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,664
He hugged and kissed me,
but he does that to everyone!

87
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,291
He asked me to go out with him,

88
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:54,169
but it's just like how Momotaro
invited the animals to join him!

89
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:57,839
MOMOTARO

90
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,299
[laughs smugly]

91
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,220
I'm gonna go exterminate the demon,
so join me.

92
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:05,972
Woof!

93
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,474
Good.

94
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,351
[sighs]

95
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,564
This is just Momotaro
sending a message to an associate.

96
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,400
Do not get the wrong idea.

97
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,402
Reply as one of his associates!

98
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,949
-[phone vibrates]
-[gasps] Hey, she replied to my message!

99
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,743
[Sahoko] Thank you very much
for your message.

100
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,832
As it is midday,
I have just consumed my lunch.

101
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,584
You must be busy as always,

102
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,461
so please take care of your health.

103
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:37,838
From your associate.

104
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:39,089
"From your associate."

105
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,343
My confession flew over her head.

106
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,971
I thought so.

107
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,182
[whining] What do I do, Kanato?!

108
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:53,854
First off, what's with the "associate"?
Why's she being so formal?

109
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,981
It feels like she's distancing herself!

110
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,275
So, what now?

111
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,195
-What?
-Are you giving up on Sahoko?

112
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,285
[Kota] Of course I'm not giving up!

113
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:12,914
At this point,
I'd do anything to make her look at me!

would make a girl happy?

Well, of course...

you'd have to do it somewhere romantic.

wanna hang out, just you and me?

What?!

161

[Sahoko] This is not a date.

never forget that you're his associate.

00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,808
-[Kota] Wow, look at all those fish!
-[Sahoko] What a cool place.

179
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:46,229
[chuckling] Wow, it's huge!

180
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,440
There's so many fish! [chuckling]

181
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:51,151
-Holy moly!
-What?

182
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:53,069
-It's a spotted eagle ray!
-Spotted what?

183
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,114
A near-threatened species
that eats tons of crustaceans!

184
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,657
-Wow.
-Like crab and shrimp!

185
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,159
-You know your stuff.
-[laughing]

186
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:00,827
This is so fun!

187
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,246
Wow, look at all these fish over here!

188
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,583
Look, it's a hammerhead shark!

189
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,335
There are rays here, too! See, Sahoko?

190
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,673
[chuckles]

191
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,717
Sorry.

192
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,887
Sahoko...

193
00:11:23,892 --> 00:11:25,727
[chuckles nervously] I'm sorry.

194
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,899
Why are you walking so far behind me?

195
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,570
Just in case.
We have to pretend we're strangers!

196
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,322
It's fine, I'm in disguise.

197
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,489
It's not fine!

198
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,950
Please, make sure you don't stand out!

199
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,452
All right...

200
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,747
Sahoko, Sahoko! Hey, Sahoko!

201
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:51,085
[Sahoko] He's way too relaxed about this.

202
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:55,381
I know this isn't a date,
but it still doesn't hurt to be cautious.

203
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,635
I need to make sure
he doesn't interact with others...

204
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,011
[Kota] Sure! [laughs]

205
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,222
-Thank you.
-You're welcome!

206
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,098
-Isn't this nice?
-Here goes...

207
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:09,354
Let me just zoom in a little...
There, just right!

208
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,105
How's that? [laughs]

209
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,690
-Let me do it...
-Say "butter"!

210
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:14,400
[laughing]

211
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,444
Gotcha. [laughs]

212
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:20,281
-How does this look?
-[gasps] This is good. You look great!

213
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,700
[Sahoko] He doesn't act like
a national icon at all.

214
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,869
That's what I like about him.

215
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,537
Oh! You're back, Sahoko.

216
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:31,709
If you'd like,
I can take a photo for you two.

217
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:32,919
-Really?
-Of course.

218
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,212
[Sahoko] A photo?!

219
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,923
KOTA KIRIGAYA SPOTTED AT HAKKEIJIMA
WITH MYSTERIOUS GIRL

220
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,717
[squeaky voice] I have no connection
to Mr. Kirigaya.

221
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,886
I'm just an associate of his.

222
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,221
VOICE ALTERED FOR PRIVACY

223
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:48,726
[Sahoko] Oh, no. Not good.
This is really not good.

224
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,436
-That can't happen!
-[woman] Say "cheese".

225
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,521
[camera shutter clicks]

226
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:53,064
How does it look?

227
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,901
[chuckling] Wow! Thank you so much!

228
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,655
All right.

229
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,824
-Sahoko, I just sent you the photo.
-[phone vibrates]

230
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,908
Oh...

231
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,038
-Uh...
-[Kota chuckles softly]

232
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,625
[Kota chuckling]

233
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,547
So good-looking...

234
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,761
[chuckles]

235
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,723
Come on, don't compliment me
out of the blue like that.

236
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,474
It's making me blush.

237
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,060
[Sahoko] So cute!

238
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,396
Okay. I should go harder.

239
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,192
You're so good-looking!
Wow, so manly! Totally hot!

240
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:41,946
You're adorable too, Sahoko.

241
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,036
-Please don't mess with me.
-That wasn't my intention.

242
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,913
I said it because I meant it.

243
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,790
What?

244
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,836
Look, Sahoko!

245
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,379
-Let's get on that!
-What?

246
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,381
-You're okay with that, right?
-No, wait...

247
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,925
-Let's go!
-Wait, hold on!

248
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:06,304
[Sahoko] Wait... What's going on?

249
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:09,557
Saying things like that
gives me the wrong idea.

250
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,564
[inaudible]

251
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,197
My aura's shining!

252
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,740
-Please keep quiet.
-What?

253
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,284
[riders screaming]

254
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,827
[Kota] Wait, it's too fast!

255
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:31,662
It's too fast!

256
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:35,666
I love you, Sahoko!

257
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,295
[chuckling]

258
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,297
DIDN'T HEAR IT

259
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,008
That was so much fun! [laughs]

260
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:46,260
-Let's ride it together, Sahoko!
-No, I'll pass...

261
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,429
-Come on! Please, just once more!
-No, thanks.

262
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,848
-I wanna ride it again!
-Let's go. Wear your hat.

263
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,017
-Why not? Let's ride it!
-Let's go! Hurry!

264
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,444
Hello, everyone! I'm an idol.
My name is Kokoro Oyama.

265
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:06,114
Thank you for all your support!

266
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,326
Thank you!

267
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,621
You can do it! I'm cheering for you!

268
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,997
[chuckles]

269
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:17,625
-Thank you!
-Yeah! [chuckles]

270
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,925
[Kota] Mmm...

271
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:28,761
Sorry about this, Sahoko.

272
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,599
If I didn't have work so early tomorrow,
we could've gone camping or had a cookout.

273
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,893
No, I wasn't expecting all that.

274
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,860
[sighs] Why are you
distancing yourself again?

275
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,736
We came here together, remember?

276
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,824
But if you get into any trouble
because of me...

277
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:53,202
It doesn't matter if we're seen together.

278
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,329
What?

279
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,125
[Sahoko] Does that mean
he's okay with a relationship?

280
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,836
If it's you, Sahoko,
it won't be a problem at all!

281
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,425
That figures.

282
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,012
If it's me,
no one will think anything of it.

283
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:15,266
[Sahoko] Even if he's seen with me,
no one would think we're on a date.

284
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:18,352
So please, don't be so worried about it.

285
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:23,733
Okay. I won't worry anymore.

286
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,067
Good. [chuckles]

287
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,362
Wait, there's something
I want to show you.

288
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,240
I'll call you over in a bit,
so go do some shopping!

289
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,326
-Okay? Go shop around. Yeah.
-Shopping?

290
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,959
[Sahoko] I feel stupid for being
so overly worried about everything.

291
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:47,715
Still, I'm glad that I didn't let myself
have one iota of expectation.

292
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:49,717
Oh...

293
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,552
[scoffs]

294
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,388
I need a tissue...

295
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,937
I'm such a liar.

296
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,858
The truth is, I'm afraid of being hurt.

297
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:10,529
[Kota] You might find a love so profound
that it heals your past wounds.

298
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:15,159
Isn't it a bit too early
to decide to be single for life?

299
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,876
Whaddaya want with my girl?

300
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:36,430
[Sahoko] Ever since then,
I've been expecting things from him.

301
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,643
You forgot this.

302
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:42,520
Thank you.

303
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,816
Sahoko...

304
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,279
You're a great cook.

305
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,864
A loving daughter who helps her family.

306
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:58,869
And a sweet girl who even worries
about guys you hate, like me.

307
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,831
Approved by a national icon.

308
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,001
Feeling better now?

309
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,805
[Sahoko] What happened
to all the courage he gave me?

310
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,899
I want to know
why he invited me out today.

311
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:34,196
I want to know how he really feels.

312
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,452
[sighs]

313
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,163
What if he actually got lost?

314
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,341
Where did he go?

315
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,220
[Kota] Huh?

316
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,056
Yikes, it got tangled up!

317
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,100
Will it light up?

318
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:09,607
Hey.

319
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,611
Sahoko?

320
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:15,988
What are you doing?

321
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,326
Forget it. Here goes!

322
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,255
Sahoko, please go out with me.

323
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,050
I'll take good care of you.

324
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,554
What?

325
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,932
What?

326
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,308
Sorry.

327
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:47,061
This is all so strange
that I don't know what to think.

328
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,271
But why? What's strange?

329
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,731
Well...

330
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,525
What's the point of that thing?

331
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,570
I was in the middle of decorating.

332
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,908
The view of the audience's light sticks
from onstage looks amazing,

333
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,618
so I tried to recreate it.

334
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,706
Then, what about the backflip?

335
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:10,000
The fans love it when I do it onstage,

336
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,129
so I thought you'd think it looked cool.

337
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,094
Sorry, that must've surprised you.

338
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:26,100
I wanted to be myself and confess to you
in the coolest way I could think of.

339
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:34,150
Sahoko?

340
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,114
You're awful.

341
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,450
Sorry.

342
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,789
Why...

343
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,543
Why are you giving me hope?

344
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,296
I want to give you hope.

345
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,468
Because I love you, Sahoko.

346
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,185
Thank you for always coming back to me.

347
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:16,567
Thank you for always cheering me on
with that loud voice of yours.

348
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:30,790
Sahoko.

349
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,211
Please be my girlfriend.

350
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,595
[grunts]

351
