1
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,133
Let me make it clear.

2
00:00:08,217 --> 00:00:10,511
She wants me, not you.

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,556
I can't believe you said that yourself.
You must be feeling really anxious.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:18,477
I don't have time to listen to someone
who talks big from the sidelines.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,855
That's rich coming from someone
who can't make a move at all.

6
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:37,037
-[director] Okay, cut! That was great!
-[Haru] Thank you.

7
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,998
-[Emika] I know we're just acting...
-[director] That seemed so real.

8
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:42,543
[Emika] ...but two national icons
fighting over me

9
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,212
is not something I'm worthy of.

10
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,048
-Wait, Emika!
-I'm so sorry!

11
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,802
[Emika] Nothing went well
between me and Kanato,

12
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,388
and all I did was cause him trouble.

13
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,890
And now, filming is about to wrap up.

14
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,059
I want to start my life all over again.

15
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,770
[director] That's a wrap
for Haru Kurusu! Good work.

16
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,814
-Thank you. Good work, everyone.
-[applause]

17
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:06,817
[Emika] Right.
Haru finishes his filming today.

18
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,195
[director] Our co-star Kanato Asuma
is also done with his filming.

19
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:12,364
-Good work.
-Good work.

20
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,991
Wait, Kanato's done too?

21
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,537
I was supposed to
wrap up filming with Emika,

22
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:23,083
but I had to finish up early
due to changes in my schedule.

23
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:24,668
Thank you, everyone.

24
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,378
-[director] Good work.
-[applause]

25
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,089
[Emika] There goes my chance
at getting close to Kanato.

26
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,257
Emika.

27
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:37,639
[Kanato] Why...
Why does she look so disappointed?

28
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,562
It was a pleasure working with you.

29
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,647
Thanks.

30
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,278
[Kanato] I don't know
what Haru's planning to do,

31
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,238
so I can't afford to bide my time.

32
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:55,449
I have to do it today.

33
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,744
Hey, are you free tonight?

34
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,412
What?

35
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:03,373
We need to talk.

36
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,003
HOYA-BOYA

37
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,048
I'm digging in! [chuckles softly]

38
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:17,012
Okay, I'll be waiting to hear
back from you. All the best.

39
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,680
Bye.

40
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,892
[Kota] Was that Nanase?

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,189
She said Kanato invited her out tonight.
He said they needed to talk.

42
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:29,483
-He's finally doing it? [laughs]
-Mmm.

43
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,943
-It seems like Emika doesn't get it yet...
-Hmm.

44
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,946
...but as her cheering squad,
I believe he'll confess his love today.

45
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,031
Cheering squad?

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,617
I, Sahoko Wakaume,

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,245
am Emika and Kanato's
self-proclaimed romance cheering squad.

48
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:44,539
Here comes the demon mask!

49
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:45,666
[both chuckle]

50
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,460
Kanato and Nanase sure are lucky.

51
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,380
They have someone like you
cheering them on.

52
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,509
I'm doing this for myself.

53
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:56,802
What?

54
00:03:00,764 --> 00:03:04,309
I love seeing smiles
on the faces of people I cherish.

55
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,230
That obviously goes for you,

56
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:12,275
but it's the same for Emika, Kanato,
and the other LiKE LEGEND members.

57
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,236
I hope all of you will smile forever.

58
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,196
That's why you're cheering us on?

59
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:20,409
Yes. After all, cheering
is the only thing I'm really good at.

60
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,536
[Kota chuckles]

61
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,500
Anyway, I wonder
where they'll be going on their date.

62
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:33,046
You think they'll go to Kanato's place?

63
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,716
Or maybe they'll have dinner
at a nice restaurant?

64
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,803
Well, the vibe's really important too.

65
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:43,140
I bet it's going to be so romantic.

66
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,020
[Emika] Why are we in the practice room?

67
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:53,316
[Kanato] It's just too soon
to invite her over to my place.

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,153
But all the restaurants are fully booked,

69
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,405
and we'll get interrupted
at our usual spot.

70
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,409
This is the only place we can be alone.

71
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,123
So...

72
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,126
Kanato, what did you want to talk about?

73
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,133
Emika. What is it you like so much
about that guy you admire?

74
00:04:18,717 --> 00:04:19,968
What?

75
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,764
[Kanato] Jeez, what am I even asking?
I'm supposed to tell her how I feel!

76
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,269
What about you, Kanato?

77
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:30,979
What?

78
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,856
Is there someone you like?

79
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,903
[Emika] Why am I asking that?
I gotta tell him how I feel!

80
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,239
Yes. I really love her.

81
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,325
What?

82
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,207
Can I ask who it is?

83
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,295
I'll tell you who I like
if you tell me who you like.

84
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,094
In that case,
should we say it at the same time?

85
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:05,806
Fine by me.

86
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,809
[Kanato] Should I tell her?

87
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,811
[Emika] Should I tell him?

88
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,855
[both] The one I like...

89
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:16,191
-Yay!
-LiKE LEGEND's in the house!

90
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,442
Wait, what?

91
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,987
What a coinkydink meeting you two here!

92
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,697
What's going on?

93
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,157
Why are you guys here?

94
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,119
We're just drinking
and talking about our future activities,

95
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,455
and we got really excited and...

96
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,959
-Let's do our best, Kanaty!
-Kanaty!

97
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,627
-Stop it.
-It's Emika!

98
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,295
You guys reek of alcohol!

99
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,257
-Well, we drank a ton!
-Yeah!

100
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:41,925
[snores]

101
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,594
What?

102
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,596
I feel sick.

103
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,306
-What?
-You're kidding.

104
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,767
[gagging]

105
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,311
-[Emika exclaims]
-No way!

106
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:55,647
What...

107
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,148
-[Yu vomiting]
-[Kanato] Hey!

108
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,525
[Emika] No!

109
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,485
What?

110
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,112
EMIKA

111
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,196
[phone vibrating]

112
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,282
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YU!

113
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,826
What's this? What's going on?

114
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,662
DRAMA "MY SPECIAL ONE"

115
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,539
[♪ opening theme song playing]

116
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,532
DRAMA "MY SPECIAL ONE"

117
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,617
EPISODE 8

118
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:52,871
I see. That would completely
kill the mood, wouldn't it?

119
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,956
It was awful.

120
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,876
I was just about to tell him how I feel.

121
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,088
Still, I'm sure
you'll have more opportunities.

122
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,258
I don't know about that.

123
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,093
Why?

124
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,557
Even if we meet again,
we'll both be busy with work,

125
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,268
and we won't have time
to have a proper talk.

126
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:18,480
Maybe we'll be stuck like this forever.

127
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,651
That's not true. Please don't give up.

128
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,778
[crew member] You're up, Nanase.

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,696
Okay.

130
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,575
Sorry, Sahoko. I have to go now.
I'll call you later.

131
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,452
Okay.

132
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,455
[sighs]

133
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,168
[Sahoko] I wonder if Emika will be okay.

134
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,963
[both] We're really sorry!

135
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,049
Why don't you forgive them?

136
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,593
Yu and Itsuki look really sorry.

137
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,304
It was a rare opportunity
to be alone with Emika,

138
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,140
and you're pissed
because they ruined it, right?

139
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:55,725
Shut up.

140
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,521
Don't be like that.
I'm sure you'll get another chance soon.

141
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:03,066
You know what they say,
"Grab the bull by the tail!"

142
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,484
It's "horns" actually.

143
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,696
What? Then that won't do!

144
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,489
What are you doing, Kanato?

145
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,324
Ask them that, not me.

146
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,327
Why would you guys
go to the practice room drunk?

147
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,456
We wanted to tell everyone
as soon as possible.

148
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,292
Tsuyuguchi told us something.

149
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:24,921
We'll be holding a live concert
for our seventh anniversary!

150
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,549
-An anniversary concert?
-Yeah.

151
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,218
All right! [laughing]

152
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,804
Our fans are going to be so happy!

153
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:35,890
That's awesome. Don't you agree, Kanato?

154
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,059
All right!

155
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,355
In preparation for the concert,
let's unite as one, and--

156
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,524
I wonder if Emika will like this.

157
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,235
Emika's not really a fan of yours, Haru.

158
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,030
And she's not yours either, is she?

159
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,199
Come on, guys...

160
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:57,370
Anyway, let's hold a kickoff party.

161
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,873
Wait, you're currently
banned from drinking.

162
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:00,999
Right, I forgot.

163
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,378
Are we going to be okay?

164
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,896
I'll tell you who I like
if you tell me who you like.

165
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,570
[Kanato] I could be reading it wrong,
but maybe the one Emika likes is...

166
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,699
No, I can't jump to conclusions.

167
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:39,412
There's no way someone like me
could inspire Emika to become an actress.

168
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,167
Still, considering everything
that's happened between us,

169
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,711
I'd say I have a chance...

170
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,922
This is annoying!

171
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,131
Good morning.

172
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,244
Can you help me, Kanato?

173
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,496
What? Who are you?

174
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,253
Are you Sahoko?

175
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,006
How'd you get in here?

176
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,051
I asked Mr. Tsuyuguchi to let me in.

177
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,804
Please accept this.

178
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,474
HOYA-BOYA
FRIED CHICKEN SET MEAL

179
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,563
A fried chicken set meal
is all it took, huh?

180
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,814
Fear not.

181
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,900
I just need to have a word with you.

182
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:52,443
A word?

183
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,279
Kanato.

184
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,615
You like Emika, right?

185
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,040
In that case,
why aren't you doing anything?

186
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,751
-I've been trying...
-Trying hard?

187
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,670
Explain in detail.

188
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:14,924
-I've been trying...
-Trying hard?

189
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,759
Explain in detail.

190
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,845
You say you're on it

191
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,557
while you wait in your comfort zone
for a chance to come.

192
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:28,313
Making excuses and doing nothing
because you're afraid of getting hurt.

193
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,193
I'm sending those words back
with double the punch!

194
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,282
After Emika wraps up filming tomorrow,

195
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,826
she'll be going overseas for a while
for a photo shoot.

196
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,620
What?

197
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,790
If you let this chance slip by,
you'll regret it for life.

198
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,718
Kanato Asuma, you can do it!

199
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,597
I'm cheering for you.

200
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:04,974
Please do your best.

201
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,658
That was a lot more than a word...

202
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,959
[Emika] When I received
this casting offer,

203
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,503
I made up my mind to do my best.

204
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,800
Still, I think I did all I could.

205
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,222
Things didn't go well
since I had no relationship experience.

206
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,807
You know so much, Kanato!

207
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,392
You're being too obvious.

208
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:53,439
But if nothing changed after all that,
I guess that means we're not meant to be.

209
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:55,817
[phone vibrates]

210
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,822
SAHOKO

211
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,949
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR LAST FILMING DAY!

212
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:08,037
I don't need a pumpkin carriage
or glass slippers.

213
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:10,123
I'll come to you.

214
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,545
[Emika] When I was young, I fell in love
with Kanato through the TV screen.

215
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,882
I joined this industry to meet Kanato.

216
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:25,305
I wanted to be the special one
who gets to stand beside him.

217
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,850
-We had nothing in common.
-Nice to meet you. I'm Emika Nanase.

218
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,934
Nice to meet you.

219
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:31,644
A kiss scene?

220
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,271
Shall we go?

221
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,566
I made the effort to approach him.

222
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:55,543
You can do it, Emika!

223
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:03,593
Emika Nanase is done with her filming!

224
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,470
Thank you, everyone!

225
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,476
[director] A word for everyone,
if you would.

226
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,643
Okay.

227
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:19,859
Well, I truly enjoyed my time
with such a splendid team

228
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,153
and the rest of
the wonderful staff members.

229
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,782
Actually...

230
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:37,126
This is a personal matter,

231
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,882
but I entered this industry
out of admiration for a certain person.

232
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,179
I wanted to meet that person,
and I wanted that person to know about me,

233
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,725
and acknowledge my skills as an actress,

234
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:56,854
and that's how
I've pushed myself to come this far.

235
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,274
Since I met this person,

236
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,653
he can be a bit mean at times,
teasing me and such,

237
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:09,659
but he's also sensitive
to the people around him.

238
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,704
He's the type of guy who would
help anyone without being asked.

239
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:21,337
For some reason, he thinks
he'll never reach the top.

240
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,841
But that is also the reason

241
00:15:26,134 --> 00:15:28,803
why he's put in so much hard work.

242
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:36,018
And I like him even more because of that.

243
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:39,939
I have to tell Kanato
how much I love him.

244
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,357
That person is Kanato.

245
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:45,403
To be able to co-star with him,
someone I've always admired,

246
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,156
made me really happy.

247
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,625
So, thank you very much.

248
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,711
[crew members applauding]

249
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:08,009
[Emika] Why? Why is he here?

250
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:10,887
It's too late to take back my words.

251
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,056
-I'm scared.
-[Kanato] Why did you run?

252
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,142
Because...

253
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,439
Emika. I...

254
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,446
-Hear me out.
-No, don't say anything.

255
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,660
Sorry.

256
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,915
I just need to prepare myself.

257
00:16:58,601 --> 00:16:59,727
I like you.

258
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,855
What?

259
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,276
I've always liked you, Emika.

260
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,581
Say it again.

261
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,558
I really, really like you.

262
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,354
I'm so lame.

263
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,358
[Emika] What?

264
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,238
I planned to confess to you today.

265
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:58,035
I'm the type that goes
to get her prince herself.

266
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,746
What does that even mean?

267
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,304
So, Emika and I are officially dating.

268
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,724
[tearfully] I'm so happy for you!

269
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:22,059
-Congratulations!
-[members chuckling]

270
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,436
[Haru] Don't cry.

271
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,480
That's wonderful!

272
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,482
-Stop crying, guys!
-All right!

273
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,568
Don't you think it's too early to relax?

274
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,153
[Kota] Come on, Haru!

275
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,572
Just kidding. I admit defeat.

276
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,408
Still, that doesn't mean I'm giving up.

277
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,620
I'll take you on any time.

278
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:41,704
[Kota] Mmm.

279
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,002
All right! Let's keep this up and make
our anniversary concert a success.

280
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,337
-Yeah.
-Yu and Itsuki.

281
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,047
Let's come up with an amazing show.

282
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,423
-Okay!
-Okay!

283
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,925
-All right.
-Well, let's get going.

284
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,137
Sahoko's amazing.

285
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,305
What?

286
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:03,392
I wouldn't have been able to confess
if Sahoko hadn't pushed me to do it.

287
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:04,477
[chuckles]

288
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,479
It's all thanks to Sahoko's support.

289
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:08,856
I need to thank her someday.

290
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,442
Right. [chuckles]

291
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,490
Let's see...

292
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:19,825
What should we do about the video?

293
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:21,243
Well...

294
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,412
So, how about something really fun?

295
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,915
Fun... sounds good.
Does anyone have any idea?

296
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,919
-A prank video?
-A prank might work.

297
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,712
-[Itsuki] No way!
-[laughs]

298
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,381
-[Yu] All right!
-[Itsuki] Are you serious?

299
00:19:33,464 --> 00:19:34,465
[Yu] Yeah.

300
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,806
A LOT'S HAPPENED,
BUT I'M OFFICIALLY DATING KANATO!

301
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:47,228
CONGRATULATIONS!
PLEASE BE HAPPY WITH KANATO!

302
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,481
[phone vibrates]

303
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,316
KOTA KIRIGAYA

304
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,027
[Kota] I have something I'd like
to talk to your mom about.

305
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:57,363
Can I come over tonight?

306
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,366
To Mom?

307
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,118
HOYA-BOYA

308
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,422
Kota, what did you want to talk about?

309
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,551
I apologize for the delay,

310
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:23,264
but I, Kota Kirigaya, am currently
in a relationship with Sahoko.

311
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,650
I apologize for the delay,
but I, Kota Kirigaya...

312
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:39,905
am currently in a relationship
with Sahoko.

313
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:43,075
Okay, but why are you repeating it?
You're too nervous.

314
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,038
And your point is?

315
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,208
Right. Actually...

316
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,841
What was that?

317
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:02,178
-Wow, you finished it.
-[Kota gulps, exhales]

318
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,265
We're holding
our anniversary concert soon.

319
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:07,975
Hmm?

320
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:14,440
I would like Sahoko to join us
as part of the cooking staff.

321
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:16,609
What?

322
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,739
And for that,
I would like to obtain your permission!

323
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,199
Wait, hold on just a minute!

324
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:27,161
What? Sahoko, you don't want to?

325
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,246
No, that's not what I mean.

326
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:33,667
I am nowhere near worthy of being a part
of LiKE LEGEND, even as a staff member.

327
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,253
I can deliver food to you
whenever you need it.

328
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:38,923
I want you to come with me.

329
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,091
What?

330
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:46,472
Remember what you said before?
That cheering is all you're good at.

331
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,476
I do.

332
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:55,314
I think that's really great.

333
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,404
Because of your support,
Nanase has found happiness.

334
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,866
And our members
are also getting along well.

335
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,081
I'm sure that our fans
will be happy to see that.

336
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,628
Sahoko, you make everyone smile.

337
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:28,639
LiKE LEGEND needs you, Sahoko.

338
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:36,188
I think of you as our sixth member.

339
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,693
So...

340
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,863
won't you come with me?

341
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:56,458
After everything Kota just said,
what are you waiting for?

342
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,298
Go be a part of LiKE LEGEND
and give it your all!

343
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,467
-Mom...
-Go for it.

344
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:22,026
As the sixth member of the group...

345
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,239
please allow me to accompany you.

346
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,825
Of course.

347
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,248
-[Sahoko] His smile is so special.
-Thank you!

348
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:41,128
[Sahoko] I hope that Kota
