15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:44,545
No, maybe I'm just able

Yes! Well...

22
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,940
Thank you very much for the other day.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:07,234
I'm truly grateful for the experience.

24
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:11,154
What's wrong, Sahoko? You sound stiff.

25
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,531
Just relax.

26
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:14,658
Okay.

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,745
But I understand how you feel.

28
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,583
I'm so happy that we're dating,

29
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,835
I haven't been able
to calm down since then.

30
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,631
I don't know what I'd do
if some other guy came after you.

You're kidding.

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,097
I'm not!

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,099
You should have more self-awareness.

35
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:40,976
Sahoko.

36
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,563
You're cute.

38

I... I can't do this.

00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,280
Why not?!

40
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,032
Oh...

41
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,036
Anyway, I wanted to ask for your help.

42
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:00,787
What?

43
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,955
Sure.

44
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:04,207
I'll do anything I can.

45
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,850
[Sahoko] Wow, I really went overboard.

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:24,019
This is embarrassing.

47
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,608
Still, I hope he finds me cute.

48
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,197
[man] This is the overall flow
of the program.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
[Kota and Emika] Okay.

50
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,076
You can promote the movie
near the end of the show.

51
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,161
-[Kota chuckling] I almost forgot.
-[Emika] I understand.

52
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,580
[Sahoko] It's Emika Nanase!

53
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,583
She looks as beautiful as always.

54
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,835
-[Emika] Thank you.
-[Kota] We'll be counting on you.

55
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,463
-[man] Thank you.
-Go ahead.

56
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,759
[gasps] Sahoko!
Sorry I couldn't come get you.

57
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,010
No, it's fine.

58
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,515
-Ta-da!
-My lunch!

59
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,600
[chuckling] Thanks.

60
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,769
These always make my day.

61
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:08,647
I'm glad.

62
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,484
[Kota] Hmm? What's wrong?

63
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,570
[Sahoko] Uh...

64
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:19,700
No, it's nothing.

65
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,368
[both chuckling]

66
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,247
[Sahoko] It flew right over his head!

67
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,874
I'm ashamed of myself
for expecting something.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,670
[Kota chuckling] I wanna eat it now!
Let me get the chopsticks.

69
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:33,880
[chuckles] You should enjoy it later.

70
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,507
Right, later. Okay.

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,092
[Sahoko giggling]

72
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,344
[Kota] I'm sure it'll be delicious.

73
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,724
You look so cute, Emika!

74
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,144
Thank you. That's nice to hear.

75
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,896
You're really too adorable.
I can't believe it!

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,606
You're too kind, Nicole.

77
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,316
No, I'm just telling the truth.

78
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,695
You'll make me blush
if you keep complimenting me like that.

79
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,782
[Nicole] You look like a doll.
Any girl would admire you.

80
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:01,992
You're so cute.

81
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,118
[Sahoko] That makes sense.

82
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:09,291
He's always surrounded
by adorable girls like Nanase.

83
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,129
I can't believe
I wanted him to think I'm cute.

84
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,714
I wish I didn't.

85
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,424
What do you think, Kota?

86
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,842
Even if you had a girlfriend,

87
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,845
wouldn't you be tempted
if someone like Emika Nanase hit on you?

88
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,138
I bet you'd fall for her.

89
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,265
[Sahoko] Of all the questions to ask...

90
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,769
Well, let me think...

91
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:29,978
[Sahoko] I can't take this!

92
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,649
[Kota] I'm not good at
opening up to people.

93
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,529
So I find it hard to fall in love.

94
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,156
Because I give up easily.

95
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,033
-[Nicole] Really?
-Yes! [chuckles]

96
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:50,499
So if a girl who can open my heart
happens to appear and I end up dating her,

97
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,751
it would turn my world upside down.

98
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,380
If a girl like that exists,
she'd be the only one for me.

99
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,595
Wow, that's so cool!

100
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,721
Thank you!

101
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,348
[all chuckling]

102
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,766
-Right?
-Yeah, that was cool.

103
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,351
I'm pretty cool in the movie too.

104
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,022
Whoa, whoa.

105
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,149
What's wrong, Sahoko?

106
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,901
Sorry.

107
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,363
There's something I have to tell you now.

108
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:22,906
Sure.

109
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,117
Actually...

110
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,330
Just a while ago,
I was feeling down because of Nanase.

111
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:36,127
But your words made me realize something.

112
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,587
What?

113
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:41,675
Life's too short to feel down or uneasy
over every single thing.

114
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,636
Instead of wasting time on that,

115
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,682
I want to put in more effort
to make you fall in love with me.

116
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,934
So, I...

117
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,407
I really tried to hold back.

118
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,701
But I can't.

119
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,288
You're too adorable today, Sahoko!

120
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:16,167
It was so hard to put up a front
so that I could look professional at work.

121
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,169
What?

122
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,923
Sahoko.

123
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,259
Don't dress cute
in front of anyone but me.

124
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,052
Okay?

125
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:28,305
Good.

126
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,307
So cute.

127
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,157
Good work today.

128
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,284
I saw you guys.

129
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,078
You went through the back exit with Kota.

130
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:55,749
What's your relationship with Kota?

131
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,961
That's...

132
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,049
I know delivering his lunch
was just an excuse.

133
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,469
You're here to see
the guy you like, right?

134
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,978
I can't afford to underestimate her.

135
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,398
-Of course not!
-You're so cute.

136
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,775
Wait...

137
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,902
After all, Sahoko's my fan.

138
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,989
You're all dressed up today.

139
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,619
[Emika] I know you're using Kota
to get closer to Kanato.

140
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:38,958
Still, I've been putting in
way more effort.

141
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:40,960
So I won't lose to you.

142
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,089
What?

143
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:48,134
[Sahoko] What's going on?
Does Nanase like him too?

144
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,597
No.

145
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,225
I just promised myself
that I'd try harder.

146
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,727
Be confident, Sahoko!

147
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,354
I won't lose to her!

No way, don't come!

168

But it's so unfair
that you're the only one having fun.

Don't do that, okay?
Seriously, don't get in the way!

Hey, don't tell her!

175

And they invited me, too.

No we didn't. Stop lying!

She must be stopped!

182
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,567
In that case, how about this?

183
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:10,944
I'll come too!

184
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,862
-What?
-What?

185
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,548
I'm absolutely no match for Nanase...

186
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:36,136
but I look cute in my own way, don't I?

187
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,222
-I'm home!
-Welcome ho--

188
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,390
[Emika] Hello.

189
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,393
I'm here for the party.

190
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,854
I heard them talking about it,
and I couldn't resist.

191
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,356
-Let's go, Emika.
-Okay.

192
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:53,695
Sorry, Sahoko. I'll send them home soon.

193
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,822
No, it's okay.

194
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,200
I want to be alone with you.

195
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,539
Take a day off to let me
make it up to you.

196
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,832
We'll go somewhere then.

197
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,376
How about we go for a drive?

198
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,711
How about we visit a farm?

199
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,047
-Yeah. That sounds nice.
-Good.

200
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,800
[Kanato] Kota,
where's the game we played before?

201
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,136
Come on, don't go through my stuff!

202
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:26,895
Nanase must have come

203
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,648
because she didn't want me
to be alone with Kota.

204
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:36,029
I must stay strong!

205
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,655
[♪ metal music playing]

206
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,826
[both] I won't lose!

207
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:50,585
Wow, what a feast!
All my favorites!

208
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,589
Actually, I wanted to throw you
a wrap party for your concert.

209
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,633
What? Really?

210
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,428
I'm not part of the staff, but you...

211
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:06,434
I mean, everyone from LiKE LEGEND
did their best,

212
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,479
so I made this
as a reward for all your hard work.

213
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,065
I see.

214
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:15,109
-Thanks.
-This looks really good.

215
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,237
-Yeah!
-Thank you.

216
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,405
-[Kota] Can we eat now?
-[Sahoko] Let's eat.

217
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:24,577
[Emika] I bet you're using this to win
some brownie points with Kanato,

218
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,080
but I won't let you have your way.

219
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,457
-Let's have a toast.
-Sounds good!

220
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,626
I'll go get the champagne glasses.

221
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:32,877
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

222
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,462
I'll serve up the fried shrimp!

223
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,924
[Kota] Open wide, Kanato!

224
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,426
-[Emika] Need help?
-Right, thanks.

225
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,720
I don't see the champagne glasses.

226
00:12:43,805 --> 00:12:45,473
The champagne glasses...

227
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,850
are over here.

228
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:50,353
You're right. Thank you.

229
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,356
[Sahoko] She knows his house inside out.

230
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,276
Also, Sahoko.

231
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,112
The dishes you made look really tasty,

232
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:03,283
but he likes spicy food, so you should
make more things like that next time.

233
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,910
[Emika] Kanato really loves
his food spicy, after all!

234
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:10,373
But I read in a magazine
that he dislikes spicy food.

235
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,377
He tends to talk without thinking,
so you shouldn't take it seriously.

236
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:19,132
I see. I should've asked him in advance.

237
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:24,012
Hey, Sahoko...

238
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,933
I actually went to the zoo with him once.

239
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,476
What?

240
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,437
[Emika] Along with our managers,
of course.

241
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,481
An elephant sprayed water on me
and I got soaked.

242
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:38,026
He burst out laughing
and left me all alone.

243
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,320
I was so upset with him,

244
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,572
but he came back with a towel.

245
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,158
That really made my heart flutter.

246
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:50,079
Wait, what's going on?

247
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,664
That sounds like Kanato.

248
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,000
-Bullseye.
-What about you, Sahoko?

249
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,002
Have you gone anywhere with him?

250
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,171
Well...

251
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,798
We went to an amusement park
the other day.

252
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:02,717
No way! Just the two of you?

253
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:08,139
Yes. He took photos
with just about everyone

254
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,141
-and screamed on the roller coaster.
-What?

255
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,060
We saw some pretty lights together too.

256
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,604
What?

257
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,732
He doesn't seem like
he'd be interested in that kind of thing.

258
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,776
Is that so?

259
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,736
He really seemed to enjoy himself,

260
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,863
and we even took pictures together.

261
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,324
[Emika] What's going on?
That sounds just like Kota.

262
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,909
Bullseye!

263
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,994
[Kanato] Sahoko, where are the glasses?

264
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,579
I'll get them now.

265
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,760
Give me some more, Kota.

266
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,303
You've had too much, Nanase.

267
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:48,679
Come on, just pour!

268
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,264
-[Kota] Just a little, then.
-[Emika] Okay.

269
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,769
-There's something on your face, Sahoko.
-What? Here?

270
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,479
Not there.

271
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,148
-Here.
-Hey!

272
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,192
I'm the only one allowed to touch Sahoko!

273
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,443
What are you on about?

274
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,571
I want Sahoko to comfort me, too.

275
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,948
You...

276
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,702
Well, as you can see,
this girl is like our mascot.

277
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,038
Get away from Sahoko!

278
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,042
Come on! That's enough!

279
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,128
You're amazing, Sahoko.

280
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,884
I mean, you're not even that cute.

281
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,595
But you've got these two guys
all over you.

282
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,389
I'm envious.

283
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,521
Nanase, want some water?

284
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,689
I'll get you some.

285
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,193
Hey, are you upset about something?

286
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,363
Sorry. I'll go sober up.

287
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,536
Is Nanase okay?

288
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,538
Sorry about that, Sahoko.

289
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,623
She never says things like that.

290
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,542
What?

291
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,502
Why would you apologize?

292
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,258
I totally get where she's coming from.

293
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:10,469
I must really be amazing.

294
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,723
Maybe I saved a country
in my previous life.

295
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,814
[Kota] Still, she was quite drunk.

296
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,900
I hope she's okay.

297
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,613
Guess it can't be helped.

298
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,239
Shall we go find her?

299
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,116
Okay.

300
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:37,580
The path splits here.

301
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,789
I'll go this way.

302
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:40,291
-We'll go this way.
-Okay.

303
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,251
-All right.
-Let's go, Kota.

304
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,034
Nanase.

305
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,245
Are you okay?

306
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,502
Want me to get some water for you?

307
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,552
Back there...

308
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,431
I said some mean things. I'm sorry.

309
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,351
No, it's fine.

310
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,189
I was so disgraceful.

311
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,025
I'm ashamed of myself.

312
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,070
That's not true at all.

313
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,324
Sahoko.

314
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,828
Are things going well with him?

315
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,456
Or are you guys already dating?

316
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,512
We are.

317
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,350
I see.

318
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,146
No wonder you're so unbothered.

319
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,815
No, that's not it.

320
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,402
I'm not unbothered at all.

321
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,408
Knowing that someone as wonderful as you

322
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,245
likes him too

323
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,667
makes me feel that
I have to try that much harder.

324
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,588
But the truth is,

325
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:53,674
I'm actually really scared.

326
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,933
But that person...

327
00:19:06,437 --> 00:19:11,484
He made someone like me his special one.

328
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,820
So...

329
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,241
I tell myself that
I need to have more self-confidence.

330
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,829
So...

331
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,291
I can't afford to lose.

332
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,584
Not even to you, Nanase.

333
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:32,588
Because...

334
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,383
Because I...

335
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,844
I really love Kota.

336
00:19:41,764 --> 00:19:42,765
I see.

337
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,060
You like Kota...

338
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,020
Wait.

339
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,105
Kota?

340
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,317
Yes. I like Kota.

341
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,820
Hold on. Not Kanato?

342
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
What?

343
00:19:58,531 --> 00:19:59,532
No.

344
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,868
I like Kota...

345
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,705
What?

346
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:07,998
What?

347
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,417
What?

348
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,588
[both] What?

349
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,006
What?

350
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,930
Looks like we had a huge misunderstanding.

351
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,057
Yes.

352
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:35,401
Nanase. Since when have you liked Kanato?

353
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:38,154
When I was young,

354
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,450
I saw Kanato in a TV series
and fell in love with him.

355
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:47,288
I wanted to be close to him,
so I got into the industry.

356
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:50,833
Wow. You're such a go-getter.

357
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,087
Still, he never sees me as a girl.

358
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,424
I need to work hard like you, Sahoko.

359
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,177
What are you talking about?

360
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,970
I'm nothing compared to you.

361
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,185
You became a successful actress
to make the guy you like notice you.

362
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,812
Not everyone can do something like that.

363
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,065
Thanks.

364
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:20,613
Nanase. I'm sure that
your romance will work out.

365
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,282
Emika.

366
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:25,576
What?

367
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,915
Please call me Emika.

368
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:38,881
Then Emika it is.

369
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,134
Okay.

370
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,098
[chuckles]

371
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,893
[both chuckle]

372
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,770
[Emika] I'm glad.

373
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,648
-[Sahoko] I'll never wash this hand.
-[Emika] Why not?

374
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,442
-[Sahoko] Because I'm happy.
-[Emika] What, you're that happy?

375
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,280
Sorry to make you do all the cleanup too.

376
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:08,118
The food was really good,
and I had an amazing time.

377
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,746
I'm glad to hear that.

378
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,790
You sure you're okay going back alone?

379
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,291
I'll be fine.

380
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:16,544
Anyway, I can't let you come with me.

381
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,838
What if the paparazzi saw us together?

382
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:21,173
[chuckles] You're right.

383
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:23,717
In that case...

384
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,387
can you do one last thing for me?

385
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,222
Sure, anything you want.

386
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:30,641
Tell me you like me.

387
00:22:33,102 --> 00:22:34,728
-What?
-I mean...

388
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,315
you haven't told me you like me
ever since we started dating.

389
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:45,698
And you're always so polite
when talking to me.

390
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:50,786
I just thought that
maybe you don't really like me.

391
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,211
I do.

392
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,716
What? Who?

393
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,137
I like you, Kota.

394
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:16,478
The way you said my name
just now is out of this world.

395
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:27,823
So, to thank you for tonight,
I'll do anything and everything you want.

396
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,117
So think about it.

397
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,411
[Sahoko] What?

398
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,664
Something I want Kota to do...

399
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,002
Like this... and that?

400
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:44,256
No, wait a minute... No, stop! Ahhh!

401
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,883
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

402
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,967
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW

403
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,637
My drama serial is starting soon,
and the co-lead is...

404
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,721
Kanato?

405
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,807
[Sahoko] I'm nowhere near ready
to kiss a super idol!

406
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:57,770
Once the movie reaches its climax,
it might put you in the mood to kiss!

407
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,147
Thanks for being my special one.
