00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:21,039
Everyone, starting today,

12
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,876
Isn't Kota so cute?

13
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:09,796
<i>The movie he starred in last year</i>

14
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,049
<i>His photo album sold 200,000 copies.</i>

15
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,343
He's a national icon!

16
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:18,138
Hey, Sahoko, are you listening?

17
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,975
Listen up, Yuko.

18
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,062
Pop idols are popular
just for their looks.

19
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:29,399
Anyone who'd choose
that profession can't be cool.

20
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:33,445
I'll be impressed if they're
still popular when they get old.

21
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,451
Don't be so gloomy at New Year's.

22
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,663
You're such a die-hard hater of cute boys.

23
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,876
[Sahoko] <i>Yes. I, Sahoko Wakaume,</i>

SAHOKO'S BLACK HISTORY THEATER

26
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,676
<i>I'll never forget that day</i>
<i>in my second year of high school.</i>

27
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,555
<i>I was originally a cute-boy lover.</i>

28
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,851
<i>Being young and stupid,</i>
<i>I fell for the cutest boy in school.</i>

29
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:10,899
Please...

30
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,609
read this letter.

[Kimura] <i>A full-on love letter</i>

35
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,712
<i>Know your place, for crying out loud!</i>

36
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,804
<i>Sorry, misfired... lol!</i>

37
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,767
[whispering] Seriously?

38
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:47,477
-Some nerve.
-[giggling]

39
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,688
[boy 1] <i>She sent a love letter.</i>

40
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,731
<i>-</i>[boy 2] <i>Impossible.</i>
<i>-</i>[girl 1] <i>How stupid.</i>

41
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:52,858
[girl 2] <i>Stuck-up nerd.</i>

42
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,526
[girl 3] <i>Overweening.</i>

43
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,659
[Yuko] Sahoko.

44
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,455
Excuse me.

45
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,462
But "hate" and not "indifferent" means

46
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,381
you can't help noticing them, right?

47
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:17,757
What?

48
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,926
So it's still possible

49
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,722
that something might inspire you
to like cute boys.

50
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:25,766
For instance...

51
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:27,350
Kota!

52
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,270
You must be joking.

53
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,147
Utterly ridiculous.

54
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,860
[Sahoko] <i>I, who regard</i>
<i>all cute boys as enemies,</i>

55
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,820

56
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,700
<i>I intend to keep living</i>
<i>a boy-free happy life,</i>

57
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,452
<i>so please watch over me.</i>

58
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:52,542
<i>And please make all conceited cute boys</i>
<i>as unhappy as possible.</i>

60
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,758
[man] Oh, right, spring break.

61
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,968
Nice of you to help your family.

62
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,179
How's university? Found a boyfriend?

63
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,433
Keep that topic up
and next time we meet in court.

[men laugh]

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,687
Sahoko is so funny.

66
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:15,023
-See you.
-Thanks, bye.

67
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,566

Sahoko.

What was that?

113
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,747
If that was fan service,
you should know I'm not your fan!

114
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,292
Huh? You mean, you don't like me?

115
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,880
Really?

116
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,758
Then that was rude of me.

117
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,260
I'm sorry.

From this moment on,
I'll work hard to win your heart.

Then that kiss on the forehead
will become a sweet memory, right?

Sweet memory?

125
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:00,415
Hmm?

126
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:06,755
You're so wrong to think
you can win anyone's heart!

127
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,883
I'll never be your fan, you narcissist!

So that's how it went.

133
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:32,363
What a wimp for a national icon. [scoffs]

134

<i>So how was Kota in the flesh?</i>
<i>Fell in love?</i>

136
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:42,874
Never.

he gave me an autograph.

Sahoko, for you.

I'm very sorry for being
rude to you yesterday.

Thank goodness! [laughs]

178
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,705
I was thinking
how I can make you my fan...

179
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,333
Hold on. [chuckles]

180

Oh, yeah, do you have a boyfriend?

196
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,174
I've decided never to fall in love, ever.

-Ever?
-Correct.

198
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:44,347
For me, love is nothing but pain.

199
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,436
And I don't feel lonely at all.

200
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,356
I even have a perfect single-life plan.

201
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:58,236
Save up 50 million yen by age 30,
purchase real estate, and manage assets.

Yeah, life isn't all about love.

That's cool.

208
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:24,220
But you never know what'll happen in life.

209
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,058
You might find a love so profound
that it heals your past wounds.

210
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,939
Isn't it a bit too early
to decide to be single for life?

00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:47,067
I'm Yu Haruna.
Thanks for taking care of Kota.

533
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,738
I'm Itsuki Naruse.

534
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:54,908
Itsuki Naruse, nice to meet you.

535
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,205
[Sahoko] <i>Everyone's insanely handsome.</i>

536
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:05,335
I'm Sahoko Wakaume, nice to meet you all.

537
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,337
Are you really Kanato's fan?

538
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,797
What?

539
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,216
I thought you were Kota's fan.

540
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,300
Me too.

541
00:34:13,677 --> 00:34:15,303
Sahoko...

542
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:19,432
If you look closely,
can't you be my fan instead?

543
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,142
Huh?

544
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,061
Look again more closely.

545
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,730
At this lovable character! [laughs]

546
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,192
Kota, don't scare her.

547
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,694
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:31,778
Truly sorry.

549
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,031
Kota and Haru, please stand by.

550
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,491
-Okay.
-Yes, ma'am.

551
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:41,955
Sahoko, you wanna see us record a show?

552
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,748
Huh? Oh, I can't...

553
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,918
No, come watch me!

554
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,212
-[Yu] Sahoko, just go.
-[Haru] Yeah, go.

555
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,380
THE TEN-YEAR LOVE PLAN

556
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,507
[Kota chuckling] Don't be shy, go see it.

557
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,385
Are you sure it's okay?

558
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,345
[Kota] Of course! [laughs]

559
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,307
[quietly] Whoa.

560
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:08,356
[people chattering indistinctly]

561
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,866
[people shouting
and chattering indistinctly]

562
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,955
Starting soon.

563
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:25,915
Hello, camera three!

564
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,711
[Sahoko] <i>Emika Nanase!</i>

565
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,256
<i>She looks like a goddess.</i>

566
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,424
[Kota] A sequel, yes?

567
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,718
-Sure, why not?
-[all laughing]

568
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,845
[chattering indistinctly]

569
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:43,350
[Kanato] Is the "Ten-Year Love Plan"
going well?

570
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,647
Why do you have that?

571
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,816
Falling in love for real with Kota?

572
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,152
I didn't expect you to be so bold.

573
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,237
Give it back.

574
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,701
Stop lying that you're my fan
and get on with it.

575
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,330
Act before your feelings rot in ten years.

576
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,046
A good-looking person like you
won't understand my feelings.

577
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,508
I've been trying...

578
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,176
Trying hard?

579
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,844
Explain in detail.

580
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,139
Well, um...

581
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,517
You say you're on it

582
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,396
while you wait in your comfort zone
for a chance to come.

583
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,193
Making excuses and doing nothing
because you're afraid of getting hurt.

584
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:42,450
If you stay like that, you'll never
be able to open Kota's closed heart.

585
00:36:43,785 --> 00:36:45,036
What?

586
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:47,622
[Emika] Hi, Kanato.

587
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,916
[Kanato] Hey, good job.

588
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,212
[Emika] <i>Kanato, looking damn cute as ever.</i>

589
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:56,464
<i>Huh?</i>

590
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,924
<i>Who's this?</i>

591
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,469
She's from a restaurant Kota frequents.

592
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,972
She came to deliver us food earlier.

593
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,474
I'm Sahoko Wakaume.

594
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,103
[Emika] <i>Oh, Kota's acquaintance.</i>

595
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,605
Thank you for looking after Kota.

596
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:19,446
[Sahoko] <i>Her sparkly beams are blinding!</i>

597
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:22,824
Emika and Kota
were classmates in high school.

598
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,659
Really?

599
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,330
[whispers] Feeling jealous of Emika?

600
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,083
Of course not!

601
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:34,836
-[Kanato] You're so cute.
-What?

602
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,338
What are you doing?

603
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:40,049
[Emika] <i>Kanato petting a girl's head?</i>

604
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:41,926
<i>This must be some kind of mistake.</i>

605
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,430
You two seem quite close.

606
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,348
Well, yeah.

607
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,477
After all, Sahoko's my fan.

608
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,187
-Right?
-[stammers]

609
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,648
[Emika] <i>This is an unmistakable fact.</i>

610
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,652
<i>Sahoko Wakaume, what a frightening girl.</i>

611
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:02,614
Creepy, stop!

612
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,032
Or I'll call the police.

613
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,950
Sahoko.

614
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,161
Let's be friends too.

615
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,039
Yes.

616
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,168
[straining]

617
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,879
[Sahoko] <i>What's this?</i>

618
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,757
<i>I can feel hostility,</i>
<i>almost like electricity.</i>

619
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:25,303
<i>By any chance, is Emika into Kota as well?</i>

620
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,473
<i>Using Kota as an excuse</i>
<i>to get close to Kanato...</i>

621
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,058
<i>That's not how things go!</i>

622
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:34,229
<i>She can tell I'm actually</i>
<i>a fan of Kota, not Kanato.</i>

623
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,483
This movie is about

624
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,903
the regrets we have in life.

625
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,405
Kota, do you have any regrets?

626
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:48,868
Mmm... Regrets? Let me think...

627
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,668
[chuckles softly] No regrets.

628
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,087
I never had time to look back.

629
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,214
-[Haru] I guess so.
-Mmm-hmm. [chuckles]

630
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:08,763
[sighs]

631
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:14,269
[Sahoko] <i>This clear blue sky</i>
<i>seems to be celebrating our rendezvous.</i>

632
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,772
[Kota] Sahoko!

633
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,829
Fifty hamburger steak sandwiches.

634
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,123
[Sahoko] <i>Well, just making a delivery.</i>

635
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,291
[Kota] Thanks!

636
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,459
It must've been far.

637
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,586
Not at all.

638
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,381
The comet orchid symbolizes
"a special one."

639
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,592
-But words are--
-Cut!

640
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,720
It's great, but try to relax a bit more.

641
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:49,888
And smile.

642
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,098
Haru, what's one plus one?

643
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,349
-Two.
-You got this!

644
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:54,767
Then one more time!

645
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,645
Sorry, can I start over?

646
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:00,356
What are you looking at?

647
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,822
-[chuckles]
-Seems like a tough shooting.

648
00:40:07,906 --> 00:40:10,575
It's for the video of our new song.

649
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,411
But it's not going so well.

650
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:18,541
Is this the one you were practicing
heart-melting lines for?

651
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:19,792
Yeah.

652
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,087
That's right!

653
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:25,924
-Do you have a bit of time?
-Hmm?

654
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:34,265
Think of her as "your special one"
and say your lines.

655
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,018
-Yes, sir!
-Please get ready!

656
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:41,940
Um... I don't think I can do this.

657
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:46,110
It'll be fine,
you just have to stand there.

658
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:49,781
It'll help everyone
to express their emotions.

659
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:54,327
But I'm not exactly "a special one."

660
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,246
[director] Stand by for test take!

661
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,373
Good luck.

662
00:41:01,209 --> 00:41:03,044
[director] Then, action!

663
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:07,966
The comet orchid symbolizes
"a special one."

664
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,011
For you.

665
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,767
Sorry I'm bad at expressing myself.

666
00:41:18,518 --> 00:41:20,353
I've always wanted to say...

667
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:21,980
thank you for...

668
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,942
finding me.

669
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,862
I like your voice.

670
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,073
I like your name.

671
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,994
But what I like the most is...

672
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:42,417
your eyes that reflect my face.

673
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,587
Didn't I tell you...

674
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,259
not to get any cuter than you already are?

675
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,386
As a punishment...

676
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,304
I'm gonna hold you tight.

677
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,516
[glasses crackling]

678
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,269
I always want to be admired by

679
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,604
who I love the most in this world.

680
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:05,815
So...

681
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:10,194
always tell me how cool I am.

682
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,744
Your red face is super cute!

683
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:20,747
[whispers] Sahoko.

684
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:23,416
[hissing]

685
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,836
[director] Okay, cut!

686
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,422
You brought us brilliant footage.

687
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:31,424
Thank you so much!

688
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,926
My pleasure. Thank you for these gifts.

689
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:37,013
Words of love don't work against walls.

690
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,140
A muse is essential.

691
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,477
Look forward to the outcome. Thanks!

692
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,002
[clears throat]

693
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:14,092
Kota Kirigaya.

694
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,845
Uh...

695
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,183
I think...

696
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,187
I...

697
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,690
I...

698
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:33,986
love you!

699
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:40,743
[laughs]

700
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:44,789
[chuckling] I'm crazy.

701
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,297
[chuckles]

702
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,844
I just came to thank you.

703
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,305
Were you...

704
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,225
listening?

705
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:16,654
Good night!

706
00:44:20,575 --> 00:44:22,785
[Sahoko] <i>It's all over. I blew it.</i>

707
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:26,581
<i>I was never gonna confess my feelings.</i>

708
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:32,628
Making excuses and doing nothing
because you're afraid of getting hurt.

709
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,094
Exactly.

710
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,055
[Kota panting] Sahoko!

If we can pretend that I didn't confess...

722

things could stay the same.

723
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,223

it's the same as not caring at all.

That proves...

930
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,553
I'm cruel, after all.
