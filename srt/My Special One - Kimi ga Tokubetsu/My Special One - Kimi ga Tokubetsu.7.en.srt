1
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,503
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:11,261
-Ahh.
-It's my first time at a members-only bar.

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:14,181
This is one of LiKE LEGEND's
favorite hangouts.

4
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,225
Eat up, and we'll brainstorm later.

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:17,309
-Okay.
-Okay.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,979
Wait, weren't you going to ask something?

7
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,481
-What's up?
-Well...

8
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,691
-Actually...
-Yeah?

9
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:27,527
It's about Emika and Kanato.

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,279
[phone vibrating]

11
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:33,283
Emika. How was the date
at the amusement park?

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:39,581
I feel like we got closer to each other
and deepened our bond...

13
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:43,418
[whining] What do I do now?

14
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,337
I see.

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,257
I didn't realize
Nanase liked Kanato that much.

16
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:53,595
-I think Kanato likes Emika too.
-Hmm?

17
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:56,098
Because, at the amusement park,
Kanato said...

18
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,101
It pisses me off so much,

19
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,104
I'll make sure you're glad
that I'm your co-star instead of him.

20
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,400
I'll make it the most unforgettable
kiss scene you've ever had.

21
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,445
What's that supposed to mean?

22
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:14,866
Doesn't it sound like
he's jealous of the guy Emika admires?

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,703
-I think that confirms it.
-I see.

24
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,079
[both] Correct!

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,914
What?

26
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:22,874
-Hmm?
-[Yu chuckles]

27
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,876
Kanato definitely likes her.

28
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,420
-Wait a minute...
-[Itsuki] That's right.

29
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,713
You guys came too?

30
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:31,133
-Guess you all really do come here often.
-Yep.

31
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:34,553
We've known about Kanato's
crush on Emika for a while now.

32
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,971
[both] What?

33
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,557
Hey, as our leader,
it should've been obvious to you!

34
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,476
Really? I had no idea.

35
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,646
Then, aren't they in love with each other?

36
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:48,025
Why doesn't Kanato just
tell her how he feels?

37
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,654
Well, Kanato can be
surprisingly delicate at times.

38
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:57,826
He's the type of guy that can't make
a move unless he's sure it'll work out.

39
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,745
-I see.
-[Kota] Yeah.

40
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,333
-All right. I'll handle this!
-What?

41
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,627
I've known both of them
for a very long time.

42
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:11,673
Sahoko, you can leave the rest to me!

43
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:12,758
[soft chuckle]

44
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,260
[Sahoko] Now I'm worried...

45
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,724
I shall become cupid... bringer of love!

46
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,729
Please sit down.

47
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,690
-What? Right...
-[Yu and Haru chuckle]

48
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,442
[chuckles nervously] Sorry.

49
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,277
DRAMA "MY SPECIAL ONE"

50
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,404
[♪ opening theme song playing]

51
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,398
DRAMA "MY SPECIAL ONE"

52
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,482
EPISODE 7

53
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,529
This is a special video
for LiKE LEGEND Channel!

54
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,073
A panel discussion for Kanato's TV drama,

55
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:20,659
-The Love Story Incident!
-Yeah!

56
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,327
-Thank you, everyone!
-[all cheering]

57
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,080
All right, let's begin!

58
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:28,667
Now, The Love Story Incident
starring Kanato and Emika Nanase

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,503
topped both TV ratings
and streaming charts

60
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,422
-by a huge margin!
-Wow!

61
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,506
And so...

62
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,426
the whole crew is here
today to talk all about it!

63
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:39,803
-[Kota] Yay!
-[cheering and clapping]

64
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,097
The story's really ramping up.

65
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,223
-I agree.
-Yeah.

66
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,268
We're just about halfway
through the series now.

67
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,855
Okay, Kanato, please give us
a short introduction to the show!

68
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,939
Yes, please do.

69
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,275
Right.

70
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,360
It's a story about how my character, Ren,

71
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:58,280
and his co-worker Tsubasa,
played by Emika Nanase,

72
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,493
get entangled in a series of incidents
and fall in love with one another.

73
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,078
I see.

74
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,581
So, as Ren and Tsubasa
solve various incidents,

75
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,375
their relationship deepens
as the story goes on.

76
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,752
But they barely get anywhere romantically

77
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,213
-due to their constant misunderstandings.
-Right.

78
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,882
[both] How exciting!

79
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,341
[Kota] There they go again!

80
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,676
[all laughing]

81
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,969
-Kanato.
-[Kota] Yeah.

82
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,637
Why won't you confess to Nanase?

83
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,476
-Hey, that's his character!
-Character?

84
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,978
-It's not between Kanato and Nanase!
-Right, my bad.

85
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,897
-It's Ren and Tsubasa.
-That's right!

86
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:38,236
But I think any guy working with Nanase
would likely end up in love with her...

87
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,529
What? You think so?

88
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,615
-Wait, what's up with that reaction?
-What?

89
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,284
-Come on, anyone would fall for her.
-[Kota] Really?

90
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,286
[Itsuki] Maybe it's because
you were classmates.

91
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,704
[Kota] Maybe.

92
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,417
[Kanato] You could ask any guy
if they'd go out

93
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,377
with Emika Nanase, and they'd all say yes.

94
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,134
My relationships never last long.

95
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,057
Where does she get off
uploading a selfie in my hoodie?

96
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,352
[sighs]

97
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,896
USER HAS BEEN BLOCKED

98
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,192
A professional has to keep
these things a secret, you know.

99
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,152
She doesn't get it at all.

100
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,656
A FEW DAYS LATER

101
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,242
[man] Hello. This way, please.

102
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,618
Thank you for coming.

103
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:33,834
[Kanato] That was when I met Emika.

104
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,461
Nice to meet you.

105
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,839
I'm Emika Nanase.

106
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,885
Nice to meet you.

107
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:49,558
[Kanato] When I first saw Emika,
I found her insanely cute.

108
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,562
All right, listen to me.
You need to go all out, like this!

109
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,106
Think you can do it?

110
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,190
I can handle that.

111
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:59,401
[Kanato] She's friendly
with production staff

112
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,111
and amazing at her job.

113
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,404
[Emika] Okay.

114
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,824
[Kanato] We'd only just met,
but I immediately gained respect for her.

115
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,451
[Emika] Like this? Okay, I got it.

116
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,832
[man on screen]
Unless that mystery is solved,

117
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,460
you two will also be left out in the cold.

118
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,887
THE LOVE STORY INCIDENT
AIRS EVERY TUESDAY 9 P.M.

119
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,598
I wonder who the culprit could be.

120
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,766
Who's the bad guy?

121
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,854
-I bet you're curious too!
-Yeah, I'm dying to know!

122
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,606
It has to be Kanato.

123
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:39,065
[Itsuki] What? Why Kanato?

124
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,485
[Haru] I mean, Kanato's never honest
about his feelings.

125
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,031
[Kota chuckling] I told you
that's his character!

126
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,450
Okay? It's not Kanato!

127
00:06:49,034 --> 00:06:50,869
Okay, be honest now.

128
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,579
What's next for you two?

129
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,080
What?

130
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:57,083
-Not you. I meant Ren and Tsubasa.
-Yeah!

131
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:00,211
You know I can't talk about that.

132
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:02,756
-Well, yeah.
-Of course.

133
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,215
[Kota] I knew that.

134
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,135
[Kanato] But since then,
nothing has changed between us.

135
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:09,012
[Emika] There is someone I admire.

136
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,350
I wanted to meet that person

137
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,270
and get him to acknowledge me,
so I became an actress.

138
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,315
[Kanato] Since then,
I've been trying to find...

139
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,399
Biker dude.

140
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:23,860
-the guy she likes.
-Keepin' it real. Big respect.

141
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,028
-BKB! Yeah!
-Yeah!

142
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,446
EMIKA NANASE'S BKB CHALLENGE!

143
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,823
-All right, nice BKB!
-Yay!

144
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,576
Emika, from today onwards,
you're my younger sister!

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,161
I will follow you forever.

146
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,996
You'll ride in my sidecar forever?

147
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,748
What does a bike do? Vroom, vroom!

148
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,166
Let's go!

149
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,168
Is it him?

150
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,504
Is it him?

151
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,880
I WENT TO WATCH HIM LIVE!

152
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,510
[Kanato sighs] I've been searching
this whole time.

153
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,970
With that, LiKE LEGEND Channel...

154
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:53,723
...will continue to support
The Love Story Incident!

155
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,350
All together now!

156
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,936
Please support the series!

157
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,604
[all laughing]

158
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,649
There we go!

159
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,900
All right.

160
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,694
-Good work, everyone!
-Good work!

161
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,320
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

162
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:09,572
-I have another gig, so I'm heading out.
-Okay.

163
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,866
-I've got a radio show to record.
-I see.

164
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,785
-Break a leg. Bye.
-Thanks. Bye.

165
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,120
-Bye.
-See you. Good work.

166
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,579
-Bye.
-Bye.

167
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,957
Work hard, guys! [chuckles]

168
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,543
Huh?

169
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:23,962
I have an early day tomorrow,
so I'm hanging up.

170
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,338
See ya!

171
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,635
Nanase's acting in the drama
has been a big hit, huh?

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,721
Yeah.

173
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:36,808
Emika is seriously amazing.

174
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,896
She makes short work of everything
the director throws at her.

175
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,524
No wonder she's a top actress.

176
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,942
[chuckles]

177
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,863
Hey. Did you know that
there's someone Nanase likes?

178
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,033
Why are you bringing that up?

179
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:57,078
I'm her high school classmate,
so I kind of had a hunch.

180
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,040
I thought maybe you knew too.

181
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,461
Yeah, I knew.

182
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,087
What?

183
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,797
I heard it from Emika.

184
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,885
She got into the entertainment industry

185
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,804
because she wants to meet
the guy she likes.

186
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,016
[Kota] That's you, Kanato!

187
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,186
I could practically see stars in her eyes
when she talked about him.

188
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,689
And it made me so mad

189
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,942
at whoever it was
that changed Emika's life.

190
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,445
Yeah!

191
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:35,533
That person's super cool,
has black hair, is good at acting...

192
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,037
And apparently, he's nice,
but he rarely shows it.

193
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,458
Come on, doesn't someone come to mind?

194
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:44,542
No.

195
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,294
Seriously?

196
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:50,381
Still, I refuse to lose to him
as an actor.

197
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,052
I'm gonna go read the script again.

198
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,888
I'll make sure our ratings soar!

199
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:00,016
-Bye.
-Hey, wait! Kanato! Hold on--

200
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,436
You've got to be kidding.

201
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,856
Oh, no. What do I do now?

202
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,441
No way...

203
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,074
[Yu] There it is.

204
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,037
-Kota, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

205
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:28,086
By the way, Kanaty's TV drama
will be casting a surprise guest,

206
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:29,754
and they contacted us.

207
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,631
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

208
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,967
Tsuyuguchi's handling that right now.

209
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,552
Really?

210
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,972
Wait, I don't think I can make it, though.

211
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,933
I wonder who they'll get.

212
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,477
Well, how about you?

213
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,229
-"You" as in "Yu"?
-Yeah.

214
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,815
-Me? You think it'll be me?
-How about you and me?

215
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,401
-[both laughing]
-That sounds like a song!

216
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,236
[Kota singing in English] ♪ You and me ♪

00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:56,114
-[Yu] Sounds like a folk song.
-[all laugh]

219
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:58,116
-[Yu] It really does.
-[Kota] Yeah.

220
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,291
Okay, we'll start
from the top of scene 12.

221
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,084
-[Kanato] Okay.
-Okay.

222
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,136
He can be a little mean,
but he'd never abandon someone in need.

223
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,851
He looks adorable when he smiles.

224
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,316
I like it when he calls my name.

225
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,281
I love everything about him.

226
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,993
[Kanato] What if she really meant
all that...

227
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:43,995
Kanato?

228
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,708
Sorry, my bad. I forgot my line.

229
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,169
-[chuckles] Don't worry about it.
-[Kanato chuckles]

230
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,631
My heart really skipped a beat.

231
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:59,093
I totally forgot we were acting.
I was so moved.

232
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:09,979
Hey...

233
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,610
Kanato.

234
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,989
What am I to you?

235
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,532
What?

236
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,079
I just wanted to know
before we film our kiss scene.

237
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,791
[Kanato] Why would she ask me this?

238
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,048
You're someone I respect
when it comes to work.

239
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:40,260
The best co-worker anyone could ask for.

240
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:50,353
When I realize that we would've never met
if you hadn't gotten into the industry,

241
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,399
I'm really grateful to that guy you like.

242
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,403
Thanks.

243
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,073
[Kanato] What's going on? Did I mess up?

244
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,119
I don't think I could have
spoken any more highly of her.

245
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,414
[crew member] Let's proceed
with the test filming if everyone's ready.

246
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:14,752
[Emika] To Kanato, I'm just a co-worker.

247
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,090
I feel stupid for expecting
anything out of this.

248
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,719
[director] You don't need to kiss
during the test filming.

249
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,305
[Emika] Co-worker? Fine by me.

250
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:29,767
-I'll just do my work perfectly.
-[director] Ready, action!

251
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,227
[clapperboard snaps]

252
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,854
Ren, I've never thought of you

253
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,108
as just a co-worker.

254
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,949
[Emika] Kanato may treat this
as just another kiss for work...

255
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:46,117
Tsubasa!

256
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,842
[Emika] ...but I'll never forget it
for as long as I live.

257
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,766
Sorry, I messed up.

258
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,062
We didn't need to kiss, right?
I was just so into it that I...

259
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,229
It's all right.

260
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,232
That was great, so let's take it up
a notch when we film.

261
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:20,068
-Okay? Even better.
-[Kanato] I understand.

262
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,361
-[director] Make it quick.
-[Kanato] Okay.

263
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,322
Sorry about that, Emika.

264
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,574
[director] Make it next level, everyone.
You too.

265
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:36,876
Kanato apologized to me,
but he didn't have to.

266
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,715
He was just covering up for me
so I wouldn't get embarrassed, right?

267
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,095
[Emika] Jeez, what do I do?

268
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,972
I'm still shaking!

269
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,684
I seriously don't think
I'll ever be able to forget this.

270
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,980
Kanato! I love you,
I love you, I love you!

271
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,942
All right. I've got to do my best.

272
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:03,778
Filming will end soon,

273
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:08,449
so we have to get even closer before then!

274
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,285
-Right? [chuckles]
-[knocking at door]

275
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,703
[man] You're up next, Tsubasa.

276
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,580
Got it. Okay.

277
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,999
[director] Ready, action!

[clapperboard snaps]

279
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,504
How can I make him
fall head over heels for me?

280
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,298
[mysterious man]
You're still chasing after him?

281
00:15:26,968 --> 00:15:29,679
Why don't you choose me instead?

282
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,556
What?

283
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,142
Okay, cut!

284
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,561
All right, let me do the introduction.

285
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,480
This is Tsubasa's childhood friend
Shota Sugihara,

286
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:41,899
-Haru Kurusu!
-Thank you for having me.

287
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:43,609
[Haru] It's nice to meet all of you.

288
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,156
He's a surprise guest,
so I kept it a secret from you two.

289
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,366
What? Really? [chuckles]

290
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,951
I didn't hear about this at all.

291
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,662
-Well, I didn't tell you.
-[director] It's a success! Yay!

292
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,581
[all laughing]

293
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,418
I had no idea. You really surprised me.

294
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,129
Anyway, I'm glad you're joining us, Haru!

295
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,799
So, how are things going between you two?

296
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,009
What do you mean?

297
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,720
I heard you guys kissed.

298
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,474
Haru. That's only because
Kanato was covering for my mistake.

299
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,685
There's nothing more to it.

300
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,023
But didn't you guys go on a date too?
At the amusement park, right?

301
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,404
It's to help us understand our characters.
Don't read too much into it.

302
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,074
We're just co-stars.
Stop imagining things, stupid!

303
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,578
What are you two talking about?

304
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,749
I'm asking about the relationship
between your characters.

305
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,084
-[Haru chuckles]
-What?

306
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,588
-I know. I'm just joking.
-[laughs]

307
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,089
[Haru] Wait, were you surprised?

308
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,260
[Emika] I almost forgot.
Haru's always been like this!

309
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,190
[Kanato] This is bad.

310
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,026
If I don't do something,
that little devil's gonna steal the show.

311
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:17,912
[Haru] Hey, there.

312
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,748
Remember when we promised
to go out for a meal sometime?

313
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,917
-What?
-Are you free today?

314
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,544
-Let's go now.
-Wait...

315
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:27,255
Wait, hold on! Right now?

316
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,839
MS. EMIKA NANASE

317
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,678
Wait, where's Emika?

318
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:35,763
She left with Haru a while ago.

319
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:36,847
What?

320
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:40,768
[Kota] Yeah.

321
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:43,896
Okay.

322
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,816
I see. Okay.

323
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,487
Wait, I just remembered.

324
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:53,739
How are things between Emika and Kanato?

325
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:55,700
Well, you see...

326
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,869
I just heard that
Haru's appearing in Kanato's TV drama.

327
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,371
Wow, that's great!

328
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:02,081
That's the problem.

329
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,709
Yu called me just now.

330
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,338
He said Haru used to have
a bit of a crush on Nanase.

331
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:11,173
-What?
-On top of that,

332
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:14,802
Haru is like a little devil
that stirs up trouble.

333
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,888
-Hmm.
-It's hard to know what he might do.

334
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,140
[door opens]

335
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:21,434
-[gasps] No way!
-What's wrong?

336
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,022
[Sahoko gasping]

337
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,359
Haru came here with Nanase?

338
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,033
[whispering] You guys really like
this place.

339
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,117
Keep it down!

340
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:42,079
Cheers.

341
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,260
Emika, you always chase Kanato around
with your eyes. It's really obvious.

342
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,222
Still, I can tell.

343
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,892
I bet you think this
is your golden opportunity,

344
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,894
but you're just running around in circles.

345
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,107
-You're too easy to read.
-Haru.

346
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,569
-Please don't tell Kanato...
-I won't.

347
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,531
Actually, I wouldn't mind helping you out.

348
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:20,242
What? You'll help?

349
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,828
Well, you're pretty clumsy.

350
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:25,998
At this rate, you'll mess up,
and Kanato's going to reject you.

351
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,418
Then, you'll drown yourself in alcohol
and start to gain weight.

352
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:30,836
Man, I feel so sorry for you.

353
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,840
Hey, can you cool it
with the nightmare fuel?

354
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,637
[Emika] So, what should I do?

355
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,931
[Haru] I told you I'll help.

356
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,099
[Emika] Okay.

357
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,855
All right.

358
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:52,608
I'll be nice
and go through the script with you.

359
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,193
I can manage on my own.

360
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,612
You guys are supposed
to fight over me, remember?

361
00:19:56,696 --> 00:19:59,782
-Let's see how cool you are!
-Jeez, you're seriously annoying.

362
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:04,078
Still, you don't really
look cool to me, Haru.

363
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,540
If anything, you're adorable.

364
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,551
Do you really think I'm just cute?

365
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:22,722
This won't do. I have to help her!

366
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,058
-Sahoko, deploying!
-What?

367
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,687
Wait, you can't do that!

368
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,188
Just hold on a second!

369
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:34,775
-It's okay. I called her prince over.
-What?

370
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:38,779
Emika?

371
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,908
There you are.

372
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:46,829
How did you know where we were?
Why are you even here?

373
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,090
That's my line.
What were you trying to do?

374
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,843
-What are you thinking--
-You see...

375
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,513
Let's say, I like Emika.

376
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:09,602
What?

377
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,061
What would you do?

378
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:15,399
Right, I guess
it has nothing to do with you.

379
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,568
I won't do anything.

380
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,113
But it does have something to do with me.

381
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:28,120
Let's go home, Emika.

382
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,998
What? Kanato?

383
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,181
I heard you're drunk,
so I called for a taxi.

384
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,729
Listen, Emika. I...

385
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,565
[sniveling]

386
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,984
[soft chuckle]
Why are you making that face?

387
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:00,486
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,989
Haru called you
to take me home, didn't he?

389
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,991
What?

390
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,994
I can go home by myself.

391
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,121
[slurring childishly] I'm really sorry.

392
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,957
No, that wasn't why I came...

393
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,835
Wait, Emika!

394
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,422
I'm sorry to bother you.

395
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,926
I'm a disgrace to society!

396
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,554
You can go now.

397
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,849
[crying] I'm so sorry!

398
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,852
I'm a disgrace to society!

399
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,500
[Kanato] Haru,
what are you trying to pull?

400
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,381
Kanato, what are your feelings for Emika?

401
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,259
It's none of your business.

402
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,261
Yeah, I know, but...

403
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,847
You guys are together all the time.

404
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,558
So, it's just funny
that you haven't gotten any closer.

405
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:17,146
Since when did you like Emika?

406
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,273
What are you talking about?

407
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,108
That's got nothing to do with you.

408
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,614
In any case, I won't let you have her.

409
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,868
You won't let me have her?
How will you stop me?

410
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:45,883
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

411

NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW

412
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,218
We need to talk.

413
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,763
She wants me, not you.

414
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,058
-Why don't you do something?
-[Kanato] I have my own problems.

415
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,769
-I would like your permission...
-Hold on just a minute!

416
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,439
-Is there someone you like?
-Yeah. I really like her.
