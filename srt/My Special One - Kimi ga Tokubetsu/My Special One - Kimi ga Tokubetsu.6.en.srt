00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,506
I see. A kiss scene, huh?

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:11,261
-[smooches]
-I've filmed many kiss scenes,

3
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:15,182
but this is the first one
with someone I like. [chuckles nervously]

4
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:19,478
I really hope
we can get closer to each other by then...

5
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:22,481
Hmm...

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:26,026
That's right!
How about visiting an amusement park?

7
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:31,990
One of my restaurant's customers
introduced this place to me.

8
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,368
Apparently, it's a popular
hidden gem of a place.

9
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,578
Why don't you invite Kanato?

10
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:40,958
But would he actually want to go with me?

11
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,377
I'm sure it'll work out.

12
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,673
Thanks. I'll try my best. [chuckles]

13
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:48,799
Okay.

14
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,176
How should I invite him?

15
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,681
And if he agrees, what should I wear?

16
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,684
[Sahoko] I guess
even someone beautiful like Emika

17
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,060
has her own worries.

18
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,855
[phone vibrating]

19
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,193
-Hello?
-[Kota] Sahoko?

20
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:11,446
Sorry for the short notice,
but I humbly request your assistance!

21
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,657
[chuckles] Sure. What is it?

22
00:01:14,283 --> 00:01:16,785
I'm currently filming
the sequel to my movie,

23
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,454
and I want to treat my co-stars
to some food.

24
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:24,209
It's a sequel, but the filming
is really tough this time.

25
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:26,378
I want to help lift their spirits.

26
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,132
Could you make some of those
hamburger sandwiches again?

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,884
Of course, I'd be glad to.

28
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:36,305
[chuckles] Really? Thanks!

29
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,433
Right, I have one more favor to ask.

30
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,894
When you're here,
I want you to help me think of some ideas

31
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:45,022
-for LiKE LEGEND's YouTube channel.
-What?

32
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:48,608
Everyone's all fired up
about YouTube videos.

33
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:51,028
We have to come up
with a hundred ideas each.

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,113
A hundred?

35
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,949
But I'm totally drawing a blank here.

36
00:01:56,033 --> 00:01:59,077
So I was hoping
you could help me think of something.

37
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:01,496
I understand.

38
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,542
I don't know if I'll be of any help,
but I'll gladly render my assistance!

39
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:11,423
Come on, it's insane
to come up with a hundred ideas.

40
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:15,385
You think so?
I like coming up with ideas like this.

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,346
-For real?
-Yeah.

42
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,805
Let me see yours.

43
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,558
-I came up with quite a few, like these.
-I see.

44
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,268
They're all prank video ideas!

45
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,853
Not all.

46
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,938
-You really like prank videos.
-Well, yeah.

47
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,774
Maybe I'll think about it with Kota.

48
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,486
Kota said he's going to think it over
with his girlfriend.

49
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,904
Jeez.

50
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,240
This one sounds interesting.

51
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,701
[Sahoko] At this moment,
we were still unaware...

52
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,370
What? Really?

53
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:44,289
[Sahoko] ...of the worries
Itsuki had kept hidden.

54
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,375
[Kota] Thanks! You'll be a great help!

I have amusement park tickets.

Would you want to go on our next break?

64
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,021
[nervously] To help us prepare
for our roles.

65
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,941
I mean, we've never gone out
just the two of us.

66
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,943
It'll deepen our friendship.

67
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,618
Sorry.

68
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:11,501
Let's go... to deepen our friendship.

69
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,212
What? Really?

70
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,548
Well, you want to go, right?

71

Yeah.

72
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,265
[Emika] Of course I want to go.

73
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,643
Because it'll be with
someone I've always liked.

74
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,899
I miss you, Mom...

75
00:04:35,025 --> 00:04:37,903
[Emika] When I was a child,
I saw Kanato on TV.

76
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,531
I fell in love
with his beautiful crying face.

77
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,827
[girl] I'll do my very best,
so please choose me!

78
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,913
Please take a seat.

79
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,665
Next. Your self-introduction, please.

80
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,671
I'm Emika Nanase.
It's great to meet everyone.

81
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,676
My special skills include
rolling my eyes and ballet.

82
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,721
[director] Is that so?
Eye rolling and ballet?

83
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,307
[Emika] I wanted to be
the girl closest to him,

84
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,768
and that's what
motivated me to come this far.

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:15,023
I'll do everything I can
to bring us closer together!

86

A natural, no-makeup makeup look,

87

It's perfect!

89
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:25,158
And yesterday,
I studied up on how to flirt.

FULL FLIRTING MODE!

91
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,410
GIVE HIM THE LOOK!

92
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,455
It's important to be myself,
but flirting is a special case.

93
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,625
It's time to make use
of all my experience as an actress

94
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:37,379
to make absolutely sure
Kanato sees me as a girl today!

95
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,214
[Kanato] Emika.

96
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,551
Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?

97
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,928
No, I just got here too.

98
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,639
[Emika] Wow!
His glasses and clothes look great!

99

And his face looks as amazing as always.
Thank you so much!

Nothing, just thinking
you look cute today.

102
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:05,031
[Emika] Calm down!
You've practiced this, remember?

103

[Kanato] What should we ride first?

108
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,888
I've heard the coaster here
is pretty popular.

109
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,641

-Yes?

174
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,252
You must never abandon your fans,
you hear me?

175
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:49,881
I understand.

176
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,591
Well, good work today.

177
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,009
Thank you.

178
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:55,887
Thank you.

179
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:02,936
You having fun?

180
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,982
Hey, we got 63!

181
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:10,401
-[Emika] Wow!
-[Kanato] Sixty-three? That's amazing.

182
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,321
-[bleating]
-[Emika laughs]

183
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:18,034
Oh, my gosh.
They make such adorable sounds! Mmm.

184
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:21,913
[Emika] Man, I'm so tired
of this flirting act.

185
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,749
Should we have lunch soon?
I heard they have beer here.

186
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,418
All right! A beer sounds great!

187
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,589
Amazing as usual, Kanato!

188
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,591
-That's perfect...
-[imitates Emika] "That's perfect!"

189
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,676
I knew it.

190
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,929
-How?
-You're being so obvious.

191
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,683
But it's my first time seeing someone
actually use those tricks on a date.

192
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,896
All right. Let's go grab a beer.

193
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,372
[Sahoko] Movie sets are kind of scary.

194
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:07,000
All right, time to rack my brain.

195
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:13,006
What?

196
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,676
Itsuki? What are you doing here?

197
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,095
I'm in this movie, too.

198
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,515
Is that so?

199
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,393
What?

200
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:47,123
[Sahoko] This feels awkward
for some reason.

201
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,958
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

202
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,587
[Emika] Mmm.

203
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,839
This is awesome!

204
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,177
-You're finally acting like yourself.
-What?

205
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,805
What's with the act you put on?
Did something happen?

206
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,017
No, well...

207
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:14,776
I wanted to practice
some flirting techniques for my acting.

208
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,445
That's ridiculous.

209
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:22,700
I think it's good
that you're passionate about your job,

210
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,286
but there's no need to act
during your time off.

211
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,667
You're fine just as you are, Emika.

212
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,965
Today, you're not allowed
to act in front of me!

213
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,220
Got it.

214
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,847
Good. That's better.

215
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:54,691
By the way, you and Kota
have complete opposite personalities,

216
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,859
but you two get along surprisingly well.

217
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:58,319
When did you become so close?

218
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:02,323
Well, I wonder...

219
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,453
What?

220
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:12,750

-[Kota] Sorry to keep you waiting, Sahoko!

225
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:45,324
[Kota whooping and laughing]

226
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:48,202
Kept you waiting, right? I took forever!

227
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,455
-Well...
-[laughing]

228
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,083
Hey! You're here too, Itsuki!

229
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,044
[laughing]

230
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,714
Hmm?

231
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,176
Hmm? Eh?

232
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,303
Itsuki, what's wrong?

233
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:11,142
I'm... against this.

234
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,227
Against what?

235
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,064
I...

236
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,778
To be honest, I'm against you
having a girlfriend, Kota.

237
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:24,906
What?

238
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:35,124
Just now, you seemed a little hesitant
to talk about Kota.

239
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,795
Let's not talk about him.

240
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,923
Come on, we're here
to deepen our friendship.

241
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,591
Tell me what's on your mind.

242
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,970
At first, I really didn't like Kota.

243
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:50,556
Wait, really? Why not?

244
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,102
It wasn't just me.

245
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,939
I think some of the other members
didn't really like him either.

246
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,111
In any case, I sure didn't.

247
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:13,496
To me, and to our fans...

248
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:16,666
You're our sun, Kota.

249
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,089
You're kind to your fans,
you're kind to everyone.

250
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,762
Even to your fellow members.

251
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:35,810
Despite my bad singing and dancing,
you shower me with all your love. But...

252
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,231
I think having a girlfriend
might change you.

253
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,151
I'm worried.

254
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,199
This is an important time for us,

255
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,703
so I'm not sure
you should have a girlfriend.

256
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:06,007
Unlike the others,
he has both good sense and talent.

257
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,427
He has the kind of personality
that anyone would love.

258
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,680
That's true. I know what you mean.

259
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:17,435
He has everything I lack,
and I was envious of him.

260
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:23,232
Everyone always compared us,
and it made me so frustrated.

261
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:27,153
But Kota always stays true to himself.

262
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,161
Even if I have a girlfriend,

263
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,915
my feelings towards my fans
will never change.

264
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,794
[Itsuki] Can't you break up with her?

265
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:45,171
That's impossible.

266
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,179
Because I know if I lose the one I cherish
and can never see them again,

267
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,681
no amount of regret

268
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,227
will ever bring them back to me.

269
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,813
But what if the fans find out?

270
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,817
If that happens, I'll tell them.

271
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:11,864
That she's my special one! [laughs]

272
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:19,247
It's not like I'm neglecting my work
or cutting corners or anything like that.

273
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:20,665
Hmm...

274
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:26,045
If people find out about Sahoko
and I lose everything because of that,

275
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:32,760
it means that the work I've done
wasn't enough.

276
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:36,138
Besides...

277
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,852
If you can't reach out your hand
to someone who is crying next to you,

278
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,857
you will never be able to
make everyone else smile.

279
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:56,200
It's as you say, Itsuki.

280
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,625
I also think that my presence

281
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:10,923
may sadden the fans
or someone else, for that matter.

282
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,594
But...

283
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,723
Even so, I can't give up.

284
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,268
I...

285
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,564
I don't ever want Kota
to be left alone again.

286
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,071
Sahoko.

287
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm sorry for what I said.

288
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,291
Please...

289
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,044
take good care of Kota.

290
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:53,174
I will.

291
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,676
[chuckles softly]

292
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,429
[♪ "YOU ARE SPECiAL" playing]

293
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,641
[Kanato] Kota's amazing.

294
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,355
When the two of us were grouped together,

295
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:12,735
he said, "Since we're complete opposites,
we make the best duo!"

296
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,572
That was when I started to respect him.

297
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:21,202
And it made me feel so small next to him.

298
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,540
So, since I can't
become someone like Kota,

299
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:32,088
I decided that I just need to focus
on what I can do.

300
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,843
What you said just now

301
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:41,555
was really profound.

302
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:44,975
Well, it's just my excuse
for being second best.

303
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:46,686
No.

304
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:50,773
It must have taken so much courage
for you to acknowledge your rival.

305
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,609
You must've struggled and felt frustrated.

306
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,779
So...

307
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:01,659
being able to face your frustrations
and admit Kota's strengths despite them

308
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,787
makes you the coolest person in the world
in my book.

309
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,499
I see.

310
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,586
Well, then...

311
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,133
Let's get on the Ferris wheel.

00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:22,763
What a beautiful view.

314
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,231
Look behind you.

00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,610
Hey, it's not nice to peek!

319

I've filmed countless kiss scenes.

320
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,083
It's nothing.
In fact, it's a piece of cake.

321
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,586
Yeah. I guess it will be easy.

322
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,588
That's right. Easy peasy.

323
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,506
By the way,

324
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,343
you've never told me
why you became an actress.

325
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,930
Well, that's...

326
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,142
We're here to bond, right?

327
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,226
Just tell me.

328
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,690
There is someone I admire.

329
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:24,158
I wanted to get close to him
and get him to acknowledge me.

330
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,409
So I became an actress.

331
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:30,873
Really?

332
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,627
Did you ever manage to meet him?

333
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,711
What?

334
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,925
Yeah, I met him.

335
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,930
Then, if you have a kiss scene with him,

336
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,641
Emika, won't you fall in love with him?

337

Well, yeah...

339
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,566
I think I might fall for him even more.

341
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,172
Emika. How was the date
at the amusement park?

342
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:27,555
I feel like we got closer to each other,
and deepened our bond...

343
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:32,768
But what do I do now?

344
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,354
What happened?

345
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:37,064
[sighs]

346
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,945
[Emika] Thanks for coming with me today.

347
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,406
Yeah. I had a good time.

348
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,117
But I'm kinda pissed.

00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,330
That guy you said you admire.

351
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,792
I can't believe the Emika Nanase
would say that about him.

352
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,127
He doesn't deserve it.

353
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,922
No. Actually, that person is--

354
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,966
It pisses me off so much,

355
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,011
I'll make sure you're glad
that I'm your co-star instead of him.

356
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,811
I'll make it the most unforgettable
kiss scene you've ever had.

357
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:23,611
What did he mean by that?

358
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,697
I don't get it either!

359
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:36,040
[woman in film] A shocking mystery
lies hidden within that company.

360
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:39,043
Unless that mystery is solved,

361
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,130
you two will also be left out in the cold.

362
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,883
THIS DRAMA IS A WORK OF FICTION

363
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:46,967
NEXT EPISODE PREVIEW

364
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:49,136
I shall become cupid... bringer of love!

365
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,096
Why won't you confess to Nanase?

366
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,432
[Emika] How can I make him
fall head over heels for me?

367
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,101
[Kota] Haru is like a little devil
that stirs up trouble.

368
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:57,937
What were you trying to do?

369
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,563
[Emika] What am I to you?
