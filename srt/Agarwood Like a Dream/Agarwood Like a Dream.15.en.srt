Greetings, Mr. Bai.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,060
Madam Ye told me

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,540
that if I need any ingredient
for Lord Wen's medicinal incense,

28
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,180
I may approach you for help, Mr. Bai.

29

Since Madam Ye sent you,

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,780
just let me know

thus, I'm unaware

51
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,980
of what happened there back then.

52
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,500
Once I get the water agarwood,

53
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,260
I will have it sent to your residence.

you may take your leave.

this white jade pendant

58
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,700

of the Bai family would wear.
