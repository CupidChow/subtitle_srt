saying you brought Ms. Chen back

It is tight.

165
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,020
I didn't mean that.

I thought it would be nice
for you to come tonight.

171
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,340
It would also reassure both families.

172

I never thought about marrying you.

your family's money and ingredients

184
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,300
and take a share
of the Qixiang Pavilion business,

185
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,340
you can reconsider it.

186
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,380
That day,

187
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,300
Rumeng was sent to the Pleasure House.

188
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,980
I'm sure you know better
than anyone else

189
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,220
who was the person behind it.

190
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,340
Chen Rumeng.

191
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,980
Just you wait.

192
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,620
Seems

193
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,740
I have to find a way to get that key

194
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,860
to open the box.

195
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,340
Today is Bai's birthday.

196
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,140
I know how to behave.

197
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,820
I'm clear today is about her.

198
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,820
She just invited me
to spend the night in her room,

199
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,660
just as you and Nan Qing did.

200
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,740
I don't know.

201
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,500
Nor am I interested.

202
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,620
How can you seem unconcerned?

203
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,700
Bai and I are both married to you.

204
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,340
Why should I compete with her
and get jealous?

205
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,100
I will make you jealous.

206
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,220
Ye Buhan!

207
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,020
Someone come!

208
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,900
