A decade has gone by.

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,540
I've never once let my guard down.

3
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:30,620
Ever since then, my life

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,340
has been devoid of the warmth
and blossoms of spring.

5
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,540
Who is it?

6
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,860
Who's been here?

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,540
It is Meng's mother.

8
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,540
It isn't me.

9
00:00:58,540 --> 00:00:59,740
Mother!

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,620
Beat her until she confesses.

This noon is the only reason

12
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,060
that I'm still alive.

[Agarwood Like a Dream]
Today's incense competition

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,580
has brought together
many incense makers,

15
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,900
with the theme being Spring Blossoms.

16
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,000
[Episode 1]
This year, Qixiang Pavilion's owner,

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,420
who is the head of the Ye family,
is hosting the incense competition,

18
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,980
which is why Her Highness
has been invited.

19
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,360
[Qixiang Pavilion]
The Ye family is renowned

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,180
for their expertise in incense-making

21
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,380
and has been a top contender
for many years,

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,820
so their status is beyond compare.

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,300
Is this girl also here to participate
in the incense competition?

24
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,060
She probably just came to the Ye family
to expand her horizons.

I'm back.

28

Who is it? Who's been here?

30
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,340
It is Meng's mother.

31
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,020
Mother!

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,900

it's been ten years,

34
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,180
and we finally met.

35
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,920
[Ye Buhan, the Ye family's sole heir]

36
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,540

Is it you who's going to compete
against me today?

38
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,900
While this is Ye's Mansion,

39
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,700
it doesn't seem
quite appropriate for you, Mr. Ye,

40
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,220
to grip my wrist like this,

41
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,860
especially

42
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,900
since you're about to marry
the young lady from the Bai family.

43
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
What's your name?

44
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,740
My name

45
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,380
is Chen Rumeng.

[The hour of Chen]

48

As expected, Madam and Her Highness
are indeed dazzling with their jewelry.

49
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,180
The lady next to them
must also be from a prestigious family.

50
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,780
These two incense makers

51
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,940
are the final contenders
in today's competition.

52
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,860
I've never seen this girl
in the register of incense makers,

53
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,820
yet she made it to the final round.

54

between the Bai and Ye families

in Shangjing,

[An esteemed guest of Wengong Mansion]
but this pink smoke is truly unheard of.

112

It's a rare sight indeed.

113

The shape of this incense
is remarkably lifelike,

is sweet and refreshing,

Choosing this year's champion
will surely be a tough task.

How dare you!

Your Highness,

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,460
this incense uses reverse smoke flow

136
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:38,180
to bring souls from the underworld
to the mortal realm,

137
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,100
hence it's called
the Path to the Underworld.

138
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,600
As our ancestors
watch over us from above,

139
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,140
this incense flows downward,

140
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,700
symbolizing the blessings of the divine.

141
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,220
That's why I created
this landscape incense.

142
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,060
This incense may be visually stunning,

143
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,660
but its fragrance is rather faint.

144
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,900
Please forgive my boldness.

145
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,340

Butterflies have flown in.

148
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
It's incredible that butterflies
are drawn to this scent.

149
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
It rivals real spring flowers.

150
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,780

I guess we do share
a special connection.

Thank you, Mr. Ye.

159
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,540
This is a keepsake left by my mother,

Mr. Ye, you're not my husband,

163
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,380

As the delicate fragrance
of agarwood lingers,

for quite some time.

171
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,700
Relying on the Bai family's wealth
isn't a sustainable solution.

172
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,860
Only by marrying
that young woman from Suiyang

173
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,020
can the Ye family survive in Shangjing.

174

to the Ye family's destruction

176
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,460
