When handling the incense seal,

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
it's essential to lift it

He must have known I was Ying Hemeng,

which is why he risked his life
to save me that day.

32
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,660
How's your injury?

33
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,900
Did you sleep well last night?

34
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,260
It was too cold in the mountains,

35
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,300
and I was worried
you might catch a chill,

36
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,580
so I took some extra time.

37
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,620
I've brought some herbs
that I specifically gathered

38
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,780

Ms. Chen,

43
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,740
ever since you married
into the Ye family,

44
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,060
our home has been beset
by continuous troubles.

45
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,780
Anyuan has been tirelessly managing
the household affairs,

46
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,620
and as a daughter-in-law
of the Ye family,

47
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,580
you should contribute
to the family as well.

48
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,220
[Incense Pact]
You've met Her Highness.

49
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,360
She's a distinguished guest
of the Qixiang Pavilion

50
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,620
that we cannot afford to offend.

51
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,140
You must ensure this matter
is handled properly.

52
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:05,820
Grandmother,

53
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,420
this is such an important matter.

54
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,460
I should be the one to handle it.

55
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,460
You're still recovering
from your injury.

56
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,380
Besides,

57
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,180
this trouble started
because of Ms. Chen,

58
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,620
so she ought to do something
for the Ye family.

59
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,420
I won't let you down, Grandmother.

I will reward you handsomely.

If this matter angers him,

99
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,140
it could lead to a messy situation.

100

Even if she has committed
a grave offense,

101
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,460
we can't afford to cross her.

102

Grandmother,

103
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,060
please don't get into another conflict
with Master because of her.

104
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,780
She's just a lowly wretch who plotted
against the Wengong Mansion.

105

Am I not allowed to punish her now?

106

what's going on here?

00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,100
The noble concubine who sampled
the incense with Her Highness

114
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,380
has suffered an unexplained miscarriage.

115
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,580
The imperial physician discovered

116
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,940
that it was due to the musk
that Ms. Chen added to the incense.

117
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,060
Coincidentally,

118
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,060
the servants caught the new doorman

119
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,940
lurking by the Southwest Pavilion today.

120
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,340
Keep talking.

121
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
According to him,

122
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,780
it was Ms. Chen who instructed him
to purchase the musk

123
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,820
and add it to Her Highness's incense.

124
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,660
I can't believe such a vicious person
would exist in Qixiang Pavilion.

125
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,140
What a disgrace to our family.

126
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,460
I told you that I'm innocent.

127
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,380
Shut up!

128
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,580
Grandmother,

129
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,500
you are wise and just.

130
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,020
Do we have any solid proof?

131
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:30,940
Master,

132
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,060
before he was caught,

133
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,140
I saw Ms. Chen talking to him.

134
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,140
I don't even know this person.

135
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,540
He just asked me for directions.

136
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,820
You have no place to speak here.

137
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,820
A pair of gold earrings belonging
to Ms. Chen was found on Sheng,

138
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,060
and he said Ms. Chen gave them to him
as a reward.

139
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
Those earrings were lost two days ago.

140
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,660
He must have stolen them.

141
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,540
Clearly, my words hold no sway
in the Ye family these days.

142
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,140
Sharp-tongued

143
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,140

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,580
Qingzhi, what are you waiting for?

145
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,220
Madam Ye,

146
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,100
since Mr. Ye is already here,

147
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,060
perhaps we should...

148
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,460
Your Highness,

149
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,380
please forgive me for going
against your wishes this time.

150
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,820
In this matter,

151
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,860
no one's words will make a difference.

152
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,900
Do you all really have no respect for me

153
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,900
in the Ye family now?

154
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,500
Buhan,

155
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,060
do you still see me as your grandmother?

156
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,380
Trust me.

157
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,220
I'm innocent.

158
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,100
How about

159
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,340
handing over Sheng to me?

160
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,740
I'll personally look into this matter

161
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
and give you an explanation.

162
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,820
But I know

163
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,980
that whether Rumeng is guilty or not,

164
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,660
she will be held responsible.

165
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,980
Buhan,

166
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:02,220
I don't think this solution is fair.

167
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,060
I think

168
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,580
it's better for Grandmother
to handle this matter.

169
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,980
She is my woman.

170
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,140
I'll deal with this myself.

171
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,500
I'll give her ten lashes myself,

172
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,020
and her life or death

173
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,660
will be determined by the heavens.
