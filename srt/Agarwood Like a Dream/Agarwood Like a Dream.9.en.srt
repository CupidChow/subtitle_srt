[Episode 9]

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,260
Anyuan,

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:10,980
do you realize your mistake?

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,300
Even though you
and Ms. Chen don't get along

18
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,260
and you've repeatedly
made things difficult for her,

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,860
have I ever criticized you for it?

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,260
But now,

21
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,620
you've dragged
Qixiang Pavilion into this.

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,580
If someone dies because of this,

23
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,300
do you think we could handle
Her Highness's wrath?

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,700
Are you trying to jeopardize
the Bai family's legacy?

25
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,260
Grandmother,

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,780
it was all my fault.

27
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,140
From now on,

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,780
I won't cause trouble for the Ye family
out of jealousy anymore.

29
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,500
I will remain in the inner quarters

30
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,900
and do my best to ease your burdens.

31
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,580
I arranged

32
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,740
your engagement with Buhan myself.

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,300
All these years,

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,380
I have treated you
as my own granddaughter.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,100
Before you do anything,

36
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,580
have you considered
the consequences for me

37
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,900
and Qixiang Pavilion?

38
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,820
I...

39
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,100
And you, Ms. Chen,

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,100
since you married into the Ye family,

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,660
have you ever found yourself
short on food, clothes, or money?

42
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,140
You're also accountable
for what's happened here.

43

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,700

Greetings, Madam Ye.

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,820
I hope you are well.

50
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,180
Greetings, Ms. Bai

51
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,980
and Ms. Chen.

52
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,100
Mr. Nan Qing,
we're honored by your visit.

53
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,460
Please, take a seat.

54
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,900
Mr. Nan Qing,

55
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,460
are you here today

56
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,860
because of Her Highness?

57
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,700
Rest assured, Madam Ye.

58
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,980
Mr. Ye and Ms. Chen

59
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,780
have already explained everything
to Her Highness.

60
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,100
Her Highness likes
the incense made by Ms. Chen

61
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,940
and has decided
not to pursue the matter any further.

62
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,060
Let's not bring it up again.

63
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,260
I won't.

64
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,300
To be honest,

65
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,660
I've come here today

66
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,900
with a request.

67
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,180
Mr. Nan Qing,

68
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,780
since it's your request,

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,580
I will fulfill it

70
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,740
as long as it's within my power.

71
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,900
Ten years ago,
Qixiang Pavilion had an incense,

72
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,820
just one whiff of which
left a lasting impression.

73
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,300
It was called Night Spirit.

74
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,980
I'm here today

75
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,580
to ask

76
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,300
for some more.

77
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,780
I hope you can grant my wish.

78
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,100
It's not that I wish to turn you down,

79
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,380
but the formula for Night Spirit
has been lost for many years.

80
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,980
I'm afraid no one

81
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,900
at Qixiang Pavilion can recreate it now.

82
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,820
Madam,

83
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,820
I'm sure

84
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,100
that Ms. Chen could give it a go.

85
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,940
Mr. Nan Qing,

86
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,540
stop putting her
in a difficult position.

87
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,900
At the incense competition
several months ago,

88
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,500
Ms. Chen's incense-making skills

89
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,020
were evident to all.

90
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,620
Though I'm no expert,

91
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,180
I've met some excellent incense makers

92
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,140
and have a bit of knowledge
on the subject.

93
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,060
Ms. Chen's skills

94
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,820
are undoubtedly those of a true artisan.

95
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,060
Since Mr. Nan Qing
has spoken so highly of you,

96
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,260
you should give it a try.

97
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,940
I'm flattered, Mr. Nan Qing.

98
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,660
I'll give it a try.

99
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,420
Since that's the case,

100
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,500
consider it a way to make amends.

101
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,820
Mr. Nan Qing,

102
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,900
once the Night Spirit incense is ready,

103
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,660
I'll have it delivered to your mansion.

104
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,820
Thank you, Madam Ye.

105
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,260
Ms. Chen,

106
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,140
since Mr. Nan Qing holds you
in such high esteem,

107
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:49,900
be sure

108
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,300
not to let anything go wrong this time.

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,180
Back then,

110
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,380
I was afraid people would find out
about me stealing the formula,

111
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,620
so I never revealed what I saw
on the day of the incident.

112
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,540
Little did I know, it indirectly led
to your mother's death.

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,020
I've been filled with regret

116
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,540
my heart can finally find peace.

The formula for Night Spirit.

118
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,460
What?

119
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,780
Just a little bit of criticism
from Grandma,

120
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,500
and you're already so upset?

121
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,980
It's just a bit stuffy in there,

122
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,460
so I just came out for some fresh air.

123
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:46,140
Even the great Mr. Nan Qing

124
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,660
is infatuated with you.

125
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,180
Now I understand

126
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,540
why Buhan is so captivated by you.

127
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm sure these tricks to charm men

128
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,660
were taught to you by your mother.

129
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,300
Please, Ms. Bai, mind your words.

130
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,060
Such words

131
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,020
are unbecoming of your status.

132
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,460
On the day of the incense competition,

133
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,940
you knew full well
that Buhan was already engaged,

134
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,260
yet you still tried to seduce him,

135
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,260
and on our wedding night,
you couldn't wait to climb into his bed.

136
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,820
Yes.

137
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,220
Go ahead and steal him
if you are so capable.

138
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,700
You went through all that trouble,

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,740
even throwing yourself at him,

140
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,980
but did he even look at you?

141
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,180
You!

142
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,580
Buhan,

143
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,780
we've been engaged for years,

144
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,980
and I'm your legitimate wife.

145
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,220
Are you really just going to stand there
and let her insult me like this?

146
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,660
You were the one
who spoke disrespectfully first.

147
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,180
I see, Chen Rumeng,

148
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,820
you're now using Buhan to back you up.

149
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,380
Enough!

150
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,380
We have visitors today,

151
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,780
so I'll let it slide.

155
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:27,380
I only said those things
to provoke her earlier,

156
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,500
don't take them

157
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
seriously.

158
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,460
Ms. Bai is different from me.

159
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,460
She's from the Bai family after all.

Buhan,

161
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
please don't cross
the Bai family because of me.

162
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,060
Don't you have anything
you want to say to me?

163
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,100
Mr. Nan Qing asked for you
to make the incense.

164
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,700
You should get to it right away.

165
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,700
Speak up if something's bothering you.

166
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,140
Don't take it out on the incense.

167
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,940
If you're tired,

168
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,140
just go back and rest.

169
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,460
You're making incense for Nan Qing,

170
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,860
and I'm not even allowed to take a look?

171
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,780
As an incense maker,

172
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,860
once I accept an order,

173
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,500
I must give it my all.

174
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,980
Besides,

175
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,580
Mr. Nan Qing is my friend,

176
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,860
and he appreciates the incense I make.

177
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,060
The Night Spirit he asked for

178
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,620
is not just his request,

179
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,060
but my wish too.

180
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,460
You said you trusted me,

181
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,900
but now you don't?

182
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,540
You're disrupting my work.

183
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,620
If you won't let me make it here,

184
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,620
I'll do it elsewhere.

185
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,460
No need.

186
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,700
I'll just watch.

187
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,020
Stop causing trouble.

188
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,260
Don't touch that!

189
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,260
You knew my identity long ago,

190
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,260
so why didn't you expose me?

191
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,300
Why do you keep playing along?

192
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,620
Do you enjoy watching people like me

193
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,860
struggle in despair?

194
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,500
Just like how you lied back then,

195
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,260
accusing my mother of being a murderer?

196
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,100
You watched her suffer

197
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,020
and die with an injustice unavenged,

198
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,460
and it made you happy, didn't it?

199
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,900
What I said

200
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,740
was just what I saw.

201
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,140
I didn't lie.

202
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740
Your mother

203
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,220
entered my father's room late at night,

204
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,180
and they seemed intimate

205
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,060
in an inappropriate way.

206
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,860
Don't speak of my mother like that!

207
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,060
You want to kill me?

208
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,940
Since the day my mother died,

209
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,540
I've wanted to kill you.

210
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,860
Look carefully.

211
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,900
Only someone who's left-handed

212
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,220
would wield a knife like that.

213
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,780
My mother was right-handed,

214
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,500
so she wouldn't kill
with her left hand.

215
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,420
Do you still think

216
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,300
she's the murderer?

217
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,580
Come with me.
