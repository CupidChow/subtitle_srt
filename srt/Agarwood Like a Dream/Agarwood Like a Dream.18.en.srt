I remember you're in charge
of ingredient purchases.

The average unit price
for Frankincense is five qian.

The top-quality ones
cost two more qian at most.

But the purchase price on the books
is double that.

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,980
Is someone pocketing the extra profit

in the ingredient market.
