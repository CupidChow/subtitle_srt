[Episode 12]

15
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,700
I happened to acquire
an incense burner today.

16
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,940
It pairs perfectly
with the new incense you made.

17
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,020
May I invite you
to the incense event for a chat?

18
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,460
It's getting cold lately.

19
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,220
I hope you are in good health.

20
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,700
How is Meng?

21
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,420
Don't forget to wear more layers.

22
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,660
Ling,

23
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,420
I've acquired a new formula

24
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,820
based on peony.

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,940
It fills the room with fragrance
when burned.

26
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,020
I just found out

27
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,020
peonies should be given
to one's beloved person.

28
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,660
This is my father's handwriting.

29
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,580
Why is this in my mother's room?

30
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,020
"The lad and lass

31
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,060
have a happy hour,

32
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,020
giving each other peony flowers."

33
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,780
Turns out your father and my mother

34
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,060
had such a history.

35
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,700
If we had known they were in love,

36
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,300
we wouldn't have

37
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,700
misunderstood each other
for so many years.

38
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,340
I did see your mother

39
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,580
enter the Southwest Pavilion.

40
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,220
The next morning,

41
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,580
my father was found dead.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,660
But why was there

43
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,660
an incense knife
engraved with my mother's name?

44
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,140
Perhaps it was a gift

45
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,940
that my father had prepared
for your mother.

46
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,620
Tonight's moonlight is enchanting.

47
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,740
Would you join me for a moonlit stroll?

48
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,260
Promise me,

49
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,380
don't leave me

50
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,380
no matter what happens.

51
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,900
How can you still play weiqi here?

52
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,700
I am also Buhan's wife.

53
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,740
But he only took that seductress
to the lantern fair with him

54
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,620
on Mid-Autumn night.

55
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,380
Do you remember what I told you

56
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,740
before you got married?

57
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,980
My feelings for Buhan are sincere.

58
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,060
No need for you to tell me.

59
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,140
I certainly wish
to be a loving couple with him.

60
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,900
If it weren't for Chen Rumeng,

61
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,940
with my relationship with Buhan,

62
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,700
we would have spent Mid-Autumn together.

63
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,620
Instead of obsessing over who he loves,

64
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,420
you should think

65
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,460
about how to reclaim control
over the Ye family.

66
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,300
What do you mean?

67
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,140
Madam Ye wishes

68
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,340
you and Ye Buhan
to have a child as soon as possible.

69
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,460
I have a prescription

70
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,460
that can be of help.

71
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,980
Today, I had a beloved daughter.

72
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,700
She brought great joy to my life.

73
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,260
"The night is warm in the pavilion
with the curtains down.

74
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,420
Lonely, I pity the crane
that dreams alone."

75
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,260
I named her Hemeng,
meaning "crane dream",

76
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,860
and gave her the surname Ying,
after my beloved.

77
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,340
The full name of my daughter
is Ying Hemeng.
