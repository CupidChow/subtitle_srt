[Episode 20]

15
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,740
My wife falls for me

16
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,860
and is willing to marry me.

17
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,780
You no longer stand a chance.

18
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,420
Rumeng,

19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,580
it was him who killed your father.

20
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,900
Why are you marrying him?

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,100
Everyone,

22
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,220
please follow me
to the front hall for the feast.

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,020
Okay.

24
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,820
Let's go.

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,100
Let's go.

26
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,260
Please.

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,100
My father?

28
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,660
That man never acknowledged my mother.

29
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,420
Who is him to be called my father?

30
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
If he hadn't killed Ye Cheng,

31
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,380
your mother wouldn't have died.

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:35,020
I've never harmed Meng's mother.

33
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,340
The one who got her mother killed

34
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,180
was the Ye family.

35
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,900
I've brought down the Ye family

36
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,620
to avenge Meng.

37
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,020
To me, it was the Ye family
that killed my mother.

38
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,740
Ye Cheng's death

39
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,220
is not my concern.

40
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,820
I am not Ye Cheng's son,

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,420
but he treated me as his own.

42
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,740
I must seek justice for his death.

43
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,860
Very well.

44
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,220
I will give you your justice today.

45

What's your evidence?

46
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,980
That night,

47
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,060
it wasn't until Ying Ling left

48
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,180
that Master Cheng was killed by you.

49
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,860
When you ran away,

50
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,580
you dropped a pendant from your waist.

51
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,180
It matches the white jade

52
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,500
that you are wearing.

53
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,860
Where is the pendent?

54
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,860
Ms. Chen,

55
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,820
you should know it well.

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
Even if that's the case,

57
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,460
years have passed since that happened.

58
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,820
Why didn't you accuse me until now?

59
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,380
Besides,

60
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,700
the Xiangnan White Jade

61
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,740
could be what you stole
from Bai's Mansion.

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,380
You...

63
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,460
Meng.

64
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,500
He is no good person.

65
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,580
He also killed Lord Wen.

66
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,420
You knew Meng had placed
Fritillaria ussuriensis in the incense

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,900
that she prepared for Lord Wen.

68
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,060
So you bribed the servant
who cooked medicine for him

69
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,980
and had him add a herb

70
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,020
called Pinellia ternata.

71
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,540
These two herbs

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,020
are antagonistic to each other.

73
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,380
It was because of the Pinellia ternata

74
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,100
that Lord Wen suddenly died.

75
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,380
Nonsense!

76
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,580
It is a prominent family,

77
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,100
and Her Highness

78
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,500
is Anyuan's foster mother.

79
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,580
Why would I harm Lord Wen?

80
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,740
Everything you've done

81
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,020
was for you to get her.

82
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,220
Mr. Ye,

83
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:31,340
are you so jealous of me

84
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,020
that you've had a delusion?

85
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,100
This

86
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,100
is the prescription
from the imperial physician.

87
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,260
This

88
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,260
is the one he gave to the apothecary.

89
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,860
It has his signature on it.

90
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,860
You are not leaving here alive today.

91
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,820
I'm telling you,

92
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,860
I killed Ye Cheng.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,340
He looked as terrified

94
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,860
as you are now.

95
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,340
I never thought of marrying you.

96
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,620
All of this

97
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,580
was a trap set for you.

98
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,900
You are not Ye Cheng's son.

99
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,260
So Buhan and I

100
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,060
are not siblings.

101
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,420
Since this is the case,

102
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,380
I'll take the opportunity
to leave the family.

103
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,060
Bai Chengzhi is bound to take action
against the Ye family.

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,060
Now,

105
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,380
we have no other choice.

106
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,380
Turns out I am the outsider.

107
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,380
I'll leave.

108
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,260
Buhan!

109
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:25,980
Meng.

110
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,300
I will let Bai Anyuan stay

111
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,820
and keep the Bai family.

112
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,620
Buhan!

113
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,700
I misunderstood you

114
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,860
about the medicinal incense.

115
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,700
I hope you don't take it personally.

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,540
Certainly not, Your Highness.

117
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,340
Thank you for trusting Buhan.

118
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,820
Otherwise,

119
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,820
we wouldn't have been able

120
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,780
to identify the murderer so quickly.

121
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,580
I didn't expect

122
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,540
you would invite me.

123
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,260

124
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,860
