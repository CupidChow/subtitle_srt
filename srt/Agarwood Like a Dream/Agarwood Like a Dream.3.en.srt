[Episode 3]

15
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,780
Greetings, Ms. Bai.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,900
Let me take a look.

17
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,820
Who might this Ms. Bai be?

18
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,660
She's made quite some noise last night.

19
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,100
How can someone like that be worthy
of joining the Ye family?

20
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,540
She's hardly any different
from the courtesans of a pleasure house.

21
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,540
Right after Grandmother handed me
the Token of the Household Head,

22
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,020
she stole it and rushed off
to the Southwest Pavilion.

23
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,350
She's truly asking for trouble.

24
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
Greetings, Bai.

25
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,980
I was just trying to help,

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,740
with no offense intended.

27
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,260
No offense intended?

28
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,220
So you're admitting
you did it on purpose?

29
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Ms. Chen,

30
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,940
you stole
the Token of the Household Head

31
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,780
and impersonated Ms. Bai.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:19,900
Now that Ms. Bai
is the head of the household,

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,820
while you, Ms. Chen,
are the one in the wrong,

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,860
you ought to kneel and respond.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,210
Both Ms. Bai and I

36
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,700
are the daughters-in-law
of the Ye family.

37
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,260
Why should I kneel and respond?

38
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,580
Ms. Chen,
if you don't understand the rules,

39
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,540
don't blame us servants
for being heavy-handed.

40
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,100
Who would have thought
a member of the Bai family

41
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,380
would be among the Ye family's servants?

42
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,220
Never mind.

43
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,260
The priority now
is to get out of here quickly.

44
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,980
I'm to be blamed
for what happened today.

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,660
I willingly accept your punishment.

46
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,500
Since you want to help,

47
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,550
did you know

48
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,780
that despite the spring flowers
blooming everywhere,

49
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,740
the Qixiang Pavilion's incense workshop

50
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,060
is missing a key ingredient?

51
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,220
What a pity.

52
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,500
I've dedicated myself to incense-making
since I was a child.

53
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
If you let me into the workshop,

54
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,700
I'm sure I can help you
find the missing ingredient.

55
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,140
Then tie up Ms. Chen

56
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,980
and send her to the incense furnace
for refinement.

57
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,620
The Bai family has ample resources,

58
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,700
but you must know better than I do

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,260
that the ambergris from a sperm whale

60
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,620
is a rare treasure,

61
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,500
and the musk extracted from a deer

62
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,900
lasts the longest.

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,820
Animal-derived scents

64
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,100
are naturally more intense
than plant-based ones.

65
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,420
What the Qixiang Pavilion

66
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,460
is missing now

67
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,950
is a certain feminine fragrance.

68
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,820
I've heard
that you've long admired Mr. Ye

69
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,300
and are skilled in incense-making.

70
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,980
If you

71
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,020
are willing to join the flowers

72
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,260
in the steamer,

73
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,020
it would truly honor
your marriage to the Ye family

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,500
and be a great contribution
to the Qixiang Pavilion.

75
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,620
It's only been two days,

76
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,060
and you already hold
such a grudge against me?

77
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,860
Jinling, don't overstep your bounds.

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,260
Two days?

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,540
You have a remarkable memory.

80
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,180
You spent last night with our husband.

81
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,060
To me,

82
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,220
it's far more than just one day.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,380
Steam her at once!

84
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,220
What are you doing?

85
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,740
It wasn't me, I didn't do it.

86
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,100
Do you feel better now?

87
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,620
Mr. Ye,

88
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,460
this is the weapon
that wounded Ms. Chen.

89
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,660
Ms. Chen,

90
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,380
you need to be more careful
in the future.

91
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,380
The wound is just below the collarbone,

92
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,140
and thankfully, it missed your heart,

93
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,260
you've narrowly escaped with your life.

94
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,180
Narrowly escaped with my life?

95
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,340
Bai, you speak so lightly of it.

96
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:22,060
Should my life truly be seen
as something so unimportant?

97
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,340
No matter how much you resent me,

98
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,260
you shouldn't go as far
as to take my life.

99
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,220
Ridiculous!

100
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,140
When have I ever wanted
to take your life?

101
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,590
You're the one who stole
the Token of the Household Head,

102
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,220
and you think that's justified?

103
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,540
Buhan,

104
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,580
what happened today
isn't just an accident.

105
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,580
It's that Bai

106
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,380
holds a grudge
because I spent the night with you.

107
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,100
For her, it felt like an eternity.

108
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,580
The Token of the Household Head
has always been in her hands,

109
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,540
and the passing workers heard everything.

110
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,940
She resents me.

111
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,500
That's why she wants me dead.

112
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,420
Ye.

113
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,140
Buhan,

114
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,460
you didn't come to my room last night,

115
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,180
and I admit I was disappointed,

116
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:03,020
but I've never laid a hand on Chen.

117
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,540
Jinling.

118
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,020
Master,

119
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,980
Chen Rumeng
has always shown a deceitful character,

120
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,540
while Ms. Bai is a noblewoman
from a prestigious family,

121
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,660
so she's clearly been wronged.

122
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,580
Is this the maid trained by you?

123
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,580
She's sharp-tongued

124
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,740
and everyone here knows

125
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,340
that Jinling works for your Bai family.

126
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,900
How credible can her testimony be?

127
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,020
If you didn't harm her,

128
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,820
then why is the hairpin

129
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,500
Grandmother gave you here?

130
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,500
I saw what happened there.

131
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,020
I'm the only daughter
of the Bai family from Pinggu,

132
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,540
marrying into the Ye family
with a grand dowry.

133
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
And today, I've received the Token
of the Household Head Madam.

134
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,700
Why would I have any reason to harm her?

135
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
Buhan,

136
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,900
if Bai wants to reprimand me,

137
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,020
then I'll accept my fate.

138
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,520
But I've just joined the Ye family,

139
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,460
and I've already suffered
great misfortune.

140
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,180
Everyone in this mansion

141
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,060
knows about our consummation last night

142
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,340
and my devotion to you.

143
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,260
Now that Bai has the Token
of the Household Head,

144
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,340
if there isn't an explanation
for what happened today,

145
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,220
how could I continue to stay here?

146
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,780
I'd be cast out,

147
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,420
with no place to go.

148
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,180
Grandmother has consented

149
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
to reclaim the token from Ms. Bai.

150
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,460
Buhan,

151
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:24,420
I admit there was an argument
with Chen Rumeng,

152
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,940
but she deliberately pushed me

153
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,420
and pretended to be hurt by me.

154
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,340
This woman is full of schemes,

155
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,860
and we must be cautious around her.

156
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,780
Buheng.

157
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,140
Ms. Bai, please.

158
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,780
Jinling.

159
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,460
That vile woman twisted the facts
and accused me,

160
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,220
and now Buhan has taken back the token,

161
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,100
making it hard for me
to move freely in the mansion.

162
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,820
My lady, please don't be upset.

163
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,380
It's not worth harming your health.

164
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,740
But that vile woman
actually thinks she can rise above me.

165
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,620
My lady, please don't be anxious.

166
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,980
The family head has a message for you.

167
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
In that case,

168
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,220
let's wait and see how things unfold.

169
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,620
Doukou, come and greet Mr. Ye now.

170
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,180
Greetings, Master.

171
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,580
She seems well-behaved.

172
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,620
Doukou is a distant relative of mine
from Suiyang.

173
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,660
She may have come
from humble beginnings,

174
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,180
but she's smart enough.

175
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,820
With so many servants
and maids around Bai,

176
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,660
now that I am injured,

177
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,900
I just want someone caring by my side.

178
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,540
Can you understand, Buhan?

179
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,260
It's fine.

180
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,740
Buheng, help her settle in.

181
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,420
Yes, sir.

182
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,860
You've had quite a day today.

183
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,500
After all that effort,

184
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,640
you wouldn't just want to bring

185
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,780
a little maid
into the mansion, would you?

186
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,860
I only thought of this cousin

187
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,740
because I got injured.

188
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,100
When Buheng took Doukou in,

189
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,420
they talked about old times in Suiyang,

190
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,780
but she didn't know anything.

191
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,980
Didn't you two grow up
in Suiyang together?

192
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,980
Maybe she forgot
because she was too young.

193
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,460
Are you really from Suiyang?

194
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,220
Is your surname truly Chen?

195
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,260
When I was little, I had a maid

196
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:17,020
whose name also contained
the character "Meng."

197
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,700
But her mother made a mistake,

198
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,420
and as a result, she was cast out
of the Ye's Mansion at a very young age.

199
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,420
No one knows if she's still alive.

200
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,380
But she was the daughter
of our family's enemies,

201
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,180
so it wouldn't matter even if she died.

202
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,740
Seeing your injury today,

203
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,180
I suddenly remembered

204
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,140
that maid

205
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,580
had a red birthmark on her back,

206
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,300
shaped like a blooming spring flower.

207
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,580
I wonder if you can imagine it.

208
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,140
If you want to remove this birthmark
without leaving a trace,

209
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,380
it will require cutting away
half the skin from your body.

210
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,340
Miss,

211
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,740
you'd better think carefully.

212
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,420
Ms. Diannan,

213
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,540
I have made up my mind.

214
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,340
Please go ahead.

215
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,140
By the time Buheng
finished the investigation,

216
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,580
you had already died,

217
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,620
yet she's too suspicious.
