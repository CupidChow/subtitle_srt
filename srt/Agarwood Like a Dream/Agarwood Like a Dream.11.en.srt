It's so cold.

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,660
Before my mother died,

47
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,820
she told me to leave this mansion.

48
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,740
I didn't expect I...

49
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,380
I'm here.

50
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,180
Mr. Ye, bad news.

51
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,420
Something's off at the store.

52
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,940
Everyone, listen up.

53
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,100
Look what the Qixiang Pavilion did

54
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,460
to our beautiful lady.

55
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,660
She applied your incense

56
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,100
and now her face is covered in rashes.

57
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,980
How is she going
to meet anyone now?

58
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,980
They are from the Pleasure House.

59
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,580
I'll go check this
in the Pleasure House.

60
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,060
I need to see your shopkeeper!

61
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,540
Talk to me about it.

62
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,580
Who do you think you are?

63
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm not talking to you.

64
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,860
How come you look so familiar?

65
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,180
Oh, it's the person
who harmed me last time.

66
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,420
What?

67
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,980
Hurting me is not enough,

68
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
and you're aiming
at the Qixiang Pavilion now?

69
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,940
The Pleasure House

70
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,300
has a booming business
every Mid-Autumn Festival.

71
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
But

72
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,100
your incense has stopped me
from making money this year.

73
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,780
I'm not letting this go.

74
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,180
Don't think about getting away today.

75
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,740
Are you okay?

76
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,220
Thank you, Mr. Nan Qing.

77
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,500
Buheng,

78
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,060
take Mr. Nan Qing to get changed.

79
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,300
Mr. Nan Qing,

80
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,260
please.

81
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,540
You've seen what happened.

82
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,580
They know it's their problem.

83
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,700
Their shopkeeper
doesn't dare to come out.

84
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,140
I just went to the Pleasure House

85
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,580
and checked your Mid-Autumn menu.

86
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,860
It's mostly seafood.

87
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,900
I heard she's allergic to seafood.

88
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,340
It gives her a rash.

89
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,460
Are you holding a grudge from last time

90
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,260
so you're here today
to frame the Qixiang Pavilion?

91
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,860
I... I will report this
to the authorities!

92
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,100
Very well.

93
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,900
Let's settle
our old and new grudges there.

94
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,100
We'll get you to the authorities now.

95
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,700
Take them away!

96
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,020
You...

97
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,500
Please rest assured.

98
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,780
Our incense is produced

99
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,700
for medicinal purposes.

100
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,820
Our incense-making adheres
to seasonal patterns,

101
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,540
bringing you fragrance
and health benefits.

102
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,100
Please do not worry.

103
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,420
Mr. Ye.

104
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,300
Why are you here?

105
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,500
Mr. Nan Qing is here
to collect the Night Spirit.

106
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,780
Then why is he wearing my clothes?

107
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,500
The Madame of the Pleasure House
threw ink on me,

108
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,340
and Mr. Nan Qing blocked it.

109
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
But

110
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,660
I've never seen you in this outfit.

111
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,900
He can't wear it
even if I don't want to.

112
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,820
Buheng,

113
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,660
buy him a new outfit.

114
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,540
Mr. Ye,

115
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,700
I'll have this cleaned
and returned to you in a few days.

116
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,900
Just throw it away.

117
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,740
Rumeng,

118
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,820
let's go to the lantern fair.

119
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,740
Come on,

120
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:13,700
take a look here.

121
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,460
Don't miss it.

122
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,660
Let's continue.

123
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,820
Everyone,

124
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,900
the next prize

125
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,300
is a box of years-aged incense.

126
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,500
It's what my mother made.

127
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Autumn bathes the room in light;
the moon shines bright.

128
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:32,980
The moon.

129
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,900
Wrong.

130
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,220
Mooncake.

131
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,460

132
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:37,900
White jade plate.

133
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,980
All wrong.

134
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,980
Incense burner.

He's my husband.

137
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,940
Please give me the prize.

138
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,940
Only the winner of today's contest
may take this incense.

139
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,700
This gentleman

140
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,860
answered one riddle correctly.

141
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,540
Anyone else willing to challenge?

142
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,940
Best three out of five.

143
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,260
Me.

144
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,260
I can't.

145
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,500
Round when drawn
and square when written.

146
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,100
Short in winter and long in summer.

147
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,460
The sun.

148
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,380
Brilliant.

149
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,700
- That's a tricky one.
- It's challenging indeed.

150
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,980
- Bravo!
- Impressive!

151
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,900
It's small when big and big when small.

152
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,340
When it gets bigger, it disappears.

153
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,700
Stone in water.

154
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,460
Impressive. It's correct again.

155
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:30,780
Great.

156
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,380
Leaving at the start of the year
and returning at the end.

157
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,300
The answer is "many".

wins the prize.

163
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,700
An obsession, a thought,
a fleeting life.

164
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,420
A sorrow, a joy, and a regret.

165
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,180
Life is like a dream.

166
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,420
How long can one enjoy happiness?

167
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,260
Only the beauty

168
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,020
is what I yearn for.

169
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,500
Congratulations, sir.

170
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,500
The prize is yours now.

171
