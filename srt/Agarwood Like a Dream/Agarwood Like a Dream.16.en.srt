00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,180
[Episode 16]

15
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,380
You asked me to come back today.

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,100
Is it because you know Buhan
didn't return to the mansion last night?

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,660
Wearing winter clothes in autumn,

18
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,140
it seems you've truly been living

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,820
a lonely and bitter life
in Ye's Mansion.

20
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,180
I lack both the authority
to manage the household

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,260
and Buhan's love,

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,980
so life in the inner chambers

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,180
is lonely and helpless.

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,980
But I didn't painstakingly arrange
for you to marry into Ye's Mansion

25
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,540
just for you to be consumed by jealousy

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:48,860
and waste away in the inner chambers!

27
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,860
Without the love of Buhan,

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,780
how could I possibly find my footing
in the Ye family?

29
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,820
Even if this strategy doesn't work,

30
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,300
there are other ways.

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,940
There are many ways to win.

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,820
But I've been in love
with Buhan for many years

33
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,260
and have tried everything.

34
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,060
If you have a solution,

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,180
then take care of it yourself.

36
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,980
Do you know
why I must acquire Qixiang Pavilion?

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,900
Of course, I know.

38
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,420
The Bai family may currently
be the richest in Shangjing.

39
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,820
But just because our wealth
was built in only two generations,

40
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,420
we are seen as less
than those with century-old enterprises.

41
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,060
What my father and I
strove for but couldn't achieve,

42
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,660
they were born into.

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,020
How is that fair?

44
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,700
Our father chose Qixiang Pavilion

45
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,980
after much consideration

46
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,180
as an opportunity to change our destiny.

47
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,740
After all, Qixiang Pavilion
has lasted over ten generations

48
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,620
and is one of the Five Great Businesses
in Shangjing.

49
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,300
Among them,

50
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,620
only fragrance materials

51
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:48,620
are something the Bai family
can strategically control.

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,580
Given my situation in the Ye family,

53
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,180
how could I possibly talk about
taking control of Qixiang Pavilion?

54
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:07,980
If someone of the Bai family's lineage
inherited Qixiang Pavilion,

55
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,460
we would be able
to improve our status much sooner.

56
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:16,420
But Ms. Chen is a master
at captivating hearts.

57
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,620
Now that she's back at Qixiang Pavilion
making incense,

58
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,460
if she bears Buhan's child before me,

59
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,220
how could I possibly control
the Ye family?

60
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,020
All you need to do

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,300
is hand this letter to Madam Ye.

62
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,820
After staying up for several nights,
you and Master

63
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:05,260
have finally created
the incense Her Highness wanted.

64
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,700
No,

65
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,380
don't go.

66
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,740
Don't leave me.

67
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,980
Don't leave me.

68
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,980
He's burning up.

69
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,100
I'll go get a physician.

70
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,260
Don't leave.

71
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,940
Don't leave.

72
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Don't leave.

73
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,820
Okay.

74
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,140
I won't leave.

75
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,780
The weather is really nice today.

76
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,740
Please take a seat.

77
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,980
Anyuan,

78
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:50,660
it's such a relief to see you and Buhan

79
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,180
back on good terms.

80
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,900
If you can have a child with him,

81
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,180
I'll feel at ease

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,780
handing the family business over to you.

83
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,060
Grandmother.

84
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,060
I...

85
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,820
Are you feeling unwell?

86
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,220
I might have caught a chill.

87
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,940
Madam, bad news.

88
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,220
What's going on?

89
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,180
Just now, we received news
from Lord Wen's Mansion.

90
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,140
After Lord Wen

91
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,780
used the medicinal incense
sent by Ms. Chen,

92
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
he suddenly fainted.

93
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
Now, Her Highness is furious,

94
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,900
the imperial physicians are
with Lord Wen, diagnosing his condition.

95
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,340
Hurry,

96
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,580
get the carriage ready.

97
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,100
I'll go to Lord Wen's Mansion.

98
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,540
Yes, Madam.

99
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,380
Grandmother,

100
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,500
I believe you should not intervene
at this moment.

101
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,180
From what I can tell,

102
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,180
since he collapsed suddenly
after using the medicinal incense,

103
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,380
if the issue
really lies with the incense,

104
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,500
it's most likely that someone's trying
to harm the Qixiang Pavilion.

105
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,020
The priority now

106
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,780
is to find out who this person is.

107
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,100
I've suspected something was off

108
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,980
ever since the incident

109
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,820
at Ye's Mansion.

110
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,220
Confess now!

111
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,420
What exactly did you put

112
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,660
in the medicine incense for Lord Wen?

113
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,020
I hold no grudges against Lord Wen,

114
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,860
so why would I harm him?

115
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,860
It's you

116
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,420
who have repeatedly
made things difficult for me.

117
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,420
We've inspected it.

118
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,020
The medicinal incense
sent to Lord Wen's Mansion

119
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,820
is the same as the one you have left.

120
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,260
It's the incense you made.

121
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,300
Now, you can't say that it was me
who added musk to harm you.

122
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,420
If you're set on blaming me,
there's always a pretext.

123
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,940
I didn't do it,

124
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,260
so why should I confess?

125
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,380
Because you are Ying Hemeng.

126
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,060
Your mother took her own life

127
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,580
in this very room out of guilt.

128
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,820
This is why you resent the Ye family

129
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,420
and have caused trouble over and over.

130
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,700
My mother was killed by the Ye family!

131
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,660
If it weren't for the tricks
you used back then,

132
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,980
how could she have never had the chance
to step into the courtroom

133
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,100
and die here of illness?

134
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,410
Torture and forced confessions

135
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:12,100
are exactly
what the Ye family excels at!

136
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,660
Shut up!

137
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,260
Use the wet paper.

138
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:43,140
Meng!

139
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,860
Meng!

140
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,860
Madam,

141
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,020
Master is here.

142
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,220
Where's Meng?

143
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,060
What's the matter?

144
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,620
I just need to ask her
a couple of questions.

145
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,900
Grandmother,

146
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,260
Ying Hemeng

147
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,300
is your granddaughter.

148
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,940
I named her Hemeng,

149
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,500
and gave her the surname Ying,
after my beloved.

150
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,180
The full name of my daughter
is Ying Hemeng.

151
