the feelings I experienced
were overwhelming.

That day in the incense workshop,

you intentionally bumped into me,

of the Ye family's young master

99

100
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,500

when we met at Qixiang Pavilion
back then

102
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,340
and vowed I would only marry you.

103
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,090
However, I recently learned

104
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,220
that you are going to wed
the young lady from the Bai family,

105
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,140

to such desperate measures.
