This is the weapon from that day.

No murderer

17

[Ying Ling]

20
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,740
Why didn't you expose me?

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,500
I was worried
that if you knew the truth,

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,060
you would insist
on finding the real murderer.

23
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,300
The murderer

24
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,100
killed my father unguarded

25
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,340
and then escaped.

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,220
They must be someone the Ye family knew.

27
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,100
If you act rashly,

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,580

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,860

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,820
Your speculation is right.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,740
It's from the Bai family.

32
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,860
Where did you get this from?

Do you remember an incense maker

was driven out.

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,860
Wen Zhong left with this secret.

39
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,660
He kept it until I met him again.

When I left Ye's Mansion,

43
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,100
I was adrift

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,420
and begged for a living

45
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,860
until one day,

46
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,860
I met a smuggler

47
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,460
who sold me into a pleasure house.

48
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,220
I was too young

49
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,020
and had to stay in the backyard
doing the drudgery.

50
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,380
Laundry, boiling water,
cooking, and cleaning the yard.

51
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,900
I did all the hard work.

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,700
Meet me next time.

53
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,620
See you.

54
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,260
I am sorry.

56

thought I had a talent
for incense making

61
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,060
and kept me by her side.

62
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,860
Life became easier.

63
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,700
Later,

64
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,260
I started to make fragrances
for the girls.

65
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,420
Backflow incense was an invention
during that time.

66
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:03,020

Right,

69
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,140
it's from the well-known
Qingyun Restaurant in Shangjing.

70
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,500
What you missed,

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,180
I'll make it all up to you.

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,100
That day,

73
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,820
I merely raised my voice a bit
when speaking to Ms. Chen,

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,020
and Buhan told me
he was going to divorce me.

75
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,820
How could I stay in the Ye family?

76
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,100
The Ye family is not for him
to make the decisions.

77
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,300
Grandmother,

78
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,660
Buhan has his struggles

79
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,420
and I don't wish
to make it difficult for him.

80
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,940
You and Buhan

81
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,140
grew up together,

82
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,580
and you are his wife

83
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,260
with a proper marriage

84
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,700
arranged by our family.

85
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,460
But his heart is only with her.

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,460
On the wedding day,

87
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,260
you saw how calculating
Ms. Chen could be.

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,540
Buhan is still young

89
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,900
and can be unsure about his feelings.

90
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,100
I shouldn't ask

91
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,380
about your intimate life,

92
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,380
but it's been months

93
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,340
since your wedding day.

94
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,620
Have you spent any nights

95
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,500
with Buhan?

96
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,380
A woman's status rises with her child.

97
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,980
The priority now

98
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,020
is to bear a child.

99
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,820
But Buhan won't even enter my room.

100
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,500
How could I...?

101
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,260
Do not worry.

102
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:18,140
I have my plans.

103
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,340
Egg yolk pastry,

104
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,420
Osmanthus cakes,

105
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,980
Drunken Crab in Huadiao Wine,

106
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,420
and steamed smoked venison

107
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,220
are all signature dishes
of the Qingyun Restaurant.

108
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,940
The delicacies were once out of reach,

109
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:44,900
and now,

110
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,700
I can finally taste them.

111
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,740
The pastry looks lovely.

112
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,100
It's sweet, not overwhelming,

113
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,060
but it breaks easily.

114
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,220
That's like
all the beautiful things in life.

115
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,140
They always slip away too quickly.

116
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,940
The crust is flaky,

117
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,700
but the inside is soft yet resilient.

118
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,540
Just like

119
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,260
how Chen Rumeng appeared

120
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,660
after I searched for Ying Hemeng
for ten years

121
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,140
and found she had died.

122
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,820
You hid the box on the lower floor
of the Southwest Pavilion

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,700
and carried the key with you every day.

124
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,180
I thought it was

125
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,820
a secret Qixiang Pavilion formula.

126
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,460
I didn't expect it

127
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,860
to be the Ruyi seal I put in the coffin.

128
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,060
I remember us making incense together

129
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,740
when we were children.

130
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,900
The way you smiled

131
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,900
was adorable.

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,860
Turns out
you had your eye on me all along.

133
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,500
It was you who bumped into my arms

134
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,300
and enticed me with incense powder.

135
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,100
Did you not fall for it?

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,060
I was playing along.

137
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,820
I've long admired you.

138
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,100
Would you do me
the honor of becoming my wife?

139
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,220
Would you bear children

140
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
and grow old with me?

141
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,660
Would you be willing

142
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,020
to drink this couple's toast with me?

143
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,460
Master,

144
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,100
Ms. Chen,

145
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,060
Madam would like to speak with Master.

146
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,300
Wait for me.

147
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,060
The meal is ready.

148
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,580
Madam is detained

149
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,500
but will be here shortly.

150
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,860
Please have a rest

151
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,820

00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,060
it's been months since we married.

155
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,420
You haven't dined

156
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,420
alone with me.

157
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,540
Let's get a divorce.

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,580
If you have someone you like,

159
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,300
I can help you arrange a match.

160
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,580
I only wish to be your wife.

161
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,700
What did you put in the tea?

162
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,500
You really...

163
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,700
have no feelings for me at all.

164
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,860
