he dropped the pendant he was carrying.

66

why not divorce

69
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,780
did I do something wrong?

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,580
It's the Ye family
that is not worthy of the Bai family.

Ms. Bai.

from Huichun Hall

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,860
examine her yesterday.

78
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,460
The physician said

79
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,060
Ms. Bai is two months pregnant...

80
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:51,980
Jinling.

81
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,180
Grandmother,

82
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,220
it's just been a couple of months.

84
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,420

00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,020
the good news

86
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,420
when it's stable.

87
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,020
Buhan didn't want to touch me
even when drunk.

88
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,620
Am I really not as good as that wretch?

89
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,620
From now on,

90
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,740
you're carrying Ye Buhan's child.

91
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,620
Since Ms. Bai is two months pregnant,

92
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,220
let's wait for her
to give birth to the child

93
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,780
and we'll raise them with great care.

94
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,580
Grandmother,

95
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,020
you promised me

96
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,420
we would face the Bai family together.

97
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,780
Are you going to give up

98
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,060
because Bai Anyuan is pregnant?

99
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,420
This is not giving up.

100
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,100
The Qixiang Pavilion needs
the Bai family's money.

101
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,220
Besides,

102
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,060
the child of our family is innocent.

103
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,500
But I've never had any feelings for her.

104
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,020
Her child

105
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,380
may not even be a Ye.

106
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,980
Neither are you.

107
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,140
Grandmother,

108
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
what did you say?

109
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,420
Your parents

110
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,260
were like you and Bai Anyuan.

111
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,620
You are not Cheng's son.

112
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,180
So you've been deceiving me.

113
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,620
You told me I was the only child
of the Ye family.

114
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,980
No wonder you turned so emotional

116
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,860

Fine.

118
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,420
