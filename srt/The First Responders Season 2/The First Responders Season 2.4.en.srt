[Kang Doha] The fact that the sensor

The defendant, Yang Sangman,

violated Article 164 Paragraph 1
of the Criminal Act,

The defendant was once
a firefighter himself,

but he didn't hesitate to commit arson

602

of killing human lives.

604
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,427
Even after his arrest,
he has remained silent

and has refused to show
any signs of remorse.

810
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:49,082
Goodness, Detective.

811
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:50,792
You're amazing.

812
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:53,086
[parent] Look here, people.

813
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:57,549
These days, animal abuse is a crime too.

814
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,634
The police will launch
a serious investigation!

815
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:01,928
[neighbors] They should.

816
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,014
Auntie, do you suspect anyone?

817
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,348
Did anyone pick a fight lately?

818
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,185
-Well…
-Yes?

819
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:15,400
Never mind. Just bring back my containers.

820
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,860
Didn't you finish that food yet?

821
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,778
I'm so busy
that I don't even have time to eat.

822
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,615
Goodness, the kimchi won't taste good
if you leave it for too long.

823
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,325
[parent] What a waste.

824
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:29,039
Hey, is that lady your real aunt?

825
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,665
No, she's not.

826
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:33,877
She's worse than my real aunt.
She's a neighbor who gives me food.

827
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,630
My place is right over there. Unit 404.

828

-[Pil] Here, Mr. Baek.
-Oh, my gosh!

829
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:41,760
[Pil] My goodness.

830
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,345
Ma'am, don't worry.

831
00:53:43,428 --> 00:53:45,430
-I'll take care of this.
-[parent] Okay.

832
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:47,057
[Pil] Excuse me. Coming through.

[Pil] Thank you so much, Ms. Yun.

836
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,611
You know we don't normally
do animal autopsies, right?

837
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,363
-Right.
-This is a special case.

838
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,823
But I need you to help me out.

839
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:11,665
I'm coming in.

840
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:18,296
[Pil] Current time, 23:47.

841
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,341
An unidentified stray cat.
Beginning the autopsy.

842
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,386
[Hong] You don't have to do that stuff.

843
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,263
[Pil] It's cool.
I've always wanted to try it.

844
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,389
This is such a cool job.

845
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:30,725
-[Hong] Then shall we begin?
-[Pil] Yes, ma'am.

846
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,318
-[Hong] Cut as deep as you can.
-[Pil] Yes, ma'am.

847
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,127
Sorry.

848
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,337
[Hong] Let's check the appearance.

849
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:07,470
There is white foam
around its nose and mouth.

850
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,222
There's a chance of poisoning.

851
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,182
-Hand me the clipper.
-[Pil] Yes, ma'am.

852
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,102
[♪ tense music playing]

853
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,779
[Pil] Is this a burn wound?

854
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:27,240
[Hong] See how the edges are triangular?

855
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:30,827
A tool that leaves
a triangular burn wound. It's obvious.

856
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,246
It's an iron.

857
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:39,878
[♪ tense music playing]

858
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,818
[Hong] There's a bit of kibble
and a lot of liquids.

859
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,446
-I'll have the contents tested.
-[Pil] Yes, ma'am.

860
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:14,245
[sighs]

861
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,499
[Hong] Both lungs are abnormally enlarged.

862
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:19,751
It's a typical case of drowned lungs.

863
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,296
A large amount of water
was inhaled through her airway.

864
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,715
[Pil] She wasn't wet
at the time of discovery.

865
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,801
[Hong] She could've been
forced under flowing water.

866
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:32,347
And her skin is burned
from an iron in several places.

867
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:36,518
This cat was abused by someone

868
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,937
to the extent of torture.

869
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,232
A devil in human form

870
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,609
is hiding in this cat's surroundings.

871
00:56:53,034 --> 00:56:56,663
Thankfully, we found
human skin cells under the cat's nails.

872
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,290
There's a chance
we'll get the attacker's DNA.

873
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:03,253
Thank you. I'll get DNA samples
from suspicious people.

874
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:04,796
[Hong] Be careful.

875
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,216
-Pardon?
-There are many murderers

876
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,552
who have a history with animal abuse.

877
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,680
I know. That's why we need
to catch them quickly.

878
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,682
Thank you.
