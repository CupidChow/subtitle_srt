Overseas,

167
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,299
there were quite a few cases of couples
committing these crimes together.

168
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:24,637
So this is starting
to get really complicated.

169
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,807
We need to go back
to the beginning of the case

170

and start with profiling the victims.

171
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,858
From serial arson to simultaneous fires,

172
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,985

What do you mean?

176
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,745

177
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,665

There was oxygen left in the tank.

183
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,489
His mask was off when he was found.

184
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,657
Exactly.

00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:32,413
Why did he take off the respirator
that still had oxygen inside?

Was someone other than Dojin…

[♪ ominous music playing]

511
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,669
According to the statement
made by Majung Station's chief,

512
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,546
there was a second explosion
while they were putting out the fire.

513
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,258
The estimated time of explosion
was about an hour after the fire started.

514
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,680
All arsonists leave the scene
after starting the fire.

515
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:45,182
That's human instinct.

516
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:49,353
In that case,
how was the second explosion set off?

517
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,647
If it was an hour
into putting out the fire,

518
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,067
we would be inside extinguishing embers
after having suppressed the big flames.

519
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:59,238
Also, the first ignition point was
at the easternmost part of the building,

520
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,991
but the second explosion
occurred in the west,

521
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,201
on the opposite side.

522
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,663
That means these two ignition points
were intentionally set up.

{\an8}The missing link

[♪ tense music playing]

528
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,010
A distinctive combustive property
of candles

529
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:25,305
is you can control the combustion time
according to the material and size.

530
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,350
That's why the term "sleeper fire" is used

531
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,437
since a fire or explosion is induced
at a certain period of time

532
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,397
after lighting the fire.

between the two explosions?

00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,476
{\an8}The accelerant must have been a mixture
of kerosene and gasoline then.

00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,770
[Hong] If we experiment
with this accelerant,

it could cause a big fire.

609
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,505
{\an8}it won't last an hour.

Or if the container
with the accelerant melts first,

[Seol] it won't last, either.

612
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:17,222
The candle must have a melting point
that can withstand the radiant heat,

613
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:21,893
and the container with the accelerant
must also be able to withstand fire.

But the investigation of the warehouse
yielded no signs of accelerant containers.

That's why it's difficult.

The container has to hold out

This was how he was able to start
simultaneous fires without an accomplice.

So depending on how long

it's possible to set a fire

{\an8}<i>and activates the fuse wire,</i>

843
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,227
