486
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,920
Ms. Yun, I thought you'd want to know
about the scene of the crime,

487
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,631
so I brought the firefighter
who put out the fire.

488
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:44,217
-This is Bong Dojin.
-[Hong] Hello, thank you for coming.

489
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,553
Shall we begin?

490
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,848
The current time is 8:13 a.m.
We shall begin the autopsy.

00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,184
[camera shutter clicks]

492
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,482
{\an8}[Hong] There are black soot deposits
all over the body.

The adherence of soot from a fire

[♪ tense music playing]

497
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,415
[Hong] There's a large amount
of soot deposit

498
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,417
in the oral and nasal cavities as well.

499
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,335
Was the trunk of the car
closed during the fire?

500
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,672
-Yes, it was.
-[Hong] I see.

501
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,549
[camera shutter clicks]

502
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,141
[Hong] There are a number
of unidentifiable skin lesions.

503
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,477
Was he bound in cable ties?

504
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,354
Yes, that's right. How did you know?

505
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,148
[Hong] He was so tightly bound

506
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,317
that the shape of the cable ties
was left on the skin.

507
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,611
[cable screeching]

508
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,700
[Hong] Were several cable ties used?

509
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:53,828
No, no. There were one each
for the ankles and wrists.

510
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,248
[Hong] There are several binding marks,
not just one.

511
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,333
What happened, then?

512
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,835
[Hong] I'll tell you
once I observe the body some more.

513
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,837
Scalpel, please.

514
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:05,548
Starting the incision.

[camera shutter clicks]

520
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,652
[Hong] All his muscles
and organs are bright red.

521
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,071
Why are they all bright red?

522
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,530
When the hemoglobin in the blood

523
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:31,866
combines with carbon monoxide
instead of oxygen

524
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,701
and becomes carbon monoxide hemoglobin,

525
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,203
the blood becomes bright red.

526
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,914
Since the same blood flows
through the muscles and organs,

527
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,624
they become bright red as well.

528
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,085
It's a typical finding
in deaths due to fire.

529
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,878
[Hong] Let's check
the bronchial tubes first.

530
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,381
[♪ tense music playing]

531
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,050
[Hong] Cutting the bronchial tubes.

532
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,559
Do you see this black residue
inside the bronchial tubes?

533
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,436
They're black soot deposits.

534
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:04,482
Do you remember the residue we saw
inside the oral and nasal cavities?

535
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,528
Residue adhered to the oral cavity,
nasal cavity, and bronchial tubes.

536
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,947
Muscles and organs that turned bright red

537
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,699
and several binding marks.

538
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:15,284
They're all pointing to one fact.

539
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,828
And that is?

540
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:20,957
[Hong] That the victim was alive
and breathing at the time of the fire.

541
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,042
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

542
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:32,343
[grunting]

543
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,472
[Hong] If we look at how deep
the tears are on the skin,

544
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,475
you can say he made
very desperate attempts to escape.

545
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,645
How long do you think he was alive?

546
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,440
[Hong] It's hard to determine that
by autopsy.

547
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,402
But we can assume
that the larger the amount of residue,

548
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,820
the longer he was breathing.

549
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,449
The victim, Cho Iljun's cause of death

550
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,077
was oxygen-deficient asphyxiation
caused by inhalation of toxic gas.

551
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,996
-And--
-The manner of death was a homicide.

552
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,414
I was too late.

[camera shutter clicks]

554
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,625
I should have checked
for any signs of life.

555
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:05,710
You couldn't have known

556
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,920
that someone would be
in the parking tower that late.

557
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:10,548
It's not your fault,
so don't blame yourself.

558
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,383
Firefighters are different
from the police.

559
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,850
Ms. Yun, I'd like to request
an emergency evaluation.

Please run a tox screen,

561
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,855
focusing on any sleeping pills
in the victim's system.

562
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,356

Don't blame yourself.

569

I mean, he was tied up and locked inside.
There's not much you can do to stop that.

570
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,850
A firefighter is the first person to go in
and the last to leave.

571
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,480
Just by the fact
that I came out before him

572
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,689
means I neglected my duty.

We have to make it out ourselves.

If the people who will put out the fire
are the targets,

584

then who…

585
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,311
will put out that fire?

586
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,985
I know I'm not one to talk,
but you should take care of yourself.

587
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,239
Hey, then what about the police?

588
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,242
Does anyone help you
when you arrest a dangerous criminal?

589
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,078
You should take your own advice.

590

How can I do that
when there's a criminal loose?

Exactly. We're the same way about fires.

Why would he kill Cho Iljun
after meticulously making him a criminal?

He's just messing with firefighters

Did Cho Iljun have

There's no coincidence in a crime.

It doesn't make sense
that Cho Iljun became a target,

because he was rude to the firefighters.

What? Who is it?

The culprit has had
as much experience putting out fires

That means there was
another cause of ignition.

There was something like
a depressuring sound

Does that happen often?

-A depressuring sound?
-Yes.

Is it a hydraulic cylinder problem, then?

00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,929
So, is this facility
operated hydraulically?

661
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,183
{\an8}Yes, there's a hydraulic cylinder
under each parking compartment.

transferred to be
the head of the Institute of Justice.

Seeing as how your son
was also transferred to the boondocks,

They said the results are out. Ms. Yun!

You were right, Detective Jin.

[Hong] You made the right call.

But Ms. Yun, this amount
of drugs means that…

970
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:05,802
Even if he was rescued
right after the fire broke out,

971
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,179
it's likely he wouldn't have survived.

-Yes.

-[Dojin] Pass it out.
-[Kisoo] Okay.

986
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,176
[Dojin] If you look at the destroyed pipe,

987
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,802
you will see that it was destroyed

988
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,638
in the same way, in the same direction,
and with the same length.

989
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,766
If you look at the photo,

990
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,019
it was scratched up
in an upward direction in a semi-circle.

991
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,812
We assumed this

992
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,232
as the culprit setting up the explosion
to go off in a certain direction

993
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,193
and focused on finding
the tool that was used.

994
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:10,241
We collected all the pipe cutters
available in the market and tested them.

995
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,328
And we found the pipe cutter that made
those unique marks seen in the photo.

996
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:14,913
Which was…

997
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,584
the German Kupax one-inch pipe cutter.

998

to cause the explosion</i>

1001

Gosh, that's loud.

1002
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,136
You're going to break the table.

1003
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,014
Since it uniquely has needle bearings,

1004
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,517
it's a model with the ability
to adjust the direction of the cut.

1005
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:37,602
[Anna] It's not a commonly used tool,

1006
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:40,480
so once we look into the importers,
we'll be able to trace who bought it.

1007
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,232
We're currently looking into it right now.

1008
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,276
You've found something
pretty useful, Bulldozer.

-[Pil clears throat]
-[Hogae groans]

1013
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,664
We had previously requested the NFS

1014
00:56:57,747 --> 00:57:01,376
a very special and targeted tox screen

1015
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:04,129
after they performed
the autopsy of the victim.

1016
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:05,755
[Pil] And as a result,

1017
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,924
a large amount of sleeping pills

1018
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:11,261
and anesthetics were detected
in his blood vessels.

1019
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:12,846
Since the contents of the stomach

1020
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,807
consisted of coffee
and pills that hadn't been broken down,

1021
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,185
we can assume that the victim
drank coffee that contained the pills.

1022
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,771
<i>Then the sleeping victim</i>

1023
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:24,524
<i>was injected with anesthetics.</i>

1024
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,861
<i>Then the unconscious victim
was put into the car</i>

1025
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,821
and taken to Galmae Parking Tower.

1026
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:33,450
The sleeping pills and anesthetics
were detected above the lethal dose.

1027
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:37,412
The victim was murdered
with clear intentions.

1028
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,746
It wasn't your fault, Bulldozer.

1029
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,042
That's nice to know,
but you can't find the culprit with that.

1030
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,004
We should be focusing on
finding the culprit, not the method.

1031
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,547
-[Hogae] Myeongpil.
-[Pil] Yes.

1032
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,757
The sleeping pills and anesthetics
in the victim's body

1033
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:51,718
are classified as psychotropic drugs.

1034
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,304
So their use is strictly monitored.

1035
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,390
Which means we can trace it back
to the culprit, too.

1036

to identify the culprit?

There's another clue.
