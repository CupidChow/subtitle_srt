1
00:00:31,034 --> 00:00:35,955
The characters, places, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious

2
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,416
- Hey.
- Hey. Over here.

3
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:46,007
I'm Song Seol, a paramedic
with Taewon Fire Station.

4
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:48,676
You were a bit aggressive
with the hemostasis.

5
00:00:53,264 --> 00:00:55,016
Gauze alone wouldn't stop the bleeding,

6
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:58,227
so I performed the treatment
to minimize blood loss during CPR.

7
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,733
Did I do something wrong?

8
00:01:06,027 --> 00:01:07,467
Life before Limb?

9
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:08,881
Life before Limb: A principle
in emergency situations…

10
00:01:08,905 --> 00:01:09,947
Nice.

11
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,511
…where less important parts
are sacrificed to save vital organs

12
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:17,663
I'll get going now, then.

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,708
- Bye.
- Bye.

14
00:01:21,459 --> 00:01:22,502
Don't go.

15
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:33,513
I'd like to hear the opinions
of the first responder on the scene.

16
00:01:33,596 --> 00:01:36,849
Judging from how you treated him,
I assume you worked at a hospital before.

17
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:37,934
Am I right?

18
00:01:38,518 --> 00:01:41,145
Yes, I used to be a PA at a hospital.

19
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:44,190
Please help us if you aren't busy.

20
00:01:57,787 --> 00:01:59,389
Code issued
when someone exhibits

21
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:01,053
threatening behavior in an operating room

22
00:02:01,415 --> 00:02:05,461
I'll remove the epidural catheter
from the spinal cord now.

23
00:02:05,962 --> 00:02:07,255
Lift it up, please.

24
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:13,761
<i>Was this injected into the victim's body?</i>

25
00:02:14,554 --> 00:02:18,141
Yes, I told him to press
the button over the phone.

26
00:02:18,224 --> 00:02:19,225
<i>Over the phone?</i>

27
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:22,103
What if there was poison in it?

28
00:02:22,395 --> 00:02:23,915
I checked the name of the drug,

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,774
and they would simply inject poison
with a syringe,

30
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:29,861
not with a PCA in the spine.

31
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:33,447
That's just your assumption,
isn't it?

32
00:02:34,782 --> 00:02:36,909
Oh, well…

33
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:39,030
That's enough, Seol.

34
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:42,349
Are you examining the decision
of the first responder too or what?

35
00:02:42,373 --> 00:02:43,374
Let's not go too far.

36
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,002
I apologize if I was out of line.

37
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:48,564
I was just curious about the reason
behind your decision.

38
00:02:48,588 --> 00:02:50,882
That's what I would've done
if I were them.

39
00:02:53,134 --> 00:02:55,261
There may be fingerprints
on the device,

40
00:02:55,344 --> 00:02:57,346
so please hand it over
to the trace evidence room.

41
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:59,515
Also, analyze the drug inside the tube.

42
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:01,893
It's probably a painkiller.

43
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,755
Yes, sir.

44
00:03:07,023 --> 00:03:09,275
No trauma to the wrists, ankles,

45
00:03:09,358 --> 00:03:11,152
or other parts of the body.

46
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:12,820
Let's make an incision.

47
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:14,947
Forceps, please.

48
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:49,482
Around an inch of subcutaneous fat.

49
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:53,527
He's not obese,
and his nutritional status is not bad.

50
00:03:57,782 --> 00:03:59,200
There's so much blood.

51
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:01,972
I'm going to remove all the organs
and check them individually.

52
00:04:02,495 --> 00:04:03,621
Let's start with the heart.

53
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:13,714
The heart is around 12 ounces.

54
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:19,845
The left lung is here,
but there's no right lung.

55
00:04:21,514 --> 00:04:22,765
He's missing a lung.

56
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:24,684
He's missing a lung?

57
00:04:25,142 --> 00:04:26,769
And he's missing…

58
00:04:28,437 --> 00:04:30,398
the right lobe of his liver.

59
00:04:32,566 --> 00:04:33,818
And he's missing…

60
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,820
his right kidney.

61
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,407
You keep saying he's missing something.
What do you mean?

62
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,658
Exactly as I've said.

63
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,869
This corpse is missing some of its organs,
the heart being the exception.

64
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:45,162
Everything but the heart?

65
00:04:45,413 --> 00:04:47,873
He'd die right away
if they messed with his heart.

66
00:04:48,457 --> 00:04:50,668
As Officer Song mentioned earlier,

67
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:52,545
that must have been…

68
00:04:54,297 --> 00:04:56,132
different from
the perpetrator's master plan.

69
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:58,175
Master plan?

70
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:02,513
In other words,
the perpetrator's objective.

71
00:05:02,888 --> 00:05:04,265
It seems to me

72
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,809
that this is a corpse of a victim
who was murdered

73
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:08,686
with a meticulous goal and plan.

74
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,647
How do you know that
just by looking at the corpse?

75
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:13,190
If you look here,

76
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,085
there are no signs of binding, right?

77
00:05:15,109 --> 00:05:17,111
But this isn't post-mortem damage.

78
00:05:17,528 --> 00:05:20,406
He wasn't tied up
but suffered this much damage?

79
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:21,907
As you know,

80
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:23,868
it means he was anesthetized.

81
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:25,703
Done properly

82
00:05:26,162 --> 00:05:27,496
just like in an operating room.

83
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:31,516
You said he was submerged in ice
at the time of discovery, right?

84
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:33,085
Yes.

85
00:05:33,336 --> 00:05:34,337
All right.

86
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:36,964
When your body temperature drops,

87
00:05:37,048 --> 00:05:39,508
the functions of major organs,
such as the heart and brain,

88
00:05:39,592 --> 00:05:42,011
that are essential for life support,
are protected.

89
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:46,265
That's the principle of hypothermia,
which is used in clinical cardiac surgery.

90
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:49,518
In addition, they induced
a state of profound hypothermia

91
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,979
in which the body temperature
falls below 53.6°F.

92
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,065
The same goes for the PCA.

93
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:56,734
Why did they anesthetize him

94
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:59,236
if they were going to kill him so cruelly?

95
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:01,214
That's what's strange, right?

96
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:04,450
Something isn't adding up.

97
00:06:05,618 --> 00:06:07,328
The right hand…

98
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,538
is a surgeon.

99
00:06:10,456 --> 00:06:11,957
The left hand…

100
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,834
is a butcher.

101
00:06:14,794 --> 00:06:17,463
A surgical specialist who's a butcher.

102
00:06:18,631 --> 00:06:21,133
Everyone, would you mind
closing your eyes for a moment?

103
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:22,343
Pardon?

104
00:06:23,886 --> 00:06:24,929
What is he doing?

105
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,639
Imagine it yourself.

106
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:28,408
He's saying to think
from the criminal's perspective.

107
00:06:28,432 --> 00:06:30,309
I do this a lot as well. Let's do it.

108
00:06:31,936 --> 00:06:33,354
You too, Officer Song.

109
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:44,532
The first location is an operating room.

110
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:02,383
<i>There's no need for restraints.</i>

111
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:06,429
<i>One shot of anesthesia,
and the victim is at my mercy.</i>

112
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:13,936
<i>The incisions were made
with a surgical scalpel,</i>

113
00:07:14,895 --> 00:07:17,857
<i>but cauterization
to prevent bleeding was omitted.</i>

114
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:21,281
<i>Since there was no cauterization,
the blood would have splattered a bit.</i>

115
00:07:21,318 --> 00:07:22,778
Splatter: To scatter or disperse

116
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:32,538
<i>Cut the stomach open
and remove the organs.</i>

117
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:37,001
<i>Removing the right lobe
of the lungs.</i>

118
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,671
<i>While making sure
the victim is alive.</i>

119
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:43,716
Suturing layer by layer.

120
00:07:43,799 --> 00:07:46,343
A typical surgical stitch.

121
00:07:47,386 --> 00:07:51,182
Immersing him in ice water
was some sort of exhibition.

122
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:53,017
<i>He was put on display.</i>

123
00:07:53,434 --> 00:07:55,311
It aligns with the goal

124
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:58,522
of thoroughly destroying
both the victim's body and mind.

125
00:07:58,814 --> 00:07:59,815
You're wrong.

126
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,133
This wasn't done
only to bring pain to Yang Chiyoung.

127
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,077
He was put on display
for the first responders

128
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:07,072
from the fire and police stations.

129
00:08:07,948 --> 00:08:09,988
Are you saying
they wanted to induce trauma?

130
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:12,578
"I can…

131
00:08:14,163 --> 00:08:15,456
do this whenever

132
00:08:16,582 --> 00:08:18,167
and to whoever again."

133
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:19,877
A warning of the sort.

134
00:08:24,465 --> 00:08:25,925
I believe this perpetrator

135
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,512
has done this multiple times.

136
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:31,889
Are you saying this is serial?

137
00:08:31,972 --> 00:08:32,973
Not exactly.

138
00:08:33,057 --> 00:08:35,851
I'm saying
they're highly experienced in surgery.

139
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:39,188
It's possible they're a surgeon.

140
00:08:39,897 --> 00:08:42,337
If they're experienced in surgery,
a surgeon would make sense.

141
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:44,485
But if they're also familiar with murder,

142
00:08:45,486 --> 00:08:46,612
they're a serial killer.

143
00:08:48,405 --> 00:08:50,574
We just have to catch them.

144
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,201
Serial killers

145
00:08:52,284 --> 00:08:55,746
are bound to make mistakes
since they're full of themselves.

146
00:08:56,372 --> 00:08:57,915
I hope that's the case.

147
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:01,502
I don't want to meet the second victim

148
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,421
of the same perpetrator
in the autopsy room as well.

149
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:07,633
You probably don't know much
from simply looking at a corpse,

150
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:10,094
but even these perverts

151
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:12,137
cave in when handcuffed.

152
00:09:24,316 --> 00:09:26,694
NFS National Forensic Service

153
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:27,778
There he comes.

154
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,030
It took longer because there was something
strange that needed a closer look.

155
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,579
- Let's discuss this first.
- What is that?

156
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:38,622
This is the liver of a corpse

157
00:09:38,706 --> 00:09:40,666
that was stabbed to death
by a sharp blade.

158
00:09:40,916 --> 00:09:43,335
And this is Yang Chiyoung's liver.

159
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:45,629
They're different, right?

160
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:51,051
Are you saying the culprit has mysophobia
because he's a doctor?

161
00:09:52,261 --> 00:09:55,639
There's only one reason
to remove organs so neatly like this.

162
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:56,932
An organ transplant.

163
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,058
An organ transplant?

164
00:09:58,142 --> 00:10:01,162
A right lobe resection of the liver
was used in preparation for a transplant.

165
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,689
The lung, bronchial tubes,
and blood vessels

166
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,107
were finely removed as well.

167
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,527
The bronchial tubes and blood vessels
need to connect to the recipient.

168
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:10,571
You said the right kidney
was missing too, right?

169
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:11,697
Yes.

170
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,242
Of the two kidneys, the right lobe
is usually removed for transplants,

171
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:17,411
which is the case for the victim.

172
00:10:19,038 --> 00:10:21,081
Liver, lung, and kidney.

173
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,710
Only organs that can be transplanted
were removed.

174
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:26,086
This person…

175
00:10:26,795 --> 00:10:28,213
had his organs stolen from him.

176
00:10:28,297 --> 00:10:29,673
You're still not done?

177
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,386
You sure do take your time
conducting an autopsy.

178
00:10:32,426 --> 00:10:34,186
Should I be sorry
for taking my time…

179
00:10:36,305 --> 00:10:37,473
conducting an autopsy?

180
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,310
Hey, come by my room later.

181
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,190
- Let's go now.
- Okay.

182
00:10:46,273 --> 00:10:47,858
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

183
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:57,660
This bomb
isn't a crude IED that you can copy

184
00:10:57,743 --> 00:10:59,286
and make by watching a video.

185
00:10:59,828 --> 00:11:00,829
They're a professional.

186
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,414
It's pretty sophisticated.

187
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,168
Here it is.

188
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,783
I tracked the product number
on the pager's circuit board.

189
00:11:08,962 --> 00:11:10,798
It's manufactured in China
and sold in the US.

190
00:11:10,964 --> 00:11:13,484
It's a model that has never been
imported to our country before.

191
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,720
Should I get some information
out of the Beomdongyeong faction?

192
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:19,223
They're also just customers,

193
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:21,475
so they won't know much
about the manufacturer.

194
00:11:21,558 --> 00:11:25,187
They must have received the item,
so please check the delivery records.

195
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:26,271
Okay, I will.

196
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:28,357
Do pagers even work these days?

197
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,651
Services for the general public are gone

198
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:33,946
and only a few lines are being used
for military and medical purposes.

199
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,864
Can you do a traceback with just that?

200
00:11:35,948 --> 00:11:38,176
It's used for military purposes
because it's hard to trace.

201
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,202
I see they won't be easy to catch.

202
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:43,997
For now, I've requested cooperation
from the Air Force EOD.

203
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:45,082
They should remain alert.

204
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:48,293
I have a grudge against the person
who made the bomb.

205
00:11:48,502 --> 00:11:49,503
Call me if you need help.

206
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,672
I'll call you if I need handcuffs.

207
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,633
I use this in most situations.

208
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:57,720
You use your brain, and I use my body.
Okay, I got it.

209
00:11:57,803 --> 00:11:59,430
Anyway, page me if you need help.

210
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,889
- Go.
- Okay.

211
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:05,769
Oh, right. What happened to Yang Chiyoung?

212
00:12:05,853 --> 00:12:07,020
We'll have to look into it.

213
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,439
We have a pro on our side.

214
00:12:08,522 --> 00:12:10,899
- You're still tailing Ma Taehwa, right?
- Yes.

215
00:12:11,316 --> 00:12:14,278
I heard he almost died again
not too long ago.

216
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:16,530
Jeez, he sure is holding on.

217
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:19,032
Check up on him again, just in case.

218
00:12:20,075 --> 00:12:21,285
All right.

219
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:24,663
Ma Taehwa

220
00:12:31,545 --> 00:12:34,089
- Have you eaten yet?
- Yes, at the braised short ribs place.

221
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:35,933
- The food there is delicious.
- It is.

222
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,093
When is the next shift?

223
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:39,845
The next shift…

224
00:12:40,846 --> 00:12:43,056
The perpetrator is the type
to find pleasure

225
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,367
in inflicting maximum pain on the victim

226
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,977
and enjoys head-to-head fights
with investigators.

227
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:50,189
Or they're a group
of organ transplant brokers.

228
00:12:50,773 --> 00:12:52,024
If that's not it either,

229
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,652
then they're an acquaintance
with a grudge. They're one of these three.

230
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:58,572
- Give us a rundown of the victim.
- Okay, I'll do it.

231
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,116
The victim is Yang Chiyoung.

232
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,202
We all know him well,
so let's skip introductions.

233
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,662
We investigated his whereabouts
before his death,

234
00:13:05,746 --> 00:13:07,348
but there are three days
that are a bit uncertain.

235
00:13:07,372 --> 00:13:09,374
If they're an acquaintance,
they'll be found there.

236
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:13,253
His personal cell phone
has a limited recent call history.

237
00:13:14,254 --> 00:13:16,131
As if an attorney wouldn't have
a call history.

238
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:17,375
That's what I'm saying.

239
00:13:17,424 --> 00:13:20,511
He wouldn't engage in anything shady
with his personal phone.

240
00:13:20,594 --> 00:13:22,346
I think he used a burner phone,

241
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:25,149
but they're called burner phones
because they're impossible to trace.

242
00:13:26,016 --> 00:13:27,309
The site inspection is complete.

243
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:28,727
Did you find anything?

244
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:31,271
There wasn't a single fingerprint
or strand of hair.

245
00:13:31,355 --> 00:13:33,075
I think they wiped
everything down

246
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:35,943
and vacuumed up all the dust.

247
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,904
You can consider this
a case of serious mysophobia.

248
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,533
Can you find anything on black-market
organ trafficking organizations?

249
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:43,936
Black-market deals are done

250
00:13:43,992 --> 00:13:45,869
without anyone's knowledge,
hence the name.

251
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,204
They're not easy to track down.

252
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:49,039
If it's hard to track down, we backtrack.

253
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:53,001
Organs that were trafficked
have to be used in surgery immediately.

254
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:55,170
- That's right.
- That's right.

255
00:13:55,254 --> 00:13:59,091
Let's look into transplant surgery records
from every hospital in the country

256
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:00,926
on the day of Yang Chiyoung's death.

257
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:02,769
Focus on liver, lung,
and kidney transplants.

258
00:14:05,222 --> 00:14:07,432
All right, I'll look into it.

259
00:14:07,516 --> 00:14:09,017
- What about grudges?
- Oh, right.

260
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:13,355
Attorney Yang always defended
and stood on the side of money and power,

261
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:16,483
so he was known in the industry
as "Bully," not Yang Chiyoung.

262
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:20,112
There are more than a few people
who were wronged by Bully.

263
00:14:21,697 --> 00:14:24,575
But based on the autopsy results,

264
00:14:24,658 --> 00:14:27,202
it's highly likely
that the culprit is a doctor, right?

265
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,955
So while looking into cases
involving doctors,

266
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:31,582
this popped up.

267
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:33,792
What?

268
00:14:34,543 --> 00:14:35,544
Seok Mijung's case?

269
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:36,729
A woman in her 30s
found dead in an officetel

270
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:38,064
Officetel murder suspect
Ma Taehwa arrested

271
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:39,649
Director of Masong, not guilty
of the murder of a university student!

272
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:42,673
Mr. Ma Taehwa, you're under arrest
under suspicion of murdering Seok Mijung.

273
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:43,802
You bastard!

274
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:47,055
Why can't you turn a blind eye just once?

275
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:49,641
Would you have done that, you bastard?

276
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:03,113
We finally broke his alibi
of Seok Mijung's case.

277
00:15:11,997 --> 00:15:14,333
Seok Mijung's father, Seok Moongu,

278
00:15:16,001 --> 00:15:17,210
was an anesthesiologist.

279
00:15:18,545 --> 00:15:21,506
He would have a grudge against Ma Taehwa,
so why Yang Chiyoung?

280
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:24,885
While the victim's parents were also
in court, Attorney Yang did something

281
00:15:25,093 --> 00:15:27,262
that was the equivalent
of killing the victim twice.

282
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:29,056
Do you know

283
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:32,684
what kind of relationship
the victim and my client had?

284
00:15:34,561 --> 00:15:35,938
She met him as a hostess

285
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:38,190
at a very low-quality bar...

286
00:15:38,273 --> 00:15:39,691
What nonsense are you spewing?

287
00:15:40,943 --> 00:15:42,736
How dare you say that about my daughter!

288
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,657
Oh, my goodness.

289
00:15:49,159 --> 00:15:52,204
- Honey!
- Someone call an ambulance!

290
00:15:52,412 --> 00:15:53,872
Call an ambulance!

291
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:57,501
<i>After the trial,
Seok Mijung's mother</i>

292
00:15:57,584 --> 00:16:00,024
<i>couldn't stand the malicious comments
made about her daughter…</i>

293
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:01,272
That bastard.

294
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:04,174
<i>…and committed suicide in the mountains.</i>

295
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:05,926
<i>My goodness.</i>

296
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:09,012
His daughter died and was defamed,

297
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:10,555
and he also lost his wife?

298
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,475
He wouldn't have been satisfied
even if he removed all of the organs.

299
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,645
Which hospital
is Seok Moongu working at now?

300
00:16:17,396 --> 00:16:21,733
He quit his work
and is living in the mountain

301
00:16:23,402 --> 00:16:24,712
where his wife committed suicide.

302
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:27,936
Ma Taehwa kills people with his hands,
Yang Chiyoung kills people with his mouth!

303
00:16:28,949 --> 00:16:31,118
My goodness, are you just now opening up?

304
00:16:31,201 --> 00:16:33,203
Well, look who it is!

305
00:16:33,286 --> 00:16:35,497
Our Kang Doha.

306
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,207
It's been a while.

307
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,793
You've got more stuff
since the last time we saw each other.

308
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:43,213
That's because people keep throwing away
perfectly functioning things.

309
00:16:44,423 --> 00:16:47,300
Let me welcome our VIP customer inside.

310
00:16:47,384 --> 00:16:49,386
Please go in.

311
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,640
Uncle, I need to fix this.
Do you have any parts?

312
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,518
Jeez, would you look at that?

313
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,353
A one-of-a-kind antique.

314
00:16:58,437 --> 00:16:59,855
My goodness.

315
00:16:59,938 --> 00:17:02,274
Where did you get
such an antique?

316
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:03,525
If only I knew.

317
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:05,736
It's a product
that isn't sold in the country.

318
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,862
That's not right.

319
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,531
This is originally from Hong Kong

00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:11,742
with a different make
that sold like crazy.

321
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,747
This is why I like you.

322
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:18,248
So can you fix it?

323
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,418
This is why I like you.

324
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:23,420
Of course, I can fix it.

325
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,921
Wait one moment.

326
00:17:25,964 --> 00:17:28,592

<i>♪ Where did I put the pagers? ♪</i>

328
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:33,513
I found it!

329
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,891
Ta-da.

330
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:38,310
So you can fix this, right?

331
00:17:38,894 --> 00:17:41,646
Lately, I haven't been able
to see properly.

332
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,191
You fix it with your hands, not your eyes.

333
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:48,004
<i>I'm assuming you heard the news.</i>

334
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:50,113
<i>I knew you'd contact me.</i>

<i>If Yang Chiyoung
gets investigated, it'll cause me trouble.</i>

336
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,994
Where are the drug
trafficker's case files?

337
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:58,163
I'm sure you know where they are.

338
00:17:58,747 --> 00:18:00,373
<i>I can't give you that for free.</i>

339
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:03,168

Thank you.

354
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:51,151
<i>It's the crime of getting found out.</i>

355
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:54,613
<i>I'm sorry, Hogae.</i>

356

<i>Assemblyman Ma Joongdo's death</i>

358
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:31,708
Are you sure this is the place?

359
00:20:31,733 --> 00:20:33,276
Yes, it is.

360
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:37,614
Darn it, that stings.

361
00:20:39,574 --> 00:20:40,575
Hey.

362
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:42,911
I think this is the place.

363
00:20:42,994 --> 00:20:45,538
Come on. Hurry.

364
00:20:56,091 --> 00:20:57,842
There it is. Over there.

365
00:20:57,926 --> 00:20:59,219
Oh, my gosh! That startled me.

366
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:00,595
There's a mannequin.

367
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,056
Damn it. That scared… Be careful.

368
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:04,724
What is this?

369
00:21:04,808 --> 00:21:06,351
Court

370
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:12,107
I think we found the right place.

371
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,110
Hello?

372
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:17,112
- Is anyone here?
- There's a fire.

373
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:19,406
Hello?

374
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:23,702
What the heck?

375
00:21:28,248 --> 00:21:29,791
You seem to have lost your way.

376
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,711
Have some water before you go.

377
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,799
You know Attorney Yang Chiyoung, right?

378
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,634
Who are you?

379
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,319
I lost everything

380
00:21:58,028 --> 00:21:59,321
the moment he was released.

381
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:01,573
These darn bastards!

382
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:04,439
What's wrong?

383
00:22:05,785 --> 00:22:06,786
Look at this.

384
00:22:09,372 --> 00:22:11,225
Ma Taehwa released on bail
for drug trafficking charges

385
00:22:11,249 --> 00:22:12,334
This guy…

386
00:22:13,001 --> 00:22:14,044
was released?

387
00:22:14,794 --> 00:22:16,880
These bastards!

388
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:22,010
The fall of a gold digger

389
00:22:22,093 --> 00:22:23,853
Well deserved!
Retribution for a gold digger!

390
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,227
<i>I heard it was spread
by his attorneys.</i>

391
00:22:31,811 --> 00:22:33,438
They deserve to be beaten to death.

392
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:36,941
That's how they usually do things.

393
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:42,072
Have you heard any news
about Attorney Yang?

394
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:44,616
Look.

395
00:22:46,368 --> 00:22:47,744
I don't even use a cell phone.

396
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:49,827
I stopped keeping up with the news
a long time ago.

397
00:22:50,163 --> 00:22:51,206
Mr. Yang Chiyoung…

398
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:54,042
is dead.

399
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:07,389
- Are you okay?
- What amazing news.

400
00:23:10,767 --> 00:23:12,769
Hooray! Yes!

401
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:17,565
Mijung.

402
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:20,860
Honey.

403
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:24,239
Goodness.

404
00:23:25,031 --> 00:23:27,617
That bastard finally took his last breath.

405
00:23:32,664 --> 00:23:34,124
If you meet him over there,

406
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,419
crush him into little pieces!

407
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,129
Mr. Seok Moongu.

408
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,924
Where were you,
and what were you doing on January 19?

409
00:23:44,884 --> 00:23:48,388
Every day
is the same here for me.

410
00:23:48,471 --> 00:23:50,640
How can you prove that
without a cell phone?

411
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:03,727
What are you guys going to do?

412
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:05,864
I don't have a cell phone.

413
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,367
I'm talking about the alibi to prove…

414
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:12,662
that I was at the scene

415
00:24:13,246 --> 00:24:14,286
of Yang Chiyoung's murder.

416
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:19,836
That darn alibi you guys like.

417
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,214
I'm sorry, Mijung.

418
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:25,550
I'm sorry, honey.

419
00:24:30,722 --> 00:24:31,723
I'm sorry.

420
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,353
Gosh, I'll do better.

421
00:24:41,024 --> 00:24:42,192
I'll do better.

422
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:44,694
My goodness.

423
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:48,573
This feels like a dead end.

424
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:51,743
This place doesn't have
a hiking trail or CCTV cameras.

425
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:54,913
It's impossible to trace
Mr. Seok Moongu's whereabouts.

426
00:24:54,996 --> 00:24:57,415
People used to conduct investigations
and catch criminals

427
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,219
when there weren't
any CCTVs or cell phones.

428
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,251
We'll find a way.

429
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:03,421
He seemed a bit insane.

430
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,346
Okay, it turned on.

431
00:25:11,804 --> 00:25:12,889
All right.

432
00:25:14,224 --> 00:25:16,684
Let's see what they did with a pager.

433
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:25,360
127, 142, 009, 002.

434
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,445
What's that?

435
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:30,073
Four consecutive three-digit
decimal numbers.

436
00:25:31,908 --> 00:25:33,576
Consecutive three-digit numbers.

437
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:36,037
An IP address.

438
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:42,460
Hello?

439
00:25:42,544 --> 00:25:45,338
I'm at the Chinese restaurant
the Beomdongyeong faction often visited.

440
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,884
Recently, they often ate
whole-grilled Beijing duck.

441
00:25:49,968 --> 00:25:52,178
<i>It's slang
for receiving a delivery.</i>

442
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,975
First, we'll look through
all the CCTV footage nearby.

443
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,811
The culprit wouldn't have flown here.

444
00:25:59,894 --> 00:26:01,437
I've got a lead as well.

445
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:03,856
Let's do a two-way approach.

446
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,983
<i>All right.</i>

447
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:13,783
- Hey.
- You're here.

448
00:26:14,617 --> 00:26:15,660
Were you waiting for me?

449
00:26:17,412 --> 00:26:18,413
Petition

450
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:19,872
Oh, right. This.

451
00:26:20,498 --> 00:26:23,543
I have to sign this
before Chief Dokgo's summons, right?

452
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:24,877
Yes.

453
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:27,964
Yes, of course, I have to sign it before.

454
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:49,485
Petitioner: Jin Hogae

455
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:51,613
- Okay.
- Thank you.

456
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:53,072
We're all family.

457
00:26:54,032 --> 00:26:55,074
Have you eaten?

458
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:58,786
Not yet.

459
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,247
Okay, let's go.

460
00:27:33,446 --> 00:27:35,990
I've seen a lot of people die

461
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,785
in the hospital and as a paramedic,

462
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,454
but today was my first autopsy.

463
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,081
I see.

464
00:27:45,416 --> 00:27:47,085
You must've been shocked.

465
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:50,338
I feel like I've taken

466
00:27:50,421 --> 00:27:52,840
a closer look at the world you live in.

467
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:57,095
Our work isn't always so unsightly.

468
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:01,349
A person

469
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:04,185
should never do something like that
to another person.

470
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,481
How cruel of a person are they
to do something like that?

471
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:11,567
It was so terrible and terrifying.

472
00:28:34,674 --> 00:28:35,800
You said…

473
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:39,345
they could do this to someone else, too.

474
00:28:42,181 --> 00:28:43,182
Mm.

475
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:45,046
That's why I need to catch them.

476
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:48,896
What's wrong?

477
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,692
Do you have to be the one to catch them?

478
00:28:57,697 --> 00:28:59,407
You're making things awkward.

479
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:01,200
Are you worried about me?

480
00:29:02,869 --> 00:29:06,456
If you don't want me to worry,
don't get hurt.

481
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,299
I can never turn a blind eye to crime

482
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:19,177
for my own livelihood.

483
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,386
I've never done that before.

484
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:24,140
I can't promise
that I won't get hurt, either.

485
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:26,476
But…

486
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,189
no matter how badly I get hurt,

487
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:33,983
come to me.

488
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:37,528
I mean…

489
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:41,657
Come save me as a paramedic.

490
00:29:46,704 --> 00:29:49,373
I'm tired, so I'll head home first.

491
00:29:50,583 --> 00:29:51,751
Take care of the bill for me.

492
00:29:53,336 --> 00:29:54,712
She's going to pay.

493
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,881
Thank you for the food.

494
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:01,886
<i>Just stay alive.</i>

495
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:04,013
<i>I'll run to you wherever you are.</i>

496
00:30:07,308 --> 00:30:10,120
You shouldn't have any problems
regarding the serial arsonist case.

497
00:30:10,144 --> 00:30:11,904
The prosecutor in charge
should be here soon.

498
00:30:14,357 --> 00:30:16,317
Oh, hello. You can have a seat here.

499
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,904
Here's a petition written and signed by

500
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,990
all of Taewon Fire Station
and Taewon Police Station.

501
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:24,617
They attest that there was no problem

502
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,911
with the field command
and response that day.

503
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,874
- Please wait outside, Detective Moon.
- Pardon?

504
00:30:31,499 --> 00:30:32,708
I said please wait outside.

505
00:30:36,212 --> 00:30:37,213
All right.

506
00:30:43,052 --> 00:30:45,781
I'm Prosecutor Yang Mooyoung from
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

507
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,165
A peculiar document was discovered

508
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:50,268
during the search and seizure.

509
00:30:50,476 --> 00:30:52,645
Woosung-dong shantytown
fire investigation report

510
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,690
Why was this…

511
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,442
in your desk, Chief Dokgo Soon?

512
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,570
I was going to review

513
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:04,407
whether there were any faults
in the fire investigation at the time.

514
00:31:06,367 --> 00:31:07,535
What faults were there?

515
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,426
There was an opinion from the fire station

516
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:15,376
that there was a possibility of arson,
but it was disregarded.

517
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:18,129
That case has already been closed.
You know that.

518
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:21,382
Are you going to hold on to the past

519
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,844
and ruin your entire future?

520
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,437
<i>I'll see this end
with just a reprimand</i>

521
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:37,440
for the failure to respond
to the serial arson,

522
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,403
so please corroborate
the prosecution's account.

523
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:44,780
Ma'am, there's still
a plausibility of arson.

524
00:31:44,864 --> 00:31:47,408
We shouldn't rule it out yet.
If you give me some time...

525
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:50,870
Dojin, even the police are frustrated
because they can't find the body.

526
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,498
They said they'd close it
as a missing case.

527
00:31:54,582 --> 00:31:56,751
Let's submit our report
and close it too. Okay?

528
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,836
I understand how you feel.

529
00:32:00,046 --> 00:32:01,839
But about this fire case…

530
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:09,764
we need to go along with the police.

531
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:15,770
Goodness.

532
00:32:16,437 --> 00:32:18,689
Why are you drinking coffee again?

533
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:21,067
I heard you went to the NOI today.

534
00:32:22,151 --> 00:32:24,153
It's been rough for you, hasn't it?

535
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:27,615
Aren't you drinking too much coffee?

536
00:32:28,699 --> 00:32:31,744
You have to take care of your health
at times like these.

537
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:36,248
I brought this for you to drink
and get your strength back.

538
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:39,752
Here. We can have one each.

539
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,182
Thank you for the petition.

540
00:32:54,308 --> 00:32:56,644
Of course, we're neighbors.

541
00:32:58,145 --> 00:33:00,147
But did it help at all?

542
00:33:01,357 --> 00:33:02,441
Yes.

543
00:33:02,525 --> 00:33:05,111
I think it'll end with a reprimand.

544
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:07,947
That's a relief.

545
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,282
Everyone has been so worried.

546
00:33:16,664 --> 00:33:19,083
There's something else, isn't there?

547
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,753
Would you ever…

548
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,548
put your job on the line

549
00:33:26,173 --> 00:33:28,009
to reveal the truth about something?

550
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:31,512
I believe

551
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,640
that my pride is at stake in this job.

552
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:38,102
Even if I get beat up a lot
on the frontline,

553
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:40,576
I live with my pride as a police officer.

554
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,160
So I'm not an embarrassment to my juniors.

555
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:49,905
I shouldn't do something

556
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,617
that'll make me
an embarrassment to Dojin, right?

557
00:34:04,712 --> 00:34:07,840
This is a copy of the investigation report
of the shantytown fire

558
00:34:07,923 --> 00:34:10,301
that occurred ten years ago
where Next Officetel stands now.

559
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:13,345
Why do you have this?

560
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,807
At that time, the fire broke out

561
00:34:17,391 --> 00:34:21,187
when the conflict between the contractors
and shantytown residents was at its peak.

562
00:34:22,063 --> 00:34:24,940
However, the fire burned
the shantytown down that day,

563
00:34:25,483 --> 00:34:28,736
and the residents
were forced out with nothing.

564
00:34:30,571 --> 00:34:32,865
Woosung-dong shantytown
fire investigation report

565
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:34,784
NFS National Forensic Service

566
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,628
<i>The heart is around 12 ounces.</i>

567
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,717
<i>The left lung is here,
but there's no right lung.</i>

568
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,637
<i>He's missing a lung.</i>

569
00:34:56,388 --> 00:34:57,428
<i>He's missing a lung?</i>

570
00:35:00,935 --> 00:35:02,228
<i>And he's missing…</i>

571
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,773
<i>the right lobe of his liver.</i>

572
00:35:07,817 --> 00:35:09,026
<i>And he's missing…</i>

573
00:35:09,944 --> 00:35:11,195
<i>his right kidney.</i>

574
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,281
<i>You keep saying he's
missing something. What do you mean?</i>

575
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:15,658
<i>Exactly as I've said.</i>

576
00:35:15,741 --> 00:35:19,078
<i>This corpse is missing some of its organs,
the heart being the exception.</i>

577
00:35:19,161 --> 00:35:20,496
<i>Everything but the heart?</i>

578
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,619
<i>He'd die right away if...</i>

579
00:35:51,318 --> 00:35:53,487
This is Han Sejin from the NFS.

580
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,406
Can we meet?

581
00:35:56,699 --> 00:35:58,325
A total of five buildings,

582
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:00,619
including Next Officetel
and the neighboring

583
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:02,454
mixed-use buildings,

584
00:36:02,788 --> 00:36:04,790
were built after the shantytown fire.

585
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,502
The development profit
must have been astounding.

586
00:36:08,586 --> 00:36:10,504
Oh, you haven't gone home yet?

587
00:36:10,588 --> 00:36:13,716
No, not yet.
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

588
00:36:13,966 --> 00:36:15,718
It's on me, so let's go eat.

589
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,469
What's the special occasion?

590
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,346
You two can go ahead. I'm not hungry.

591
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,140
Hey, get him.

592
00:36:21,223 --> 00:36:23,559
No! You're going to eat
instant food again, aren't you?

593
00:36:23,642 --> 00:36:26,163
- No, I'm just not hungry.
- You can't have any more instant food.

594
00:36:26,187 --> 00:36:28,814
- Come along. Let's go.
- I said I'm just not hungry.

595
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:30,618
- Just go eat.
- I'm not hungry.

596
00:36:30,649 --> 00:36:32,443
What are you saying? You will be.

597
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:40,868
I've discovered one similarity
and one difference between the organs

598
00:36:40,951 --> 00:36:42,328
that have been removed.

599
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,496
A similarity and a difference?

600
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:48,125
An obsessed criminal

601
00:36:48,417 --> 00:36:50,211
never acts without reason.

602
00:36:51,629 --> 00:36:52,755
Look here.

603
00:36:54,215 --> 00:36:56,342
The first organ that was removed

604
00:36:56,425 --> 00:36:57,968
is the key point.

605
00:36:58,928 --> 00:37:00,221
The first organ.

606
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:13,984
Was it this one?

607
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,930
As expected, you have a good eye.

608
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,781
I knew you'd recognize it right away.

609
00:37:19,365 --> 00:37:21,051
We have to let
Taewon Police Station know right away.

610
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,868
I contacted you

611
00:37:23,661 --> 00:37:25,955
to get a second opinion
before we notified them.

612
00:37:26,872 --> 00:37:27,915
If that's the case,

613
00:37:27,998 --> 00:37:30,751
you should discuss this
with someone else from the NFS.

614
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,594
"That's what I would've done
if I were them."

615
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:35,008
That's what you said
in the autopsy room, right?

616
00:37:35,965 --> 00:37:38,175
I apologize if I was out of line.

617
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:40,779
I was just curious about the reason
behind your decision.

618
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:43,013
That's what I would've done
if I were them.

619
00:37:44,348 --> 00:37:46,225
I'll ask you one question.

620
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,143
Would you have done it this way

621
00:37:48,727 --> 00:37:49,979
if it were you?

622
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:03,200
Yes, I would've done it this way as well.

623
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:05,452
Okay, then.

624
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,677
I'm going to Taewon Police Station.
Would you like to come with me?

625
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:11,375
Me?

626
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:13,877
I don't really like detectives.

627
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,298
You didn't drive here, did you?

628
00:38:18,507 --> 00:38:19,550
Let's take my car.

629
00:38:40,738 --> 00:38:42,281
Why do you dislike the police?

630
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,285
We always end up fighting when we meet.

631
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:52,875
That's why I went to Jeju Island to avoid
conducting autopsies for criminal cases.

632
00:38:53,459 --> 00:38:54,460
I see.

633
00:38:55,669 --> 00:38:59,506
Autopsy results don't always match
the results of the investigation.

634
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:03,635
It's like a coexistence
between conflict and cooperation.

635
00:39:03,719 --> 00:39:06,221
Don't firefighters feel the same way?

636
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:07,806
Well…

637
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,393
I believe cooperation
is more important than conflict.

638
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,231
It seemed like you tried very hard

639
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:19,693
to save the victim's life at the scene,

640
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:23,113
so I'm sorry for letting you
see him lying on the autopsy table.

641
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,948
I was a bit insensitive.

642
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,493
It's okay.

643
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,119
You know, we're pretty similar.

644
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:31,955
I see death's extremities,

645
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,249
and you see life's extremities.

646
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:38,212
And both of us have very daring hands.

647
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:40,881
- Daring hands?
- Yes.

648
00:39:41,298 --> 00:39:44,635
You hurt your hand
while using a stapler during treatment.

649
00:39:45,302 --> 00:39:47,054
Oh, this?

650
00:39:56,647 --> 00:39:59,566
It's become a habit to think
about causality when I see damage.

651
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:04,340
You may end up conducting autopsies
on the living at this rate.

652
00:40:06,657 --> 00:40:08,033
I've wanted to look…

653
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:12,371
into a living person's mind before,

654
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,958
but I'm more comfortable with the dead.

655
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:18,627
Even if I put a knife to their body,

656
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:22,464
there isn't a hint of hate or resentment

657
00:40:23,507 --> 00:40:26,093
as they quietly tell you
what happened to them.

658
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:30,556
In a way,
it's the most genuine relationship.

659
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:32,266
Hmm…

660
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,393
That's a bit too lonely.

661
00:40:34,476 --> 00:40:38,397
Aren't we all lonely, anyway?

662
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:53,287
Yes. Thank you.

663
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,433
So you're saying that the people
who benefited from the reconstruction

664
00:40:56,457 --> 00:41:00,085
of Next Officetel are trying to prevent
Chief Dokgo from exposing the case?

665
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:02,379
There's something suspicious about it.

666
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,841
I think huge cartels are lurking
in the shadows.

667
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,528
Why did a prosecutor from
the Central District Prosecutors' Office

668
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,632
suddenly come into
the interrogation room at the NOI?

669
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,764
I don't know how far,

670
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,434
but someone high in the ranks is involved.

671
00:41:15,517 --> 00:41:18,187
How do we find evidence for an arson
that occurred ten years ago?

672
00:41:18,604 --> 00:41:19,605
Hey.

673
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,690
The statute of limitations
for arson is 15 years.

674
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,418
Should we give up
despite having five years left?

675
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:24,860
No, that's not what I mean.

676
00:41:24,943 --> 00:41:26,737
So the key is finding evidence.

677
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:29,174
If the purpose of the arson
was to burn down the shantytown,

678
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:31,116
they would have used flammable substances.

679
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,785
The problem is
how we find evidence of that.

680
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:37,915
Whatever the case, you should find out
how it differed from normal fires.

681
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:39,158
You mean, conventional fires.

682
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,919
Interrupting us as we speak.
It's the same thing.

683
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:44,171
- Over here!
- Hey.

684
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:45,339
Did you get anything?

685
00:41:46,632 --> 00:41:52,721
I've checked all the surgical records
from every hospital in the whole country.

686
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,806
On the day of Attorney Yang's death,

687
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:56,975
not a single hospital
performed a transplant,

688
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,936
whether it be…

689
00:42:00,354 --> 00:42:01,605
for a liver, lung, or kidney.

690
00:42:03,148 --> 00:42:06,944
This means that they built a hospital
and operated in it,

691
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:09,988
they shipped the organs overseas,

692
00:42:10,072 --> 00:42:13,617
or I've been looking
in the wrong place the whole time.

693
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,078
How are you guys able to eat?

694
00:42:20,916 --> 00:42:23,377
I take it back. This looks good.

695
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:27,798
An investigation
isn't supposed to be easy.

696
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:30,592
Oh, that. That's really good. Eat up.

697
00:42:30,676 --> 00:42:32,886
Mmm! My goodness, it's delicious.

698
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,265
Then should we work with Interpol
to check hospital records...

699
00:42:36,348 --> 00:42:38,308
I'm sick and tired
of hearing the word "hospital."

700
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,436
But, Ms. Woo, hospitals abroad…

701
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:43,438
Enjoy your food.

702
00:42:44,481 --> 00:42:45,899
It tastes so good.

703
00:42:46,483 --> 00:42:49,111
- What's this?
- It's good, right?

704
00:42:49,278 --> 00:42:50,958
It's an unknown number.

705
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,156
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Han Sejin from the NFS.

706
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,366
You're not at the station.

707
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,329
I came in person
because it's an important case.

708
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,690
You're at the station right now?

709
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:00,122
I'm not in a hurry, so take your time.

710
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,295
He seemed like a well-mannered person,
but he just hung up on me.

711
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:08,130
Let's go.

712
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:09,631
I'm not done!

713
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:11,466
You should eat more before you go.

714
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:14,136
He sounds like he's lost it.

715
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:17,806
- He's always been that way.
- What about me?

716
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:19,641
I need to go, too.

717
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:24,313
We weren't even able
to finish all of this.

718
00:43:26,898 --> 00:43:29,234
Organ transplants are all about speed,

719
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:32,112
because organs lose oxygen supply
from the moment they are removed

720
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:35,115
from the blood vessels of the human body,
and the cells begin to die.

721
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,411
I'm sure you've all seen helicopters
transport organs in ice boxes.

722
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:42,664
Speed is the key to organ transplants,

723
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,751
but not a single hospital in the country
performed an organ transplant.

724
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:46,918
How will you explain that?

725
00:43:47,002 --> 00:43:49,338
I'm going to explain it,
so please be patient.

726
00:43:52,883 --> 00:43:56,637
If you look at the liver and the lung,

727
00:43:57,638 --> 00:44:00,140
they look like they were removed
for an organ transplant,

728
00:44:00,223 --> 00:44:01,892
but the level of extraction is too wild.

729
00:44:01,975 --> 00:44:04,978
They used right lobe resection,
in which case…

730
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:06,873
The liver will function properly
when blood flow is restored

731
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:09,316
after the hepatic vein and portal vein
are anastomosed

732
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,776
to the recipient's blood vessels.

733
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:12,396
But if you look here,

734
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:16,114
the veins are haphazardly cut,
so anastomosis is impossible.

735
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,866
The lung is in a similar state.

736
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:20,130
It's not suitable
for a transplant.

737
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,329
So the liver and the lung
can't be transplanted?

738
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,040
Oh… Uh…

739
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:28,126
You, Mr. Han, mentioned organ transplants,

740
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,880
so I had to look through
so many surgical records.

741
00:44:34,091 --> 00:44:35,592
There's one organ left.

742
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:37,719
- The kidney.
- Precisely.

743
00:44:38,637 --> 00:44:41,556
Based on the degree of bleeding
or inflammation around the tissue,

744
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,977
<i>the first organ removed
from the victim was the kidney.</i>

745
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,815
And the most finely
removed organ was the kidney.

746
00:44:49,898 --> 00:44:51,733
In particular, the blood vessels, ureters,

747
00:44:51,817 --> 00:44:54,057
and other parts needed
to connect to the recipient's body

748
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:56,405
have been cut very finely,

749
00:44:56,488 --> 00:44:58,240
The opposite of the liver and lung.

750
00:44:59,324 --> 00:45:02,160
It's an organ that was
properly extracted for a transplant.

751
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:05,330
So the kidney was the only organ…

752
00:45:06,873 --> 00:45:08,458
used for a transplant?

753
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:10,085
Yes.

754
00:45:10,335 --> 00:45:12,921
The rest were a smokescreen.

755
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,424
You should've told us sooner.

756
00:45:15,507 --> 00:45:18,593
The reason why I didn't realize
this sooner is because

757
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:20,762
until an organ removed during an autopsy

758
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:23,807
<i>is placed in formalin and becomes rigid,</i>

759
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:25,475
it's too soft to notice anything.

760
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,978
And there's the most important fact.

761
00:45:28,437 --> 00:45:30,355
Everyone has two kidneys,

762
00:45:30,814 --> 00:45:34,192
so even if you remove one,
the victim could've been saved.

763
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:37,738
That's the cruelest detail
about the perpetrator.

764
00:45:39,072 --> 00:45:40,532
So the culprit

765
00:45:40,615 --> 00:45:43,368
is someone who tampered
with the liver and the lung

766
00:45:44,244 --> 00:45:47,038
to hide the fact that they need a kidney?

767
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,712
I found Ma Taehwa.

768
00:45:53,795 --> 00:45:56,590
I heard he almost died again
not too long ago.

769
00:45:56,673 --> 00:45:58,675
Jeez, he sure is holding on.

770
00:46:04,014 --> 00:46:06,183
Ma…

771
00:46:09,144 --> 00:46:10,353
It's Ma Taehwa.

772
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:12,481
Ma Taehwa. Darn it.

773
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:20,739
They all have hasty personalities.

774
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,950
<i>Anyone who's stolen
the victim's kidney, I mean…</i>

775
00:46:24,034 --> 00:46:26,036
<i>Anyone who had an organ transplant</i>

776
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,456
<i>should be lying in an aseptic room
and being administered immunosuppressants.</i>

777
00:46:30,373 --> 00:46:33,335
It's mine.
Don't eat it. Don't touch it.

778
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:34,753
It's mine!

779
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,047
Darn it.

780
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:41,360
We're from Taewon Police.
We contacted you earlier.

781
00:46:41,384 --> 00:46:42,487
You need permission to be here.

782
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:44,071
We just want to check
if there's a patient in there.

783
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,639
- Wait. Excuse us.
- No.

784
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:48,433
- Wait, have we seen each other before?
- What are you doing?

785
00:46:49,017 --> 00:46:50,912
We're from Taewon Police Station.
Ma Taehwa is inside, right?

786
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,938
You can't go in until visiting hours.

787
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:56,024
Darn it, move. Ma Taehwa, you bastard!

788
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,531
Who are you?

789
00:47:13,166 --> 00:47:14,167
Well, you see…

790
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:18,588
He just asked me to lie here in his stead.

791
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,715
How did you meet Ma Taehwa?

792
00:47:20,966 --> 00:47:22,843
We just ended up talking to each other

793
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:25,762
after hours of dialysis.

794
00:47:26,346 --> 00:47:28,431
He said that
all he had was money.

795
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,141
So he paid for my dialysis

796
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:31,351
and my hospital bills.

797
00:47:32,602 --> 00:47:33,979
He seemed like a very nice person.

798
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:35,897
He's a murderer.

799
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:39,776
I only have a month left to live,

800
00:47:40,485 --> 00:47:44,573
so why should I care
if he killed someone or not?

801
00:47:44,656 --> 00:47:46,658
You just helped a criminal escape,

802
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:49,181
and Article 147 establishes
that aiding an escapee is a crime.

803
00:47:49,452 --> 00:47:51,788
You could spend your last month in jail.

804
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:53,081
Where's the nurse?

805
00:47:53,915 --> 00:47:54,916
Excuse me…

806
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,127
You shouldn't have done that.

807
00:48:02,424 --> 00:48:04,801
You didn't have to do this.

808
00:48:05,343 --> 00:48:06,386
Thank you.

809
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,180
I just wanted to have a drink.
Don't worry about it.

810
00:48:09,764 --> 00:48:10,974
Thank you.

811
00:48:14,519 --> 00:48:15,645
Hold on.

812
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:35,707
A paramedic shouldn't leave
their injury unattended like this.

813
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:38,585
It's okay. It's not a big deal.

814
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:41,588
Let me treat it for you.

815
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:49,095
You must have
several wounds like this.

816
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,264
Pardon?

817
00:48:51,348 --> 00:48:53,475
You may get physically hurt again.

818
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,188
You may get emotionally hurt if there's
a problem you can't fix as a paramedic.

819
00:48:59,564 --> 00:49:01,274
You feel guilty…

820
00:49:02,984 --> 00:49:04,544
about Mr. Yang Chiyoung's death, right?

821
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,450
A paramedic can't save everyone.

822
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:13,954
Everyone dies in the end.

823
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:17,874
I know.

824
00:49:18,708 --> 00:49:21,252
There's a saying
first responders like us keep in mind.

825
00:49:21,753 --> 00:49:24,506
"No matter how soon we arrive
at a scene, we're late."

826
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:27,801
The incident or accident
has already happened,

827
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:31,054
and the reports
are always made one step late.

828
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,474
I know that,

829
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:37,477
but it doesn't lessen the guilt.

830
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,732
You're done.

831
00:49:43,942 --> 00:49:45,026
Thank you.

832
00:49:47,195 --> 00:49:49,948
Just throw that guilt away.

833
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,243
Is that even possible?

834
00:49:54,035 --> 00:49:55,286
Maybe?

835
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:59,582
You try to be a perfectionist,

836
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:00,750
so to be perfect,

837
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,044
you need to throw it away.

838
00:50:08,967 --> 00:50:12,637
You said that an autopsy
harbors no resentment or hatred

839
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:16,307
and is the most genuine relationship
you can have with a corpse.

840
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:19,227
Is that why you're so nonchalant
in front of death?

841
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:23,440
I'm sure Ms. Yun is the same way.

842
00:50:23,773 --> 00:50:24,941
That's what an autopsy is.

843
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,819
You can't miss the story of the deceased.

844
00:50:27,902 --> 00:50:29,446
If you're not nonchalant about it

845
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,074
or if you don't steel yourself,

846
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,619
you'll miss their last story.

847
00:50:37,912 --> 00:50:40,248
Just think of it
as fulfilling my duties to the fullest.

848
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:44,794
A medical examiner is a doctor
you meet at the end of your life.

849
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:52,446
It's likely that the perpetrator
of this case is also a doctor.

850
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:54,512
How ironic.

851
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:00,435
They killed him using a scalpel,

852
00:51:02,103 --> 00:51:05,065
and we used a scalpel to find out
what happened to him.

853
00:51:06,983 --> 00:51:08,443
It's quite ironic, isn't it?

854
00:51:10,278 --> 00:51:12,447
Thanks to you,
the culprit will definitely be caught.

855
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:16,743
You found the evidence.

856
00:51:17,994 --> 00:51:18,995
And…

857
00:51:19,579 --> 00:51:22,290
Detective Jin is working hard
on the investigation.

858
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,043
But…

859
00:51:27,045 --> 00:51:28,296
I'm a bit worried.

860
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:35,053
I don't think it's going to be easy,
seeing that they removed his liver

861
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:37,514
and lung to confuse us.

862
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:42,268
The ones who manipulate evidence
are harder to catch

863
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,980
than the ones who destroy it.

864
00:51:50,819 --> 00:51:54,030
There was emergency dialysis
for Ma Taehwa at dawn on the 18th.

865
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,699
His potassium level
was unusually high

866
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:59,327
and his saturation level
had fallen to 80%.

867
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:02,122
Cases like these
always get emergency dialysis.

868
00:52:02,205 --> 00:52:05,708
Is there a way to deliberately
induce such an emergency?

869
00:52:06,543 --> 00:52:10,964
Well, it's possible if you consume
alcohol or salty foods.

870
00:52:11,548 --> 00:52:13,675
<i>But who would do
such a crazy thing?</i>

871
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:15,318
<i>They could die if something goes wrong.</i>

872
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:18,012
There's a bastard who would do just that.

873
00:52:18,596 --> 00:52:21,474
Hey, you can't even
watch him properly?

874
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:24,227
- Hey.
- And you call yourself a detective?

875
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,896
- You little…
- Wait, stop it.

876
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,816
You could hardly see his face
with the plastic in the room.

877
00:52:29,899 --> 00:52:30,900
I'm sorry.

878
00:52:31,651 --> 00:52:34,154
Jindo Dog, I'm really sorry.

879
00:52:34,237 --> 00:52:35,557
I'm ashamed of myself.

880
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:39,284
Let's not do this. Let's go
through the hospital's CCTV footage.

881
00:52:39,367 --> 00:52:40,660
I'm sure we'll find something.

882
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:42,078
No luck with the CCTV.

883
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,914
If they vacuum up dust
to clear their tracks,

884
00:52:45,498 --> 00:52:47,218
they wouldn't leave any footage,
would they?

885
00:52:54,924 --> 00:52:56,718
<i>We have news that Ma Taehwa,</i>

886
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:59,679
<i>an inmate who was granted a stay
of execution due to kidney failure</i>

887
00:52:59,762 --> 00:53:03,391
<i>and undergoing dialysis at a hospital,
escaped after setting up a decoy patient.</i>

888
00:53:03,641 --> 00:53:06,686
<i>The police are looking into
a possible connection between him</i>

889
00:53:06,769 --> 00:53:08,271
<i>and the recent incident in Taewon-gu,</i>

890
00:53:08,354 --> 00:53:11,274
<i>in which a victim had several organs
removed, including a kidney.</i>

891
00:53:11,357 --> 00:53:14,527
<i>An hour after realizing he was on the run,
they began a public search</i>

892
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:16,404
<i>and are putting all efforts
into the search.</i>

893
00:53:16,988 --> 00:53:18,698
<i>Also, Ma Taehwa…</i>

894
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:20,241
It hurts my pride to admit,

895
00:53:20,325 --> 00:53:21,659
but we've been fooled.

896
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:23,870
It wasn't a coincidence

897
00:53:23,953 --> 00:53:26,307
that he had kidney failure
right after his father's funeral.

898
00:53:26,331 --> 00:53:29,250
But what should we call this case?

899
00:53:30,043 --> 00:53:31,836
Kidney theft and murder?

900
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,171
Murder should come first.

901
00:53:33,254 --> 00:53:35,673
And kidney theft
falls under mutilation of the body.

902
00:53:35,757 --> 00:53:39,552
No, he was alive when it was removed,
so it's special bodily injury.

903
00:53:39,636 --> 00:53:41,721
Or special theft since he ran off with it?

904
00:53:41,804 --> 00:53:44,098
Ma Taehwa really
complicated things this time.

905
00:53:44,682 --> 00:53:45,683
Darn it.

906
00:53:48,436 --> 00:53:50,876
Someone is controlling
this bastard behind the scenes.

907
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:54,400
He planned everything
from the Bang Pilgu case to this case.

908
00:53:55,276 --> 00:53:57,195
None of this ends until we catch them.

909
00:53:58,112 --> 00:53:59,447
<i>Hey, Jindo Dog,</i>

910
00:54:00,031 --> 00:54:01,366
you could be reborn.

911
00:54:02,158 --> 00:54:03,451
You could bark all you want.

912
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,286
But in front of them,

913
00:54:06,663 --> 00:54:08,289
you'd be nothing…

914
00:54:10,124 --> 00:54:12,710
but a mutt.

915
00:54:14,212 --> 00:54:15,630
This was a big stunt.

916
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,689
It would've required a lot of resources.

917
00:54:17,757 --> 00:54:19,926
By resources, you mean money.

918
00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:22,178
Right. If we try to get
a transplant at a hospital,

919
00:54:22,303 --> 00:54:23,596
it would cost us a fortune.

920
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,265
All he has is money,

921
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:27,225
so maybe he bought out a whole hospital.

922
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:28,518
Look into his accounts.

923
00:54:28,601 --> 00:54:31,104
Find any and every transaction

924
00:54:31,187 --> 00:54:33,523
made with his assets
since he went to prison.

925
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:36,234
He must have inherited
Ma Joongdo's assets when he died,

926
00:54:36,317 --> 00:54:38,117
so let's go
to the National Tax Service first.

927
00:54:38,152 --> 00:54:40,738
And this bastard should be lying
in an aseptic room somewhere,

928
00:54:40,822 --> 00:54:42,865
so please check for patients
in aseptic rooms

929
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:44,575
in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

930
00:54:44,659 --> 00:54:46,452
Okay. Gosh, hospitals again.

931
00:54:47,912 --> 00:54:49,998
That's a Jindo Dog warning, right?

932
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:52,709
It's not a warning. It's the real thing.

933
00:54:53,251 --> 00:54:54,691
- Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

934
00:54:57,088 --> 00:54:59,566
After his father,
Assemblyman Ma Joongdo's death,

935
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:01,592
some of the assets
were returned to society.

936
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,137
The rest…

937
00:55:05,013 --> 00:55:08,516
were split in half between his wife
and only son, Ma Taehwa.

938
00:55:08,725 --> 00:55:11,686
Have there been any
suspicious cash flows recently?

939
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:16,190
Among the inherited assets,
land properties were sold.

940
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:19,944
I thought he was raising cash
to pay the inheritance tax,

941
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:22,196
but the said tax is still unpaid.

942
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,865
How much did he receive from the sale?

943
00:55:25,491 --> 00:55:28,161
About 34 billion won.

944
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,997
Where did that money go?

945
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:32,766
It was deposited
into an account in Switzerland.

946
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,751
In order to trace the usage,

947
00:55:34,834 --> 00:55:38,129
we have to work with Interpol in
Switzerland to view account information.

948
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:42,383
But it could take months of going
back and forth with various documents.

949
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:47,070
- All right, then.
- Goodbye.

950
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:50,156
We don't have time to wait for Interpol.

951
00:55:50,183 --> 00:55:51,618
What do we do?
It's an account in Switzerland.

952
00:55:51,642 --> 00:55:54,395
He must have thoroughly
managed the money left in his name.

953
00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:56,874
Yang Chiyoung would have managed it
for him while he was in prison.

954
00:55:56,898 --> 00:55:59,650
It's not like we can ask someone
who's already dead.

955
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:01,170
Even in death, a trace is left behind.

956
00:56:01,194 --> 00:56:03,821
He didn't make a single call,
so how do we find anything?

957
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,031
Hey.

958
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:09,410
There's no way
Yang Chiyoung didn't make any calls.

959
00:56:12,163 --> 00:56:15,434
This is cell tower data on Yang Chiyoung's
cell phone location over the past month.

960
00:56:15,458 --> 00:56:18,544
What if we find a phone
with the matching location data?

961
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:20,606
- Yang Chiyoung's burner phone?
- Exactly. Ms. Woo?

962
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:23,508
Yes, yes. I'm already on it.

963
00:56:30,098 --> 00:56:33,810
We found it.
010-1346-6431, a prepaid phone.

964
00:56:33,893 --> 00:56:37,313
No one else can perfectly match
their movements for a week.

965
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:40,358
Nice to meet you, phone.

966
00:56:40,942 --> 00:56:42,276
Let's look into it.

967
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:46,322
Let's see which apps
were downloaded first.

968
00:56:47,115 --> 00:56:49,784
Bytecoin, a cryptocurrency trading app.

969
00:56:49,867 --> 00:56:52,495
How much did you get out of this?

970
00:56:53,204 --> 00:56:55,924
- Thirty-four billion won.
- The amount he got from selling the land.

971
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,268
He turned the money
into cryptocurrency through Switzerland

972
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:00,092
and deposited it
into Yang Chiyoung's account.

973
00:57:00,711 --> 00:57:03,506
That bastard paid him
for his kidney, no, his life.

974
00:57:03,589 --> 00:57:05,883
Look at this. Out of the 34 billion won,

975
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:08,052
18.7 billion won was used
to take over a hospital.

976
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:10,816
- An orthopedic clinic.
- Send us the address of the clinic.

977
00:57:10,847 --> 00:57:13,224
Okay.

978
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:34,078
What the hell?

979
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:38,624
- Just open it. Take them down.
- My gosh.

980
00:57:45,506 --> 00:57:46,507
Careful.

981
00:57:47,758 --> 00:57:49,760
- Go to the left.
- Okay.

982
00:57:53,389 --> 00:57:54,432
Darn it. Where is it?

983
00:57:58,728 --> 00:57:59,729
Darn it.

984
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:02,148
Nothing.

985
00:58:07,737 --> 00:58:08,738
Ma Taehwa!

986
00:58:11,115 --> 00:58:13,284
Operating Room

987
00:58:16,704 --> 00:58:17,955
Did you find something?

988
00:58:18,956 --> 00:58:21,125
He had the operation here.
Where's the aseptic room?

989
00:58:21,209 --> 00:58:22,376
We have to go up a floor.

990
00:58:35,431 --> 00:58:37,099
Detective Jin, it's over there.

991
00:58:53,324 --> 00:58:54,408
Ma Taehwa.

992
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:09,340
What?

993
00:59:10,508 --> 00:59:11,592
Why isn't he here?

994
01:00:20,244 --> 01:00:21,412
<i>As I expected.</i>

995
01:00:22,788 --> 01:00:24,665
<i>I was right.</i>

996
01:00:26,709 --> 01:00:28,169
<i>This is his weakness.</i>

997
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:37,198
<i>Hello, how may I help you?</i>

998
01:00:37,762 --> 01:00:39,180
Ma Taehwa has disappeared?

999
01:00:39,263 --> 01:00:41,724
Oh, yes. Goodness.

1000
01:00:41,932 --> 01:00:44,852
I'm ashamed to face Detective Jin.

1001
01:00:44,935 --> 01:00:46,270
All right.

1002
01:00:47,605 --> 01:00:48,856
We'll speak later.

1003
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:55,112
How much do you know
about Ma Taehwa's mastermind?

1004
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:56,822
I know one thing for sure.

1005
01:00:56,906 --> 01:00:59,200
It's not something
someone like you can handle.

1006
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:01,577
<i>You have a very talented son.</i>

1007
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:04,121
Detective Jin Hogae
from Taewon Police Station.

1008
01:01:04,205 --> 01:01:06,415
<i>Is that enough to convince you?</i>

1009
01:01:08,793 --> 01:01:11,545
Imagine yourself
as a patient on an operating table.

1010
01:01:11,629 --> 01:01:13,829
Do we really have
to take photos lying down?

1011
01:01:13,881 --> 01:01:15,299
Imagination.

1012
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:17,009
Let's use our imagination.

1013
01:01:19,428 --> 01:01:22,640
<i>♪ Where, oh
Where would they have touched? ♪</i>

1014
01:01:23,265 --> 01:01:27,144
<i>♪ Let's figure that out ♪</i>

1015
01:01:27,812 --> 01:01:28,813
Here.

1016
01:01:37,113 --> 01:01:40,700
They would have cleaned
the obvious places

1017
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,451
since they have mysophobia.

1018
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,997
So can we find something they missed

1019
01:01:47,873 --> 01:01:48,874
or not?

1020
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,213
Lift your arm up.

1021
01:01:58,592 --> 01:01:59,635
Too dark.

1022
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:09,019
As expected.

1023
01:02:09,729 --> 01:02:11,063
- Powder!
- Yes, ma'am.

1024
01:02:11,355 --> 01:02:12,440
Capture this, please.

1025
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:20,573
Come on.

1026
01:02:21,073 --> 01:02:22,533
Please let there be something.

1027
01:02:23,784 --> 01:02:24,994
It's there.

1028
01:02:25,077 --> 01:02:26,078
It's there!

1029
01:02:28,622 --> 01:02:31,709
But how did they leave fingerprints behind
when they had gloves on?

1030
01:02:31,792 --> 01:02:33,210
Gloves aren't foolproof.

1031
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:35,772
<i>They touched the outside
of the glove while putting it on.</i>

1032
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:38,257
- Run this through AFIS immediately.
- Yes, ma'am.

1033
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:44,930
Yes, this is him.

1034
01:02:45,014 --> 01:02:47,641
He said he was the attorney
representing an angel investor.

1035
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:49,870
He said it would be turned
into a dermatology clinic

1036
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:51,937
and attract foreigners
looking for plastic surgery.

1037
01:02:52,521 --> 01:02:54,690
But this punk scammed us?

1038
01:02:55,733 --> 01:02:57,985
I won't let this slide. Where is he now?

1039
01:02:58,444 --> 01:02:59,445
He's dead.

1040
01:02:59,945 --> 01:03:01,655
Detective Jin. Excuse me.

1041
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:03,073
All of the CCTVs are dead.

1042
01:03:03,157 --> 01:03:05,034
We have to look through
24 hours of footage,

1043
01:03:05,117 --> 01:03:06,494
but thousands of cars passed by.

1044
01:03:06,577 --> 01:03:08,513
- Regardless, we have to find something.
- Darn it.

1045
01:03:08,537 --> 01:03:09,705
Hey.

1046
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:11,332
He got surgery.

1047
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:13,334
Both of them were patients.

1048
01:03:13,918 --> 01:03:15,544
Yes, so to move both patients…

1049
01:03:16,253 --> 01:03:17,254
An ambulance.

1050
01:03:17,338 --> 01:03:18,422
Look into any ambulances

1051
01:03:18,506 --> 01:03:21,306
that show up on CCTV footage in the area
on the day Yang Chiyoung died.

1052
01:03:22,343 --> 01:03:25,012
- We narrowed it down.
- Okay.

1053
01:03:27,765 --> 01:03:31,143
We have the data for the entire
24-hour duration of the 19th,

1054
01:03:31,227 --> 01:03:32,987
pertaining to all the ambulances
in the area.

1055
01:03:33,646 --> 01:03:35,332
The last moments
before he was killed.

1056
01:03:35,356 --> 01:03:37,483
- It has to show up.
- Let's begin.

1057
01:03:37,566 --> 01:03:40,152
Check private ambulance, 5426.

1058
01:03:40,236 --> 01:03:42,738
Done. It went to
the nearby Myeongjo Hospital.

1059
01:03:43,322 --> 01:03:47,201
Next. Private ambulance, 6535.

1060
01:03:47,284 --> 01:03:48,786
I checked 6535,

1061
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,705
and it transported Kim Soonae
who had acute pneumonia.

1062
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:55,084
Next. General ambulance, 7552.

1063
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,419
Checking 7552 now.

1064
01:03:57,503 --> 01:03:58,504
Done.

1065
01:04:01,966 --> 01:04:03,634
Last ambulance.

1066
01:04:03,717 --> 01:04:05,957
There were no users,
and it was returning to its station.

1067
01:04:06,887 --> 01:04:08,722
Check the CCTV footage
to see for ourselves.

1068
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:10,641
Okay.

1069
01:04:22,987 --> 01:04:26,699
We checked all 57 ambulances
that passed by on the day of the incident.

1070
01:04:27,157 --> 01:04:28,701
Ma Taehwa was nowhere to be found.

1071
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:39,060
We got a match for the fingerprints
found on the operating light.

1072
01:04:42,089 --> 01:04:43,632
Darn it!

1073
01:04:43,716 --> 01:04:45,316
Personal identification check
Seok Moongu

1074
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,179
Move, let's go!

1075
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:52,641
Move. Hurry.

1076
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:02,961
He could've run away,
so surround the area.

1077
01:05:02,985 --> 01:05:04,153
- Yes, sir.
- Close it off.

1078
01:05:05,529 --> 01:05:06,614
Mr. Seok Moongu!

1079
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:18,876
No entry POLICE LINE

1080
01:05:18,959 --> 01:05:19,960
Ms. Woo.

1081
01:05:24,882 --> 01:05:27,482
It's an anesthetic.
I think this was the cause of death.

1082
01:05:35,476 --> 01:05:37,853
Father

1083
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:50,532
I supposed you've hit a dead end

1084
01:05:51,158 --> 01:05:53,077
with Yang Chiyoung's murder.

1085
01:05:56,622 --> 01:05:59,541
Do you know which cases serial murderers
make a lot of mistakes in?

1086
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:02,294
It's their very first case.

1087
01:06:04,296 --> 01:06:07,216
If their first murder in Korea

1088
01:06:08,092 --> 01:06:10,094
remained a hidden crime…

1089
01:06:10,177 --> 01:06:12,513
"Hidden crime: An unreported
and unregistered crime"

1090
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:15,015
…you should look into that first.

1091
01:06:15,724 --> 01:06:17,267
There was a hidden murder?

1092
01:06:18,644 --> 01:06:19,687
Take a look at this.

1093
01:06:24,316 --> 01:06:25,996
Search and seizure warrant for autopsy-use

1094
01:06:27,695 --> 01:06:31,156
This is our first collaboration.

1095
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:44,920
Integrated Detective Team

1096
01:06:48,757 --> 01:06:50,175
<i>I was going to give up.</i>

1097
01:06:50,843 --> 01:06:52,177
<i>However, Dex…</i>

1098
01:06:52,761 --> 01:06:53,887
<i>will not stop.</i>

1099
01:06:55,097 --> 01:06:56,765
<i>Now that Ma Taehwa has disappeared,</i>

1100
01:06:57,474 --> 01:06:59,893
<i>he must be planning something bigger.</i>

1101
01:07:01,270 --> 01:07:04,314
<i>It's your choice.</i>

1102
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:24,543
- Okay.
- Just a little more.

1103
01:07:26,086 --> 01:07:28,547
- Careful, we're going downhill.
- Careful.

1104
01:07:29,089 --> 01:07:30,340
Slowly.

1105
01:07:30,424 --> 01:07:31,550
I thought you wouldn't come.

1106
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:34,636
You said I would regret
missing this autopsy,

1107
01:07:35,137 --> 01:07:36,722
so I came out of curiosity.

1108
01:07:38,557 --> 01:07:40,017
Kim, be careful!

1109
01:07:41,185 --> 01:07:42,311
Goodness.

1110
01:07:42,603 --> 01:07:44,063
Jeez.

1111
01:08:05,417 --> 01:08:06,777
This is Assemblyman Ma

1112
01:08:06,835 --> 01:08:08,835
who was once mentioned
as a presidential candidate.

1113
01:08:09,338 --> 01:08:12,841
He's the father of Ma Taehwa,
a murderer who stole someone's kidney

1114
01:08:12,925 --> 01:08:14,510
and is on the run.

1115
01:08:16,553 --> 01:08:18,764
The purpose of this autopsy is very clear.

1116
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:20,349
Finding traces of murder.

1117
01:08:20,432 --> 01:08:22,976
At the time of his death,
there was no

1118
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:25,020
circumstantial evidence of murder,

1119
01:08:25,729 --> 01:08:27,981
so he was buried
without an autopsy, right?

1120
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:32,069
- Yes, that's right.
- Then why do you suspect murder?

1121
01:08:32,653 --> 01:08:33,779
I have…

1122
01:08:35,489 --> 01:08:36,824
my reasons.

1123
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:45,749
A 70-year-old man
who has been buried for 48 days.

1124
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:49,336
He was about five foot seven and weighed
about 137 lbs when he was buried.

1125
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,965
Autopsy requested of the body
in its buried state.

1126
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:57,261
No noticeable trauma
at the time of the funeral.

1127
01:08:57,344 --> 01:08:59,513
The current time is 09:47.

1128
01:09:00,097 --> 01:09:01,598
Let's begin the autopsy.

1129
01:09:16,989 --> 01:09:19,950
Special thanks to Choi Musung
for his special appearance

The First Responders Season 2

1131
01:09:54,359 --> 01:09:56,504
Do you really believe
Assemblyman Ma's death was homicide?

1132
01:09:56,528 --> 01:09:57,589
I believe it was a homicide.

1133
01:09:57,613 --> 01:09:58,965
We're doing a full-scale reinvestigation.

1134
01:09:58,989 --> 01:10:00,073
A body bomb manufacturer.

1135
01:10:00,157 --> 01:10:02,927
In the name of the Green Mothers'
Association, I won't forgive that bastard!

1136
01:10:02,951 --> 01:10:04,911
We got the location
of the body bomb delivery guy.

1137
01:10:04,953 --> 01:10:07,873
When you catch that jerk, handcuff him.
Don't hit him.

1138
01:10:08,248 --> 01:10:10,209
<i>Assemblyman Ma Joongdo. 9:00 a.m.</i>

1139
01:10:10,292 --> 01:10:12,544
<i>Found dead at home on his couch.</i>

1140
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:15,339
A solid residue in
white opaque crystalline form

1141
01:10:15,422 --> 01:10:16,632
<i>has been identified.</i>

1142
01:10:17,007 --> 01:10:18,800
Hey, Im Sunyeol. Come here.

1143
01:10:19,092 --> 01:10:20,802
Come here. I said come here, you bastard!

1144
01:10:20,886 --> 01:10:24,097
Dex is not only perfect at planning
but executing as well.

1145
01:10:24,181 --> 01:10:26,099
You just witnessed it yourself!

1146
01:10:26,183 --> 01:10:27,184
It's blood.

1147
01:10:27,601 --> 01:10:28,894
<i>Detective Jin!</i>
