The condenser I removed earlier

64

If there was an unknown blackmailer,

why would they go through the trouble of stealing it and then blow it up?

He killed Ma Joongdo and got Ma Taehwa out of prison on stay of execution.

After purposely ruining his kidneys, he gave Ma Taehwa a new kidney

Furthermore, he manipulates

Here it is.

00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,483
[door opens]

171
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,777
[door closes]

172
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,031
[Sungjae] Could the detectives from Taewon Police Station step out?

173
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,741
What do you mean?

174
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:22,413
We just received the forensic report from the NFS's firearms room.

175
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,333
We've examined the serial number of the gun

176
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,335
recovered from Im Sunyeol's death scene,

177
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,172
and it matches the one issued to Detective Jin, and so does the bullet.

178
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,632
No other fingerprints

179
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,509
were found on the gun itself except for Detective Jin's.

180
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,928
-I mean-- -[Mr. Baek] Even if the gun and bullet

181
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,388
are Detective Jin's,

182
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,974
we can't be certain that he fired it.

183
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,602
Right. I thought the same thing

184
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:47,271
until I saw this CCTV footage.

185
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,238
[Sungjae] This footage was captured at an Internet cafe located

186
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,908
near the building where Im Sunyeol died.

187
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,286
We're in the process of obtaining other CCTV footage from the area.

188
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,623
What's Detective Jin doing there?

189
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:08,709
We've secured records of him logging into his email.

190
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,253
[Sungjae] Since it's a foreign email service,

191
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,838
we haven't uncovered the contents yet.

192
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,717
But with this, Im Sunyeol becomes the fourth person to die

193
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,136
in the vicinity of Detective Jin's whereabouts.

194
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,517
We'll presume his innocence,

195
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,894
but those associated with him can't participate in the investigation.

196
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:28,979
[sighs]

197
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,649
I won't keep you any longer. Please leave.

198
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,487
Darn it.

[door opens]

203
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,657
Around the entrance wound on the forehead,

204
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:07,077
there are gunpowder and deflagration residue.

205
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:10,164
This suggests the shot was fired within 39 inches of the victim.

206
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,583
Moreover, the bullet that penetrated didn't exit horizontally

207
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,877
but rather downwards from the lower part of the occiput.

208
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,129
While we can't be certain,

209
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:21,050
in cases like this, we can speculate that the victim was shot

210
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:24,762
in an execution-style manner while kneeling.

211
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,139
[Yungjae] We can speculate that Detective Jin's anger

212
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,350
over Moon Youngsoo's killing played a role.

213
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,605
Judging by the digestion level of food, blood clotting in the victim's stomach,

214
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,066
and the degree of rigor mortis,

215
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,861
the estimated time of death is about 28 hours ago.

216
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,155
[Yungjae] Im Sunyeol was last seen

217
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,990
at the parking lot in Mapyeong Park.

[sniffles]

219
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,911
After that, Detective Jin, who had evaded the Supreme Prosecutors' Office,

220
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,248
went to an Internet cafe and then to the rooftop to commit murder.

221
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,336
-It's not impossible. -What are you talking about?

222
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,133
I understand it's not easy

223
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,344
to lose colleagues and face such a situation.

224
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,515
However, we can't ignore the evidence.

225
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,309
Since Detective Jin is already deceased,

226
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,979
the case will be closed due to lack of indictment.

00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:45,009
he went to Prosecutor Jang Sungjae's officetel

230
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,136
and then headed straight to the SPO

231
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,347
and entered the server room.

I can't see well due to tears.

Is this a lens?

This isn't a button.

248
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,783
It's a mini camera.

The ground we stand on

00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,119
has distinct features, from soil color to topsoil properties

334

Topsoil comprised of high-quality soil and sandy soil,

If you follow this route,

there's a building that was abandoned during construction.

350

-An abandoned building? -Then there probably won't be any CCTVs.

-[static] -[Hogae] …for euthanasia.

That's me.

357
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,718
Right after that, Detective Jin inserted a microchip

It's still being recovered.

361

Clues about the blackmailer might appear later in the footage.

Kang Doha, Kongmyeong Pil,

851
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,684
the defendant is charged with threat, special assault,

852
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:25,812
and use of explosives, firearms, and swords

853
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,063
in violation of safety management laws.

854
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,606
He is also charged with violation of medical laws,

855
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,525
including unlicensed medical practices,

856
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,444

forgery of official documents, and use of forged official documents.

860
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,289
Thereby, I give the following verdict.

861
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:49,460
The defendant meticulously planned all these crimes in advance,

862
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:52,505
and the cruelty, wickedness, extreme disregard for human life,

863
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,800
and the attitude of extreme indifference displayed in these crimes

864
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:59,554
can only be seen as a manifestation of the defendant's true nature.

865
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:03,308
As such, this court has reached the conclusion

866
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,352
that the inevitable choice is to deprive the defendant of life

867
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,315
and permanently isolate him from society.

868
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,026
Therefore, this court sentences the defendant

869
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,154
to the maximum sentence prescribed by law,

870
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,906

996
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,224
But…

997
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,520
what would you have done in this situation, sir?

998
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:50,691
What?

999
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:54,278
That Dex or something is a truly evil bastard.

1000
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,739
[Hogae] Honestly, I don't regret my decision.

1001
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,158
If I ever come across someone like him again,

1002
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,659
I'll arrest him even if I have to…

1003
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:02,953
beat him half to death.

1004
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,247
Detective Jin.

1005
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:06,457
What?

1006
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,751
That's what a detective should do.

1007
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:11,879
[clapping]

1008
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,760

1009

-[cop 3] You're great! -[cop 4] That's right!

[cops cheering, applauding]

1011
01:08:21,138 --> 01:08:22,264
[cop 5] That's right!

1012
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,475
[cop 1] That's right, Jin Hogae!

1013

01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:55,691
By openly and passionately

1018
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:59,570
-counting on and understanding each other… -[cell phones buzz, beep]

1019
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:02,448
…to ensure that there will be nothing to regret…

1020
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:06,285
-I apologize. -[cell phone buzzes]

1021
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,706
Hey, move it! Let's go.

1022
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:12,499
I'm wearing blue underwear. Why are we being called out?

1023
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,335
-It's a joint response. -Get moving!

1024
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:15,628
Get married tomorrow.

1025
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,504
[chairperson] Hey, get moving!

1026
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,591
-My goodness. -What do we do?

1027
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:29,433
-What are you doing? Aren't you coming? -But we should still go on our honeymoon.

1028
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,062
Let's go.

1029

"A prisoner transport vehicle overturned."

1030
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,358
[Hogae] "Multiple casualties and fatalities."

1031
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:39,235
There were fatalities. We should go.

1032
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,278
Let's go.
