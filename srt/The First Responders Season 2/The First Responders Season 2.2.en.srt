How about the others?

163
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,069
[Jihoon] Sensor three is in position.

164
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,326
[Inju] We're almost done.

165
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,577
Please hurry.

166
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,203
Thank you.

167
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,041
Report back on the sound sensors.

168
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,251
[Seoha] We've set up two sets
in six places. They're ready to go.

169
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,045
Turning them on now.

170
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,213
Cut the radios and stop any movements.

171
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,673
[Hoyeon]
Turn up the reception all the way.

172
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,091
Shoot it.

-[muffled screaming]

180
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,812
We have sound from A-3,
the southeast sensor.

181
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,273
Rescue team,
start a secondary search by sensor A-3.

182
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,319
[Kisoo] We can't control the fire.

183
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,487
It'll take some time.

184
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,699
-Turn up the water pressure to 210 psi!
-Then we'll run out of water soon.

185
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,118
We have to put this out
and go over to the other side!

186
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,828
-Turn it up!
-[Kisoo] Yes, sir.

[Doojun] Are you sure it's done?

189
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,587
Why does it keep hurting?

00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,931
What? Is something wrong?

193
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,476
{\an8}The broken fibula
keeps touching the blood vessel.

194
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,645
{\an8}I think I'll have to perform traction.

195
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,605
{\an8}[splutters]
Track… What?

196
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,482
To get the broken bone inside…

197
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,567
[sighs]

198
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,069
It's just a thing. Hang on.

00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,283
[Doojun whimpers]

200
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,078
I have to widen the incision for traction.

201
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,581
To do that…

202
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,418
[Doojun groaning]

-[Jihoon] Sir?

205
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,724
-[Inju] Get the gas detector.
-[Jihoon] Yes, sir!

206
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,440
[indistinct chatter]

207
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,402
-[Jihoon] I brought the gas detector.
-[Inju] All right.

208
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,915
We're by sensor three
where we heard the sound.

209
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:12,583
We'll enter after checking for gas leaks.

210
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,379

[beeping]

212
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,384
[Jihoon] The gas detector is reacting!

213
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,011
It's an LPG gas leak warning!

214
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:25,179
Oh, come on.

215
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,641
[Hoyeon] This is the site commander.

216
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,309
We have confirmed an LPG leak.

217
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,686
Determine the perimeter
and close in on the danger zone.

218
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,647
What about the LPG?

219
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,816
Since LPG is heavier than air,

220
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,275
it sinks to the bottom when leaked.

221
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,611
There's a chance that it may have built up

222
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,613
where Officer Song
and the civilian are buried.

223
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:43,906
And during the rescue,

224
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,991
there may be some sparks
from breaking down concrete.

225
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,577
Are you saying it might explode?

226

[Doojun groans]

230
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:02,049
[Seol] Mr. Choi, you need to stay awake.

231
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,093
How old are you, sir?

232
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm 45.

233
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:07,972
Tell me about your family.

234
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,141
[Doojun] A daughter… I have a daughter.

235
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,144
[Seol] What's your daughter's name?

236
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,897
Nari. Her name is Choi Nari.

237
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,442
Nari. And how old is she?

238
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,404
[Doojun groans]
She's 18.

239
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,076
[Seol] If you want to see her again,
you need to stay strong.

240
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,831
It might be better if I died.

241
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,543
Then she would qualify for welfare

242
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,672
and could go to college
on special admission for low-income kids.

243
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,716
What?

244
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,218
[Doojun] She was born to a lousy dad

245
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,596
and couldn't even do
what she wanted to do.

246
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,932
I couldn't do anything for her.

247
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:55,102
What should I do now, Nari?

the food he's delivering?

-What a nuisance.
-[Doojun] Ouch, that's hot.

251
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,860
[student 2] Should we report him?

252
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:04,361
Should we?

253
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,365

254
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,410
What are you going to do about
the soup that spilled in the elevator?

255
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,162
I'm sorry.

00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,539

257
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,874
I'm sorry.

What do you mean, you'll go now?

00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,010
You need to hang in there for Nari's sake.

263
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:29,553
No.

264
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,725
An embarrassing dad like me
is better off dead anyway.

265
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,146
Get it together.

266
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,856
Aren't you going to go back to Nari?

[grunts, breathing heavily]

268
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:44,944
I'll disinfect it first.

00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,863
-This will hurt.
-No, no! Don't do it.

273
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,331
No, don't do it!

Are you crazy?
[wheezing]

275
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,377
Don't you want to go out
when the rescue team comes?

276
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,254
If we move you and your leg gets twisted,
you'll have a massive bleed.

277
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,840
Do you want to die on the way
to the hospital after being rescued?

00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,135
No.

279

Help me. Please help me.

Please hang in there a bit more.
