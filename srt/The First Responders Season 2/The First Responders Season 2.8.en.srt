was it?

But the strange thing about these guys

164
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,820
is that the top three members,
from Number One to Number Three,

165
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,512
have completely blank information.

166
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,593
[Mr. Baek]
A newly-formed gang with no known lineage.

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,603
Ha Joongsik, the undercover detective,

168
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,563
was assigned to identify
the three top members.

169
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,190
[Mr. Baek sighs]

170
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,285
Wait, they managed to consolidate
loan sharking on Taewon's side too?

171
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,527
Yes.

172
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,239
I know a guy
in the Taewon loan sharking circle.

173
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,910
Ms. Woo is coming soon,
so conduct a thorough on-site inspection.

174
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,036
[Pil] Yes, sir.

175
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,996
Be careful.

176
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,332
[Mr. Baek]
Detective Ha seems to have been killed

177
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,169
while investigating the leading trio
of the Beomdongyeong faction.

178
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:13,381
I'll dig into it a bit more.

179
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,567
[Hogae] Sir, keep a low profile
and move as quietly as possible.

180
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,218
They can't find out that we made it out.

181
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:19,762
Also, Prosecutor Park Hongjun
is currently on trial

182
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,405
for the Chinese restaurant murder case.

183
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,140
Find out which courtroom they're in.

184
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,600
[Mr. Baek] Got it.

185
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,436
[lawyer] Can you tell us
about the day of the incident?

186
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,315
He suddenly collapsed
around the time we were done eating.

187
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,110
I was taken aback,

188
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,947
so I followed what I'd seen on TV
and performed CPR.

189
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,824
- CPR?
- He performed CPR?

190
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,493
- But he wasn't breathing.
- [attendees murmuring]

191
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,161
[lawyer] We also have testimony

192
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,014
from the Chinese restaurant staff
at the scene.

193

[♪ suspenseful music playing]

[gangster sighs deeply]

197
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,986
What brings you to my humble abode?

198
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,864
You put on such a dramatic performance

199
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,782
to nab me, didn't you?

200
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:25,453
I went very easy on you.

201
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,624
You must've come here for a reason.

202
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,710
And yet you came empty-handed?

203
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,050
- Stop smirking, you bastard.
- [♪ intense music playing]

204
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,844
My guys' lives are on the line here.

205
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,556
Want to see if you can survive
being chewed up by Polar Bear?

206
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,641
All right.

207
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,478
I was just joking.

208
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,568
[Seol] What are you doing?

209
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,155
Pass me that water bottle.

210
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,204
I'll pay back what I owe you.

211
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,247
Is it red or blue again?

212
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,208
No.

213
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,669
It's a bit risky this time,
so I'm going to use a different approach.

214
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,298
[♪ tense music playing]

215
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,675
- Are you okay?
- [inhales sharply]

216
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,761
Gosh, why does this keep happening?

217
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,972
[inhales sharply]

218
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,075
My nose has been running,
and now I'm getting a nosebleed.

219
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,519
How did you hurt your head earlier?

220
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,730
[Kang Doha]
I bumped it slightly due to the explosion.

221
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,023
Hold on a moment.

222
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,310
[Seol] It's not just a runny nose.
The fluid is too thin.

223
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,949
It could be cerebrospinal fluid.

224
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,994
It means there might be
cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea.

225
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:50,996
[sniffs]
What's that?

226
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,666
It's when the protective fluid
around the brain leaks.

227
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,334
You need to go to the hospital.

228
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,961
Give me 20 minutes.

229
00:13:57,044 --> 00:14:00,214
No, 10 minutes,
and we'll head to the hospital.

230
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,466
Can you help me?

231
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:05,957
There's a wireless signal receiver
inside his left thigh.

232
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,640
Could you make an incision to expose it?

233
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,738
[gangster] All right,
I'll explain the lineage.

234
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:27,658
The top three leaders
of the Beomdongyeong faction.

235
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,660
Their real names are unknown.

236
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:31,161
Number One is the Chairman,

237
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:34,456
and the rest are simply referred to
as Number Two and Three.

238
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,295
[gangster] Number One is dead.
[inhales deeply]

239
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,922
Now…

240
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,719
we're left with Numbers Two and Three.

241
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,845
[exhales deeply]

242
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:52,725
These greedy guys
fought for control of the organization.

243
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:58,272
One of them killed the top boss.

244
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,356
[scornful chuckle]

245
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,652
Those power-hungry rats
love a good succession fight.

246
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,282
- [chuckles]
- But since their faces are unknown,

247
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:12,786
the police didn't realize
the dead guy was the gang leader

248
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,914
and he was classified
as an ordinary victim.

249
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,500
And Number Two got pinned
as the murderer and got arrested.

250
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,294
That worked out nicely.

251
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,587
[gangster] No, it didn't.

252
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,466
Number Two hired a lawyer
and claims he's innocent.

253
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,551
The gang is watching the trial closely.

254
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,473
There was a gang fight
at the junkyard not long ago.

255
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,142
Number Two's guys

256
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,353
were up against Number Three's crew.

257
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:41,023
[Mr. Baek] Detective Ha Joongsik
was investigating Number One's death.

258
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,359
My boss is innocent!

259
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,111
Innocent? After killing someone?

260
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,196
[both grunting]

261
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,281
[Mr. Baek] One of them definitely did it.

262
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,951
So we don't know…

263
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,954
which one yet.

264
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,413
[gangster] What's for sure is…

265
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,540
That the killer goes to prison,

266
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,085
and the survivor takes the throne?

267
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,546
He was like a father to me.

268
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,007
[Youngdoo] We just had a meal together.

269
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,387
These people here have heard my story

270
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,639
and come to support me.

271
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,016
The prosecutor is after an innocent man!

272
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,786
[attendee] Just being at the scene
doesn't make us all murderers!

[attendees clamoring]

276
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,383
[judge] We have a witness statement
requested by the prosecution.

277
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,616
We'll go into recess,

278
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,827
and once the witness testimony
is complete,

279

we'll proceed with the verdict.

Appraisal results Enclosed

284
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,413
[Mr. Baek] The dead guy
was the Beomdongyeong faction leader,

285
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,606
and the guy in the defendant's seat
is Number Two.

286
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,960
That's right. They wouldn't do this
to get an ordinary guy out.

287
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,528
[Mr. Baek] If Number Two gets convicted
and sent to prison,

288
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,196
his life will be done.

289

They won't let a traitor off the hook.

290
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,343
He'll fight tooth and nail
to be found not guilty.

291
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,994
But there's one more variable.

292
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,372
If Number Two goes to prison,
Number Three will become chairman.

293

[Hogae] If Ms. Yun gives false testimony,
they'll try to silence her.

[Mr. Baek] Silence her?

they're going to kill her too?

00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,716
He pleaded so desperately.

322
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,760
- You bastards.
- [blackmailer giggles over phone]

323
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:57,845
Hey.

324
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,968
- [blackmailer laughs over phone]
- We'll meet soon.

325
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,435
They found out about the CCTV. Get out.

326
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,159
We're almost there. Just a little longer.

327
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,705
[Kang Doha] Only expose the circuit board.

328
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,529
Don't touch the wires.

329
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,447
Okay.

330
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,117
I still have the skills
of a physician assistant.

331
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,054
Physician Assistant: A nurse who assists
in surgeries in the operating room

332
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,414
What could be used as forceps?

333
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,001
[♪ tense music playing]

334
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,147
Got it. Now what do we do?

335
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,941
We'll create an EMP generator.

336
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:56,695
It emits a powerful electromagnetic pulse
that fries electronic circuits.

337
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,733
It should be able to fry
a circuit board of that size.

338
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,494
If the board gets damaged,
it won't receive signals.

339
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,687
[Hongjun] I request Yun Hong from the NFS,

340
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,671
the medical examiner
who conducted the autopsy,

341
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,256
as a witness.

342
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,645
Ms. Yun?

343
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,899
[♪ tense music playing]

344
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,408
Defendant

345
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:51,142
"I solemnly swear that
I will tell the truth, the whole truth,

346
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,794
and nothing but the truth,
and agree to receive punishment

347
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,618
in accordance with perjury
should there be any falsehood."

348
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,473
Please explain the autopsy procedure
for the victim.

349
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:10,269
There were no notable external injuries
on the victim's body.

350
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,664
[Hong] So I thoroughly examined
the heart and the brain

351
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,856
and considered
the possibility of sudden death

352
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,525
caused by heart or brain hemorrhage.

353
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,193
[Hong] No anomalies in the heart.

354
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,113
[Hong] However, there were
no significant abnormalities

355
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,991
in either the heart or the brain
that could have caused sudden death.

356
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,910
In fact, a potential clue
for the cause of death

357
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,370
came from another area.

358
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,961
During the autopsy,
I found red microfibers

359
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,130
in the victim's oral and nasal cavities.

360
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:43,593
Since the oral and nasal cavities
are essential for human respiration,

361
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,097
any foreign substance found there
must be traced back to its source.

362
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:50,076
[Hong] As a result, a secondary
on-site inspection was conducted

363
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,768
under the direction of the NFS,

364
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:56,189
where we discovered a cushion
comprised of similar-colored fibers.

365
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,737
[Hong] A comparative analysis

366
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,657
of these two fibers was performed
at the NFS's Trace Research Lab,

367
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,785
and the results came out
around 11:50 a.m. today.

368
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,961
If these two fibers match,

369
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,340
it cannot be ruled out that the defendant
induced the victim's suffocation

370
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,634
by covering their nose and mouth
with the cushion,

371
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,404
resulting in asphyxia
by airway obstruction.

372
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:29,639

presented by the prosecution in this case,

442
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:33,818
there's not enough
objective and reasonable suspicion

443

00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:20,232
…once in my life.

645
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,193
Right, but you see,

646
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:25,112
the transplantation process
is managed by the government.

647
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,883
The allocation depends on
when you enter the transplant program

648
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,116
and the severity…

649
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,036
There must be someone in charge of that.

650
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:34,538
Give them a bribe if needed.

651
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,982
[Chiyoung] These days,
everything is done through computers.

652
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,751
I'll look into it.

653
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:42,546
[Taehwa] Attorney Yang.

654
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,716
Come here.

655
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,764
[Chiyoung] Yes, sir.

656
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:57,228
[Taehwa] You need to do well.

657
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,688
You understand, right?

658
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,732
Yes, sir.

659
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,734
30 billion won.

660
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:08,280
You think I gave you that money…

661
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,742
just to stand in line?

662
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,702
[Taehwa coughs]

663
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,621
No, sir.

664
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,835
What about the pager?

665
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,295
Did you get one?

666
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,005
[Chiyoung] Yes, sir.

667
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,007

What the…

673
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,136
I kept the promise.

674
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,306
You go first. I'll stay here with him.

675
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,724
What are you saying?

676
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,477
Don't waste your time here.
Go and catch the culprit.

677
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,621
And make sure to head home after.

678
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:22,813
[sighs]

679
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,191
I'll see you after work.

680
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,361
Dismantle that bomb
and get her out of here.

681
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:30,946
[Hogae] I'll be going.

682
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,357
I heard you got a nosebleed.
Are you already discharged?

683
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,036
It wasn't a nosebleed.

684
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,954
[Kang Doha] It was… Darn it.
[clicks tongue]

685
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:42,333
And conservative treatment
doesn't require hospitalization.

686
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,503
Anyway, I heard this place is close

687
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,505
to the police station
and the fire station,

688
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,964
so it's really safe.

689
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:51,217
It's a complete package
of disaster and crime.

690
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,236
What are you looking at? Go.
There are no vacant rooms.

691
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,345
What are you talking about?

692
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,697
[Kang Doha] I got permission from Anna.

693
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,518
Who else would she hand over
Dojin's old apartment to?

694
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:05,272
[smacks lips, sighs deeply]

695
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,149
What's with that pressure cooker?

696
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,234
[Kang Doha] Right.

697
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,402
This guy's really good at cooking rice.

698
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:12,530
But you little punk.

699
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,740
You still lied to those scumbags

700
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,575
knowing I'm handcuffed and tied up.

701
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,826
Do you see the serial number?

702
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,371
No, I don't.

703
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,706
You have to bear that much

704
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:24,959
to fool these guys.

705
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,202
- Anyway, you crazy son of a…
- [footsteps approaching]

706
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,214
- You're here.
- Yes.

707
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,507
[Hogae] "You're here"?

708
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,842
You knew he was coming?

709
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,511
Yes. Anna told me.

710
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:36,971
[Hogae] Jeez.

711
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,391
I'm also a resident on the eighth floor,
and you discussed it without me.

712
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,059
Hold on a second.

713
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,104
The NFS is next to the police station,
which is next to the fire station.

714
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,313
We're invincible.

715
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,066
If the NFS is involved, it's a big case.
Invincible, my foot.

716
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:50,818
The three of us should try

717
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:53,904
not to get involved with one another
for the sake of world peace.

718
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:55,588
[Kang Doha] For the sake of world peace,

719
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,366
I'll go in first.

720
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,159
[Seol] Bye.

It's nothing.

732
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,343
I made it home in one piece.
You said we'd see each other after work.

733
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:02,806
It's great to catch criminals,
but don't get hurt.

734
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:07,603
[Hogae] Watch out for yourself
and don't do anything dangerous.

735
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,521
I was worried.

736
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,608
[Seol] You called me for an SOS.

737
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:15,819
That's because you catch onto things well.

738
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,489
By the way, you don't look well.
Is something wrong?

739
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,367
A lot happened today.

740
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,536
There was a search and seizure
at the fire station too.

- Hello?

00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,296
A real-time rescue request?

745
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,900

00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,519
Ms. Woo, was the location
of the cell phone traced?

751
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,148
We confirmed it up to Gyemu-dong,
but it's difficult beyond that.

[Mr. Baek] Yes, this is Taewon Police.

Can you tell us where you are right now?

Hey, we need to know where you are.

But I don't remember anything after that.

There's a motel village in Gyemu-dong.
But there are over dozens of motels.

How's your physical condition right now?

768
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,566
Can you get on a video call?

[Hogae] Yes.

774
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:56,003
What's that? Is that blood?

775
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,839
What? He's bleeding a lot.

776
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,632
We need to find him quickly.

777
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:04,094
We need to locate you.
Show us the space you're in.

[Samsoon] Not yet.

788
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,500
There are too many motels.

789
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,877
It's a kingdom of infidelity.

790
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
Here. Zoom in.

791
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,764
I found it! Udadak Chicken.

792
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:51,975
It's 02-9282-8282.

Hello, this is Udadak Chicken.

00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:55,854
This is the police.

795
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:57,999
There's a motel where you placed
promotional tissues, right?

796
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,024
Pardon?

797
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,151
We placed them in a lot of motels.

798
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,390
I'll send you a photo right now.

What should I do?

00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,578
I'm dying.

803
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,373
I'm dying here.

804
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:18,669
Save me.

805
00:47:18,752 --> 00:47:20,379
Please calm down, Mr. Yang Chiyoung.

806

It's attached to me.

There's a button too.

There's something stuck on my back!

817
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,848
- [Chiyoung] What's this?
- An epidural catheter

818
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,998
connected to the spine.

819
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,791
- What's that?
- It's a painkiller

820
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,418
connected through epidural anesthesia.

821
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,837
[Seol] Think of it
as an epidural for childbirth.

822
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,880
When you press the button, the painkiller
is administered through the vein.

823
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,718
That's an epidural injection.
Try pressing...

824
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,028
- Wait a minute!
- [Pil] What is it?

825
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,612
[Hogae] Are you sure it's a painkiller?

826
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:12,306
What if he loses consciousness?

827
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,475
He would lose consciousness
in extreme pain anyway.

828

It's a motel in Gyemu-dong.

it's Yeonok Motel. It's Yeonok Motel.

Hello.

Nice to meet you. I'm Detective Jin Hogae

I'm Kongmyeong Pil.

[Sejin] Let's get started.

Even at this moment,
all the tissues of the body

are gradually decomposing and decaying.

It hasn't even been a day since his death…

[Sejin] Decomposition is both a friend…

907
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:58,967
and an enemy of the autopsy.

But not for living people.

I'm sorry. I was too short-sighted.

960
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,598
I told you
to only think about a year from now.

961
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,726
That one year will turn into two,

Dex.

I'm Song Seol, a paramedic

[Sejin] You were a bit aggressive
with the hemostasis.

[Seol]
Gauze alone wouldn't stop the bleeding,

to minimize blood loss during CPR.
