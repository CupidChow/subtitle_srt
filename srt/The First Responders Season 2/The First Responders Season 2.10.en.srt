Do you think you can find something through the autopsy?

Yes.

[Sejin] No. Actually, Mr. Ma's state of decay was quite well-maintained.

86
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,995
In deep soil, the oxygen supply is cut off,

which slows down the rate of decay.

What about the home CCTV footage?

216
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,418
That footage was the smoking gun,

217
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,837
which changed it into a case of sudden death.

218
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,133
The CCTV caught the moment of death.

219
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,760
No one can touch that case. It's definitely a natural death.

That's what you think.

No, the moment of death is clearly recorded.

[Hogae] Assemblyman Ma Joongdo.

232
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,056
October 7, 2022, 9:00 a.m.

233
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,393
Found dead at home on his couch.

234
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:59,236
At the time, only Assemblyman Ma and the housemaid were at home.

235
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:02,198
The entire house was equipped with CCTV,

236
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:05,951
so the events of the day were thoroughly recorded.

237
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,256
One hour before his death,

238
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,345
the housemaid prepared beef bone soup for breakfast as usual.

239
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,398
On the day of his death,

240
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,693
both the housemaid and Assemblyman Ma consumed the same food.

241
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,864
Thus, poisoning by food toxins can be ruled out.

Moments after the meal until his death were thoroughly captured,

00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,457
so possibilities of external intrusion or forced homicide

245
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,917
can be ruled out.

This is a satellite communication antenna used for military purposes.

We're going to modify it to create an Internet bypass network.

we can even receive air traffic control signals.

The darknet is where all sorts of crazy people from around the world lurk.

Professor, something seems strange.

295
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,279
This salt isn't just a single component.

296
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,782
One is salt, but what's the other one?

297
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,409
[examiner] It's potassium.

298
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,329
That's why it wasn't salty. I tasted it.

299
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,832
He added salt eight times to his soup.

300
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:48,877
Crystallized potassium will look like salt on the outside,

301
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,420
but because it lacked the salty flavor,

302
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,882
he must have added a lot more to his soup than usual.

303
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,762
What does potassium mixed in with salt do to the body?

304
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,181
If you consume more than a lethal dose of salt,

305
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,183
it creates an electrolyte imbalance.

306
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,520
Young people might be able to balance it out

307
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,188
by drinking water or other means.

308
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,316
But for an elderly person with cirrhosis and renal failure,

309
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:12,734
it could have been difficult.

310
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,863
So you're saying it could cause death, right?

311
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,158
The lethal dose of salt for adults is around one ounce,

312
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,577
which is about four teaspoons.

313
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,538
Even though it's measured in blood concentration,

314
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,916
consuming slightly more salt than usual in daily meals

315
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,793
could potentially lead to death.

316
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,337
[Sejin] Furthermore, even after death,

317
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,048
potassium continues to be broken down by enzymes in the blood.

318
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:37,509
So even if an autopsy had been performed at the time,

319
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:41,221
it would have been hard to detect abnormalities in blood potassium levels.

320
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,766
Which is why the murder weapon was left behind.

321
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,436
Because neither potassium nor salt alone

322
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,314
is a murder weapon.

323
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,359
[Sejin] The victim being an elderly man with underlying conditions

324
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,570
of renal failure and cardiac disease.

325
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,947
You'd need all three factors in a perfect combination

326
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,908
for death to occur.

327
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:05,287
In other words, the victim's age and underlying conditions

328
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,248
also played a role in making the murder feasible.

329
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,377
It must have taken at least a week or more.

330

It shows persistence and meticulous planning.

331

It's not that meticulously planned.

00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,889
A critical mistake was made,

334
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,141

No.

Yes.

00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:53,228
[Seol] I'm not sure. I'll eventually get over it.

347
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,356
Do you take the elevator elsewhere or is it just here that you can't take it?

00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,114
Can you help me?

349
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,624
Let's take the elevator together.

350
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,047
Shall we?

351
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,644
It's okay.

Next time.

00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,941
We can take the stairs.

Yes.

Once an organ like the kidney deteriorates, there's no reversing it.

We want to request an inspection of an item from the scene of a fire.

Okay, we'll send them now.

Okay.

470
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,803
She'll be summoned in two hours. Will there be enough time?

471
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,388
We have to make it work no matter what.

472
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,436
Hello.

473
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,021
You're Ms. Han Sookja who used to work

474
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,023
as a housemaid at Assemblyman Ma's house, right?

475
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,233
-Yes. -Right.

476
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:38,485
It's heavy.

477
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,820
-Who are you? -We're the police.

478
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:48,036
I filled the salt container on the dining table

479
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,663
when it looked like it was going to run out.

480
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,583
He always had soup in the mornings,

481
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:56,294
and he got angry whenever he saw the salt that hardened.

482
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,297
Do you happen to remember when you bought this salt?

483
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,174
Oh…

484
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:02,592
I think…

485
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,930
it was about a week before he passed away.

486
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,724
[helper] It was a gift that came in the mail.

487
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,768
It seemed expensive, so I added it in.

488
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,397
Where did the package come from?

489
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,526
Hmm…

490
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,027
[Hogae] There it is.

491
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,571
It was delivered to Assemblyman Ma's residence on September 30.

492
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,949
But there's nothing sent from the US.

493
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,493
I've checked the surrounding dates, but there's nothing.

494
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,579
The housemaid mentioned receiving a package from the US.

495
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,748
There's no record of any overseas package.

496
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,500
[inhales sharply]

497
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,253
It couldn't have been added in between.

498
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,712
It's strange.

499
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,339
Who made the delivery that day?

500
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,425
Deliverymen keep quitting abruptly, so I need to look it up.

501
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,552
Give me a moment.

502
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,972
Found it. Park Youngjun.

503
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:52,016
He's the punk who quit after being absent without notice.

504
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,978
Do you have any personnel records?

505
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,188
If the delivery vehicle had an accident and the delivery guy fled,

506
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,065
it would cause us a lot of trouble.

507
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,942
So we make copies of the driver's license just in case.

508
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,026
Let me take a look at it.

509
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,695
Okay. Just a moment.

510
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,868
This driver's license has a fake address and resident registration number.

511
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,911
-I don't care who that guy is. -Excuse me?

512
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,038
What he did with this fake license is more important.

513
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,832
Ms. Woo, do me a favor.

514
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,753
You don't need to worry too much.

515
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,715
Intentional dereliction of duties won't be acknowledged.

516
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,217
We've already coordinated with the higher-ups.

517
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,597
Did I mishear?

518
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,473
Coordinated with the higher-ups for what?

519
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,934
[Mr. Baek] Are you shooting a romance drama

520
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,728
instead of investigating?

521
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,022
Who are you?

522
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,733
I'm Detective Baek Cham, the team leader at Taewon Police Station.

523
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,068
Since the busy prosecutor was coming in person,

524
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,946
I took the time to come as well.

525
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:49,282
Well, the investigation was just a formality

526
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,993
and it's over, so I think we're done here.

527
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,164
You shouldn't be conducting an investigation as a formality.

528
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,919
What are you doing?

529
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:03,755
What matters is not whether or not Chief Dokgo Soon has committed

530
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,882
intentional dereliction of duties.

531
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,638
Here are the statements

532
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,973
from the firefighters who responded to the shantytown fire

533
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,100
ten years ago.

534
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,813
The common point is that the soles of their fire-fighting shoes were burnt.

535
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,942
-So what? -"So what?"

536
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:27,695
We managed to retrieve a pair that were worn back then,

537
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,323
and they're currently being examined by the NFS.

538
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,951
What do you mean by examined?

539
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,870
Let's find out together once the report is in.

540
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,497
It should be here any minute.

541
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,957
[knocks on door]

542
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,583
Come in.

543
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,758
[Kisoo] Here's the report on the chemical analysis of the residue

544
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,344
left on the soles of the thermally decomposed fire-fighting shoes.

545
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,056
Flammable liquids such as toluene and xylene

546
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,475
were detected in the residue.

547
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,770
Flammable liquids?

548
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,898
Most of them were consumed by the fire,

549
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,734
but traces of the liquids remained on the soles of the shoes.

550
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,946
The fact that all the firefighters' shoes were burnt…

551
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,621
indicates that a wide area of the floor

552
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:22,125
was sprayed with a flammable liquid accelerant

553
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,335
since liquid flows on the floor.

554
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,879
So what does this mean?

555
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:28,589
The presence of flammable liquid residue

556
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,092
in the remains of combustion

557
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,387
serves as direct evidence of arson.

558
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,768
What are you trying to pull?

559
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,311
I'm warning you.

560
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,064
I don't know who the higher-ups you're kissing up to,

561
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,900
I mean, the higher-ups you coordinated with are.

562
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,070
[Mr. Baek] But the fact that the shantytown fire was an arson case

563
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,197
can no longer be concealed.

564
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,033
You won't be able to conceal it.

565
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,004
The situation has become quite complicated.

566
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,297
What?

567
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,674
You were supposed to only scare them.

568
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:13,092
Why did you complicate things?

569
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:15,928
Where is this guy from?

00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,556

You're violating human rights here.

Lieutenant Jin Hogae, right? I will not tolerate what happened today.

Good.

578
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,077
I know someone there.

579
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,414
It's not just any connection.

580
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,166
It's an ill-fated one.

581
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,711
They rented a car with a forged driver's license.

582
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,340
The date of Attorney Yang's death is within the rental period.

583
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,675
Darn it. We went through so much trouble to find the car that day.

584
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,511
What kind of car is it, exactly?

585
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:59,222
These guys are seriously insane.

586
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,224
[Samsoon] They rented two hearses.

587
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,601
That's why we couldn't find anything with the ambulances.

588
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,187
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

589
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:12,735
They're making us waste our time.

590
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:15,029
I'm starting to feel bitter.

591
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,697
Send us the rental car company's address.

592
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:17,949
-Step on it. -Yes, sir.

593
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,579
Yes. This is our hearse.

594
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,248
Okay.

595
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,875
Rental cars have GPS trackers on them.

596
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,293
Can we see the operation records?

597
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,839
But this customer requested to have the GPS tracker removed

598
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,298
in exchange for paying more,

599
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,551
so the record shows that it wasn't attached.

600
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,846
What? Then let us see the payment record.

601
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,307
They paid in cash, so I gave them a discount.

602
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,310
[Pil] So, there's no credit card record?

603
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,688
No.

604
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,565
So if a customer asks for it, you remove the GPS tracker?

605
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:54,193
You run your business with extraordinary trust and confidence in people.

606
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,279
There are thousands of rental car thefts every year.

607
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,447
Yes. Well, that's true.

608
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,908
You give discounts if they pay in cash.

609
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,411
Yes, that's right.

610
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,620
Why do you give discounts?

611
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,291
What? What do you mean?

00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,501
Because I am grateful?

A backup system?

Yes. Sometimes customers remove the GPS tracker,

00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,763
At a convenience store near Mapyeong IC.

660

-I'll go with you. -No, I'll go alone.

661
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,144
He was my junior. I'll go quietly and bring him in.

662
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,354
If we ambush him, he might resist and we might get hurt.

Hey, Jindo Dog!

666
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,291
We got the location of the body bomb delivery guy.

667
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:57,460
-What about Ma Taehwa? -I've got his location, too.

668
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,837
You better catch the guy with your life on the line this time.

669
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,005
Don't worry.

670
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:04,467
I'll make up for losing Ma Taehwa with this.

671
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,386
All right, Batter Moon of the RIU.

672

When you catch that jerk, handcuff him. Don't hit him.

By the way, it's nice to work together like this again.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Okay.

00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,317
Have him send us a recent project before we strike a deal.

-We'll need to verify it. -Yes.

Okay.
