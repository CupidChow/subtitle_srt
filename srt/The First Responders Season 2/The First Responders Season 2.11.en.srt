[Soon] Oh.

171
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,809
I wanted to find the cause
of the shantytown fire,

172
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,644
although it may be hard
to find out the truth.

173
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,730
Taewon's serial arsonist
may have been caught,

174
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,940
but not the culprit
of the shantytown fire.

175
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,444
[sucks teeth]
If I let this get swept under the rug,

176
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,364
I won't be able to face Dojin.

177
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,076
-I'll help you.
-You will?

178
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,037
I'll head inside soon.

179
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,249
This is a collection
of all the news footage

180
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,336
that was recorded at the scene
during the shantytown fire.

181
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,754
There's so much.

182
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,924
Cameras from all the news stations
in Seoul were there.

183
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,510
It took 12 hours to address the situation.

184
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,512
So what should we do now?

185
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,348
If the shantytown fire was arson,

186
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,142
the arsonist wouldn't have left the scene.

187
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:34,230
Since the goal was to scare away
the residents who lived there,

188
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,399
they wouldn't have left
until they accomplished their goal.

189
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,319
Then they would have been caught
on the cameras.

190

[♪ exciting music playing]

191

That's just my guess right now.

192
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,245
[Soon] It'll take a while to go through
every single one of these.

193
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,790
There's no guarantee
that the arsonist was caught on camera.

194
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,792
It won't be considered official work,

195
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,044
and we'll have to head out
for any dispatches.

196
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,423
[Kisoo]
Then we can just come back and watch them.

197
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,051
We have to catch the arsonist, don't we?

198
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,344
Is anyone against it?

199
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:06,595
[firefighters] No!

What did you do?

225
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,481
The headache is the aftereffect

[Dex] You'll feel better soon.

[Dex] You've heard of
bone-conduction earphones, right?

00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:55,496
It's just relaying electricity

Jeez, you should let me

00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:14,723
I put an electrolytic condenser
in the earphone's battery.

237
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,601
That just means I can induce
an electrical discharge.

238
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,773
I set it to the most dangerous frequency
for the human body at 60 c/s.

239
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:26,360
More than 100 volts and you'll die.

00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,197
Electric currents flow better
in the blood vessel-rich mucous membrane.

[breathes heavily]

242
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:34,535
[Dex] In your case,
the currents flow through your body,

243
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,787
so it'll be a clean death

244
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,747
without any entry or exit marks.

245
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,040
Entry and exit mark: Traces of current
entering and leaving the body

246
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,460
So you'll die immediately
without any evidence left behind

How did you get into the NFS?

250
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,554
Han Sejin, a forensic science professor
at Aewol University.

251
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,141
From his birth registration

You killed Moon Youngsoo, didn't you?

255
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,231
I'm morally responsible,

but he had bad timing.

You and Seok Moongu
killed Yang Chiyoung, right?

258
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,238
I needed an anesthesiologist.

And also to take care of Ma Taehwa.

[Seol] Right, well,

I'll bring the documents to you.

He was stabbed so hard
that the marks were etched into the bone.

297
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,659
There were probably
a lot of puncture wounds

298
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,869

how many in total?

301
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,171
[Hong] There are currently
a total of 12 distinguishable wounds.

302
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:34,673
It shows the intent to kill him

with strong will and brutality.

304

This is a typical case of overkill.

By the way,

308
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,112
there's no damage caused by…

309
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,323
a gunshot wound, right?

310
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,492
I didn't see any direct evidence
of a bullet hitting the bone,

311
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,495
but I can't make that conclusion
because the bullet may have passed through

without hitting any bones.

313
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,041
[Hong] What's worth noting

314
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,960
is that the puncture wounds
are concentrated in the upper body.

315
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,922
And many of them were made
while facing the victim.

316
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,967
Isn't that characteristic
of an acquaintance with a grudge?

317
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,262
Yes, it's damage
typically seen in cases like that.

318

He went alone on purpose

Detective Moon

was looking for the body bomb maker
who attacked the NFS.

325
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,203
He's indeed more fit to run errands

326
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,205
than to plan bombings.

327
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,165
Someone else was the brains behind this.

328
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,585
The bomb placed
in the Next Officetel elevator,

329
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,338
the body bomb that came to the NFS,

330
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,924
and the caravan bomb yesterday

331
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,260
were all planned by one man.

332
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,513
[sucks teeth]
So each bomb was used by different people,

333
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,765
but the plan came from the same person?

334
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,852
And this man would be
Ma Taehwa's brain and mastermind.

335
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:14,481
Im Sunyeol was used to manipulate

336
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,358
Bang Pilgu's arson-suicide case.

337
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,195
And I'm sure he needed more people
to help kill Yang Chiyoung and Ma Taehwa.

338
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,905
But Mr. Baek,

339
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:24,992
there's a pattern in the bombs he makes.

340
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,869
[Kang Doha]
The elevator bomb with a level.

341
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,497
The body bomb with the sutured wires.

342
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,000
He plants devices
so the bombs would explode without fail

343
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,460
even without him being at the scene.

344
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,421
But this one is different.

345
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,964
How is it different?

346
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,675
He blew it up from a very close distance.

347
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,760
[Kang Doha] Look there.

348
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,721
It's the communication device

349
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,389
that was used
to detonate the caravan bomb.

350
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,891
What kind of product is it, you ask?

351
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,186
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

352
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,271
It's this.

353
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,482
Isn't this a toy walkie-talkie?

354
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,152
The maximum effective communication range
is less than 110 yards.

355
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:04,072
He made a sophisticated bomb
but used a toy walkie-talkie?

356
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,366
A lot of errors can occur
with this kind of product,

357
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,161
so he would have set it off
from a much closer distance.

358
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:12,622
So he was right there
during the explosion?

359
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:16,084
Ma Taehwa's mastermind
never does anything without a reason.

360
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,587
There must have been a reason
why he was close by.

361
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,547
For example…

362
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,216
to pick someone up.

363
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:27,679
That means another person was there.

364
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,391
And that's why Hogae used his gun.

365
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,436
There were no gunshot wounds found
during the autopsy.

366
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,982
So Detective Jin…

367
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,779
[Mr. Baek]
Hogae could be framed for murder.

368
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,864
Detective Jin's cell phone

369
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,700
hasn't been used since around 11 p.m.,
the time of the explosion.

370
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,786
I think it is Detective Jin's phone.

371
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,995
[Mr. Baek] When was it turned off?

372
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,206
I don't think he turned it off himself.

373
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,083
I think it stopped working
after the explosion.

374
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,126
None of the CCTVs
in the parking lot are working.
