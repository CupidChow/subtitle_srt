The characters, places, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious

2
00:00:32,952 --> 00:00:34,054
Child actors were filmed
in safe situations

3
00:00:34,078 --> 00:00:35,389
Scenes involving animals were staged

4
00:00:35,413 --> 00:00:38,013
and filmed in compliance
with applicable animal welfare guidelines

5
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:58,144
Chief.

6
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:22,043
Mmm.

7
00:01:47,235 --> 00:01:50,279
You've always taken care of me, chief.

8
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:54,367
Take care of you? I only scolded you.

9
00:02:00,248 --> 00:02:02,083
I was alone too.

10
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:05,419
Being alone…

11
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:08,047
was the easiest.

12
00:02:09,882 --> 00:02:10,883
But…

13
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,720
we don't always take the easy path.

14
00:02:18,808 --> 00:02:20,488
That's what it's like to be a firefighter.

15
00:02:28,609 --> 00:02:29,694
Take this with you

16
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:32,446
when you leave.

17
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,205
I'll go back to the station first.

18
00:02:45,585 --> 00:02:46,878
Please take your time.

00:02:52,091 --> 00:02:53,926
Public official ID Dokgo Soon

20
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:44,912
Hot Zone: A dangerous area
at the heart of an incident,

21
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:46,622
where the risks are highest.
Access is strictly controlled

22
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,105
- Climb up.
- There you go. Very good.

23
00:03:48,189 --> 00:03:49,583
- Good job.
- Put your other foot up.

24
00:03:49,607 --> 00:03:51,776
- Have some <i>sikhye.</i>
- There are persimmons too.

25
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:52,902
All right.

26
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:56,656
- Who are they?
- They're my friend's children.

27
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:57,966
They wanted a tour of the station.

28
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,368
- She's Yoonseo.
- Hello.

29
00:04:00,451 --> 00:04:02,245
- Hello.
- Say hello.

30
00:04:02,328 --> 00:04:03,621
Say hello, Yoonseo.

31
00:04:03,704 --> 00:04:07,124
- By the way, what's all this?
- They're from Chief Dokgo Soon.

32
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:08,209
I see.

33
00:04:08,668 --> 00:04:10,419
How is she? Is she okay?

34
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:12,672
We'll have to wait and see.

35
00:04:12,755 --> 00:04:15,424
Seeing that she's still taking care
of us like this,

36
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:17,028
don't you think she'll come back soon?

37
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,386
She will.

38
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,054
Once a firefighter?

39
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:22,431
Always a firefighter!

40
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:23,557
Once a firefighter?

41
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:25,393
Always a firefighter.

42
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:32,483
Huh?

43
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:33,901
What are you doing here?

44
00:04:36,195 --> 00:04:38,990
Thank you for looking after Yujung.
She'll be discharged soon.

45
00:04:39,949 --> 00:04:42,344
Fortunately, we were able to pump
her stomach quickly enough,

46
00:04:42,368 --> 00:04:43,744
and she hadn't taken a lot.

47
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:47,456
I heard that her father did it.

48
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:50,339
It doesn't seem like
he gave her a lot, though.

49
00:04:52,962 --> 00:04:54,672
So, you're back now?

50
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,299
Yes.

51
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:58,467
To let you know that I'm off work.

52
00:04:58,551 --> 00:04:59,719
That I made it back safe.

53
00:05:01,387 --> 00:05:04,056
I've said this before,
but you don't have to report back to me.

54
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,189
I thought you weren't coming back.

55
00:05:17,445 --> 00:05:19,030
Why did you come back?

56
00:05:19,613 --> 00:05:22,074
You said you would leave Taewon
when you got promoted.

57
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,867
I'm a detective.
I came back to catch the culprits.

58
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:30,374
Then I look forward to working together.

59
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:34,712
What's so good
about working cases together?

60
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:37,965
What are you doing?

61
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:40,718
I partially look forward to it.

62
00:05:42,595 --> 00:05:44,930
You said the police need cases
to get a workout.

63
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:47,683
Firefighters need reports
to get a workout.

64
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:52,688
- Hello?
- Yes, this is Song Seol.

65
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:54,732
<i>Get over here quickly.
There's a gang fight.</i>

66
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:58,110
- A gang fight?
- Many injured? Understood.

67
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:08,954
Hey, you bastard!

68
00:06:36,357 --> 00:06:38,692
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are they gangsters?

69
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,445
Don't come any closer! It's dangerous.

70
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:45,574
Jeez, they have axes. How do we stop them?

71
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,160
I have a plan.

72
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:50,162
What? A plan?

73
00:06:56,794 --> 00:06:58,254
Police, you bastards!

74
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:00,589
Myeongpil!

75
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:02,383
- Turn on the sirens.
- Turn on the sirens.

76
00:07:09,932 --> 00:07:12,077
- They're running away.
- Let's at least try to catch one of them.

77
00:07:12,101 --> 00:07:14,103
- Okay. Paramedics!
- Coming!

78
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,231
Get back here!

79
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:20,036
- Where are the injured?
- This way! Hang on, over here!

80
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,971
There's an injured person.

81
00:07:22,778 --> 00:07:23,779
Jeez, what's that?

82
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:39,920
He's already dead.

83
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:42,715
It wasn't just a fight.

84
00:07:43,716 --> 00:07:44,925
It's a murder case.

85
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:57,581
Why is the stomach like this?

86
00:07:57,605 --> 00:07:59,482
Is it full of gas,
because of decomposition?

87
00:08:02,318 --> 00:08:03,486
What's this?

88
00:08:05,112 --> 00:08:07,239
The body has been tampered with.

89
00:08:07,323 --> 00:08:10,326
It may take a while to identify him,
because of the decomposition.

90
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,120
John Does are my specialty.

91
00:08:13,913 --> 00:08:15,831
There's little you can do
this time, Ms. Woo.

92
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:18,042
There's no fingerprint
I can't lift.

93
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,939
- What the heck?
- Book an autopsy for tomorrow morning.

94
00:08:22,963 --> 00:08:24,924
- Okay.
- What time in the morning?

95
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:28,886
I'm going too. I'm up for a challenge.

96
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:30,804
This may be harder than you think.

97
00:08:32,139 --> 00:08:33,474
We'll head out first.

98
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:35,578
- We'll call you later.
- Okay.

99
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,696
Juyoung General Hospital

100
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,827
How is he?

101
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:56,121
It's acute kidney failure.

102
00:08:56,455 --> 00:08:59,416
The tissue shows damage
to the renal tubule,

103
00:09:00,626 --> 00:09:03,003
accompanied by hypercalcemia.

104
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:04,588
The creatinine level

105
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:07,007
is 88.42 umol/L higher than the average.

106
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:10,261
Signs of permanent kidney damage
are starting to appear.

107
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:11,428
Then…

108
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:13,013
what do we do?

109
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:14,431
He needs a kidney transplant

110
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:16,642
before necrosis of the renal tubule.

111
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:22,856
His stay of execution is up, so we're
moving him to the prison infirmary.

112
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,236
- Take him out.
- Wait, he's a patient.

113
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,154
Please listen to his doctor's opinion.

114
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:32,908
The patient is on emergency dialysis.

115
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:34,979
You may move him after he's done.

116
00:09:35,035 --> 00:09:36,328
This man is a murderer.

117
00:09:36,912 --> 00:09:38,122
Are you aware of that?

118
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:44,378
We'll try to finish the dialysis quickly
and get him stabilized.

119
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,839
Please wait until then.

120
00:09:57,766 --> 00:10:00,394
Yes, sir. I'm keeping a close watch.

121
00:10:00,978 --> 00:10:04,815
Don't take your eyes off Ma Taehwa
until he breathes his last breath.

122
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,484
All right. Keep it up.

123
00:10:08,902 --> 00:10:10,779
Hello.

124
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,449
Hello, Sunga.

125
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:14,950
You've gotten prettier.

126
00:10:15,034 --> 00:10:16,869
Let's eat. Please go ahead.

127
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,041
Ma Taehwa's kidneys are messed…

128
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:25,586
are not functioning.

129
00:10:27,046 --> 00:10:28,047
So it'll be any day now.

130
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,300
I don't know
if it's divine punishment,

131
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:36,347
but because of that man, I ended up…

132
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,185
putting Sunyeol away myself.

133
00:10:42,311 --> 00:10:44,855
<i>Taewon Police gave us a tip,
and yesterday,</i>

134
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,418
<i>we got the rat who stole
the lighter oil and your police shoes.</i>

135
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:49,443
<i>You know Sunyeol, right?</i>

136
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:51,362
<i>He brought a few items to Ma Taehwa</i>

137
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:53,238
- <i>in exchange for money…</i>
- Handcuffs.

138
00:10:53,322 --> 00:10:55,122
<i>…without knowing
how serious things could get.</i>

139
00:10:57,117 --> 00:10:59,119
He was probably blinded by…

140
00:11:00,704 --> 00:11:02,039
Ma Taehwa's money.

141
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,417
I'm ashamed to face you.

142
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:07,628
No, it's all right.

143
00:11:08,337 --> 00:11:11,715
Sunyeol will be released
on probation soon.

144
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:15,010
His former RIU colleagues
even wrote a petition.

145
00:11:19,306 --> 00:11:20,474
Thank you.

146
00:11:22,851 --> 00:11:26,230
Thank you so much for helping him.

147
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:30,401
It may be hard for him to return
to the police force,

148
00:11:31,193 --> 00:11:33,320
but he's a healthy man,

149
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,406
so I'm sure he can still
make a living somehow.

150
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,450
So, please,

151
00:11:39,576 --> 00:11:42,579
don't let him do such a thing again.

152
00:11:47,668 --> 00:11:49,670
All right, listen carefully.

153
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,213
Number One.

154
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:54,049
Go to math cram school after school,

155
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:56,844
study for an hour
at the study hall after that,

156
00:11:56,927 --> 00:11:58,721
and then essay writing, okay?

157
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:00,740
Did you finish
this week's assigned reading?

158
00:12:00,764 --> 00:12:02,474
No, I'm going to read it
in the study hall.

159
00:12:02,766 --> 00:12:04,268
Okay. Make sure you do.

160
00:12:04,351 --> 00:12:05,394
Number Two.

161
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,063
Go to after-school care after school

162
00:12:08,147 --> 00:12:09,773
and solve five pages of arithmetic,

163
00:12:10,107 --> 00:12:11,358
and go to English

164
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:14,069
and art cram school on time.

165
00:12:14,153 --> 00:12:15,571
Call me afterward, okay?

166
00:12:15,654 --> 00:12:17,281
We got it.

167
00:12:17,364 --> 00:12:20,909
Okay. Carry your bag properly.

168
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:23,370
All right, done. Go.

169
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,712
Number One and Two, don't move!

170
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,424
Hey, your cell phone!

171
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,636
Goodness. What time is it?

172
00:12:43,599 --> 00:12:46,685
Ms. Woo, please check the clothes
and shoes first. They're very important.

173
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,646
Detective Kong can take care of that.
I'd like to see the autopsy.

174
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,833
I need to see the autopsy
for a special case like this

175
00:12:51,857 --> 00:12:53,358
to help evaluate the evidence.

176
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:54,485
Hey.

177
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,778
Well…

178
00:12:55,861 --> 00:12:58,405
This special case's autopsy

179
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:00,741
may be a bit too gruesome,
so I'll take care of it.

180
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,452
While I was in training,

181
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:06,288
I practically lived
at the NFS for a month.

182
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,224
At that time, the bodies that came in
one after another

183
00:13:08,248 --> 00:13:10,209
were serial murders
in southwestern Gyeonggi-do.

184
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:13,003
The third corpse

185
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,506
was buried using the idea
behind a kimchi fridge

186
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:18,467
after being cut into a total of 12 pieces.

187
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:22,554
I went through and numbered
every single one of them.

188
00:13:23,722 --> 00:13:24,723
Should I continue?

189
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:25,974
This is for you.

190
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,185
Kid, take the evidence.

191
00:13:28,268 --> 00:13:30,270
Yes, ma'am. You can enter here.

192
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,816
I'll be on my way, then.

193
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:41,073
It's an unidentified body found
in a junkyard in Myeongdo-dong.

194
00:13:41,156 --> 00:13:44,576
It was at the site of a gang fight,
but we haven't found any connections yet.

195
00:13:44,868 --> 00:13:48,497
And as you can see, there are a few
distinctive marks on the body.

196
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,041
It's highly likely
that the victim is a gang member.

197
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,978
I think the mutilated body
was left on display intentionally

198
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:56,380
by the gangsters to set an example.

199
00:13:56,964 --> 00:14:00,509
- Intentionally?
- To show the tragic end of a traitor.

200
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,136
They're ruthless.

201
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:12,479
Oh, my. What is this?

202
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:13,963
It's pretty severe.

203
00:14:15,107 --> 00:14:17,943
Overall, the exterior appears
larger due to decomposition,

204
00:14:18,235 --> 00:14:19,361
and there's…

205
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,453
an 18-inch cut with sutures on the abdomen

206
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,539
and abdominal distension.

207
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:33,166
I can understand the stabbing,

208
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,168
but the sutures don't make sense.

209
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,213
And why is only the abdomen bulging?

210
00:14:38,297 --> 00:14:39,774
It may be full
of decomposition gas.

211
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:42,843
Decomposition starts with the organs
and blood in the abdomen.

212
00:14:42,926 --> 00:14:44,761
We have a lot of germs in our intestines.

213
00:14:44,845 --> 00:14:47,365
But since the abdomen was already split,
the decomposition gases

214
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,974
would escape through the sutures.

215
00:14:49,057 --> 00:14:51,685
So the abdomen
shouldn't stay so full like this.

216
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:52,808
Is there something inside?

217
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:54,438
You're quite knowledgeable.

218
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:56,690
It's a little hard.

219
00:14:57,149 --> 00:14:58,349
We'll see once we open him up.

220
00:15:03,822 --> 00:15:05,502
There are a lot of
lacerations on the scalp

221
00:15:05,574 --> 00:15:06,992
and a grating sound of bones.

222
00:15:07,618 --> 00:15:09,578
There seem to be
a lot of fractures in the skull.

223
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:12,039
Is the full body scan data ready?

224
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,310
We should use bone reconstruction to view
the fractures before we make an incision.

225
00:15:15,334 --> 00:15:18,211
We weren't able
to get a CT scan,

226
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:19,755
because the machine suddenly broke.

227
00:15:19,838 --> 00:15:23,300
They're going to repair it in the morning
and run CT scans after the autopsy.

228
00:15:23,884 --> 00:15:25,028
There's a C-arm
in the building, right?

229
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,178
Yes.

230
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:53,330
What are you guys up to?

231
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:54,623
At 1:00 p.m.,

232
00:15:54,706 --> 00:15:57,310
a deliberation committee for
a suspension of execution presided over

233
00:15:57,334 --> 00:15:59,503
by Deputy Prosecutor General
Park Dongjin will be held

234
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,810
at the East District Prosecutors' Office.

235
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,924
We barely managed to buy some time.

236
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,053
If the execution of a sentence

237
00:16:08,637 --> 00:16:11,765
prevents the preservation of life,

238
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:15,143
the prisoner's sentence is suspended.

239
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:18,939
I'm just suggesting we follow the law.

240
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:23,235
Why do you think
I'm going to take your side?

241
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:26,405
<i>Hello.</i>

242
00:16:26,738 --> 00:16:29,866
<i>It's my first time talking to you,
Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong.</i>

243
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:34,204
I knew there was
a skillful mastermind on his side.

244
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:35,330
"Mastermind"?

245
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:38,959
That's a nice nickname.

246
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:41,837
Was Ma Taehwa's acute
kidney failure your doing as well?

247
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,214
<i>I wouldn't call that a part of my plan,</i>

248
00:16:44,297 --> 00:16:47,009
<i>but Ma Taehwa's choice.</i>

249
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:51,179
There are things in the world
that you hate more than dying.

250
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,699
I don't care if he stays in the hospital
or attempts a jailbreak,

251
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:57,269
so do whatever you guys want.

252
00:17:00,063 --> 00:17:01,815
<i>A window is open.</i>

253
00:17:02,065 --> 00:17:03,692
<i>A window is open.</i>

254
00:17:04,568 --> 00:17:07,070
<i>Nowadays,
cars are walking computers.</i>

255
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,740
<i>And computers can be hacked.</i>

256
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:13,368
<i>The vehicle control system
is focused on performance,</i>

257
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:15,954
<i>so the security system is pretty lax.</i>

258
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:17,372
What the hell are you doing?

259
00:17:23,336 --> 00:17:25,630
Pick-up drug trafficking
investigation report

260
00:17:30,594 --> 00:17:33,263
This is a copy
of the drug trafficker's case files

261
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:34,681
that you personally stole

262
00:17:34,765 --> 00:17:37,184
to make Director Ma Taehwa's alibi.

263
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:39,686
<i>Make sure no one finds out</i>

264
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:41,833
<i>that I met with the chief prosecutor.</i>

265
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,067
Father. Father.

266
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:47,027
I love you!

267
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,196
It's Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong.

268
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,864
He's our living alibi.

269
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:54,034
Chief Prosecutor Jin Chuljoong
went through the hassle of finding him.

270
00:17:54,117 --> 00:17:57,245
I'll be a junkie instead of a murderer.

271
00:17:58,413 --> 00:18:00,874
It's fine that you had
Prosecutor Yeom Sanggu

272
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:03,919
take the fall and made it out alone,

273
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:07,214
but you shouldn't have left a trace.

274
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:12,761
Are you threatening me
with something as trivial as this?

275
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,501
<i>That's right.</i>

276
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:17,015
<i>That isn't enough to provoke you.</i>

277
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:21,520
No one has ever
caught on to my plan before…

278
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,940
except for one time.

279
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,443
Bang Pilgu.

280
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:31,738
The arson-suicide case.

281
00:18:31,822 --> 00:18:33,865
Ma Taehwa couldn't have done it alone.

282
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:36,886
It included fire investigation,
forensic medicine, and forensic science.

283
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:37,994
This is a professional.

284
00:18:38,078 --> 00:18:40,080
<i>You have a very talented son.</i>

285
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,582
<i>Detective Jin Hogae
from Taewon Police Station.</i>

286
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,794
<i>Is that enough to convince you?</i>

287
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,880
<i>I enjoy playing chess.</i>

288
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,093
<i>One wrong move
can ruin dozens of good ones.</i>

289
00:18:53,468 --> 00:18:55,387
<i>If you want your son alive,</i>

290
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:57,430
keep what I said in mind.

291
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,724
And please drive safely.

292
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:19,578
Taewon Fire Station

293
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:40,307
<i>That's when I promised</i>

294
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:44,227
to be the first one in
and the last one out.

295
00:19:45,854 --> 00:19:48,481
I hope you… No, I hope that we

296
00:19:48,982 --> 00:19:51,735
can work as firefighters for a long time.

297
00:19:52,068 --> 00:19:54,571
Bong Dojin. Bulldozer.

298
00:19:55,322 --> 00:19:56,323
Okay?

299
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,618
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:13,131
<i>Once a firefighter…</i>

301
00:20:14,758 --> 00:20:16,301
<i>always a firefighter.</i>

302
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,772
- Darn it. This is so annoying.
- Isn't this ridiculous?

303
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,400
I mean…

304
00:20:32,484 --> 00:20:34,164
This has to be a mistake, right?

305
00:20:34,194 --> 00:20:35,195
What are you guys up to?

306
00:20:37,113 --> 00:20:38,990
- Long time no see.
- Chief.

307
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:43,787
What's wrong? Did something happen?

308
00:20:46,122 --> 00:20:47,123
Well…

309
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:53,004
Ms. Dokgo Soon, field commander
of Taewon Fire Station?

310
00:20:53,088 --> 00:20:54,089
- Hold on, please.
- Yes?

311
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,027
- What brings you here?
- I'm here to enforce

312
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:02,305
a search and seizure
of electronic information,

313
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:07,018
mobile phone and wired
and wireless communication transcripts,

314
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:10,272
body cameras, and CCTV footage
in response to Taewon's serial arson,

315
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:12,107
Next Officetel arson,
and attempted bombing.

316
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:14,067
A search and seizure?

317
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:18,280
What did our chief do wrong
to do all this?

318
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:24,786
The serial arsonist, Yang Sangman,
was your ex-husband.

319
00:21:25,328 --> 00:21:28,415
And he called you
on the day of the incident

320
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:31,876
and arranged a meeting
on the roof of Next Officetel, correct?

321
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:34,879
Yes, that's correct.

322
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,048
Despite being able to assume

323
00:21:37,132 --> 00:21:40,844
that the serial arsonist
had knowledge of firefighting and fires,

324
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:44,347
you not only failed to inform anyone,
but went to meet Yang Sangman.

325
00:21:44,931 --> 00:21:46,558
Also, do you admit to missing

326
00:21:46,641 --> 00:21:49,686
the golden time without taking any action

327
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:54,190
despite having time to warn firefighters
and police while on the rooftop?

328
00:21:54,274 --> 00:21:58,611
How is that our chief's fault?
It's the arsonist's fault.

329
00:21:58,695 --> 00:22:00,322
You're being charged

330
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:03,450
with professional negligence
and absence without leave

331
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,287
for failing to respond appropriately
as a field commander

332
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:09,578
due to personal relations.

333
00:22:09,914 --> 00:22:11,767
- Being charged?
- What do you mean?

334
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:14,210
- Hold on.
- Please wait!

335
00:22:14,294 --> 00:22:16,254
- Move aside!
- Wait!

336
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:18,506
Shoot.

337
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,720
As expected, there are
comminuted skull fractures.

338
00:22:24,304 --> 00:22:25,972
He hasn't been identified yet, right?

339
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:27,958
No, as there were no fingerprints.

340
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,110
The last joint of every finger
was cut off with a blunt tool.

341
00:22:39,194 --> 00:22:41,905
What about the teeth? Are there any
indicators to help identify him?

342
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:45,062
Let's get a dental X-ray.

343
00:22:48,036 --> 00:22:49,037
Shoot.

344
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,541
They ground all the teeth down.

345
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,087
In addition, number 25 on the upper jaw

346
00:22:57,337 --> 00:23:00,673
and numbers 37 and 46
on the lower jaw are completely lost.

347
00:23:00,757 --> 00:23:02,175
Even his teeth?

348
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:04,403
They must have been
ones with traces of dental treatment.

349
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:07,055
You can identify someone
with their dental records.

350
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:10,725
It's an attempt to counteract
identification through forensic dentistry.

351
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:13,645
You can identify someone
with medical records.

352
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:14,896
Forceps, please.

353
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:22,431
It looks like work gloves.

354
00:23:23,863 --> 00:23:25,863
<i>It was likely left behind
while damaging the teeth.</i>

355
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:27,826
From fingerprints to the teeth,

356
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,371
the culprit worked really hard
to hide the victim's identity.

357
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,525
Let's look at the abdomen.

358
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:39,087
Shoot.

359
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:42,841
There are multiple rib fractures.

360
00:23:45,093 --> 00:23:46,094
What's this?

361
00:23:48,513 --> 00:23:50,849
- Can you zoom in and come here?
- Sure.

362
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,053
What is this?

363
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,051
There are unidentified
foreign objects in the body.

364
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:01,001
What are those things
doing in a human body?

365
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,920
Ms. Yun, have you seen
anything like that before?

366
00:24:02,944 --> 00:24:06,048
It's my first time seeing this
in my seven years of performing autopsies.

367
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:08,950
Can you send a photo of this X-ray
to Mr. Kang Doha?

368
00:24:09,117 --> 00:24:10,910
I think he should have a look too.

369
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:12,203
Yes, ma'am.

370
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,668
No matter the cause,

371
00:24:18,751 --> 00:24:21,588
a human being shouldn't do this
to another human being, right?

372
00:24:21,963 --> 00:24:23,399
You can tell
the perpetrator's personality

373
00:24:23,423 --> 00:24:24,783
while performing autopsies, right?

374
00:24:24,841 --> 00:24:27,552
What do you think
about the perpetrator of this case?

375
00:24:28,845 --> 00:24:31,973
They killed and mutilated a person
for a particular purpose,

376
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:33,534
so they're meticulous and calculating.

377
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:36,978
They have the arrogant belief that
they won't get caught after doing this.

378
00:24:37,061 --> 00:24:39,689
And there's a certain level of inhumanity

379
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:42,626
in how they treat people like tools
and are insensitive to the pain of others.

380
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,152
That's what I can tell.

381
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,737
There's one more thing.

382
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,990
This isn't their first time,
and they'll do it again at any time.

383
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,174
What is this?

384
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:07,759
No!

385
00:25:13,598 --> 00:25:15,058
I can't concentrate today.

386
00:25:16,434 --> 00:25:20,522
Hello? I understand. Okay.

387
00:25:21,898 --> 00:25:23,209
That was the Trace Evidence Room.

388
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,044
Do you remember the evaluation
for Prosecutor Park Hongjun?

389
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,819
It's an emergency, and they need help.

390
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:28,821
Yes, that's pretty urgent.

391
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:30,865
Can you two help them finish up?

392
00:25:31,574 --> 00:25:32,700
Yes, ma'am.

393
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:44,379
I'll have to cut these
if I want to make an incision.

394
00:26:03,398 --> 00:26:05,525
No, Hong! Don't touch it!

395
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:25,753
- Didn't you hear something just now?
- What was that?

396
00:26:26,462 --> 00:26:27,982
I think it came from the autopsy room.

397
00:26:28,047 --> 00:26:29,465
Check on Ms. Yun first.

398
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:30,925
Ms. Yun, are you okay?

399
00:26:32,719 --> 00:26:33,928
She's unconscious!

400
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:41,404
Everything in the stomach
was glass marbles.

401
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,485
She's bleeding from her head and hand.

402
00:26:49,736 --> 00:26:50,820
Please call for help first!

403
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:52,905
Unknown caller

404
00:26:53,823 --> 00:26:55,074
Restricted number

405
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:04,917
- Hello?
<i>- Put me on speaker.</i>

406
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,687
- Who…
- Who are you?

407
00:27:06,711 --> 00:27:08,713
<i>I said put me on speaker.</i>

408
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:11,507
<i>You're being blackmailed right now.</i>

409
00:27:14,636 --> 00:27:16,596
<i>Second order to follow.</i>

410
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:18,139
<i>From this point on,</i>

411
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,768
<i>no one can leave or enter
without my permission.</i>

412
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:22,894
<i>That's not hard, right?</i>

413
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,898
<i>If you don't listen to me,
this whole place will blow up.</i>

414
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,276
<i>Don't you understand?</i>

415
00:27:30,693 --> 00:27:31,694
<i>I told you.</i>

416
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,739
<i>No one is allowed to leave,
enter, or call anyone!</i>

417
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:37,033
They're watching us.

418
00:27:39,702 --> 00:27:40,703
Who are you?

419
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:43,164
<i>The person who planted
the bomb in the corpse.</i>

420
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:44,582
It exploded just now.

421
00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:46,834
<i>Who said there was only one bomb?</i>

422
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:48,670
<i>Check for yourself.</i>

423
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:00,014
Is it true?

424
00:28:05,812 --> 00:28:07,230
It's a homemade bomb.

425
00:28:08,439 --> 00:28:09,649
A detonator and explosive.

426
00:28:10,191 --> 00:28:12,391
They knew we'd cut the wires first,
so they planted two.

427
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:14,487
With this amount of explosives,

428
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:16,572
the glass marble explosion
pales in comparison.

429
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:18,717
<i>You're familiar
with body bombs, right?</i>

430
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,535
<i>Bombs planted within a body.</i>

431
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:22,731
What did you use as an explosive?

432
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:24,831
- <i>ANFO.</i>
- What is that?

433
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:27,625
Do you remember
the Port of Beirut explosion in 2020?

434
00:28:27,709 --> 00:28:31,129
The warehouse that exploded
contained ammonium nitrate,

435
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:32,964
<i>the main component of ANFO.</i>

436
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,299
As expected of an expert.

437
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:38,469
I'll give you a rundown of the situation,
so listen carefully.

438
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:40,722
Seventeen people in the autopsy wing.

439
00:28:40,805 --> 00:28:42,348
Forty-five others on different floors.

440
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,268
If it explodes, 17 people die immediately

441
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:47,311
while the remaining
suffer serious injuries.

442
00:28:51,065 --> 00:28:53,151
I guess that's the number of casualties.

443
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:54,360
But how unfortunate.

444
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:56,829
<i>If your bodies explode
into a million pieces,</i>

445
00:28:57,405 --> 00:28:59,657
<i>will you be able to identify who's who?</i>

446
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:06,622
So don't just stand around dumbstruck.

447
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,708
<i>Mr. Kang Doha,</i>

448
00:29:09,375 --> 00:29:11,252
<i>check the left thigh.</i>

449
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,769
This seems to be a circuit
from inside a pager.

450
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:29,395
Antenna coil.

451
00:29:30,146 --> 00:29:31,426
It's a wireless signal receiver.

452
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:33,375
Wireless signal receiver:
A hardware that receives wireless signals

453
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:35,610
Just one phone call and it'll explode.

454
00:29:37,612 --> 00:29:39,781
<i>I'm so glad
that you recognize it.</i>

455
00:29:40,281 --> 00:29:42,700
If you didn't recognize it,
I was going to detonate it.

456
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:49,165
<i>Put your phones on the autopsy table
and pull down the blinds.</i>

457
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:51,667
We'll lock the doors from here.

458
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:01,736
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>

459
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:04,096
<i>Answer it, Mr. Kang Doha.</i>

460
00:30:05,306 --> 00:30:08,810
If you don't want the same disaster
in Beirut to happen at the NFS,

461
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,394
<i>be mindful of what you say.</i>

462
00:30:14,774 --> 00:30:15,775
Hello, this is Kang Doha.

463
00:30:16,776 --> 00:30:18,528
No, there was a machine malfunction.

464
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:19,612
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

465
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:22,365
But it sounded like an explosion,

466
00:30:23,074 --> 00:30:24,659
so should I head over?

467
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:25,785
No, that's all right.

468
00:30:26,369 --> 00:30:28,871
Ms. Yun is quite upset
about all the disruptions.

469
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,498
She's telling me to hang up.

470
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,875
<i>Oh, I apologize.
Please keep up the good work.</i>

471
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:37,380
<i>Well done.</i>

472
00:30:37,463 --> 00:30:39,715
- What do you want?
<i>- What do you think?</i>

473
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,760
How is Ms. Yun's condition?

474
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:45,638
You're watching us.

475
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:47,407
She's unconscious.
She needs to go to the hospital.

476
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:50,202
<i>The explosion wasn't enough
to kill anyone. Don't overreact.</i>

477
00:30:50,226 --> 00:30:51,602
<i>Wake her up.</i>

478
00:30:52,103 --> 00:30:54,897
The wounds have stopped bleeding,
but she's not waking up.

479
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,210
I think she's having trouble breathing.
What's going on?

480
00:30:58,234 --> 00:30:59,794
She's having trouble breathing.

481
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:03,197
Don't you need Ms. Yun?
Let me make a call to a paramedic.

482
00:31:03,281 --> 00:31:04,782
<i>Do as you please.</i>

483
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:06,853
<i>Whose phone are you going to use?</i>

484
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,494
Woo Samsoon?

485
00:31:08,995 --> 00:31:11,956
<i>Use Ms. Samsoon's phone.
Put it on speaker.</i>

486
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,757
There's nothing much here.

487
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:23,050
Hello, this is Song Seol.

488
00:31:23,134 --> 00:31:25,654
<i>It's your next-door neighbor.
I have an urgent question.</i>

489
00:31:27,305 --> 00:31:28,306
Detective Jin?

490
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:29,765
What's wrong?

491
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:30,850
Uh…

492
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,144
What do you do when you hurt your chest

493
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,438
and your breathing is irregular?

494
00:31:35,521 --> 00:31:37,815
You're hurt? Are you sure you're okay?

495
00:31:37,899 --> 00:31:38,900
<i>Not me, but…</i>

496
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:41,861
Can you just answer my question?
I'm in a hurry.

497
00:31:42,278 --> 00:31:44,655
Chest trauma and irregular breathing.

498
00:31:44,989 --> 00:31:46,669
So they're having trouble
breathing, right?

499
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:48,367
Yes, I believe so.

500
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:50,053
<i>When nothing is wrong
with the lungs,</i>

501
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,913
<i>the chest will swell as you breathe in</i>

502
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,706
<i>and contract as you exhale.</i>

503
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:55,583
<i>You need to check if that's the case.</i>

504
00:31:58,085 --> 00:32:01,130
It's contracting as she breathes in
and swelling as she exhales.

505
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:03,025
What if the opposite is happening?

506
00:32:03,049 --> 00:32:05,843
Then it's an emergency.
It could be tension pneumothorax.

507
00:32:05,927 --> 00:32:07,803
What if we can't get to a hospital?

508
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:11,974
If you have any sterile unused needles,
choose the thickest one.

509
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:13,184
There were needles here.

510
00:32:14,435 --> 00:32:15,436
Then what?

511
00:32:15,603 --> 00:32:18,564
<i>Put your ear to both sides of the chest
and listen to the lung sounds.</i>

512
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:20,399
<i>One side will be less clear.</i>

513
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:26,572
What next?

514
00:32:26,656 --> 00:32:28,967
<i>At a hospital, they would pierce
the upper thoracic cavity,</i>

515
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:31,231
<i>but it's dangerous
because of the vagus nerve and artery.</i>

516
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:34,914
<i>Lay the patient on one side
and after exposing the side,</i>

517
00:32:34,997 --> 00:32:38,292
<i>insert a needle
just below the seventh rib.</i>

518
00:32:38,668 --> 00:32:40,878
<i>Until it feels like you've
pierced the thoracic cavity.</i>

519
00:32:40,962 --> 00:32:44,215
<i>Then you'll hear
a small sound of air escaping.</i>

520
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:48,344
<i>Keep the needle in place
and let the air out for a few minutes.</i>

521
00:32:48,427 --> 00:32:50,930
But are you sure you're okay?
Why are you...

522
00:32:51,013 --> 00:32:52,765
Yes, I'm fine. I'll call you back later.

523
00:32:57,436 --> 00:32:59,772
What's going on?

524
00:33:06,112 --> 00:33:07,113
I'll give it a try.

525
00:33:24,547 --> 00:33:25,548
Is it done?

526
00:33:26,924 --> 00:33:28,124
I think it's done.

527
00:33:28,634 --> 00:33:30,514
I think we need
to disinfect her hand.

528
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,315
Hong, are you okay?

529
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,527
What happened?

530
00:33:47,111 --> 00:33:48,362
There was an IED explosion.

531
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:51,699
All of the round foreign objects
on the X-ray were glass marbles.

532
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:53,951
Your breathing was irregular, so…

533
00:33:54,035 --> 00:33:55,411
Hey, watch the side!

534
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:01,876
<i>Ms. Yun?</i>

535
00:34:02,376 --> 00:34:04,754
<i>I believe we have something to discuss.</i>

536
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,800
- Move out of the way.
- What?

537
00:34:09,884 --> 00:34:12,011
Move, go over there.

538
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,221
Come sit down, Ms. Aeri.

539
00:34:14,305 --> 00:34:16,015
- Oh, okay.
- Your legs must hurt.

540
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:19,915
Ms. Aeri, I'll head back first.
Join us after you're finished.

541
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:21,437
- Okay.
- See you later.

542
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,605
Focus on working.

543
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:23,939
I am working.

544
00:34:25,733 --> 00:34:27,568
Tighten it a bit more. There you go.

545
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:34,658
There seems
to be another visitor.

546
00:34:35,326 --> 00:34:37,953
Let's handle this quietly, all right?

547
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:44,919
Ms. Yun, it's me. Open the door, please.

548
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:55,554
We found something unusual
inside the body,

549
00:34:56,138 --> 00:34:58,140
so Ms. Yun and I will take care
of the autopsy.

550
00:34:58,891 --> 00:34:59,934
The both of you?

551
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:01,769
Yes, it was Ms. Yun's decision.

552
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:03,532
The autopsy may take a bit longer as well.

553
00:35:03,604 --> 00:35:04,897
But still…

554
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:06,482
I need you to look up

555
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:08,400
recent head trauma cases

556
00:35:08,484 --> 00:35:10,861
with ruptured soft tissue
in the leg on the Dicom server.

557
00:35:11,445 --> 00:35:12,923
I want to make comparisons
with this case.

558
00:35:12,947 --> 00:35:14,031
Right now?

559
00:35:14,782 --> 00:35:16,575
Okay. How far back should I look?

560
00:35:17,576 --> 00:35:18,786
The past five years.

561
00:35:18,869 --> 00:35:19,995
Five years?

562
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:22,933
I won't be able
to go home today, then, Ms. Yun.

563
00:35:22,957 --> 00:35:24,708
Please look into it for me.

564
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,836
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

565
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:48,315
Call recording

566
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,400
<i>What next?</i>

567
00:35:49,483 --> 00:35:52,045
<i>At a hospital, they would pierce
the upper thoracic cavity,</i>

568
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:54,488
<i>but it's dangerous,
because of the vagus nerve and artery.</i>

569
00:35:54,572 --> 00:35:58,450
<i>Lay the patient on one side
and after exposing the side…</i>

570
00:35:58,534 --> 00:35:59,869
It sounds intentional.

571
00:35:59,952 --> 00:36:01,596
<i>…just below the seventh rib.</i>

572
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:04,060
<i>Until it feels like
you've pierced the thoracic cavity.</i>

573
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,338
I think my breathing is back to normal.

574
00:36:14,675 --> 00:36:16,260
Now tell us what you want.

575
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,560
I see that the rumors
about you being impatient are true.

576
00:36:19,889 --> 00:36:21,557
Hey, what are you trying to do?

577
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,100
And how can we trust you?

578
00:36:23,184 --> 00:36:25,744
Is there anything you can do
if you don't trust me?

579
00:36:26,145 --> 00:36:27,146
Detonate it, you bastard.

580
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,274
The police never compromise
with a blackmailer.

581
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:31,358
Detonate it.

582
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,527
<i>You can't, can you?</i>

583
00:36:33,611 --> 00:36:36,697
If we all die,
your whole plan implodes, right?

584
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:40,409
Ah, I guess we're in
a symbiotic relationship from now on.

585
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:42,915
<i>How should I pacify
the Jindo Dog?</i>

586
00:36:43,537 --> 00:36:46,498
I guess you've hardly ever been
blackmailed before.

587
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:50,294
Goodness, you know my nickname.
Seems like you've done your research.

588
00:36:51,962 --> 00:36:54,340
<i>What would satisfy
the Jindo Dog?</i>

589
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,551
Oh, right.

590
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:01,472
<i>You've been selected, Ms. Samsoon.</i>

591
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,265
What do you mean?

592
00:37:04,058 --> 00:37:05,392
What is it?

593
00:37:05,768 --> 00:37:08,437
Your firstborn, Sunju,
or your secondborn, Suna.

594
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,813
Choose one.

595
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,470
Don't lay a hand on my children!

596
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:15,736
<i>Bangseo Elementary School. Fourth grade,
Class Two. Second grade, Class Three.</i>

597
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:18,572
<i>They grew up so well
even without a father.</i>

598
00:37:18,656 --> 00:37:22,368
Because of an untamed Jindo dog,

599
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:25,329
<i>they may join their father in death
at a young age.</i>

600
00:37:25,746 --> 00:37:27,206
You bastards!

601
00:37:27,581 --> 00:37:28,958
You crazy bastards!

602
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,543
Who do you think you are?

603
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,588
I'll kill you all!

604
00:37:34,672 --> 00:37:36,924
<i>Silence! Be quiet!</i>

605
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:40,177
The both of you are so noisy!

606
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:43,639
Shut your mouth and stay put!

607
00:37:43,889 --> 00:37:44,950
- Ms. Woo.
- I need to leave.

608
00:37:44,974 --> 00:37:47,851
- Please calm down.
- I have to go to my kids. Let go of me!

609
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:50,729
<i>Should I press number one?</i>

610
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:55,025
This place will explode
the moment you leave through that door.

611
00:37:56,235 --> 00:37:58,696
A mother without kids is pitiful, but…

612
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:01,532
<i>Whatever. They may be better off
without a mother.</i>

613
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,945
Tell us what you want.
Don't bring the kids into this!

614
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,331
Ms. Woo.

615
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,458
Not my children.

616
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:17,256
I scolded my kids as I sent them to school
on empty stomachs today.

617
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:21,635
I've never cooked
a proper meal for my kids.

618
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:23,304
Please don't touch my kids.

619
00:38:24,263 --> 00:38:26,348
Please, I'm begging you.

620
00:38:26,432 --> 00:38:27,891
Please let me out. Just me.

621
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,935
<i>I won't say a word to anyone.</i>

622
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:32,104
<i>Please just let me out!</i>

623
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:34,148
I have to go to my kids!

624
00:38:34,481 --> 00:38:36,400
Sunju! Suna!

625
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,402
Just let me out!

626
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:40,195
I…

627
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:42,197
- I…
- Ms. Woo.

628
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:44,074
- I…
- Ms. Woo!

629
00:38:46,744 --> 00:38:49,455
She's having a panic attack!
I think she's hyperventilating, too.

630
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:50,998
A paper bag!

631
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,214
Deep breaths.

632
00:38:59,465 --> 00:39:00,591
Breathe with me.

633
00:39:01,258 --> 00:39:02,301
Slowly.

634
00:39:08,557 --> 00:39:09,600
Are you okay?

635
00:39:11,518 --> 00:39:13,228
I have to get out.

636
00:39:14,188 --> 00:39:15,731
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

637
00:39:16,648 --> 00:39:18,484
You don't compromise with me.

638
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:20,819
<i>You just obey me.</i>

639
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:22,154
<i>Obey.</i>

640
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:24,990
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

641
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:26,825
<i>Obey.</i>

642
00:39:31,705 --> 00:39:33,499
All right. Which one do you want to eat?

643
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:35,793
This one or this one?

644
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:41,799
Can you try it first?

645
00:39:47,805 --> 00:39:48,806
Satisfied?

646
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:57,481
But who are you?

647
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:08,992
This is what the unidentified victim,
currently undergoing autopsy, was wearing.

648
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:12,788
If you can find the brand name and model,

649
00:40:12,871 --> 00:40:15,791
we may be able to trace the purchase.

650
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,794
If you look here,
there's no brand tag here.

651
00:40:19,128 --> 00:40:20,504
Wait, what? Why is there no tag?

652
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:24,299
They removed the tag from the pants well.

653
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,345
- What's going on?
- Do you have his shoes?

654
00:40:28,429 --> 00:40:31,598
If you scrape off the dirt and dust,
we may find his recent whereabouts.

655
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:32,975
Oh, yes. The shoes are here.

656
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:40,107
It's been smoothened out with a knife.

657
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:44,736
Wouldn't there be trace evidence
in the pockets of the pants?

658
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:46,697
What the heck?

659
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:49,908
They've removed the pockets, too.

660
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,994
We're not dealing with a regular criminal.

661
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:55,789
- Please keep checking.
- Okay.

662
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:59,668
Let's continue what we were doing first.

663
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:00,794
Yes, sir.

664
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:04,131
Detective Kongmyeong Pil

665
00:41:07,176 --> 00:41:08,469
Restricted number

666
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,179
Detective Kongmyeong Pil

667
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:12,962
If we don't pick up,
he'll get suspicious and come here.

668
00:41:13,098 --> 00:41:14,516
<i>Do as you please.</i>

669
00:41:16,185 --> 00:41:17,186
It's me.

670
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,788
<i>What took you so long to answer?</i>

671
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,457
<i>We can't get anything
from the shoes or clothes.</i>

672
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:21,899
<i>The culprit is very cunning.</i>

673
00:41:21,982 --> 00:41:25,142
This is the first time since Yoo Youngchul
that I've seen shoe soles filed down.

674
00:41:26,028 --> 00:41:28,739
<i>Did you find anything during the autopsy?
I'm about to head over.</i>

675
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:30,719
<i>It's fine, you don't have to.</i>

676
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,117
<i>Why?</i>

677
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:34,953
The autopsy is going to take a while.
Wait at the office.

678
00:41:35,787 --> 00:41:38,290
All right, then. Take your time.

679
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:39,833
Bye.

680
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:41,793
What's going on?

681
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:45,873
<i>Now get to the point.</i>

682
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,784
<i>You're going to
a trial today, right, Ms. Yun?</i>

683
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,387
I believe your results should be out now.

684
00:41:52,971 --> 00:41:55,200
Are you talking about the incident
at a Chinese restaurant?

685
00:41:55,224 --> 00:41:56,642
<i>Call Prosecutor Park.</i>

686
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,285
<i>Tell him you're personally delivering
the appraisal to the court.</i>

687
00:41:59,311 --> 00:42:01,311
You're doing all of this,
because of that incident?

688
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,900
Should I ask Sunju and Suna to?

689
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,362
<i>Don't make it harder for the children's
mother and call him on speaker.</i>

690
00:42:17,621 --> 00:42:19,141
<i>Hello, this is Park Hongjun.</i>

691
00:42:19,498 --> 00:42:21,708
- This is Yoon Hong from the NFS.
<i>- Hello, Ms. Yun.</i>

692
00:42:21,792 --> 00:42:23,961
Are the appraisal results not out yet?

693
00:42:24,294 --> 00:42:25,546
The trial is about to begin.

694
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:28,298
The results may be a bit delayed.

695
00:42:28,382 --> 00:42:30,676
May I bring the results
to the court myself?

696
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:32,803
<i>Okay,
I'll put in a witness request then.</i>

697
00:42:32,886 --> 00:42:34,346
<i>I'll see you at the court.</i>

698
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:43,772
Hello, Ms. Yun.

699
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:46,575
<i>You know the appraisal results
that need to be released today?</i>

700
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:47,877
The Chinese restaurant incident.

701
00:42:47,901 --> 00:42:49,420
<i>Yes, we're working
on it right now.</i>

702
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:50,737
When can we expect the results?

703
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,907
It may take about 20 minutes or so.

704
00:42:53,991 --> 00:42:56,386
<i>Let me know when they're out.
I'll come by to get them.</i>

705
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,120
<i>Oh, okay.</i>

706
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:04,659
<i>Go to the court
once the results are out.</i>

707
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:07,504
And you just need to testify
as you're told.

708
00:43:08,088 --> 00:43:09,339
You want me to commit perjury?

709
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,509
<i>You'll know
once the results are out.</i>

710
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:16,054
We're watching you all,
so don't try anything.

711
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:18,890
Just quietly obey.

712
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:23,979
What Chinese restaurant incident?

713
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:28,150
It's a case where a man was found dead
in a room at a Chinese restaurant.

714
00:43:28,567 --> 00:43:31,069
A man he was with
was arrested at the scene.

715
00:43:31,153 --> 00:43:34,573
There was no external trauma
or evidence of murder, but…

716
00:43:38,327 --> 00:43:39,703
Presumably red microfiber.

717
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:43,790
<i>Microfibers were found
in both the oral and nasal cavities.</i>

718
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,377
It's possible that the fibers entered
the body while he was breathing.

719
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,821
Or something covered his face
to prevent him from breathing.

720
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:53,759
Exactly. And there happened to be
a cushion of the same color at the scene.

721
00:43:54,343 --> 00:43:57,179
Please evaluate whether the microfibers
are a match or not.

722
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:58,513
Yes, ma'am.

723
00:43:59,723 --> 00:44:03,310
<i>If the fibers match the cushion
from the Chinese restaurant,</i>

724
00:44:04,061 --> 00:44:07,064
it will become direct evidence
of asphyxia by airway obstruction,

725
00:44:07,147 --> 00:44:08,565
and there will be a conviction.

726
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:12,235
If they're not a match,
there won't be a conviction.

727
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,655
The results will be out soon.

728
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,366
Just who is the defendant
that these people are going this far?

729
00:44:18,116 --> 00:44:19,534
That's what's strange to me.

730
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:22,454
According to the case records,
the victim and perpetrator

731
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:24,331
are just ordinary people.

732
00:44:24,414 --> 00:44:26,875
Ordinary people
don't make homemade bombs like this.

733
00:44:28,627 --> 00:44:29,628
But…

734
00:44:30,754 --> 00:44:33,215
should we really be talking like this?

735
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:36,385
The CCTV in the autopsy room
does not pick up audio

736
00:44:36,468 --> 00:44:38,804
since investigative information
discussed during an autopsy

737
00:44:38,887 --> 00:44:40,138
could be leaked.

738
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:44,118
They probably think it's fine as long as
we can't contact anyone with our phones.

739
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:46,311
What if we can contact
someone on the outside?

740
00:44:56,405 --> 00:44:57,447
It's Sunju's.

741
00:44:57,531 --> 00:44:59,157
Number One and Two, don't move!

742
00:44:59,533 --> 00:45:01,743
Hey, your cell phone!

743
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,829
Deep breaths. Breathe with me.

744
00:45:04,538 --> 00:45:05,622
Are you okay?

745
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:07,499
I have to get out.

746
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:20,554
Nice one, Ms. Woo.

747
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:27,519
Good thing I bought it for her.

748
00:45:28,019 --> 00:45:29,479
Thanks, Sunju.

749
00:45:40,532 --> 00:45:43,034
He told me to leave, so I guess I should.

<i>Jindo Dog, I told you all
to stay put and not try anything.</i>

763
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,480
<i>What are you doing with the corpse?</i>

764
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:33,418
Staying still for too long
arouses suspicion, no?

765
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:36,254
<i>You won't find anything.
We made sure of it.</i>

766
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:39,132
It's going straight to the crematorium
as an unclaimed body.

767
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,258
Unclaimed?

768
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:43,303
Do you really think we won't identify him?

769
00:46:44,554 --> 00:46:47,641
I don't think your pride as a detective
will get you anywhere this time.

770
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,476
Then make a bet with me.

771
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:51,228
Okay, call.

772
00:46:51,728 --> 00:46:54,189
But if you can't identify him
within 15 minutes,

773
00:46:54,272 --> 00:46:55,774
<i>I'll detonate the bomb.</i>

774
00:46:57,192 --> 00:46:59,212
- You want me to bet my life, is that it?
- Detective Jin.

775
00:46:59,236 --> 00:47:00,570
<i>Oh, no.</i>

776
00:47:00,987 --> 00:47:03,281
<i>I can't detonate it with Ms. Yun there.</i>

777
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:04,741
<i>Take out your handcuffs.</i>

778
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,414
<i>Mr. Kang Doha, take the handcuffs.</i>

779
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:16,044
Hey.

780
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:21,591
I'm sorry.

781
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:23,677
<i>Cuff yourself to the C-arm.</i>

782
00:47:33,937 --> 00:47:35,689
- Satisfied?
<i>- Jindo Dog.</i>

783
00:47:35,772 --> 00:47:37,399
<i>What are you doing? Take out the key.</i>

784
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,488
If you can't identify
the body within 15 minutes,

785
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:44,865
Mr. Jin Hogae

786
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,826
will eat the key.

787
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,830
<i>Enjoy it like a dog.</i>

788
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:55,792
The 15-minute timer…

789
00:47:56,459 --> 00:47:57,460
starts now.

790
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,929
"Fatal injury,
struck in the back of the head."

791
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:09,556
<i>"Blunt weapon used."</i>

792
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:12,225
"No ligature marks
on the arms and ankles."

793
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,394
Mutilation of the corpse
happened after death, right?

794
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:17,206
There's no sign that the body was
functioning when the laceration was made.

795
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:18,710
<i>It was mutilation after death.</i>

796
00:48:19,065 --> 00:48:22,360
All right. Let's start victim profiling.

797
00:48:22,444 --> 00:48:24,154
Gender, male.

798
00:48:24,237 --> 00:48:25,877
He's been a smoker for at least 20 years.

799
00:48:25,947 --> 00:48:27,741
<i>There was a lot of tar
on his teeth.</i>

800
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:30,201
- Heavy smoker.
- Based on the degree of calcification

801
00:48:30,285 --> 00:48:33,705
and occlusal wear of teeth,
he's 50 years old or older.

802
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:35,290
A man who's 50 years old or older.

803
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:38,710
There were no missing person reports
that match his description.

804
00:48:39,169 --> 00:48:40,879
He may have lived alone.

805
00:48:40,962 --> 00:48:42,172
Possibly living alone.

806
00:48:42,255 --> 00:48:44,299
The radius and ulna of both arms

807
00:48:44,382 --> 00:48:47,218
and ribs three and seven
had indications of healed fractures.

808
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:50,180
Radius and ulna? Defensive marks, maybe.

809
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:52,515
Small fractures
can also be found in drunk people.

810
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,850
They often fall and get hurt.

811
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,603
Habitual alcoholic

812
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,772
or someone who fights a lot.

813
00:48:58,855 --> 00:49:01,775
We don't have any more clues.
How do we narrow it down?

814
00:49:01,858 --> 00:49:04,736
We have the best clue
to help identify him.

815
00:49:05,737 --> 00:49:08,031
A victim that the culprit
went to great lengths to hide.

816
00:49:08,114 --> 00:49:09,491
What are you saying?

817
00:49:09,574 --> 00:49:11,910
What do you mean?
We continue what we were doing.

818
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:13,286
The autopsy.

819
00:49:23,004 --> 00:49:25,232
- Pil! Where's Detective Jin?
- My goodness, you scared me.

820
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:27,456
I came alone because the autopsy
is taking a while. Why?

821
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,678
Really? Listen to this.

822
00:49:29,761 --> 00:49:30,929
I think something's wrong.

823
00:49:31,012 --> 00:49:32,430
- You guys talked today?
- Yes.

824
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,642
<i>Chest trauma
and irregular breathing.</i>

825
00:49:35,934 --> 00:49:37,614
<i>So they're having trouble
breathing, right?</i>

826
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,121
<i>Yes, I believe so.</i>

827
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:40,539
<i>When nothing
is wrong with the lungs…</i>

828
00:49:40,563 --> 00:49:42,399
What are you guys talking about?

829
00:49:42,649 --> 00:49:46,069
That's not important.
He's tapping the phone with his finger.

830
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,195
Listen again.

831
00:49:47,946 --> 00:49:50,031
<i>Chest trauma
and irregular breathing.</i>

832
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,170
<i>So they're having trouble
breathing, right?</i>

833
00:49:56,705 --> 00:49:57,789
You're right.

834
00:49:58,039 --> 00:49:59,791
It's a SOS in Morse code.

835
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:02,877
Isn't he sending us a message?
He's done this before too.

836
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,552
I'll try calling him.

837
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:12,303
I already tried. He's not answering.

838
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,473
What's this?

839
00:50:15,557 --> 00:50:16,766
<i>Bangseo Elementary.</i>

840
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:19,310
<i>Fourth grade, Woo Sunju,
and second grade, Woo Suna.</i>

841
00:50:19,394 --> 00:50:20,854
<i>Please check if they're safe.</i>

842
00:50:20,937 --> 00:50:23,273
<i>If you see this, quietly respond back.</i>

843
00:50:23,356 --> 00:50:24,399
<i>Code Zero.</i>

844
00:50:25,108 --> 00:50:26,526
They're in trouble. Darn it.

845
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:28,111
Hey, wait for me.

846
00:50:29,446 --> 00:50:31,698
Mr. Baek, there's trouble.

847
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:33,742
What's going on? Why are you so worked up?

848
00:50:33,825 --> 00:50:36,536
Woo Suna and Woo Sunja
are Ms. Woo's daughters.

849
00:50:36,619 --> 00:50:39,164
And I'm not sure who,
but I think someone's hurt.

850
00:50:39,247 --> 00:50:40,290
"Code Zero."

851
00:50:40,707 --> 00:50:42,000
"Don't call me"?

852
00:50:42,876 --> 00:50:45,045
- This is blackmail.
- Exactly.

853
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:48,381
<i>What's happening? Who got hurt?</i>

854
00:50:48,465 --> 00:50:52,093
Go to Bangseo Elementary
and check on Ms. Woo's children.

855
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,697
- Okay.
<i>- There's too much to explain.</i>

856
00:50:54,721 --> 00:50:56,639
<i>- What about my kids?
- We've sent someone.</i>

857
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:59,535
<i>There must be a hacker
who infiltrated</i>

858
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:00,977
<i>the NFS's CCTV transmission line.</i>

859
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,229
<i>They're watching us
inside the autopsy room.</i>

860
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:05,023
<i>Ask Seungkyu to track them down.</i>

861
00:51:05,106 --> 00:51:06,691
We have to go to the forensics team.

862
00:51:06,775 --> 00:51:08,359
- Let's get going.
- Okay.

863
00:51:09,152 --> 00:51:10,278
I got it. Okay.

864
00:51:18,912 --> 00:51:20,872
What's in the knees? Is this a booby trap?

865
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,248
What is that?

866
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,501
It's fixed in a unique way.

867
00:51:24,834 --> 00:51:26,419
Turn it towards me.

868
00:51:31,466 --> 00:51:32,675
This isn't a bomb.

869
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,053
It's an artificial kneecap.

870
00:51:36,846 --> 00:51:38,014
An artificial joint.

871
00:51:39,015 --> 00:51:40,850
An artificial joint is traceable, right?

872
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:44,437
Every prosthesis has a serial number
engraved on it for tracking.

873
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,773
- If we trace it back...
- We'll know exactly who, when,

874
00:51:46,856 --> 00:51:49,025
and which hospital the surgery
was performed in.

875
00:51:49,526 --> 00:51:50,527
Hold on.

876
00:51:50,902 --> 00:51:53,363
- That means we have to take it out.
- And?

877
00:51:53,613 --> 00:51:55,007
The wires attached to the detonator

878
00:51:55,031 --> 00:51:56,791
are passing right above
the artificial joint.

879
00:51:57,617 --> 00:51:59,911
One wrong move
and this whole place blows up.

880
00:52:03,248 --> 00:52:05,608
- Then what do we do?
- Do you want to vanish into thin air?

881
00:52:06,084 --> 00:52:07,919
Jeez, why do you have to talk like that?

882
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:09,531
Evaporate.

883
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,565
The closer you are
to an explosive,

884
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:14,217
the more likely your body will shatter
into pieces and disappear.

885
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:27,188
- I'll do it.
- No.

886
00:52:27,355 --> 00:52:29,023
What can you do with that hand?

887
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:31,401
I suggested it, so I'll do it.
Sit down and rest.

888
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,245
All right, let's see.

889
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:45,972
What do I have to do?

890
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:50,378
Make an incision straight down,

891
00:52:50,461 --> 00:52:53,298
starting from right beside
the artificial joint.

892
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:55,216
Doha, you keep taking X-rays.

893
00:52:55,425 --> 00:52:57,135
Then we can see how deep the scalpel goes.

894
00:52:58,261 --> 00:52:59,262
Like this.

895
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,057
Grab it like this.

896
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:06,352
You can control the pressure better
while making the incision.

897
00:53:07,478 --> 00:53:08,938
You can't cut too deep.

898
00:53:09,772 --> 00:53:11,274
Do it very slowly.

899
00:53:12,066 --> 00:53:13,526
Why is my hand shaking so much?

900
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:21,492
Hey, try to leave
about two millimeters of space.

901
00:53:21,576 --> 00:53:23,286
No, make it three.

902
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,955
Detective, be careful.

903
00:53:26,664 --> 00:53:28,559
- Aren't you going in too deep?
- It's too deep.

904
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:30,960
You're going in too deep.
Keep your hand still.

905
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,503
Be careful!

906
00:53:32,587 --> 00:53:35,298
I'm sorry, but can you be quiet,
so he can concentrate?

907
00:53:37,592 --> 00:53:39,052
Don't touch any of the wires.

908
00:53:39,552 --> 00:53:41,346
Hogae, you're cutting too deep.

909
00:53:45,516 --> 00:53:48,144
No, Hogae. Hey. Don't breathe!

910
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:49,854
Can you stop it?

911
00:53:49,938 --> 00:53:51,731
I'm going to touch it at this rate.

912
00:53:51,814 --> 00:53:54,901
Why are you… And what, don't breathe?
Should I just die then?

913
00:53:55,026 --> 00:53:56,945
Die. Just die.

914
00:53:57,028 --> 00:53:58,708
Every time you breathe, your body vibrates

915
00:53:58,738 --> 00:54:00,424
along with your heartbeat.
Can't you hold your breath?

916
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:02,608
I get it. Everyone be quiet.
I'm trying to concentrate.

917
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,119
Too many cooks, seriously.

918
00:54:10,041 --> 00:54:12,252
Okay, don't touch the wires.

919
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:14,671
Don't touch the wires.

920
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:33,940
Ms. Yun, can I take it out now?

921
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:36,359
Artificial joints
aren't easy to remove.

922
00:54:36,901 --> 00:54:39,501
It's fixed tightly so that you
never have to worry about it again.

923
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:41,593
It only gets harder from here on out.

924
00:54:41,948 --> 00:54:43,188
Do you see the tray beside you?

925
00:54:44,033 --> 00:54:46,786
You'll need it to remove the joint.

926
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:48,371
Let's pull out all the stops.

927
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:03,862
<i>Did you track down the hacker?</i>

928
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:05,388
Almost. One moment, please.

929
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,074
The transit system and bypass are no joke.

930
00:55:07,098 --> 00:55:09,142
We're using TCP backtracking
to track them down.

931
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:10,893
<i>Try using IP packet trackback.</i>

932
00:55:10,977 --> 00:55:12,454
IP Packet Traceback: Tracking the actual
destination of changed IP address packets

933
00:55:12,478 --> 00:55:13,688
Shouldn't we report this now

934
00:55:13,771 --> 00:55:15,982
and call in Special Forces
to do a rescue operation?

935
00:55:16,065 --> 00:55:18,735
No, if we do,
they'll know we made contact.

936
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:21,672
We have no choice but to trust
and wait for Detective Jin's decisions.

937
00:55:21,696 --> 00:55:23,416
Seol, don't tell anyone
at the fire station.

938
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:24,574
Okay.

939
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:28,453
All right, insert the saw
next to the wires.

940
00:55:28,536 --> 00:55:29,996
Don't touch the wires.

941
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:48,931
Wait.

942
00:56:04,781 --> 00:56:07,575
Go to work on time, work hard,

943
00:56:08,201 --> 00:56:11,496
and come back home in one piece.
Just keep those things.

944
00:57:21,274 --> 00:57:23,776
The serial number is on the inside.
Do you see it?

945
00:57:24,152 --> 00:57:25,838
There's a lot of flesh,
so I need to remove some.

946
00:57:25,862 --> 00:57:28,048
You'll see it after you remove it
and rinse it with water.

947
00:57:28,072 --> 00:57:29,073
This way.

948
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:40,702
Do you see the serial number?

949
00:57:44,505 --> 00:57:45,965
- No, I don't.
- What?

950
00:57:46,507 --> 00:57:48,009
I think I cut it off.

951
00:57:55,016 --> 00:57:57,185
<i>I'm disappointed, Jindo Dog.</i>

952
00:57:57,852 --> 00:57:59,520
Hold up your end of the deal

953
00:58:00,062 --> 00:58:01,814
and take care of the handcuff key.

954
00:58:02,482 --> 00:58:03,882
How can I eat it without any water?

955
00:58:12,283 --> 00:58:13,534
Detective.

956
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:20,761
<i>All right, let's get to work.</i>

957
00:58:26,339 --> 00:58:27,465
Hello, this is Yun Hong.

958
00:58:28,591 --> 00:58:30,676
The trace evidence results are out.

959
00:58:32,803 --> 00:58:33,971
I'm on my way now.

960
00:58:35,264 --> 00:58:37,475
<i>Get the appraisal
and head to the court.</i>

961
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,353
<i>Two police officers, your NFS colleagues,</i>

962
00:58:40,937 --> 00:58:42,897
<i>Sunju, and Suna.</i>

963
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,817
<i>You understand
that their lives are in your hands, right?</i>

964
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,365
Unknown number

965
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:55,743
<i>Get moving.</i>

966
00:59:12,051 --> 00:59:13,171
Autopsy room Restricted area

967
00:59:18,766 --> 00:59:21,227
Hey, send everyone out but me.

968
00:59:22,186 --> 00:59:24,146
You only need one hostage.

969
00:59:24,855 --> 00:59:26,482
I can't leave, anyway.

970
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:29,735
<i>No,
the more hostages the better.</i>

971
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:34,949
I'll be permanently locking
the autopsy room door,

972
00:59:35,032 --> 00:59:37,702
so no one else can leave.

973
00:59:40,788 --> 00:59:42,873
Autopsy in progress

974
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:45,793
- Ms. Woo.
- Yes?

975
00:59:47,336 --> 00:59:48,462
I found the serial number.

976
00:59:49,297 --> 00:59:50,298
I thought you cut it off.

977
00:59:50,381 --> 00:59:52,781
Why would I report
the investigation findings to the culprit?

978
01:00:00,141 --> 01:00:01,142
573420.

979
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:04,020
KG98.

980
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,730
You little…

981
01:00:05,813 --> 01:00:08,107
573420 KG98.

982
01:00:26,792 --> 01:00:28,961
Unknown number

983
01:00:30,963 --> 01:00:31,964
<i>Get moving.</i>

984
01:01:09,877 --> 01:01:11,587
- You're here.
- Yes.

985
01:01:12,129 --> 01:01:14,548
- Hand me the document.
- Yes, sir.

986
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:17,301
- Here you go.
- What are you doing?

987
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,303
Here you go.

988
01:01:19,387 --> 01:01:20,596
Appraisal results Enclosed

989
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,931
Your face…

990
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:23,641
Have a nice day.

991
01:01:43,494 --> 01:01:45,374
<i>Don't open
the appraisal documents</i>

992
01:01:45,454 --> 01:01:47,206
<i>until you sit at the witness stand.</i>

993
01:01:47,873 --> 01:01:50,584
<i>There will be a cell phone
and earphones when you get in the car.</i>

994
01:02:28,164 --> 01:02:29,165
I found it!

995
01:02:30,499 --> 01:02:33,461
We found it. It's a surgical record
for the artificial joint.

996
01:02:33,544 --> 01:02:35,814
The patient underwent surgery
at Onjo Orthopedic Clinic in 2017.

997
01:02:35,838 --> 01:02:36,982
- Hurry up and go.
- Yes, sir.

998
01:02:37,006 --> 01:02:38,007
- Min.
- Yes, sir.

999
01:02:41,093 --> 01:02:42,094
They found the record.

1000
01:02:42,928 --> 01:02:44,221
Okay.

1001
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,896
I found the line that infiltrated
the NFS's CCTV transmission line.

1002
01:02:56,025 --> 01:02:58,360
They found the hacker
who infiltrated the NFS.

1003
01:02:58,444 --> 01:03:00,070
- We'll cut their connection.
- Hold on.

1004
01:03:01,363 --> 01:03:04,158
Can you record the CCTV footage
that they're seeing right now?

1005
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,120
What if we sent a recording
to play on their screens?

1006
01:03:08,704 --> 01:03:10,414
Are you saying we loop the recording

1007
01:03:10,498 --> 01:03:12,458
to trick them into thinking
we're still in here?

1008
01:03:12,541 --> 01:03:14,686
And in the meantime,
we evacuate everyone from the building.

1009
01:03:14,710 --> 01:03:16,545
What if we get caught?

1010
01:03:16,629 --> 01:03:18,714
If we just disconnect them and evacuate...

1011
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:19,924
We can't buy time then.

1012
01:03:20,007 --> 01:03:22,768
Hong is on her way to the court.
We can't guarantee her safety either.

1013
01:03:22,885 --> 01:03:23,886
That's right.

1014
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,387
Okay, we'll try it.

1015
01:03:25,596 --> 01:03:28,556
Call the fire station, so we can open
the door once the loop is successful.

1016
01:03:28,682 --> 01:03:29,683
All right.

1017
01:03:29,767 --> 01:03:31,727
<i>Loop the CCTV footage.</i>

1018
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:34,371
<i>We need to open the door if we succeed,
so call the fire station.</i>

1019
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:38,067
Dispatch quietly.
And connect me to Chief Dokgo.

1020
01:03:38,275 --> 01:03:39,276
Okay, got it.

1021
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:43,823
We're going to start recording
for the CCTV footage loop,

1022
01:03:43,906 --> 01:03:46,242
so tell everyone
not to move too much and stay still.

1023
01:03:46,826 --> 01:03:47,827
Yes, sir.

1024
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:54,416
We're recording.

1025
01:04:12,393 --> 01:04:13,727
Hello, this is Dokgo Soon.

1026
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:15,563
<i>Hello, Chief Dokgo.</i>

1027
01:04:15,646 --> 01:04:16,814
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>

1028
01:04:16,897 --> 01:04:19,859
The NFS's CCTV
is currently being monitored,

1029
01:04:19,942 --> 01:04:22,945
so please approach the CCTV blind spots

1030
01:04:23,028 --> 01:04:24,530
as quietly as possible.

1031
01:04:25,197 --> 01:04:27,116
Understood. Please provide us
with directions.

1032
01:04:27,199 --> 01:04:28,200
<i>Yes, of course.</i>

1033
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:32,121
Welcome back, chief.

1034
01:04:48,846 --> 01:04:50,180
Hello, we're police officers.

1035
01:04:50,472 --> 01:04:51,533
I'd like to see a list of patients

1036
01:04:51,557 --> 01:04:54,727
in their mid to late fifties who recently
had an artificial joint transplant.

1037
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:56,103
Oh, one moment, please.

1038
01:04:57,938 --> 01:04:59,773
His name is Ha Joongsik, 58 years old.

1039
01:04:59,857 --> 01:05:01,275
Yes. Wait a second.

1040
01:05:04,153 --> 01:05:05,362
He's a police officer.

1041
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:07,740
His name is Ha Joongsik, 58 years old.

1042
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:09,617
He's a police officer.

1043
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,500
They not only sent a bomb to the NFS,
but also killed a police officer.

1044
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:14,121
They're no joke.

1045
01:05:14,538 --> 01:05:16,540
Even if Ms. Yun
gives the testimony they want,

1046
01:05:16,624 --> 01:05:18,417
they'll kill her and blow this place up.

1047
01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:19,919
Court

1048
01:05:42,566 --> 01:05:43,609
The recording is done.

1049
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:46,195
Tell them not to move
until I give the signal.

1050
01:05:46,278 --> 01:05:47,279
Yes, sir.

1051
01:05:48,530 --> 01:05:49,782
They said don't move.

1052
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:52,576
The moment they intercept the signal,

1053
01:05:52,952 --> 01:05:55,162
the blackmailers
might notice it on their screens.

1054
01:05:55,746 --> 01:05:57,066
That's the most dangerous moment.

1055
01:05:58,374 --> 01:05:59,375
Three,

1056
01:06:00,042 --> 01:06:01,043
two,

1057
01:06:02,044 --> 01:06:03,045
one.

1058
01:06:58,475 --> 01:06:59,852
We're ready.

1059
01:07:30,507 --> 01:07:33,260
Special thanks to
Min Sungwuk and Jung Jingak

1060
01:07:33,343 --> 01:07:35,095
for their special appearance

1061
01:08:09,713 --> 01:08:11,465
The First Responders Season 2

1062
01:08:11,715 --> 01:08:14,802
The results came out
around 11:50 a.m. today.

1063
01:08:14,885 --> 01:08:17,721
<i>If Ms. Yun gives false testimony,
they'll try to silence her.</i>

1064
01:08:17,805 --> 01:08:20,566
<i>Silence her? Are you saying
they're going to kill her, too?</i>

1065
01:08:20,682 --> 01:08:21,809
This isn't a trial!

1066
01:08:22,226 --> 01:08:23,227
<i>It's a mess.</i>

1067
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:25,591
<i>- Codeword, "fried dumpling"! Let's go!
- Engage!</i>

1068
01:08:27,523 --> 01:08:28,565
Hold on a second.

1069
01:08:28,857 --> 01:08:31,737
The NFS is next to the police station,
which is next to the fire station.

1070
01:08:31,944 --> 01:08:33,112
We're invincible.

1071
01:08:33,362 --> 01:08:36,049
<i>If the NFS is involved,
it's a big case. Invincible, my foot.</i>

1072
01:08:36,073 --> 01:08:37,366
A real-time rescue request?

1073
01:08:37,449 --> 01:08:38,450
- Darn it.
- Understood.

1074
01:08:38,951 --> 01:08:40,577
This is Yang Chiyoung.

1075
01:08:44,873 --> 01:08:46,917
