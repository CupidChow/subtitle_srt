1
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,594
The characters, places, organizations,
and events in this drama are fictitious

2
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:34,012
Child actors were filmed
in safe situations

3
00:00:34,036 --> 00:00:35,476
Scenes involving animals were staged

4
00:00:35,538 --> 00:00:38,138
and filmed in compliance
with applicable animal welfare guidelines

5
00:00:40,209 --> 00:00:41,210
Detective Jin!

6
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,212
You're what?

7
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:46,233
You're rejecting the position
as head of the NOI investigation team

8
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:47,577
and going back to Taewon Station?

9
00:00:48,009 --> 00:00:49,569
I don't like the color of the building.

10
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,153
I don't like that honking sound either.

11
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,722
By the way,

12
00:00:53,806 --> 00:00:54,807
have you seen this?

13
00:00:55,933 --> 00:00:57,643
Why are you asking about him again?

14
00:00:58,686 --> 00:01:00,046
Something's suspicious about this.

15
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:02,023
Check on his condition for me, will you?

16
00:01:04,191 --> 00:01:05,609
Hey, Detective Jin.

17
00:01:05,693 --> 00:01:07,773
Have you been in contact
with your father these days?

18
00:01:08,404 --> 00:01:09,405
No, why?

19
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:12,867
This is a copy of the report
containing everything about the case.

20
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:14,452
Thank you.

21
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:17,830
But why do you want to see the documents

22
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:21,917
for Assemblyman Ma's death
when the case has been closed?

23
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:25,254
I won't put you in a difficult position.

24
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,340
Let's pretend we never had this meeting.

25
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:31,802
It's nothing. Go.

26
00:01:31,886 --> 00:01:34,206
If you're not going to say anything,
don't ask from now on.

27
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,985
What a cool motorcycle.

28
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:53,383
Rapport Building: Process of
establishing trust between suspects,

29
00:01:53,407 --> 00:01:55,135
witnesses, and investigators
during an investigation

30
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:58,788
Chundong

31
00:02:08,172 --> 00:02:10,174
Auntie, are you home?

32
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:17,014
Why did you leave the door open
when it's cold outside?

33
00:02:19,683 --> 00:02:20,726
Auntie?

34
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:22,937
Are you here?

35
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,486
Auntie. Auntie.

36
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:35,074
Auntie.

37
00:02:36,826 --> 00:02:39,078
Auntie! Auntie!

38
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:42,873
Auntie, why… Wake up, Auntie!

39
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,001
Someone… Someone help me, please!

40
00:02:46,085 --> 00:02:47,128
Auntie!

41
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,420
Auntie, please!

42
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,473
I think
the crime scene is a bit suspicious.

43
00:02:59,557 --> 00:03:01,600
Someone died like this,

44
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:05,437
but the scene is too calm.

45
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,647
There isn't a drop of blood.

46
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:09,692
Come to think of it,
there isn't a drop of blood.

47
00:03:10,693 --> 00:03:13,130
There aren't
any shoe prints, just sock prints.

48
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:14,256
But they're all partial prints.

49
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,920
What about the victim's cell phone?
You should run forensics on it.

50
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,492
I looked everywhere…

51
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:21,162
but it's gone.

52
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,788
What?

53
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:24,349
They're bringing her out.

54
00:03:24,373 --> 00:03:25,976
- Gosh, how could this happen?
- Oh, my.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,440
- Oh, no.
- She was fine last night.

56
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:30,337
I knew something
was going to happen to her.

57
00:03:30,421 --> 00:03:32,190
- How unfortunate.
- Tell me about it.

58
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:34,425
- Are you smoking again?
- Fine, I won't.

59
00:03:34,508 --> 00:03:36,760
- Quit smoking.
- Jeez.

60
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:43,851
Did anyone see or hear
anything strange last night?

61
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:46,729
I doubt they have the time
to mind other people's business.

62
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,939
Are there any neighbors

63
00:03:49,023 --> 00:03:51,317
who were close to the deceased?

64
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:57,615
I saw her from time to time,
but I didn't know her well.

65
00:04:01,368 --> 00:04:04,163
Excuse me, but I'm pretty busy too.

66
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,752
Oh, yes. Hello?

67
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:15,549
In my opinion,
she died of stress and anger.

68
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:18,153
She turned the whole neighborhood
upside down by picking fights.

69
00:04:18,177 --> 00:04:20,221
As a result,
she was shunned by everyone.

70
00:04:20,304 --> 00:04:24,683
Everyone in this entire villa
has had an altercation with her.

71
00:04:24,767 --> 00:04:26,685
Including yourself?

72
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:32,524
Honey, is that you?

73
00:04:38,572 --> 00:04:40,032
Chul's father.

74
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,410
No, I'm actually divorced.

75
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:45,913
Didn't I tell you
life would be hard if you left?

76
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:50,000
Look at how your handsome face has aged.

77
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:52,586
It's so wrinkly.

78
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:57,341
All you had was your looks.

79
00:04:57,967 --> 00:05:01,345
Why is Chul not here to greet his father?

80
00:05:02,388 --> 00:05:04,098
Chul!

81
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:06,392
Your father is here.

82
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:10,396
Chul. Chul!

83
00:05:12,273 --> 00:05:13,433
May we see the recent entries

84
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:15,776
of the complaint ledgers
and security logs?

85
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:18,505
They would be more accurate than
interrogations in investigating grudges.

86
00:05:18,529 --> 00:05:21,240
Logs? There's nothing like that.

87
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:24,094
What do you mean? You record daily logs
and keep complaints on file too.

88
00:05:24,118 --> 00:05:25,911
Even if I do have them,

89
00:05:25,995 --> 00:05:28,497
they contain
the residents' personal information.

90
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,100
I can't just release that information.

91
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:32,143
Even someone
from management at Mijoong Apartments

92
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,753
was fired for releasing management logs.

93
00:05:35,254 --> 00:05:37,172
You're being so guarded.

94
00:05:37,256 --> 00:05:38,549
We're police officers.

95
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,509
Forget it!
I don't care if you're the police.

96
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:43,272
There's nothing like that.
So don't make a commotion and just leave.

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,350
Jeez, what's wrong with this neighborhood?

98
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:50,352
Hang on. Excuse me, sir!

99
00:05:52,396 --> 00:05:54,732
That's enough.
I have nothing to share.

100
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:57,526
Jeez, stop it. Just leave.

101
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,631
Why? What is it?

102
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:21,300
Why are you following me?

103
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:23,886
Are you a pervert or a thief?

104
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,263
Not at all. I'm on my way home.

105
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:30,267
I'm fully aware of everything
and everyone in Building 103.

106
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:32,519
I-I just moved in today.

107
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,563
I didn't see a moving truck though.

108
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:38,317
Oh, I see.
But my place is right behind you.

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,153
Excuse me. No, please. Don't blow it.

110
00:06:41,236 --> 00:06:42,738
Excuse me.

111
00:06:42,821 --> 00:06:43,822
It's right here.

112
00:06:48,535 --> 00:06:50,037
See?

113
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,622
Have a nice evening.

114
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:55,292
I'm a police officer.

115
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,547
He does live here.

116
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:52,266
<i>Eat it before it spoils.</i>

117
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:07,698
Well, it's spoiled.

118
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,369
Hello, Auntie.

119
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,292
Even a bowl of <i>ramyeon</i>
should be eaten with kimchi.

120
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:20,586
Oh, but I won't be able
to finish this by myself.

121
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:25,090
Aren't you running around trying
to catch a serial arsonist or something?

122
00:08:25,424 --> 00:08:28,469
I heard the top of Mijoong Apartments'
septic tank was blown off.

123
00:08:29,052 --> 00:08:30,762
My goodness, what a terrible bastard.

124
00:08:30,846 --> 00:08:33,182
Eat this and get your wits about you.

125
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:35,642
Catch the bastard
who's setting fires, okay?

126
00:08:35,893 --> 00:08:38,520
- Got it?
- Yes, I will. Thank you.

127
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,647
- Eat up, okay?
- Okay, goodbye.

128
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:42,649
- Bye.
- Thank you!

129
00:09:08,175 --> 00:09:09,676
I'm sorry, Auntie.

130
00:09:10,844 --> 00:09:13,680
I'll make sure…

131
00:09:18,936 --> 00:09:20,336
…to catch the bastard who did this.

132
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:39,815
<i>There's an autopsy tomorrow.</i>

133
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,710
<i>I'm waiting for you, Detective Jin.</i>

134
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,889
How does it feel
to be thrown out of the organization?

135
00:09:57,057 --> 00:10:00,017
You seem to have learned
more jokes since rejecting a promotion

136
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:02,286
and returning to your previous position.

137
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:04,106
Do you really believe

138
00:10:04,648 --> 00:10:06,608
Assemblyman Ma's death
was a case of sudden death?

139
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,027
There were no visitors on the day he died.

140
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:10,487
The CCTVs, cell phone records,

141
00:10:10,946 --> 00:10:13,031
and computer forensics came up clean.

142
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,035
There's no evidence to say
it wasn't a sudden death,

143
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,705
so don't get involved.

144
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,457
What if it was done
by someone skillful enough

145
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,181
to turn a suicide into an arson-homicide?

146
00:10:37,556 --> 00:10:40,726
How much do you know
about Ma Taehwa's mastermind?

147
00:10:44,605 --> 00:10:46,023
I know one thing for sure.

148
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:48,525
It's not something
someone like you can handle.

149
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,326
Do you still feel regret
over losing your lifeline?

150
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:01,038
How long do you plan on lying, Father?

151
00:11:03,582 --> 00:11:04,958
There's an old saying that goes,

152
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:08,962
"Don't grab a falling blade."

153
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:11,548
Stay out of it

154
00:11:12,174 --> 00:11:13,675
while you still have the chance.

155
00:11:33,028 --> 00:11:34,363
NFS National Forensic Service

156
00:11:37,074 --> 00:11:39,302
What time
did they say the autopsy will begin?

157
00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:44,247
What time does the autopsy begin?

158
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:47,751
What brings you here,
Mr. Head of NOI's Investigation Team?

159
00:11:48,043 --> 00:11:49,920
Are you upset? And you.

160
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:52,756
Why do you keep texting me?
Did you miss me that much?

161
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,634
You're here now. Let's go.

162
00:11:57,594 --> 00:11:59,680
What's wrong with him? I'm here.

163
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:02,599
He knows the victim.

164
00:12:06,478 --> 00:12:08,158
- Let's go.
- All right.

165
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:16,071
You can wait outside
if you're uncomfortable.

166
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:17,656
I'm fine.

167
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:20,379
You said not to get emotionally involved
when it comes to evidence.

168
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,543
Do you remember the cat carcass
you autopsied last time?

169
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:31,962
It was left
in front of this person's home.

170
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,171
The two cases are related.

171
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,649
I'll take it into consideration

172
00:12:34,673 --> 00:12:35,799
- for now.
- Okay.

173
00:12:35,882 --> 00:12:37,682
Let's do an external observation first.

174
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:48,204
On the top of the forehead,

175
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:52,482
a circular depressed fracture about
one inch in diameter, scalp laceration.

176
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:55,402
Wasn't she hit with a hammer then?

177
00:12:55,485 --> 00:12:57,904
Isn't a household hammer
exactly one inch in diameter?

178
00:12:57,988 --> 00:12:59,340
Should I not perform the autopsy?

179
00:12:59,364 --> 00:13:01,204
I think you've already come up
with the answer.

180
00:13:01,283 --> 00:13:03,535
No, we're sorry. Please, sir.

181
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,597
White foreign substance
on half of the face,

182
00:13:06,621 --> 00:13:09,142
centered around the depressed fracture.

183
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,500
There's no moisture.

184
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:13,464
- Scrape it off to run a chemical analysis.
- Yes, ma'am.

185
00:13:14,087 --> 00:13:15,088
Loupe, please.

186
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:34,107
There's redness of the skin.

187
00:13:35,442 --> 00:13:37,482
There was no evidence of a fire
at the scene, right?

188
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:40,030
Yes, that's right. Why? Is it a burn?

189
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:43,325
I'll have a skin biopsy done.

190
00:13:43,658 --> 00:13:45,258
It'll tell us what kind of damage it is.

191
00:13:45,786 --> 00:13:47,746
I'll remove the skin tissue.

192
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:55,229
Let's check for livor mortis.

193
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,534
Livor mortis: Purple discoloration
of the skin after death

194
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,845
There's livor mortis
in the back side of the body,

195
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:06,097
centered around the back and buttocks,

196
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,433
so there was no change in position
after death.

197
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,350
No conjunctival hemorrhage.

198
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,030
The oral and nasal cavities are all clean.

199
00:14:23,073 --> 00:14:24,741
We'll have to open her up to find out.

200
00:14:25,075 --> 00:14:26,409
Scalpel, please.

201
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,839
What is this?

202
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,975
Ribs two to five on the left

203
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,479
and ribs three to six on the right
are fractured.

204
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:55,814
The third and fourth notches
of the sternum are also fractured.

205
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:59,484
She looks fine on the outside,
so why are so many bones broken?

206
00:15:10,996 --> 00:15:12,122
Goodness.

207
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:13,999
Ms. Yun.

208
00:15:39,024 --> 00:15:41,224
Blood volume of about nine fluid ounces.

209
00:15:41,568 --> 00:15:43,904
Why is there no trauma
if she bled so much?

210
00:15:43,987 --> 00:15:46,090
We'll have to figure that out
from here on out.

211
00:15:46,114 --> 00:15:48,116
Let's start with the organs.

212
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:06,217
Left ventricular rupture.

213
00:16:06,301 --> 00:16:09,262
The left ventricle
is the weakest part of the heart.

214
00:16:09,846 --> 00:16:13,016
There's multiple hemorrhaging observed

215
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:14,851
on both lung surfaces too.

216
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:17,371
First the cat, now this.
There must have been a lot of resentment.

217
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:19,773
The bigger the resentment,
the more damage, right?

218
00:16:19,856 --> 00:16:22,400
Too early to make a conclusion.
If it was a beating,

219
00:16:22,484 --> 00:16:24,778
the skin would be covered
with subcutaneous bleeding,

220
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:26,780
commonly known as bruises.

221
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:29,115
However, there's nothing like that at all.

222
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:33,870
On top of that, other organs
such as the liver and kidneys are fine.

223
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:36,289
Only the heart and lungs were ruptured.

224
00:16:36,373 --> 00:16:38,917
How can you cause
the heart and lungs to rupture

225
00:16:39,334 --> 00:16:41,086
without leaving a drop of blood behind?

226
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:44,005
The heart and lungs
have a unique characteristic.

227
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:47,467
They have empty spaces
and are called hollow organs.

228
00:16:48,051 --> 00:16:49,052
They have empty spaces?

229
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:51,763
In the case of a living person,
they're not empty.

230
00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:55,266
The empty space within the heart
is filled with blood,

231
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,353
and the empty space within the lungs
contains the oxygen that we breathe.

232
00:16:58,979 --> 00:17:02,941
But the fact that the damage
was concentrated on those two organs

233
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:04,985
can only mean one thing.

234
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,947
Please prepare an otoscope
to look into the eardrums.

235
00:17:28,508 --> 00:17:31,386
The eardrums in both ears are ruptured.

236
00:17:33,722 --> 00:17:36,099
This complicates matters.

237
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:40,145
This is getting a little frustrating.
Can you explain what's going on?

238
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:43,086
I'm going to send out an SOS.

239
00:17:43,648 --> 00:17:45,442
Let's get a second opinion.

240
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,111
Second Opinion: Getting a new diagnosis
from another expert

241
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:58,975
Hello, this is Kang Doha.

242
00:17:59,998 --> 00:18:01,916
I haven't even unpacked my things yet.

243
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:05,795
All right, I'm on my way.

244
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:10,759
He's probably running over
with excitement.

245
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:13,470
He shouldn't be excited.
Someone passed away.

246
00:18:14,054 --> 00:18:16,264
I suppose that's what happens

247
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,808
when you overcome death about 100 times.

248
00:18:19,392 --> 00:18:20,602
100 times?

249
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,104
Is he friends
with the Grim Reaper or something?

250
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:32,614
You're here.

251
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,967
Why are you calling me
on my first day on the job?

252
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:36,576
All right, say hello.

253
00:18:37,077 --> 00:18:38,161
This is Kang Doha,

254
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:40,830
the new head of the Department
of Forensic Engineering at NFS.

255
00:18:40,914 --> 00:18:43,208
We studied together in the US,
and we were…

256
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:45,585
best friends.

257
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:47,308
These are the detectives in charge today.

258
00:18:47,587 --> 00:18:49,589
- I know them.
- You know them?

259
00:18:49,672 --> 00:18:52,008
- Somewhat.
- "Somewhat"?

260
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:55,261
There was a bomb and everything.
It was a very meaningful encounter.

261
00:18:55,345 --> 00:18:56,846
Let's not meet too often.

262
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,930
It's better that way,
considering our line of work.

263
00:18:59,182 --> 00:19:01,810
Weren't you with the EOD?
Why are you at the NFS now?

264
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:03,913
He's quite talented
in the field of forensic engineering.

265
00:19:03,937 --> 00:19:06,022
I had a hard time
convincing him to come here.

266
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,359
I'm busy.
Where should I start?

267
00:19:10,026 --> 00:19:11,306
There's no trauma at all.

268
00:19:11,361 --> 00:19:13,881
Only the heart and lungs were ruptured,
along with the eardrums.

269
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,324
Ruptured eardrums?
This is interesting.

270
00:19:16,407 --> 00:19:18,284
And there was no blood at the scene.

271
00:19:18,368 --> 00:19:20,495
The blood was likely all in the stomach.

272
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:21,704
Bingo.

273
00:19:21,788 --> 00:19:24,391
The blood doesn't have time
to flow upon instant death.

274
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,415
If your heart doesn't beat,
your blood won't eject.

275
00:19:26,459 --> 00:19:27,520
Ejection: The release of blood
as the heart contracts

276
00:19:27,544 --> 00:19:30,630
Darn it.

277
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,384
This is starting to get
really interesting.

278
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,844
Excuse me.

279
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:39,139
That's enough. This is a murder case.

280
00:19:39,222 --> 00:19:40,699
Did I do something wrong?

281
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,101
You should at least be sympathetic
in front of...

282
00:19:43,184 --> 00:19:46,437
The deceased didn't come
to the NFS for sympathy, did she?

283
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,111
Can you do a 3D bone reconstruction

284
00:19:53,695 --> 00:19:55,280
of the fracture on the forehead?

285
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:56,924
Yes, we can.

286
00:19:56,948 --> 00:20:00,028
3D Bone Reconstruction: Reconstruction
of a bone CT scan into three dimensions

287
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,560
Starting 3D bone reconstruction.

288
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:08,751
Please step to the side.

289
00:20:08,835 --> 00:20:11,838
DATA SCANNING

290
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,425
First of all,
a depressed fracture in the face,

291
00:20:15,508 --> 00:20:16,759
multiple rib fractures,

292
00:20:16,843 --> 00:20:19,403
and the rupture of vital organs,
such as the lungs and the heart,

293
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,348
are all damages
that can be the cause of death.

294
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:23,850
But we'll have to work

295
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:27,114
with the Department of Forensic
Engineering to find the exact cause.

296
00:20:28,229 --> 00:20:30,231
The reconstruction is done.

297
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:31,691
Good work.

298
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:34,235
As I expected.

299
00:20:36,237 --> 00:20:38,072
In most cases,
circular depressed fractures

300
00:20:38,156 --> 00:20:41,117
tend to break in the middle
because of the concentrated force,

301
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,577
but this is a bit different.

302
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,415
Do you see the octagonal shape here?

303
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,918
What kind of weapon
causes this kind of damage?

304
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:51,461
Whatever it is,

305
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:53,922
it isn't a regular claw hammer
or other type of hammer.

306
00:20:54,005 --> 00:20:55,840
Let's go to the scene of the crime.

307
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:57,634
We'll have to check for ourselves to know.

308
00:20:57,717 --> 00:20:59,135
Suit yourself.

309
00:20:59,969 --> 00:21:01,721
I suggest…

310
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:02,964
…that you don't come for fun.

311
00:21:06,768 --> 00:21:08,061
You're an interesting man.

312
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:15,610
Why do they keep leaving first?

313
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:22,158
Let's get that temper under control.

314
00:21:22,242 --> 00:21:23,910
And put a filter on that mouth of yours.

315
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,246
I did.

316
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:28,665
- Yun Hong.
- What?

317
00:21:29,457 --> 00:21:30,750
It's really fun here.

318
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:33,878
- Jeez. Let's go.
- Hey!

319
00:21:33,962 --> 00:21:36,756
Case information

320
00:21:38,675 --> 00:21:40,718
The victim is Yong Soonbok, 58 years old.

321
00:21:40,802 --> 00:21:42,053
She is better known

322
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:45,932
- as the Spring Lady in the complex.
- Spring Lady?

323
00:21:47,267 --> 00:21:50,103
She got the nickname
from springing into a fight

324
00:21:50,186 --> 00:21:52,063
whenever anything happens.

325
00:21:52,146 --> 00:21:54,482
You have to put a sticker on big scraps.

326
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,567
How can you just throw it away like this?

327
00:21:57,318 --> 00:22:00,613
- I don't know anything about stickers.
- It's because of shameless people like you

328
00:22:00,697 --> 00:22:03,324
that our complex
looks like a pile of garbage!

329
00:22:03,408 --> 00:22:04,928
What did you say? "Shameless"?

330
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:07,763
- How dare you talk to me like that!
- Did I say something wrong?

331
00:22:07,787 --> 00:22:09,139
- Yes, you did!
- What's going on?

332
00:22:09,163 --> 00:22:10,933
What about this table?
And this refrigerator?

333
00:22:10,957 --> 00:22:12,309
- This is smaller!
- There's no sticker!

334
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:14,585
- Why do you want a sticker on it?
- And what of it?

335
00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:17,422
Why are you parking
in the disabled parking area?

336
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:19,132
Move your car immediately!

337
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:22,468
<i>Garbage dumping,
parking disputes, smoking,</i>

338
00:22:22,552 --> 00:22:24,846
<i>public property damage,
and noise complaint issues.</i>

339
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,640
She was there for all of it.

340
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:30,435
So it's highly likely
that this case is related

341
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:32,520
to the cat carcass case.

342
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,163
Did you get anything from the cat case?

343
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,400
Ms. Yong was a cat mom who fed stray cats,

344
00:22:37,483 --> 00:22:39,569
so quite a few people didn't like her.

345
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,947
I just received a reply from the NFS.

346
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:44,365
There was car antifreeze

347
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:47,118
among the stomach contents
of the dead cat.

348
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:50,246
So someone
fed the cat antifreeze to kill it?

349
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,690
That's the cause of death for now.

350
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,791
Is she Anna's replacement?

351
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,794
What? Oh, right.
You haven't been properly introduced.

352
00:22:56,878 --> 00:22:59,339
This is Woo Samsoon,
head of the forensics team.

353
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:01,591
- And this is...
- I know all about him.

354
00:23:01,674 --> 00:23:05,094
Jindo… I mean, Detective Jin Hogae.

355
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:08,240
- I've heard a lot about you.
- I look forward to working with you.

356
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:10,826
Did we get anything about her whereabouts
on the day of the incident?

357
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:14,187
If you look at the records
of Ms. Yong's missing cell phone

358
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,898
and CCTV footage
from the store next to the complex,

359
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:19,359
<i>Ms. Yong bought groceries
from the supermarket</i>

360
00:23:19,442 --> 00:23:21,462
<i>and got home around 6:30 p.m.</i>

361
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:22,755
Did she have any visitors that day?

362
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:26,032
The front door was open
and there were only sock prints,

363
00:23:26,115 --> 00:23:27,843
so there's a high chance
the culprit was an acquaintance of hers.

364
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:29,911
The CCTVs are only installed

365
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:33,081
at the entrance
and parking lot of the complex.

366
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:35,809
We can't check if there were
any visitors to her unit that day.

367
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,073
Let's look into what happened
in Building 103 from 18:00,

368
00:23:38,127 --> 00:23:40,546
which was
when she was last confirmed alive,

369
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,256
until the day of the incident,

370
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,635
including the CCTV footage
and dashcam footage.

371
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:49,097
The most entertaining TV to watch
is a CCTV,

372
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:52,016
and the best camera footage
is that of a dashcam.

373
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,700
I'll look through everything thoroughly.

374
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,646
We'll need to thoroughly investigate
the residents of Chundong Villa.

375
00:23:56,729 --> 00:24:00,441
Around 70 people live in Building 103,
the same building as the victim.

376
00:24:00,525 --> 00:24:02,360
That's about 700 residents in total.

377
00:24:03,152 --> 00:24:04,695
They're all suspects in this case.

378
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:06,739
How are we supposed
to investigate all of them?

379
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:08,866
We'll have to narrow it down
to the suspicious ones.

380
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:10,701
I'm telling you that it's impossible.

381
00:24:11,244 --> 00:24:14,330
The people in that complex
are pretty cold.

382
00:24:14,414 --> 00:24:16,642
They say she deserved to die
for being such a rude person.

383
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,334
What do you mean by "rude person"?

384
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:19,919
Don't join in with them, Mr. Baek.

385
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,422
I didn't say that. The residents did.

386
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:30,930
Hey.

387
00:24:32,682 --> 00:24:34,809
I heard you were close to the victim.

388
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:36,519
I can't even attend the meeting.

389
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,023
I get angry and irritated
the more I think about all of this.

390
00:24:41,274 --> 00:24:42,793
How do you hold it in
when you feel this way?

391
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:44,527
Who says I hold it in?

392
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,612
Get angry.

393
00:24:46,696 --> 00:24:49,824
Just get angry and let it out

394
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,507
so that the investigation goes smoothly.

395
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:55,037
But you should sit this one out.

396
00:24:56,289 --> 00:24:58,458
- Sit this one out?
- Why are you surprised?

397
00:24:58,541 --> 00:25:01,302
People of special relations are excluded
from investigative personnel.

398
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:12,805
The safest Taewon,
respected and beloved Taewon Police

399
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:20,730
What? You didn't go home yet?

400
00:25:23,357 --> 00:25:25,443
I heard you gave Myeongpil

401
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,490
a pyramid scheme case with 318 witnesses.

402
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:34,452
Everyone in that complex
has decided to keep their mouths shut.

403
00:25:34,744 --> 00:25:36,664
How do you plan to investigate
without a partner?

404
00:25:36,746 --> 00:25:38,226
Chundong Villa management recruitment

405
00:25:39,081 --> 00:25:41,501
Investigation is a comprehensive art.

406
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:44,086
Let's make this case a movie.

407
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,923
What are you talking about?

408
00:25:47,006 --> 00:25:49,634
I get nervous
every time you say something like that.

409
00:25:49,717 --> 00:25:51,612
I'll be working offsite starting tomorrow
so don't look for me.

410
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:53,346
Wait…

411
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,724
- Yes?
<i>- I found Ma Taehwa.</i>

412
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,017
<i>Jindo Dog,</i>

413
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,228
I think you're wrong this time.

414
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:01,479
That bastard…

415
00:26:03,523 --> 00:26:06,192
<i>may actually be on his deathbed.</i>

416
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:08,778
That would be a relief,

417
00:26:09,195 --> 00:26:11,948
but have someone watch him just in case.

418
00:26:14,408 --> 00:26:18,496
Chundong

419
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,680
- Follow me.
- Okay.

420
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,793
Goodness.

421
00:26:23,876 --> 00:26:25,962
You just need to do
what Mr. Kim did before he quit,

422
00:26:26,045 --> 00:26:27,672
so it won't be difficult.

423
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:31,259
You need only ask
and I can do the grunt work as well.

424
00:26:31,926 --> 00:26:35,054
But why is a young man like you
trying to do this kind of work?

425
00:26:35,638 --> 00:26:37,199
I'm not cut out for an office job.

426
00:26:37,223 --> 00:26:39,725
I want to keep this job for a long time.

427
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,102
Speaking of which,

428
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:44,355
I'll need to stay informed
about the residents,

429
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,482
so do you have any documents
I can look at?

430
00:26:46,566 --> 00:26:50,444
Look at you trying to get a head start
on your first day.

431
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,864
You'll get that information
after three months of probation

432
00:26:53,948 --> 00:26:55,428
and once you're a full-time employee.

433
00:26:55,575 --> 00:26:57,702
Do a lap around the area and come back.

434
00:26:58,327 --> 00:26:59,495
- Go on.
- Yes, sir.

435
00:26:59,579 --> 00:27:01,059
Ah.

436
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:05,543
He's so uptight.

437
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,963
Hello.

438
00:27:10,715 --> 00:27:11,757
Hello.

439
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:15,469
I know I shouldn't say this,

440
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:19,599
but the whole complex has gotten quiet
without Spring Lady around.

441
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,309
The cats are all gone too.

442
00:27:21,392 --> 00:27:23,036
Did the police come by again?

443
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,147
The resident of Unit 404 is a detective
at Taewon Police Station.

444
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,232
He seemed to be close to Spring Lady.

445
00:27:28,316 --> 00:27:30,818
Oh, is that so?

446
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:34,780
At least the neighborhood
is going to be quiet.

447
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:38,075
That's what I'm saying.

448
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,553
- I'll be on my way now.
- Okay.

449
00:27:39,577 --> 00:27:41,037
All right, go ahead.

450
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:47,335
What the heck?

451
00:27:48,711 --> 00:27:49,712
You must be new here.

452
00:27:50,338 --> 00:27:52,798
Yes, I am.

453
00:27:52,882 --> 00:27:55,635
They're so giddy
now that Spring Lady isn't around.

454
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:57,386
Why?

455
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:01,682
That old man smokes every night
and throws cigarette butts everywhere.

456
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,727
Spring Lady would scold him
if she were here.

457
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:06,309
There will be

458
00:28:06,354 --> 00:28:07,772
a mountain of cigarette butts now.

459
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:13,402
So Mr. Cigarette and Spring Lady
weren't on good terms, right?

460
00:28:13,486 --> 00:28:17,698
No one here was on good terms
with Spring Lady.

461
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,034
I see.

462
00:28:26,374 --> 00:28:28,334
Gosh, she startled me.

463
00:28:34,465 --> 00:28:36,801
- What is that lady doing?
- Leave her be.

464
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,470
No one can stop Princess Granny.

465
00:28:40,388 --> 00:28:42,223
She's not sane.

466
00:28:42,306 --> 00:28:43,683
It seems that way.

467
00:28:43,766 --> 00:28:46,161
She collects the trash
left by everyone in the complex

468
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,603
and keeps it at her place.

469
00:28:48,354 --> 00:28:52,400
No trash is safe from Princess Granny.

470
00:28:55,403 --> 00:28:59,240
The complex is done for
now that Spring Lady isn't around.

471
00:29:02,785 --> 00:29:05,621
Is it really that serious?

472
00:29:06,205 --> 00:29:08,791
Gosh, how frustrating. Follow me.

473
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:17,842
See? I knew she would park there.

474
00:29:19,176 --> 00:29:22,430
She parks there despite not having
a disability parking permit.

475
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:25,599
She hasn't learned her lesson
even after Spring Lady scolded her.

476
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:28,329
Hey!

477
00:29:28,644 --> 00:29:31,397
Why can't I park wherever I want
when I own so many units here?

478
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,483
You still haven't learned your lesson
despite paying so many fines.

479
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:38,779
All right. Since you want
to keep adding to the national budget,

480
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,614
I'll go ahead and report you then.

481
00:29:40,698 --> 00:29:43,200
- What are you doing? Hey!
- All right.

482
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:45,262
- Wait! No, no.
- Stop taking photos!

483
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:46,829
- Goodness, ma'am.
- Move!

484
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:49,123
- Stop taking photos!
- Get out of the way!

485
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:51,935
- I'll take care of it, so move your car.
- Stop taking photos!

486
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,270
- Stop taking photos.
- Hey.

487
00:29:53,294 --> 00:29:54,438
Move your car.

488
00:29:54,462 --> 00:29:56,130
- You'll get a ticket.
- I'll move, okay?

489
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,510
How do you know all of this?

490
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:05,389
You'll need to know all this
if you want to be a part of management.

491
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:10,686
Hey, do you want something to drink?

492
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:14,106
Witness statements
Festival CCTV records

493
00:30:26,952 --> 00:30:27,953
Taewon Fire Station

494
00:30:28,037 --> 00:30:29,163
Excuse me.

495
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:30,372
Hello.

496
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:33,000
There's something I'd like to ask.

497
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:36,086
Sure, go ahead.

498
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:45,387
Who do you think
hated the Spring Lady the most?

499
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:48,057
That would be…

500
00:30:49,308 --> 00:30:52,102
Unit 301, the something enemy.

501
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,437
Sworn enemy.

502
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:56,232
Anyway, it's the unit
right below Spring Lady's.

503
00:30:56,565 --> 00:30:57,942
There he is now.

504
00:31:01,821 --> 00:31:03,197
The student in Unit 301

505
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,133
was retaking
his college entrance exam last year

506
00:31:05,157 --> 00:31:06,575
and Spring Lady started

507
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,911
doing laundry at 2 a.m.,
the morning of the exam.

508
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,081
Come out.

509
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:14,044
Come out! Come out!

510
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,838
My son failed his exam because of you!

511
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,840
How is that my fault?

512
00:31:20,923 --> 00:31:23,509
He's just stupid
because he takes after his parents.

513
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,594
You watch your mouth!

514
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:29,431
Did I or did I not tell you
to keep quiet after 6 p.m.?

515
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:31,308
Move out if you're not going to!

516
00:31:31,433 --> 00:31:35,312
I put my everything
into this place, including a loan,

517
00:31:35,396 --> 00:31:37,439
so I have no money to move out!

518
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:39,233
You move out!

519
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:41,419
Oh, my goodness.

520
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:44,130
- Goodness, I'm going to die.
- Over here. This way.

521
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,841
Goodness, I'm going to die.

522
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:48,284
Yujung, it's late. Go home.

523
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:50,911
- Goodness me.
- What are you all doing?

524
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:52,722
- One moment, please. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

525
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,683
- Yes, yes. Hold on.
- Excuse me.

526
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:59,003
My goodness.
Call the police, not an ambulance!

527
00:31:59,086 --> 00:32:01,672
Come arrest this murderer!

528
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,592
Murderer? You're the murderer!

529
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:07,553
- You cause us trouble every night!
- Sir, please.

530
00:32:07,636 --> 00:32:09,972
Someone save me!

531
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:11,765
Please stop.

532
00:32:11,849 --> 00:32:13,769
I think I'm bleeding a lot.

533
00:32:13,809 --> 00:32:16,645
- I'm hurting everywhere.
- I can't see either.

534
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:21,108
- It was an absolute mess.
- Seriously.

535
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,628
Why weren't the police called?
There were no records.

536
00:32:23,652 --> 00:32:25,532
The person in the lower unit
wanted to let it go

537
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,740
since they had a student
studying for his exams.

538
00:32:31,327 --> 00:32:32,453
Okay, thanks.

539
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,264
- Continue what you were doing.
- Okay, bye.

540
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:36,008
- You can stay seated.
- Bye.

541
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,000
The security logs would have
details of what happened.

542
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:49,303
But he failed to get into college,

543
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:53,098
and now he's trying for a third time.

544
00:32:54,183 --> 00:32:55,184
Is that so?

545
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,519
The entrance exams aren't far off,

546
00:32:57,603 --> 00:32:59,438
so he's just been studying at home.

547
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:01,106
He's probably very sensitive right now.

548
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:05,069
Unit 301
may have killed the cat too, Mister.

549
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:10,741
Why do you keep calling me that?

550
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:11,992
Then what do I call you?

551
00:33:14,078 --> 00:33:15,438
I guess there aren't many options.

552
00:33:16,038 --> 00:33:17,665
Call me "Uncle."

553
00:33:17,748 --> 00:33:19,267
How can I have an uncle
when I don't have a mom?

554
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:20,876
Fine, just call me "Mister."

555
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,671
Hey, I'll keep buying you these,
so do you want to meet up?

556
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:27,216
I'm not interested in older guys.

557
00:33:35,057 --> 00:33:36,266
Hey, Jindo Dog.

558
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:37,893
You said you were making art.

559
00:33:37,977 --> 00:33:39,577
Why are you messing around in the alley?

560
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,689
What are you doing with a little kid?

561
00:33:41,772 --> 00:33:44,650
She's an informant. My spy.

562
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:45,901
She's my partner.

563
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:49,446
Goodness. Just what are you doing?

564
00:33:51,323 --> 00:33:52,324
Looks like he's here.

565
00:34:15,222 --> 00:34:16,598
Is he trying to be funny or what?

566
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,351
He has a long way to go
to become a civilian.

567
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:21,761
Are you not going to go check?

568
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,314
I have to go on patrol.

569
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,987
Why is he method-acting
when he's working undercover?

570
00:34:30,654 --> 00:34:32,740
What's wrong with him?

571
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,078
What are you doing?

572
00:34:38,162 --> 00:34:40,706
Why? Did you not collect footprints yet?

573
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:42,291
What?

574
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,460
Of course we did.

575
00:34:44,543 --> 00:34:46,920
Go ahead and kick whatever you want.

576
00:34:47,004 --> 00:34:49,644
He only recently became a civilian.
Please try to be understanding.

577
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,676
I'm not sure if I can.

578
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,655
It's this house.
This way, please.

579
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,182
Right. Chundong Villa,
Building 103 Unit 403.

580
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:02,811
I'll start enforcing the eviction warrant.

581
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:03,955
- Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

582
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:06,273
Wait a second. What are you doing?

583
00:35:06,356 --> 00:35:07,483
The tenant here

584
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:10,861
was behind on rent and kept holding out
even after confiscating the deposit.

585
00:35:10,944 --> 00:35:15,616
I barely managed
to get through the eviction suit.

586
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,160
The new tenant
is going to move in tomorrow,

587
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:21,872
so everything
has to be cleared out by tonight.

588
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:25,667
This is an active crime scene.
We can't empty the house right now.

589
00:35:25,751 --> 00:35:27,551
If the new tenants can't move in,

590
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,380
are you going to compensate me?

591
00:35:31,423 --> 00:35:32,591
Me?

592
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,719
Hello, ma'am.

593
00:35:36,512 --> 00:35:38,430
In that case,

594
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,850
can you let us
take the kitchen with us for a bit?

595
00:35:41,934 --> 00:35:43,894
What are you saying?

596
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:45,896
The new tenants are moving in tomorrow!

597
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:48,023
It'll only take about 30 minutes.

598
00:35:50,275 --> 00:35:51,735
What are you going to do?

599
00:35:52,444 --> 00:35:56,115
We're about to lose the crime scene,
so let's just take it with us.

600
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:58,117
You're going to move a kitchen
in 30 minutes?

601
00:35:58,617 --> 00:36:01,120
I have a plan, so just stay put.

602
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,791
Please, ma'am.

603
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:07,918
My goodness.

604
00:36:10,963 --> 00:36:12,565
My goodness,
I'm the last one here.

605
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:15,092
Gosh, it's cold.

606
00:36:26,395 --> 00:36:32,776
Management office

607
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:41,785
You bastard.

608
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:51,795
What the heck?

609
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,842
Are you kidding me? What are you doing?

610
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,770
What are you doing here?

611
00:36:59,803 --> 00:37:02,240
The most effective interrogation strategy
is to become one with the organization.

612
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,933
- What are you doing?
- What are you saying? Move.

613
00:37:05,017 --> 00:37:06,268
Look at this.

614
00:37:07,436 --> 00:37:09,021
I was looking for this!

615
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,272
Complaint Ledger

616
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:12,458
The residents' information. Uncuff these.

617
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,318
That hurts.

618
00:37:16,695 --> 00:37:17,905
I don't have the key.

619
00:37:19,281 --> 00:37:21,158
- What?
- I don't have it.

620
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,952
Earlier, when you hit me… I don't have it.

621
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:40,177
You said you would be done in 30 minutes.

622
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,429
What are you doing?

623
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:45,933
You hear that sound, right?

624
00:37:46,725 --> 00:37:49,728
We're rendering a 3D image

625
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,772
of the kitchen by scanning…

626
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:53,941
You won't understand even if I explain it.

627
00:37:55,734 --> 00:37:57,945
That woman causes me trouble
even in death.

628
00:37:58,028 --> 00:37:59,279
How annoying!

629
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,615
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

630
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:04,910
By the way…

631
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:10,749
…you must be having a hard time
with the eviction suit and everything.

632
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:15,420
I deal with many shameless tenants.

633
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,233
What's the difference
between the lease and sale price?

634
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,017
I bet the demand for lease is high

635
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,803
since the means of transportation
isn't too bad.

636
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:26,556
It's about 30 million won.

637
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,308
30 million won?

638
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,770
That's not bad.

639
00:38:34,189 --> 00:38:35,190
Come with me.

640
00:38:35,649 --> 00:38:37,192
Goodness!

641
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:47,869
Management office

642
00:38:49,288 --> 00:38:50,872
Here it is, Unit 301.

643
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:54,293
"Frequent complaints,
violent, abusive language."

644
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:56,712
"Not a high school senior,
first and second exams failed."

645
00:38:56,795 --> 00:38:59,232
"Possibility of third and fourth retakes."
Something's suspicious.

646
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:01,341
Unit 301 moved in four years ago,

647
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:05,804
and they've made various complaints
against Spring Lady ever since.

648
00:39:05,887 --> 00:39:08,265
A total of 476 complaints.

649
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,352
The entrance exams aren't far off,

650
00:39:12,436 --> 00:39:14,313
so he's just been studying at home.

651
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,816
Unit 301
may have killed the cat too, Mister.

652
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,445
Kim Youngju, Building 103 Unit 202.

653
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:23,256
She complained about Spring Lady
being a cat mom.

654
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,157
She filed 68 malicious complaints

655
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,701
over the past year
through the management office.

656
00:39:27,784 --> 00:39:29,703
<i>Mr. Cigarette,</i>

657
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:32,414
<i>Building 103 Unit 104, Gong Dooeon.</i>

658
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:35,500
<i>Foreign car,
license plate number 4885, Unit 503.</i>

659
00:39:35,584 --> 00:39:37,961
<i>Princess Granny, Unit 305.</i>

660
00:39:38,587 --> 00:39:42,090
Kwak Soonja was reported 29 times
for disability parking area violations.

661
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:44,814
If she was fined 100,000 won each time,
that's about 3 million won.

662
00:39:44,885 --> 00:39:47,471
This is the log
for the day of the incident.

663
00:39:47,554 --> 00:39:48,638
And it says,

664
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:51,075
<i>"The cats were crying a lot,"
and that was during a patrol at 9:15 p.m.</i>

665
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:54,561
Unit 202's complaint states
that Spring Lady left food for the cats

666
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:55,812
every night around 8:30 p.m.

667
00:39:55,896 --> 00:39:58,940
So she didn't leave any food that night.

668
00:39:59,524 --> 00:40:01,276
We're narrowing down
the time of the crime,

669
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,279
from 6:30 to 9:15 p.m.

670
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:05,697
The key suspects so far.

671
00:40:05,781 --> 00:40:07,324
<i>Unit 301, noise complaints.</i>

672
00:40:07,866 --> 00:40:09,284
<i>Unit 202, complaints about cats.</i>

673
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:11,305
<i>Unit 104, complaints about cigarettes.</i>

674
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:13,038
<i>Unit 503, parking disputes.</i>

675
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:15,332
<i>Unit 305, trash disposal disputes.</i>

676
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,919
These five people in Building 103
gain something from the victim's death.

677
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,713
That's right, so we should
investigate them one by one.

678
00:40:21,797 --> 00:40:23,090
Where are you going?

679
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:25,801
Are you not going on patrol?

680
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,929
Find the key first, you bastard.

681
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:30,389
- Make a copy.
- Right, copy.

682
00:40:30,472 --> 00:40:31,848
Hold on, this…

683
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:40,302
Are you setting up a restaurant?

684
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:42,859
Is today your first day as a couple?

685
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:44,736
We have our reasons.

686
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:49,616
Detective Jin and Detective Gong!

687
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,202
You need us to remove the handcuffs?

688
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,787
Please don't move.

689
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,848
They said not to move.

690
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,291
You look good together. Get closer.

691
00:40:58,375 --> 00:41:00,544
If the boyfriend could smile
for the camera.

692
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,631
Let's go.

693
00:41:05,757 --> 00:41:06,758
What a jerk.

694
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:14,534
- Dongwoo, get a good grip.
- One moment, please.

695
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,998
- No.
- It's okay. Come here, please.

696
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,645
- No.
- Please stay put for a second.

697
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:21,189
Do it quickly.
It'll only take five seconds.

698
00:41:21,273 --> 00:41:23,567
Wait, no. Stop it. Don't!

699
00:41:27,696 --> 00:41:28,697
That's enough.

700
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,282
Stay still.

701
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,470
Why would you ring the doorbell

702
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:36,455
- at this hour?
- Who is it?

703
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:38,707
We're from the management office.

704
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:40,685
You're from the management office.

705
00:41:40,709 --> 00:41:42,210
What has become of you?

706
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:43,879
You wanted to come.

707
00:41:43,962 --> 00:41:45,130
What…

708
00:41:45,797 --> 00:41:46,840
What brings you here?

709
00:41:47,299 --> 00:41:48,383
Oh, right.

710
00:41:48,967 --> 00:41:50,302
Hello.

711
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:53,572
We're here for a home visit.
You know the detective here, right?

712
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,057
I heard your son
was studying for his exams.

713
00:41:56,141 --> 00:41:58,852
Yes, he's studying right now.
Is something wrong?

714
00:41:58,935 --> 00:42:02,147
We'd like to ask for your cooperation.
We'd like to take some DNA.

715
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:04,024
What? DNA?

716
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,942
Are you suspecting me?

717
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,587
Dad, be quiet!

718
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:09,237
No, I'm not.

719
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,656
- No.
- But I will start to suspect you

720
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,325
if you don't let us take your DNA.

721
00:42:13,408 --> 00:42:16,661
I heard you fought a lot
with the upper unit over noise complaints.

722
00:42:18,788 --> 00:42:19,956
Well…

723
00:42:21,666 --> 00:42:22,959
I'll go in then.

724
00:42:24,044 --> 00:42:26,129
Apologies for how late it is.

725
00:42:28,673 --> 00:42:30,800
<i>In order to create
a harmonious complex,</i>

726
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:34,679
<i>we must make common living etiquette
a daily routine.</i>

727
00:42:34,763 --> 00:42:39,184
<i>Please use slippers indoors
and walk lightly.</i>

728
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:42,103
<i>Running washing machines, showers,
and dishwashers late at night</i>

729
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,564
<i>may disturb neighbors.</i>

730
00:42:52,113 --> 00:42:54,074
Look, Detective.

731
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:57,494
You don't understand,
because you don't live in this unit.

732
00:42:57,577 --> 00:42:59,817
We heard her footsteps every night.

733
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:02,082
She took six showers every night

734
00:43:02,165 --> 00:43:04,125
and flushed the toilet over 100 times.

735
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,461
This can drive you crazy, you know?

736
00:43:07,212 --> 00:43:10,757
So I asked her several times
to refrain from making all the noise,

737
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:13,635
but are you really going
to suspect me for that?

738
00:43:13,718 --> 00:43:16,638
You can make your statement
at the police station.

739
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:18,841
This is insane. Look here.

740
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:21,893
Look at my wife.
She looks sick, doesn't she?

741
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,646
She suffers from neurosis

742
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:27,023
and has to take medication
for panic attacks.

743
00:43:27,107 --> 00:43:29,150
My son's ears are constantly ringing,

744
00:43:29,234 --> 00:43:31,945
and he's losing his hearing
because of the noise upstairs.

745
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:35,198
Dad! I can't study because it's so noisy.

746
00:43:35,282 --> 00:43:37,617
Sorry, we disturbed your studying,
didn't we?

747
00:43:38,201 --> 00:43:39,578
No, it's not that.

748
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:42,622
I hear heavy footsteps
from upstairs again.

749
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,332
Jeez.

750
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,335
I don't hear anything from here.

751
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,967
They're so inconsiderate.

752
00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:55,468
Is the NFS not done yet?

753
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:57,178
What are they doing…

754
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:00,479
What are you doing?
Go up there and do something!

755
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,434
Excuse me, please go take a look.

756
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:06,896
Okay, I'll go check it out
since I'm from management.

757
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:10,817
- He'll take care of it.
- Jeez.

758
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:20,744
Hey!
Are you guys breaking the house?

759
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:35,342
What's going on up there?
Is someone exercising up there?

760
00:44:35,425 --> 00:44:39,346
<i>There's nobody up here in Unit 401.</i>

761
00:44:40,805 --> 00:44:43,099
- Ask when they're going to be done.
- Right, okay.

762
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:44,893
Then what's this sound?

763
00:44:45,477 --> 00:44:47,395
<i>There's no one here.</i>

764
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:50,190
What? But they're flushing the toilet
right now.

765
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:52,609
But…

766
00:44:54,194 --> 00:44:55,445
<i>See?</i>

767
00:44:57,781 --> 00:44:58,865
What…

768
00:44:58,948 --> 00:45:01,409
What is going on?

769
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:05,664
I really thought Spring Lady was lying.

770
00:45:05,747 --> 00:45:08,458
Hey, lady! Listen here.

771
00:45:09,292 --> 00:45:10,652
You're doing it on purpose, right?

772
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:12,647
You only choose days
when my kid has his mock exams.

773
00:45:12,671 --> 00:45:14,005
What are you saying?

774
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:15,769
I was doing needlework
by myself yesterday.

775
00:45:15,799 --> 00:45:17,384
What are you on about?

776
00:45:17,467 --> 00:45:20,428
Don't try to get away by lying!
You were making noise all night!

777
00:45:20,512 --> 00:45:22,013
You're a crazy man.

778
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,182
Where are you going? Come here!

779
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,106
Where is the sound coming from?

780
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:39,322
My gosh, this is going to drive me insane.

781
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:42,075
I'll get a sound sample
to submit for analysis.

782
00:45:42,158 --> 00:45:43,201
Be quiet, please.

783
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,055
The sound you heard in Unit 301
of Chundong Villa isn't from another unit.

784
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:05,682
Then what is it?

785
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,144
Bang, bang, bang, bang.

786
00:46:10,145 --> 00:46:12,313
All the wavelengths
are exactly the same, right?

787
00:46:12,981 --> 00:46:15,567
There's no way someone's footsteps
can be this consistent.

788
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,860
They're not a robot.

789
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,779
Play it.

790
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:21,156
And the flushing.

791
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:26,327
The amplitude, frequency,
and wavelength are all the same.

792
00:46:26,411 --> 00:46:28,329
Aren't they usually the same?

793
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:31,249
Not everything that gets flushed
sounds the same.

794
00:46:32,667 --> 00:46:34,711
So I looked into it,

795
00:46:35,211 --> 00:46:37,547
and I found that it was
a sound sample of noises.

796
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:40,216
- A sound sample of noises?
- What is that?

797
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,927
Play it.

798
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:47,252
The vibration you hear in between…

799
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,744
…that's the sound
of an air conditioner's condenser unit…

800
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:53,313
…a golf ball, a bowling ball,

801
00:46:53,938 --> 00:46:55,690
a vacuum cleaner…

802
00:46:55,774 --> 00:46:57,501
…and the sound of a ghost.

803
00:46:57,525 --> 00:46:59,736
Gosh, they went to great lengths.

804
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,362
Darn it.

805
00:47:02,113 --> 00:47:05,575
Then can we figure out
where the sounds are coming from?

806
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:07,076
In a villa with these walls,

807
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,997
the walls absorb the sound energy
from all sides and distribute it.

808
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:13,875
In truth, it's almost impossible
to find the source.

809
00:47:14,709 --> 00:47:17,670
But they're normally set up in bathrooms.

810
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:21,216
All the pipes are connected,
so it's easier for the sound to spread.

811
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,301
Bathrooms?

812
00:47:23,968 --> 00:47:25,929
- Thank you.
- Where are you going?

813
00:47:28,306 --> 00:47:29,682
Good job, Ms. Samsoon.

814
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:36,272
Whoever it is, they started
a conflict over noises, right?

815
00:47:37,023 --> 00:47:38,566
What terrible people.

816
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,985
It can be anyone besides Unit 301.

817
00:47:41,069 --> 00:47:43,112
We've only expanded the pool of suspects.

818
00:47:43,363 --> 00:47:46,574
Ms. Yong must have been
so frustrated for being falsely accused.

819
00:47:46,866 --> 00:47:49,869
Look into Kwak Soonja,
the one with the tenants.

820
00:47:50,578 --> 00:47:54,123
Getting an eviction warrant
immediately after the victim's death

821
00:47:54,707 --> 00:47:56,000
is very strange.

822
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,020
We already identified her as the lady

823
00:47:58,044 --> 00:47:59,522
who illegally parks
in the disability parking area.

824
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,256
You probably didn't get her DNA.

825
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:02,924
Here's a present from me.

826
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:07,595
This coffee shop…

827
00:48:08,221 --> 00:48:09,514
has a nice atmosphere.

828
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:12,577
Yes, it does.

829
00:48:12,642 --> 00:48:13,768
Go ahead.

830
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,144
- Go on.
- Okay.

831
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:17,522
- Excuse me.
- Cheers?

832
00:48:18,022 --> 00:48:21,317
Thank you for buying me a drink.

833
00:48:24,153 --> 00:48:25,947
Okay.

834
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:29,033
Here, look at this.

835
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:30,317
- Why?
- What is it?

836
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:33,621
Remember how the student in Unit 301
is supposedly losing his hearing?

837
00:48:33,705 --> 00:48:35,707
Normal noise can't cause that.

838
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,625
So I looked into it and found this.

839
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:39,794
A "bone-shaking" bone conduction speaker.

840
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,672
It shakes everything, including the bones.

841
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:43,840
It's "bone-shaking."

842
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:46,009
"A speaker to multiply inter-floor noise."

843
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,638
So the culprit must have
gotten rid of the evidence already.

844
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:52,922
The police have been
in and out of the place.

845
00:48:52,974 --> 00:48:55,560
Darn it.
I thought we finally got something.

846
00:48:55,643 --> 00:48:56,853
Get rid of the evidence.

847
00:48:57,937 --> 00:49:00,815
That's right,
they must have thrown it away.

848
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,777
<i>No trash is safe from Princess Granny.</i>

849
00:49:04,861 --> 00:49:05,862
All right!

850
00:49:06,321 --> 00:49:07,697
Investigation is mindless legwork.

851
00:49:08,281 --> 00:49:10,450
- Get the equipment.
- Okay, let's go.

852
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,703
Those two. Wait up.

853
00:49:13,786 --> 00:49:15,747

00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,903

870
00:49:58,998 --> 00:50:00,184
- Come in.
- Okay.

871
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,268
Be careful!

872
00:50:01,292 --> 00:50:02,436
- Don't step on that.
- Hello, ma'am.

873
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,146
- Don't step on anything!
- All right.

874
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,421
- All right.
- Watch it.

875
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:07,840
- Don't touch anything!
- What is all this?

876
00:50:07,924 --> 00:50:11,469
It'll break!
It's going to break! No, stop!

877
00:50:11,552 --> 00:50:13,638
- No, don't touch anything.
- My goodness.

878
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:15,921
Hold on, follow the path. The path.

879
00:50:16,224 --> 00:50:18,726
Oh, child. You're here.

880
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:21,187
Honey.

881
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:22,689
Chul, your father is here.

882
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,071
Father.

883
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:33,783
You shouldn't live like that, Mister.

884
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:49,340
Head of Department of Forensic Engineering
Kang Doha

885
00:50:52,677 --> 00:50:55,888
The analysis of the substance
on Ms. Yong Soonbok's face detected

886
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:58,516
starch, dextrin, sugar, and pentosan.

887
00:50:58,975 --> 00:51:00,977
In other words, cooked rice.

888
00:51:01,686 --> 00:51:02,729
Cooked rice?

889
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:04,856
To be exact, scorched rice.

890
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:07,525
I doubt someone hit her
with a rice paddle.

891
00:51:07,608 --> 00:51:09,527
Why did she have rice on her face?

892
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,197
I'm sure that wasn't the case.

893
00:51:14,824 --> 00:51:16,034
Cooked rice…

894
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:20,580
Cooked rice.

895
00:51:21,247 --> 00:51:22,749
Are you getting something?

896
00:51:22,832 --> 00:51:24,417
All this talk about scorched rice…

897
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:28,004
makes me want to eat
<i>nurungji samgyetang</i> now.

898
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,721
Let's go together.

899
00:51:39,307 --> 00:51:40,600
That sounds good.

900
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:55,364
There's something long over there.

901
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:57,200
- Get it, you punk.
- Get it, you punk.

902
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:58,409
Don't copy me.

903
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:01,204
- Can you reach it?
- Yes.

904
00:52:01,662 --> 00:52:03,289
Here you go.

905
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:08,312
This is a bone conduction speaker.
When did you pick this up?

906
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:12,673
Oh, that? I nabbed it last night!

907
00:52:12,757 --> 00:52:15,134
See? I told you
they would throw it away immediately.

908
00:52:15,718 --> 00:52:18,363
We're going to take this. It could be
an important piece of evidence...

909
00:52:18,387 --> 00:52:20,473
Says who? Who says you can take it?

910
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:22,058
- How dare you?
- Wait, ma'am.

911
00:52:22,141 --> 00:52:24,143
- Hey, don't let her touch it.
- Put that down!

912
00:52:24,227 --> 00:52:26,187
Honey.

913
00:52:27,021 --> 00:52:28,856
What are you going to do with that?

914
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,195
I'll clean everything up,

915
00:52:34,278 --> 00:52:36,489
so let's just throw that thing away, okay?

916
00:52:36,572 --> 00:52:40,451
I think we need to discuss some things.

917
00:52:41,035 --> 00:52:42,787
You were cherishing those as well.

918
00:52:43,746 --> 00:52:45,426
You were cherishing them.

919
00:52:48,626 --> 00:52:49,669
Honey…

920
00:52:51,629 --> 00:52:52,630
Come on.

921
00:53:01,973 --> 00:53:02,974
Ah.

922
00:53:03,891 --> 00:53:06,352
Thank you for your cooperation.

923
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:08,312
You're a great young man.

924
00:53:11,357 --> 00:53:13,234
- You're welcome.
- All right then.

925
00:53:13,317 --> 00:53:14,797
The police will take their leave now.

926
00:53:15,528 --> 00:53:17,530
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

927
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:30,835
Did you come out of a forest?
Look at your hair.

928
00:53:33,379 --> 00:53:34,547
What is this?

929
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:36,257
Goodness.

930
00:53:39,969 --> 00:53:42,722
How can a girl's hair look like this?
You should wash your hair.

931
00:53:44,098 --> 00:53:45,099
Okay?

932
00:53:46,517 --> 00:53:47,685
I'm going to cut it now.

933
00:53:48,269 --> 00:53:49,896
Gosh, what is this?

934
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:52,356
All right.

935
00:53:57,737 --> 00:53:58,779
What's wrong?

936
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:00,823
Is it because I cut your hair?

937
00:54:00,907 --> 00:54:03,993
I miss Spring Lady.

938
00:54:04,076 --> 00:54:06,412
I miss her a lot.

939
00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:20,176
Oh, that's cold.

940
00:54:20,843 --> 00:54:25,890
A woman's hair must always be pretty.

941
00:54:33,689 --> 00:54:35,191
You want to take a look?

942
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,986
Go ahead and eat up.

943
00:54:46,702 --> 00:54:49,288
Don't cry. I understand how you feel.

944
00:54:53,376 --> 00:54:55,086
You're just saying that because I'm a kid.

945
00:54:55,628 --> 00:54:57,964
There's someone I miss too.

946
00:55:01,217 --> 00:55:03,552
Can you not see them again?

947
00:55:06,389 --> 00:55:07,598
It's not that,

948
00:55:09,183 --> 00:55:10,643
but it's similar.

949
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:17,692
Was there an accident?

950
00:55:17,775 --> 00:55:20,045
- Honey!
- Someone call an ambulance.

951
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:21,755
Honey.

952
00:55:21,779 --> 00:55:23,340
- Wake up!
- What should we do?

953
00:55:23,364 --> 00:55:25,509
- Someone call an ambulance first!
- Anyone!

954
00:55:28,327 --> 00:55:30,887
- Move out of the way!
- Please move!

955
00:55:45,428 --> 00:55:46,804
One, two, three!

956
00:56:05,031 --> 00:56:06,032
Seol?

957
00:56:06,574 --> 00:56:07,575
Yes?

958
00:56:07,658 --> 00:56:09,018
Do you want some tea?

959
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:10,995
Sure.

960
00:56:37,897 --> 00:56:39,357
- Seol.
- Yes?

961
00:56:39,982 --> 00:56:42,568
Should I tell you a story from my past?

962
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:48,866
There was a time

963
00:56:49,742 --> 00:56:51,535
when it was really tough being a nurse.

964
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:54,163
I was going to give it all up and quit.

965
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:59,043
I decided to stay one more day,

966
00:57:00,211 --> 00:57:03,255
and that's the day you came.

967
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:07,510
I held…

968
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:11,263
this tiny baby in my arms…

969
00:57:13,808 --> 00:57:17,770
<i>and just like that,
all my worries vanished.</i>

970
00:57:19,313 --> 00:57:20,773
You're a strong baby.

971
00:57:21,482 --> 00:57:22,900
You made it.

972
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:31,617
Since you came here on a snowy day,
I should call you "Seol."

973
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,744
Song Seol.

974
00:57:36,163 --> 00:57:37,665
I made it this far

975
00:57:38,499 --> 00:57:40,126
with that strength.

976
00:57:42,378 --> 00:57:44,130
And that's how my daughter, Seol,

977
00:57:45,214 --> 00:57:47,466
is able to sit across from me right now.

978
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:51,220
Mom.

979
00:57:53,514 --> 00:57:55,558
It's okay to quit

980
00:57:56,475 --> 00:57:58,018
if it's too hard and painful.

981
00:57:59,019 --> 00:58:00,646
When your mind is unstable,

982
00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:02,148
you don't have to do anything.

983
00:58:02,231 --> 00:58:03,357
Don't try so hard.

984
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:05,985
For me…

985
00:58:09,196 --> 00:58:10,364
and…

986
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,452
Dojin,

987
00:58:15,786 --> 00:58:17,455
what we want to protect the most…

988
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:20,499
is always you, Seol.

989
00:58:24,879 --> 00:58:27,298
Okay. Thank you, Mom.

990
00:58:27,381 --> 00:58:30,634
Think of it as taking a break.
A very brief one.

991
00:58:32,887 --> 00:58:34,430
After you wait a bit,

992
00:58:35,639 --> 00:58:39,935
you might be able to go back one day.

993
00:58:52,072 --> 00:58:56,076
Gosh, I wanted to do something
for you as a mom.

994
00:58:57,286 --> 00:58:58,412
But right now,

995
00:58:59,246 --> 00:59:02,041
it may be better for you
to have some time to yourself.

996
00:59:11,884 --> 00:59:15,137
Dear Seol…

997
00:59:37,743 --> 00:59:40,329
NFS National Forensic Service

998
01:00:10,526 --> 01:00:11,652
Wow.

999
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:19,868
We got it.

1000
01:00:21,036 --> 01:00:24,373
I see they grabbed it like this.

1001
01:00:24,456 --> 01:00:25,666
Just like this.

1002
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,670
The radial loop of the fingerprints,

1003
01:00:30,087 --> 01:00:31,630
the composite vortex.

1004
01:00:31,714 --> 01:00:34,300
This is the sexiest line
of the human body.

1005
01:00:34,383 --> 01:00:36,260
Sure, whatever you say.

1006
01:00:36,343 --> 01:00:37,886
Can you rule out Princess…

1007
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,598
I mean Gong Jusoon's fingerprints
and analyze it?

1008
01:00:40,681 --> 01:00:42,784
Please find out who it belongs to
as soon as possible.

1009
01:00:42,808 --> 01:00:43,809
Okay.

1010
01:00:46,228 --> 01:00:47,813
We'll make you regret everything…

1011
01:00:49,189 --> 01:00:50,399
once we catch you.

1012
01:00:53,694 --> 01:00:56,155
<i>♪ Whose prints are going to match? ♪</i>

1013
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:58,532
<i>♪ Can you take a guess? ♪</i>

1014
01:00:58,616 --> 01:01:01,243
- Gambling is not allowed.

1015
01:01:01,327 --> 01:01:03,871
- <i>♪ Even in our dreams ♪</i>
- Nor is singing.

1016
01:01:03,954 --> 01:01:06,457
That's how desperate we are.

1017
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:07,541
Exactly.

1018
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,918
Gosh, the smell of bleach.

1019
01:01:10,002 --> 01:01:11,629
I put in some work yesterday, didn't I?

1020
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:14,572
Your bone density must have gone up
after all that exercise.

1021
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:16,508
Have some of this.

1022
01:01:19,511 --> 01:01:20,512
What is this?

1023
01:01:20,596 --> 01:01:22,198
Are you trying to make me feel better?

1024
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,525
I feel more energized now.

1025
01:01:36,445 --> 01:01:37,446
Yes, Ms. Yun?

1026
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:39,924
<i>I think
you should come to the NFS right now.</i>

1027
01:01:39,948 --> 01:01:42,093
- We're kind of busy right now.
<i>- We're busier.</i>

1028
01:01:42,117 --> 01:01:44,036
There's nothing
more urgent than this. Bye.

1029
01:01:47,623 --> 01:01:50,042
- I really don't like this bastard.
- Let's go first.

1030
01:01:50,834 --> 01:01:52,461
We have to analyze the DNA too.

1031
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:54,713
I need to scold this bastard.

1032
01:01:55,506 --> 01:01:57,925
Why did he have to call us
while AFIS is running?

1033
01:01:58,759 --> 01:02:00,177
I really don't like him.

1034
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:05,891
NFS National Forensic Service

1035
01:02:05,974 --> 01:02:06,975
Where is it?

1036
01:02:08,143 --> 01:02:09,463
- Is it here?
- Yes.

1037
01:02:14,817 --> 01:02:17,277
It seems like you prepared a lot.
Let's hear it.

1038
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:18,821
What's with this?

1039
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:21,490
All right.

1040
01:02:22,533 --> 01:02:25,160
I've seen a corpse like this
that had no trauma

1041
01:02:25,244 --> 01:02:27,413
but had a stomach full of blood.

1042
01:02:27,996 --> 01:02:28,997
Where did you see it?

1043
01:02:29,748 --> 01:02:32,751
At the Agency for Defense Development's
Explosive Prototype Laboratory.

1044
01:02:32,835 --> 01:02:35,170
A case of death
during an impact test for pressure waves.

1045
01:02:35,754 --> 01:02:37,256
Did you say explosives?

1046
01:02:37,339 --> 01:02:40,259
The damage suffered by the victim
is typical of a blast injury.

1047
01:02:40,342 --> 01:02:43,721
And since there is no trauma,
it was caused by a type of air blast.

1048
01:02:43,804 --> 01:02:48,225
The lungs and heart are hollow organs
most affected by pressure.

1049
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:51,019
Excuse me, but can you explain it simply,
so we can...

1050
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:52,521
Hold on. Continue.

1051
01:02:53,105 --> 01:02:56,150
We're talking about air
with strong pressure.

1052
01:02:57,693 --> 01:02:59,278
Like energy blasts.

1053
01:02:59,361 --> 01:03:01,029
So what you're saying

1054
01:03:01,113 --> 01:03:03,949
is that a person was killed
by an energy blast

1055
01:03:04,032 --> 01:03:06,535
in a regular household kitchen?

1056
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:10,122
<i>It was destructive enough
to rupture organs,</i>

1057
01:03:10,205 --> 01:03:12,559
<i>but there was no trauma,
so there was no blood at the scene.</i>

1058
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,209
<i>And the eardrums were ruptured.</i>

1059
01:03:14,293 --> 01:03:16,211
What about the wound on her forehead?

1060
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:18,505
That was caused by a blunt weapon,
wasn't it?

1061
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:22,342
He's a bit impatient, isn't he?

1062
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,054
Please wait.

1063
01:03:26,805 --> 01:03:28,599
That's why we went to the scene.

1064
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:31,789
To find what caused the energy blast.

1065
01:03:32,811 --> 01:03:35,898
Remember the redness
that was observed on the victim's face?

1066
01:03:36,482 --> 01:03:39,276
Biopsy showed thermal denaturation
of epidermal cells.

1067
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:40,402
All right.

1068
01:03:42,571 --> 01:03:45,032
This is normal skin tissue.

1069
01:03:45,115 --> 01:03:46,325
But if you look here,

1070
01:03:47,409 --> 01:03:48,762
the epidermis is all burnt, right?

1071
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:51,538
In other words,
the skin came into contact with heat.

1072
01:03:52,414 --> 01:03:55,334
And according to the chemical analysis,

1073
01:03:55,417 --> 01:03:58,587
the white foreign substance on the face

1074
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:00,798
was rice that was boiled with water.

1075
01:04:01,381 --> 01:04:02,925
Rice that was boiled with water?

1076
01:04:03,509 --> 01:04:05,219
Are you talking about cooked rice?

1077
01:04:06,428 --> 01:04:08,555
In other words,
there was an incident

1078
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:12,184
involving cooked rice
when the victim died.

1079
01:04:12,768 --> 01:04:15,312
I mean, it did happen
around dinnertime, but...

1080
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:18,398
Exactly. It was around the time
when dinner was being prepared.

1081
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,821
Now, in our daily lives,

1082
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:26,907
we're safe as long as the things we need
stay in place.

1083
01:04:27,491 --> 01:04:29,660
If all the parts are in place,
they won't explode.

1084
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,290
However, if even one small thing
moves out of place, boom!

1085
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:42,506
There was one item that was out of place
in this victim's kitchen.

1086
01:04:42,589 --> 01:04:43,924
Hurry up and tell us.

1087
01:04:44,007 --> 01:04:45,551
All right, this way.

1088
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:54,226
The victim was in this position
at the moment of her death.

1089
01:04:54,977 --> 01:04:56,657
Since the corpse wasn't moved…

1090
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:01,733
she was in this position
just before she fell.

1091
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:04,653
Also…

1092
01:05:06,446 --> 01:05:07,990
the pressure cooker in this photo.

1093
01:05:11,076 --> 01:05:12,762
This is the pressure cooker
from the victim's home.

1094
01:05:12,786 --> 01:05:17,332
However, there's one thing out of place.
What could it be?

1095
01:05:17,916 --> 01:05:20,127
Can you hurry up and tell us?

1096
01:05:21,837 --> 01:05:22,838
All right.

1097
01:05:23,297 --> 01:05:26,592
We bought a similar model to double-check.

1098
01:05:29,428 --> 01:05:30,429
It's this.

1099
01:05:37,895 --> 01:05:40,397
A circular, octagonal shape.

1100
01:05:42,441 --> 01:05:43,525
You remember, right?

1101
01:05:44,651 --> 01:05:46,028
One inch in diameter.

1102
01:05:46,111 --> 01:05:48,447
It's the same size
as the victim's depressed fracture.

1103
01:05:48,906 --> 01:05:50,657
The structural damage
shaped like an octagon

1104
01:05:50,741 --> 01:05:53,452
shown in the 3D bone reconstruction
was a perfect match as well.

1105
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:57,080
So this thing…

1106
01:05:58,832 --> 01:06:03,128
…was the murder weapon
that was used to kill Ms. Yong Soonbok.

1107
01:06:06,006 --> 01:06:07,049
What did you say?

1108
01:06:09,509 --> 01:06:13,096
So you can't understand
even with audio-visual data to explain it.

1109
01:06:14,097 --> 01:06:17,893
Ms. Yong Soonbok passed away
while cooking rice in the kitchen.

1110
01:06:19,186 --> 01:06:20,266
Cause of death.

1111
01:06:20,312 --> 01:06:22,856
Multiple organ damage
and frontal depressed fracture

1112
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:25,609
caused by a blast injury
due to a pressure cooker explosion.

1113
01:06:25,692 --> 01:06:26,818
Manner of death.

1114
01:06:27,444 --> 01:06:29,644
The possibility of accidental death
cannot be ruled out.

1115
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:34,826
A-accidental death?

1116
01:06:37,037 --> 01:06:38,163
So you're saying…

1117
01:06:39,122 --> 01:06:40,791
that her ribs broke

1118
01:06:40,874 --> 01:06:42,894
and her heart and lungs ruptured
due to a pressure cooker?

1119
01:06:42,918 --> 01:06:44,294
When water becomes water vapor,

1120
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:46,588
it expands to over 1,300 times in volume.

1121
01:06:47,172 --> 01:06:49,892
A cooking tool
that uses that force is a pressure cooker.

1122
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:52,928
An explosion of air
that has expanded over 1,300 times?

1123
01:06:54,221 --> 01:06:55,741
Even an energy blast wouldn't compare.

1124
01:06:56,515 --> 01:06:58,075
Though there aren't many deaths,

1125
01:06:58,141 --> 01:07:00,185
about 10 pressure cooker explosions

1126
01:07:00,268 --> 01:07:02,354
are reported in the country every year.

1127
01:07:10,070 --> 01:07:11,071
One moment, please.

1128
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:14,241
- Yes, Ms. Woo?
- Remember how we were looking into

1129
01:07:14,324 --> 01:07:16,844
everything that happened in Building 103
on the day of Ms. Yong's death?

1130
01:07:16,868 --> 01:07:18,578
Something unusual came up.

1131
01:07:18,662 --> 01:07:22,708
That's a relief. The NFS people
are listening as well, so please go ahead.

1132
01:07:22,791 --> 01:07:24,352
<i>A high school student in Unit 505</i>

1133
01:07:24,376 --> 01:07:26,044
<i>of the same building as the victim</i>

1134
01:07:26,128 --> 01:07:28,922
streams a "Study With Me" live
on YouTube every night,

1135
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,842
and she went live
the night of the victim's death.

1136
01:07:37,681 --> 01:07:38,849
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1137
01:07:39,516 --> 01:07:42,144
<i>The noise between floors
in this villa is no joke.</i>

1138
01:07:42,519 --> 01:07:45,647
An explosion of air
that has expanded over 1,300 times

1139
01:07:45,731 --> 01:07:46,940
would sound exactly like this.

1140
01:07:48,066 --> 01:07:50,485
It shows the time of death too, 19:23.

1141
01:07:56,199 --> 01:08:01,538
The DNA of Park Yongsoo and Kwak Soonja
do not match the DNA

1142
01:08:01,621 --> 01:08:04,458
of the perpetrator's epidermal cells
detected from the cat's claws.

1143
01:08:05,083 --> 01:08:06,209
Good work.

1144
01:08:08,462 --> 01:08:09,796
What do we do?

1145
01:08:10,797 --> 01:08:12,317
This isn't it either.

1146
01:08:25,687 --> 01:08:28,315
You should answer it.
It seems to be important.

1147
01:08:30,317 --> 01:08:33,403
- Yes, Ms. Woo?
- We found the owner of the speakers.

1148
01:08:33,487 --> 01:08:37,074
They belong to Kim Youngju
in Chundong Villa Building 103 Unit 202.

1149
01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:39,877
<i>When are we going to film
the montage? Should we get ready?</i>

1150
01:08:39,993 --> 01:08:43,288
Okay, I got it. I'll call you back later.

1151
01:08:46,917 --> 01:08:47,918
Jeez.

1152
01:08:49,211 --> 01:08:50,212
Sorry.

1153
01:08:50,879 --> 01:08:54,966
You seem to be scouring
the complex to catch the murderer,

1154
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:57,177
but that's not what you should be doing.

1155
01:08:59,429 --> 01:09:00,931
You should find this first.

1156
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,184
This is the murderer.

1157
01:09:06,853 --> 01:09:09,564
Do you think we're playing around?

1158
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:13,985
No, it seems like you're wasting your time

1159
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:16,154
trying to find a murderer
who doesn't exist.

1160
01:09:16,905 --> 01:09:18,031
Are you done?

1161
01:09:18,115 --> 01:09:20,158
Shouldn't you thank us
for closing the case for you?

1162
01:09:20,242 --> 01:09:21,660
You bastard.

1163
01:09:21,743 --> 01:09:23,453
What do you know, you bastard?

1164
01:09:23,537 --> 01:09:25,997
You stay in an office all day,
so what do you know, bastard?

1165
01:09:26,081 --> 01:09:27,290
Hey!

1166
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:29,668
Stop it.

1167
01:09:29,751 --> 01:09:31,071
Why are you overreacting?

1168
01:09:35,674 --> 01:09:37,342
The laws of physics don't lie.

1169
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:44,766
The NFS and police work together,
but that's it.

1170
01:09:45,809 --> 01:09:47,853
The police decide
when to close an investigation.

1171
01:09:52,816 --> 01:09:55,169
Special thanks to Lee Jiha,
Hwang Younghee, and Hwang Jungmin

The First Responders Season 2

1179
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:33,624
Are you intimidated by what the NFS said?

1180
01:10:33,648 --> 01:10:36,234
<i>Or do you think
this case isn't serious either?</i>

1181
01:10:36,318 --> 01:10:37,986
- Hold on a second.
- What? A friend?

1182
01:10:38,069 --> 01:10:40,447
You said you're his friend.
I'm his friend too.

1183
01:10:40,530 --> 01:10:43,009
If we're both friends with him,
then you and I are friends too.

1184
01:10:43,033 --> 01:10:44,492
Do you understand?

1185
01:10:44,576 --> 01:10:45,577
Are you hungry?

1186
01:10:46,995 --> 01:10:48,663
- Put them in there.
- Jackpot.

1187
01:10:48,747 --> 01:10:50,498
I'm here to officially request
an appraisal.

1188
01:10:50,582 --> 01:10:51,750
Why are you so obsessed?

1189
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:54,145
The moment I give up,
the criminal goes to sleep comfortably.

1190
01:10:54,169 --> 01:10:55,170
Yujung.

1191
01:10:55,253 --> 01:10:56,772
<i>If I eat a lot on an empty stomach,</i>

1192
01:10:56,796 --> 01:10:58,590
<i>my intestines will twist and I'll die.</i>

1193
01:10:58,673 --> 01:10:59,901
Do you know which unit she lives in?

1194
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:02,052
- She doesn't live here.
- Sorry?

1195
01:11:02,135 --> 01:11:03,511
Medical team! Hurry!
