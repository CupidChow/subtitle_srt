00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,900
"Hot Blood & Outburst of Rage"

2
00:00:28,984 --> 00:00:30,695
Look who's here.

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,062
Xun's here.

4
00:00:35,148 --> 00:00:37,257
We're celebrating right now.

5
00:00:38,367 --> 00:00:41,406
What a warrior.

6
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:44,347
You look different.
Way skinnier than before.

7
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,541
I trying to lose some weight.

8
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:48,773
Why? For what reasons.

9
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:50,500
I'm escaping the military draft.

10
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,791
Did you? Did you make it?

11
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,296
No. I give up.

12
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:56,625
Well, you do look incredibly skinny.

13
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,125
Really? Can you tell?

14
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,000
Your face looked entirely different.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,125
My face?

16
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,531
Yes. It's so much different.

17
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,960
This is yours.

18
00:01:05,156 --> 00:01:06,656
Me?

19
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,726
We are going to celebrate.

20
00:01:17,726 --> 00:01:24,000
Magnificent, mighty, serious,
outspoken and upright.

21
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,914
Quiet, firm, precise.

22
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:31,109
(A man shall be drafted on January 1
of the following year)

23
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:35,100
(when he reaches the age of 18.)

24
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:41,625
(Man whose hemoglobin is lower than 12gm/dl
shall be exempted from the draft.)

25
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:50,541
(Secretly undergoing a venesection
before the army's physical inspection.)

26
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:51,750
Hey!

27
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:54,375
What are you guys doing in here?

28
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,666
Let's get the hell out of here. Cigarettes?

29
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:57,791
Come on.

30
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,000
Why're you guys here?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,166
Come smoke.

32
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,000
Moron.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,125
Don't you have any place to go?

34
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,500
Shit! You homeless.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,625
I'm homeless? Go fuck yourself.

36
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,875
Shit man.

37
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,416
Hey!

38
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:09,671
Stop messing around in this room.

39
00:03:10,744 --> 00:03:12,124
Higher!

40
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,843
Shit.

41
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,796
You look like hell.

42
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,296
I'm doing everything I can.

43
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:45,131
<i>Right after the PLA
military drill yesterday...</i>

44
00:03:45,156 --> 00:03:46,656
<i>they have fired eleven Dongfeng
series ballistic missiles</i>

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,101
<i>into the territorial Sea of Taiwan.</i>

46
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,693
<i>The scale and types
of ammunition are escalating...</i>

47
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,748
<i>comparing to the third Taiwan
Strait crisis around 1996,</i>

48
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:57,468
<i>the ammunition fired
by the PLA were ten Dongfeng 15.</i>

49
00:03:57,493 --> 00:04:00,507
<i>Signifying the Communist Party of China
are taking higher measures.</i>

50
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,781
<i>Specialists of the PLA is concerned...</i>

51
00:04:02,806 --> 00:04:05,100
<i>the purpose of this military drill...</i>

52
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,416
<i>is to take control
over the Taiwan's Strait,</i>

53
00:04:07,416 --> 00:04:10,109
<i>and the territorial waters demarcation</i>

54
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:11,725
<i>also the power supplies.</i>

55
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,515
<i>According to a military specialist
believing that it's very unlikely to...</i>

56
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,968
You've changed.

57
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:20,687
Since when?

58
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,382
Since the first year of college.

59
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:30,580
Everyone has changed.

60
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,476
But,

61
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:37,343
you don't see things...

62
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,117
the way you used to.

63
00:04:45,392 --> 00:04:46,921
What do you mean?

64
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,251
You don't really...

65
00:04:50,276 --> 00:04:52,156
hang out with friends anymore.

66
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,000
I remembered you used to go to parties.

67
00:04:56,728 --> 00:04:59,421
You seemed to be having fun with everyone.

68
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,812
And you don't see yourself as different,
or excluded from others.

69
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:10,125
♪ I'm holding a rifle,
right on my shoulder. ♪

71

72
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:13,470
Huh?

73
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,322
Don't you want to be patriotic?

74
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:15,789
Maybe. I don't know.

75
00:05:15,813 --> 00:05:17,000
You love Taiwan?

76
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,648
I love Taiwan.

77
00:05:18,672 --> 00:05:19,718
You love Taiwan?

78
00:05:19,742 --> 00:05:20,882
I love Taipei.

79
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,687
You should love 'Taiwan'.

80
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:24,703
Taiwan Number one.

Liao.

86
00:06:05,594 --> 00:06:07,390
Have you seen Xun lately?

87
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,789
What's the matter?

88
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,656
The robe for the ceremony has arrived.

89
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,203
I had Xun's.

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,125
But he rarely spends time
at school or in the dorm.

91
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:21,242
I don't know what to do with it.

92
00:06:21,626 --> 00:06:23,218
Hmmm...

93
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,054
I can bring the robe to him.

94
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:32,107
One more thing, when you see him, ask him.

95
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,460
When is he coming back?

96
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,679
Why?

97
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,820
Well, they announced that...

98
00:06:39,845 --> 00:06:43,850
We have to return the room next week.

99
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:50,125
We have to clear up this room
by the end of the week.

100
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,656
Go have a seat.

101
00:07:22,657 --> 00:07:24,523
Why is he having a seat?

Come on,
this pole right here is your rifle.

106
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,173
Hurry up.

107
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:53,820
Is the sharper edge facing forward?

108
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:54,820
Yes.

109
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,898
How do I settle this?

110
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:29,609
The left side?

111
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,500
I am having my time here.

112
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
I think you look boring.

113
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,625
No.

114
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,541
I just joined you guys.

115
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:51,875
No, You didn't.

116
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:54,166
This shitty tank is all we have.

117
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,375
- We're doomed to lost the war.
- Just listen to yourself for one second.

118
00:08:57,375 --> 00:09:00,039
I'm narrating the story.

119
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,921
Do you want to play the guitar?

120
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,666
I don't know how to play it.

121
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,703
I'll teach you.

122
00:09:10,556 --> 00:09:12,421
Here's C chord.

123
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,552
C chord, E chord.

124
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:17,310
Use your left hand.

125
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:20,625
Here you go.

126
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,271
You do know how to play.

127
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,802
Listen, Liao is playing.

128
00:09:25,827 --> 00:09:27,577
I don't know any.

129
00:09:29,595 --> 00:09:31,302
5678.

130
00:09:31,326 --> 00:09:34,380
♪ I had a rifle, right on my shoulder. ♪

131
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:05,000
Hold it for a sec.

132
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,541
Are you ready?

133
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,867
Easy.

134
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,672
I'll stop.

135
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,250
OK. I'm quitting.

136
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:48,516
Are you alright?

137
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,500
What’s the matter?

138
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,728
Nothing.

139
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,625
I want to start taking the medication
from that friend of yours.

140
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,291
But we have done so far. All the fasting.

141
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,250
You might be unqualified
in the first inspection.

142
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,430
What if I don't?

143
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,906
What if I failed to escape?

144
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:28,195
What if they want me
to do another inspection.

145
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,070
I must be unqualified
in the first inspection.

146
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,656
We'll manage.

147
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,666
Do you remember my sophomore year?

148
00:12:29,666 --> 00:12:31,041
I was going to quit college.

149
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,625
Yes.

150
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,588
Were you painful during that time?

151
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,320
I came around.

152
00:12:42,882 --> 00:12:44,827
Feng was talking me out of it.

153
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,414
He said I'm confused.

154
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:50,883
But you have always been supportive. Huh?

155
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,539
Including these "stealth.“

156
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:04,021
You know...

157
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:07,337
Feng, he's just being possessive.

158
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:11,703
Maybe that counts as selfish.

159
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,375
I guess?

160
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:18,789
I was thinking...

161
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:21,578
I like friends and all from college.

162
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,891
Everyone is nice.

163
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:29,023
But still, I felt lost.

164
00:13:30,416 --> 00:13:33,416
Maybe it's something to do
with your identity.

165
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:35,812
Maybe that's the reason?

166
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:38,811
I guess you're right. "My identity".

167
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:43,041
To accept all the support
and be truly understanding.

168
00:13:43,066 --> 00:13:45,475
Not just giving out some random thoughts.

169
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,562
Or tell me what's right or wrong.

170
00:13:49,398 --> 00:13:51,545
Maybe it's not only about "Identity"?

171
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,125
Whom to trust?

172
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,859
It has something to do with...
perhaps... Love?

173
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:03,623
Maybe I'm exaggerating.

174
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:05,414
No, you're not.

175
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,531
I get what you're saying.

176
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,367
I really do.

177
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:02,531
I have it.

178
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,836
What we had discussed.

179
00:15:08,861 --> 00:15:10,527
The pills to lower the hemoglobin level.

180
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,156
Really?

181
00:15:14,336 --> 00:15:15,766
How?

182
00:15:17,164 --> 00:15:18,291
Shit.

183
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,461
I can't believe this. Hold it for a sec.

184
00:15:23,127 --> 00:15:26,127
You have to eat healthier this week.

185
00:15:26,152 --> 00:15:28,516
Make sure to do all the routines properly.

186
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,476
And...

187
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:37,812
you might... bleed.

188
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:41,625
Bleed?

189
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes.

190
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:45,600
I'm not really sure, but.

191
00:15:45,625 --> 00:15:49,166
I don't think we should be too worried.

192
00:16:48,437 --> 00:16:49,500
What's wrong?

193
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:54,055
It's working. Your nose is bleeding.

194
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,205
My nose?

195
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:55,855
Yes.

196
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,630
Shit.

197
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:57,600
Let me help.

198
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,758
What?

199
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:00,828
I'm bleeding.

200
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,475
I've never had a nosebleed.

201
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,000
Does it hurt?

202
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,351
No, it doesn't.

203
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,359
It's kind of scary. Fuck.

204
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,750
But it works.

205
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,758
Thank you. You're awesome.

206
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:20,969
Shit. It works.

207
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:24,791
Thank you.

208
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,250
Sure.

209
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,500
I mean... hmmm...

210
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:36,719
What I meant is that you're awesome, but...

211
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,812
I truly appreciate everything.

212
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,203
I'm sorry.

213
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,781
What for?

214
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,250
There's nothing you need to apologize for.

215
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,961
No, actually I do.

216
00:17:56,916 --> 00:18:02,305
What we're doing here, it's not opened.

217
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,351
I'm so sorry.

218
00:18:05,273 --> 00:18:07,875
What do you mean not opened.

219
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,805
What are you talking about.

220
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:12,719
You're acting weird.

221
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:15,250
I know that, but...

222
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,416
I've always known that I had this thing...

223
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,976
and I'm really sorry.

224
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,375
I felt ashamed and embarrassed cause of it.

225
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,820
But I know there's nothing to be ashamed
or embarrassed by.

226
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,375
And this... Uneasy Affection.

227
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,875
These might be the reasons why you
always think that I'm on your side.

228
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:36,289
And being really supportive.

229
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,430
You must have felt something.

230
00:18:42,273 --> 00:18:45,541
Maybe it's just friendship,
but I think there's something more.

231
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:54,916
I felt lying and being dishonest...

232
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:58,055
But, I want to start from...

233
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:04,180
Being really open with you,
or even confessing that I'm...

234
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,875
I want to make an apology for you.

235
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:12,625
I feel so sorry, and I don't know
what just happened to me.

236
00:19:13,203 --> 00:19:15,562
I just want to say that I'm sorry, and...

237
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:18,742
I really want to be on your side.

238
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,055
I'm sorry.

239
00:19:22,164 --> 00:19:23,211
Stop.

240
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:25,736
I'm really sorry.
I should have never told you all of this.

241
00:19:26,142 --> 00:19:27,702
Would you please stop
saying that you're sorry?

242
00:19:35,805 --> 00:19:37,221
Are you mad?

243
00:19:37,246 --> 00:19:38,367
No.

244
00:19:44,531 --> 00:19:46,094
I better be leaving.

245
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,500
Thank you.

246
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,916
Sorry.

247
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,166
I'm sorry.
I should have never said any of these.

248
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,166
Just forget everything.

249
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,695
Fuck. Stop apologizing.

250
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,555
Sorry.

251
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,758
That's Ok.

252
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,281
I'm off.

253
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:40,516
Ready?

254
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,291
Go.

255
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:45,750
I had a rifle, right on my shoulder.

256
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,250
I have pulled the trigger,
and how the bullet shines.

257
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,541
I had a rifle, right on my shoulder.

258
00:20:52,541 --> 00:21:02,166
I have pulled the trigger,
and how the bullet shines.

259
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:08,625
How the bullet shines.

260
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:18,875
How the bullet shines.

261
00:21:24,765 --> 00:21:26,422
This gets me dizzy.

262
00:21:31,765 --> 00:21:33,056
What's wrong?

263
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,225
It hurts.

264
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,547
What hurts?

265
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,453
We haven't even been playing that long.

266
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:41,243
Are you okay?

267
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:43,180
Yeah.

268
00:22:14,258 --> 00:22:15,430
What's wrong?

269
00:22:21,062 --> 00:22:22,234
Huh?

270
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:30,906
I...

271
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,172
Are you alright?

272
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,805
Sorry. I don't know what I'm doing.

273
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:09,164
Magnificent, mighty, serious,
outspoken and upright.

274
00:23:09,648 --> 00:23:13,898
Quiet, firm, calm, restrained.

275
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,031
Join us. Come over here.

276
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:18,000
Come on.

277
00:23:18,024 --> 00:23:19,648
Come.

278
00:23:19,673 --> 00:23:20,453
What're you doing?

279
00:23:20,477 --> 00:23:22,016
What do you mean coward?

280
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,368
Coward?

281
00:23:24,063 --> 00:23:26,305
You're a coward.

282
00:23:27,343 --> 00:23:28,383
Coward.

283
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,291
Mushy.

284
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,541
You're insane.

285
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:37,000
Are you a faggot?

286
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,625
Faggot.

287
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,320
You're tough.

288
00:23:46,265 --> 00:23:49,141
Hey Liao. Are you a faggot?

289
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,805
Follow him.

290
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,375
Hurry up.

291
00:24:10,375 --> 00:24:12,375
Join us.

292
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:13,453
Don't touch me.

293
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:15,062
What are you doing?

294
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:19,594
What?

295
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,916
What are you doing here?

296
00:24:21,916 --> 00:24:24,125
That's my question? Why did you come?

297
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,711
What? Can't I come?

298
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:31,055
Get over here.

299
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,382
You're acting so weird.

300
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,750
You're being weird.

301
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,791
I'm being weird?
Are you just going to stand here?

302
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:10,164
What are you doing, Liao?

303
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,969
Stop it. Stop it.

304
00:25:21,994 --> 00:25:24,234
Calm down. Liao!

305
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:29,711
Calm down.

306
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,914
Help me.

307
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:34,408
Calm down.

308
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:38,234
What's going on?
What's the matter with you?

309
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:45,820
Hey! What's the matter with you?

310
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,336
Why did you do that?

311
00:25:52,444 --> 00:25:55,648
Are you alright?

312
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,937
Get your hands off me.

313
00:26:09,117 --> 00:26:10,711
What's the matter with you?

314
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:13,625
Xun is bleeding.

315
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:15,773
Hey!

316
00:26:16,594 --> 00:26:17,375
Hey!
