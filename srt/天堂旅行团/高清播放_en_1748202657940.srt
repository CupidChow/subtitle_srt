ICHE

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This world is very cruel to ordinary people.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Maybe you did nothing wrong,

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
but you will never find the truth.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This is a small hotel.

8
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Mother left it to me.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's almost half a year.

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's almost half a year.

11
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The doctor said I was sick,

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
but I don't want to take medicine.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not patient.

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
My name is Song Yili.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I choose to die.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On my birthday,

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I chose this medicine.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I've never had this medicine.

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I finally used it today.

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please, stop.

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He used a mouse.

27
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Dongyiong, I can't see it now.

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Don't try it at home.

29
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I said so.

30
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Uncle.

31
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Uncle!

32
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're so cool.

33
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yu Xiao Qu.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Where's Yu Xiao Qu?

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I heard he's the biggest.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sure he's the biggest.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Or he's your sister.

38
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Have you seen a girl?

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No.

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Where is she?

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yu Xiao Qu!

42
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Shu An, you're so stubborn.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Otherwise, I'll keep my snacks.

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Zuo Yi Li.

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Are you okay?

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How do you know?

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The police contacted me.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'll go to the hospital now.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I know.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I know!

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Chen Nan Hospital.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
The emergency room.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
21st bed.

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're so stubborn.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Help me.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No one can see.

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
How are you?

58
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is it serious?

59
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm fine.

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm fine.

61
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Don't make people worry.

62
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I want to keep this as a souvenir.

63
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll return it to you.

64
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I know you need money.

65
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Happy birthday.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lin Yi.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you change the police contact?

69
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Uncle, happy birthday.

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is a gift for you.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let me sing you a song.

72
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Happy birthday.

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Happy birthday.

74
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Happy birthday.

75
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Happy birthday.

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Happy birthday.

77
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Happy birthday.

78
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Happy birthday.

79
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Happy birthday!

80
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
The other party is in a bad shape.

81
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
Song Yilin, what's your problem?

82
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,520
Nothing.

83
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,920
The check-up is all wrong, right?

84
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,560
It's a bit serious.

85
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,840
I don't think it's a problem.

86
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,320
You can go now.

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,640
Or stay in the hospital.

88
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,160
You can do the CT and X-ray.

89
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,560
Don't look for me again.

90
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,840
Don't look for me.

91
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,160
I'll stay.

92
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,800
Sorry, wrongberg.

93
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,120

I'll let you guys take him.

101
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,820
Ok.

102
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,680
Uh-uh.

103
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,340
Ok, let's go.

104
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:49,200
Ask every child to run from AAA to NOI and Revolt should know that they would treat the child to Babas favor give

105
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,360
How's the sister of seven

106
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,640
Where did you say

107
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,340
For around three people in college

108
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,260
One 마음

109
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,760
The other د are you

110
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,300
And I

111
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,300
Are us three brothers

112
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,000
Brotherade

113
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm not better than you.

114
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I'm more sad than you.

115
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
But I can't tell you.

116
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Because I told you, it's useless.

117
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
I can't solve any problem.

118
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I just have one more person to be sad with me.

119
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
But I want to tell you...

120
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
I want to die.

121
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Actually, I want to die too.

122
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I was taken to the hospital by my sister.

123
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
But I didn't come back.

124
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
So I'm dead.

125
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,200
I have to be happy to be in the hospital.

126
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
I have another secret.

127
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Why?

128
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Why?

129
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Why?

130
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
I want to die!

131
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,200
You give me a little demon!

132
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I don't even know how to die.

133
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Why?

134
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,200
Why?

135
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Why did my sister give you the ring?

136
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
What ring?

137
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
She said I'm a married woman.

138
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,200
So she gave you the ring.

139
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
And she told you to sell some money.

140
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
You're brothers now, right?

141
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
You've got so many problems.

142
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,200
You go back first. I'll go in myself.

143
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Okay. I have to go to bed.

144
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm leaving.

145
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm going to bed.

146
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
You don't want to live like this?

147
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
The world is a mess.

148
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I don't want to live like this.

149
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
The people who love you are all there.

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
But if I die,

151
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
you'll really live well.

152
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I hope you'll be better next life.

153
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Why am I here?

154
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
You're in the forest.

155
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm thinking about you.

156
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Uncle, you're awake.

157
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
Let's go.

158
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm not going to sleep.

159
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm going to bed.

160
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm going to bed.

161
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm going to bed.

162
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm going to bed.

163
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm going to bed.

164
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm going to bed.

165
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Dad.

166
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,200
Where are you going?

167
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,200
To find dad.

168
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I don't even know your dad.

169
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
How can I take you to find your dad?

170
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
You said it yourself.

171
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,200
Brother,

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,200
if I die,

173
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I won't forget what you want me to do.

174
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I'll tell you first.

175
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm going to bed.

176
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,200
Why are you in my car?

177
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Uncle, I'm thinking we have a problem.

178
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
What problem?

179
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,200
Don't you follow me?

180
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,200
You're so beautiful.

181
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
I'm finally out.

182
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Uncle, are you here for the recording?

183
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
Uncle, will you be brave?

184
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,200
What do you want?

185
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Are you done?

186
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,200
Where's your dad?

187
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Dad is in the rooftop.

188
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,200
What?

189
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,200
He's in the rooftop.

190
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,200
I'll go to the rooftop.

191
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Dad,

192
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,200
where are you going?

193
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm going to bed.

194
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,200
I'm going to bed.

195
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,200
I'm not going to sleep.

196
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,200
I'm going to bed.

197
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm going to bed.

198
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm going to bed.

199
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
I'm going to bed.

200
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
I'm going to bed.

201
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Aunt, are we in the hospital?

202
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
I'm not going back to the hospital?

203
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
I know this road. You're lying to me.

204
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
I'm not going back to the hospital!

205
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
I'm not going back to the hospital!

206
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,200
What are you doing?

207
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
I'm not going back to the hospital!

208
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,200
I can't get out of here if I get out of here!

209
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,200
Why do you have to tell me what to do?

210
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Uncle, I'm not in any trouble.

211
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,200
It's not good.

212
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
You'll open my head.

213
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,200
I'm going to find my dad.

214
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
I haven't seen my dad for a long time.

215
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Chang Pia!

216
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I'll call your mom.

217
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
I'll send you back if she agrees.

218
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
My mom is in a bad mood.

219
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
She's too busy.

220
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Mom, I'm going to find my dad. I'm still here.

221
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Don't worry about me.

222
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
I'll send you back when your mom's back.

223
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
I'll send you back when your mom's back.

224
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,200
Okay.

225
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
Remember to take your medicine.

226
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
I can't remember.

227
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Uncle, let's go.

228
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,200
Let's go!

229
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Let's go!

230
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,200
Let's go!

231
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Don't you worry about me being a bad person?

232
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Uncle, I'm not looking down on you.

233
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,200
You're not like me.

234
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
Be careful, mom!

235
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
How is it? Did you find it?

236
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,200
Not yet.

237
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
Her things are gone.

238
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,200
She only has one note left.

239
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Where will she go?

240
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
I'll send you back.

241
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Did you take the medicine?

242
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,200
How do you know?

243
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,200
This green one eats the food every day.

244
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,200
This red one eats the food afterwards.

245
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
This white one...

246
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm Chen Mo.

247
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
Welcome to the world of your dog.

248
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
I don't know who's watching my show.

249
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
How do I look?

250
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
To be honest, I'm very angry.

251
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
I won't open up for anyone.

252
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
Nor will I be the only one.

253
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Why are you taking my picture?

254
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I'm still forcing you to take my picture.

255
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
Give it back to me!

256
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Uncle, we're going to the third camp.

257
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
The third camp...

258
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
One time.

259
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,200
One person.

260
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I really believe in you.

261
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
The third camp...

262
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,200
The fourth camp...

263
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
Boss, come here.

264
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Come on, let's go.

265
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
It's gone.

266
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,200
See?

267
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Young man, I'll treat you to something to drink.

268
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
Come on.

269
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
I'll treat you to something to drink.

270
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Come on.

271
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
Please, don't do anything.

272
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
You're going to complain about me.

273
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
I can't do anything.

274
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I'll give you a fried rice.

275
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Give me a face.

276
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
Who's going to give you a fried rice?

277
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
You're annoying.

278
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
It's gone.

279
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,200
It's gone.

280
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Please, don't do anything.

281
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Are you annoying?

282
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
What?

283
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
What's wrong with you?

284
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
You're going to kill me?

285
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Come on, let's go.

286
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,200
Come on.

287
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Are you okay?

288
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Oh, my God.

289
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,200
I'm so tired.

290
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm so tired.

291
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
Why are you afraid of running over here?

292
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
Am I going to be hit by a car?

293
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Are you okay?

294
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
No, I'm fine.

295
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,200
You promised to help me.

296
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
I'll help you move back.

297
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'm sorry.

298
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
I'm sorry.

299
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,200
Uncle, the clouds are so beautiful today.

300
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,200
Uncle,

301
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
have you ever been on a live broadcast?

302
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,200
Uncle, what do you live?

303
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,200
I cook.

304
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,200
You can continue.

305
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,200
You can eat and eat when you have money.

306
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm going to go.

307
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,200
Uncle,

308
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
say hello to your fans.

309
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Are you okay?

310
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,200
Uncle,

311
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,200
where's the noodles?

312
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
Do we still have food today?

313
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Hello?

314
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Give me the money this day.

315
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
Don't be so thick-skinned.

316
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
You can't contact me for a year.

317
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
You can only borrow money when you call.

318
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
No.

319
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm really in a hurry.

320
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Then come over.

321
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
I'll give you the money when you come over.

322
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
No.

323
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,200
No money?

324
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Uncle.

325
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I'm done crying.

326
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Why are you making a scene?

327
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Uncle,

328
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
is this your supermarket?

329
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Can I go in and take a look?

330
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
Why?

331
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Take it.

332
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
Who is this?

333
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,200
My butt.

334
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,200
Come here.

335
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Take it.

336
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Take it.

337
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
Look at my good food.

338
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Good food, good scenery,

339
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
good air.

340
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
You've been here for days.

341
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
I'm sure you're not tired.

342
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,200
I took a bottle of vinegar and a bag of micro-crisp.

343
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
I'll take it.

344
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Okay.

345
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
12.5 yuan.

346
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
Okay.

347
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,200
Xiaojun,

348
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
don't eat that.

349
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
It's not good for you.

350
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,200
Eat more food.

351
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Uncle,

352
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,200
this is called free food.

353
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
I'll take it.

354
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
What is this?

355
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
As a princess,

356
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
as a prince,

357
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I can eat well.

358
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
These are all my wishes.

359
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
Song Yulian,

360
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
do you know

361
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,200
how many wishes he has?

362
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
It's none of my business.

363
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
No?

364
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,200
I have money.

365
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,200
What money do you have?

366
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I have a small shop.

367
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
I can have a few in my pocket.

368
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Eat quickly.

369
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,200
I'll be in a hurry later.

370
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,200
Try this.

371
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
Drink more.

372
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,200
What?

373
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I made it myself.

374
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
Can't you drive?

375
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
I can't.

376
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,200
Uncle,

377
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,200
when you were in school,

378
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
what did Uncle look like?

379
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,200
He...

380
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
He looked like a fool.

381
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
When he was in college,

382
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
he said

383
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,200
he wanted to be a superman

384
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,200
and be a super hero.

385
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
He is indeed a fool.

386
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,200
Once he got drunk,

387
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,200
he came back to the room

388
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
in our dorm

389
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,200
and ran around in a mess.

390
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
Then he also said

391
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
he could fly up

392
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,200
from one day.

393
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Uncle Fang,

394
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,200
can you promise me something?

395
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Uncle Fang,

396
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,200
it's so sad.

397
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Let's make him happy,

398
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,200
okay?

399
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Xiao Ju, you are so good.

400
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
But it's too hard to fly up.

401
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,200
Actually, it's not hard.

402
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
I'm not good at flying.

403
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,200
I'm not good at flying.

404
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,200
Uncle Fang,

405
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
Uncle,

406
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
how did you get out of the car?

407
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Xiao Ju came here,

408
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,200
and the business suddenly got better.

409
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
The car was gone.

410
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
I bought you breakfast.

411
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,200
I don't have a night shift today.

412
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,200
After you finish eating,

413
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
I'll take you out for fun.

414
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,200
Uncle!

415
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Uncle!

416
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Stop it.

417
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
We are still on the road.

418
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,200
How about this one?

419
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
This one.

420
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,200
How about this one?

421
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
You want to help the princess, right?

422
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes.

423
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
Why do you call this princess?

424
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
The princess has already grown up.

425
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
She can grow up.

426
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
The princess has already grown up.

427
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
She can grow up.

428
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Brother,

429
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
are you crazy?

430
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Brother, you are doing well.

431
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
I'm sorry about that.

432
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Brother,

433
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
are you crazy?

434
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Brother, you are not a good wife.

435
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
You are not a good wife.

436
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,200
You are not a good wife.

437
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,200
You are not a good wife.

438
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,200
You are not a good wife.

439
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
You are not a good wife.

440
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
How much do you want?

441
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
I'll ask you how much you want.

442
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
Don't care about it.

443
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Take it.

444
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,200
No.

445
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Hurry up.

446
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Hurry up.

447
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Get back.

448
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Hurry up.

449
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Why are you so tired?

450
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
I'm just a little bit tired.

451
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm going to sleep.

452
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm going to sleep.

453
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
In the past,

454
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
they always called me a dog.

455
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Only you can call me a dog.

456
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,200
And they called me a beggar.

457
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
They called me a beggar.

458
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
In your heart,

459
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
you never considered me a dog.

460
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,200
You have been living a bad life these years.

461
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I know it.

462
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
You used to talk to me.

463
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Now I do.

464
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Su Yi Lin.

465
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
You want to live in the world.

466
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
You can't live for two years.

467
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,200
I've been waiting for you for eight years.

468
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Xiao Ju.

469
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Look.

470
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
You like it.

471
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I'll keep it for you.

472
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Thank you.

473
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Thank you, Uncle.

474
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
I'll always remember you.

475
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
Let's go.

476
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,200
You must remember me, too.

477
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Brother.

478
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
I'm a little bit tired.

479
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I'll make sure I don't get tired.

480
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Brother.

481
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
You're better than me.

482
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
You've been living a good life.

483
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
I've known you for a long time.

484
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
You're better than me.

485
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
You've been living a good life.

486
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,200
I think you're better than me.

487
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,200
Trust me.

488
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You'll live a good life.

489
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,200
You'll do anything.

490
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,200
You've been looking after me.

491
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Why are you like this now?

492
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Promise me, Su Yi Lin.

493
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Oh, no.

494
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Why are you like this now, Su Yi Lin?

495
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Promise me, Su Yi Lin.

496
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Promise me.

497
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Brother.

498
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Run.

499
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Run.

500
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Run.

501
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,200
Please show me your ID.

502
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Your ID.

503
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Why did you come to the highway without your car?

504
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
You can't go to the highway without your car?

505
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
How did you fall?

506
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,200
Sorry.

507
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Go.

508
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
How did you fall?

509
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
How did you fall?

510
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
How did you fall?

511
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
How did you fall?

512
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,200
Chen Dao Mei.

513
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Chen Dao Mei.

514
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
What are you doing?

515
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
You're living in your own clothes.

516
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,780
Have you heard of Channy Yu?

517
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,820
She came from Hu fathers relation

518
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:12,880
We have never seen anyła

519
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,840
She became a master of Mrs. Bao

520
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,200
She has married me

521
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,500
Moreover she got to work in this restaurant

522
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,100
More work for Mr. Lu

523
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,680
conocen

524
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,520
She came from the dry family

525
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,060
I see

526
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,060
I'm afraid I'll hit you.

527
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,060
Mr. Guo, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

528
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,060
Don't worry. We'll talk on the street if you have any conditions.

529
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,060
Right?

530
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,060
Hello? Mr. Guo?

531
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
Mr. Guo?

532
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,060
Oh my god.

533
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,060
Can you hear me?

534
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,060
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

535
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,060
I won't chase you if you hit me.

536
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:05,060
Give me a ride.

537
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,060
What?

538
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:10,060
A ride? Look at me.

539
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Guo Shuang, you're a kid.

540
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,060
You don't need to ride a car.

541
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,060
How can you be a father?

542
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,060
My father is a black donkey.

543
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,060
Who's your father?

544
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,060
Oh my god.

545
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,060
A man.

546
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:31,060
I'm a man.

547
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,060
Hello?

548
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
You want to play?

549
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,060
Jingjing, I have something to tell you.

550
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
Go back and talk to me. I'm busy.

551
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,060
Let's break up.

552
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,060
Don't make trouble.

553
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,060
I'm serious.

554
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,060
It's like we can't keep walking like this.

555
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,060
We've only met once in a half year.

556
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,060
Do you think this is normal?

557
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,060
I don't know what you feel.

558
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:07,060
Send me to Ancheng.

559
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,060
Why do people come to find her?

560
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
I'm a man.

561
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,060
Every step of my life is planned.

562
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Even if we break up,

563
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
we have to be careful.

564
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
Why can't we go to Ancheng?

565
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
Okay.

566
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
Security bureau, hospital,

567
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
Ancheng.

568
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
Go to A.

569
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
Go to A.

570
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
Where's your mom?

571
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
I'm late.

572
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,060
I'm getting married.

573
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
Look at you.

574
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,060
You look like a real man.

575
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,060
You should learn something good.

576
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
You have to learn to be a father.

577
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,060
You have to learn to be a father every day.

578
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,060
Uncle Ji,

579
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,060
where are you going to get the water?

580
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,060
I'm going to get it.

581
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,060
I'm going to get it.

582
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,060
Uncle Ji,

583
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
sister is still in the car.

584
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,060
Since you know,

585
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I don't think there's anything to say.

586
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,060
Is she inside?

587
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,060
It's none of her business.

588
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,060
Okay.

589
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,060
How long have you been together?

590
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,060
You know me.

591
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,060
I won't do this unless I'm good.

592
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:38,060
Half a year?

593
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Actually, I've been trying to tell you.

594
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,060
I'm so busy with you.

595
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,060
I'm afraid it'll affect your work.

596
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,060
Really.

597
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,060
What you mean is,

598
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,060
it's my fault.

599
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Don't blame yourself.

600
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,060
We all have our own problems.

601
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,060
We can't blame you.

602
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Jingjing,

603
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,060
I'm more painful than you.

604
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,060
Except for three people who hurt you.

605
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,060
You're better than one person who hurt you.

606
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,060
You're stronger than us.

607
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,060
What do you mean?

608
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,060
I'm stronger.

609
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,060
I have to be hurt.

610
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,060
To be honest,

611
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,060
I'm very tired.

612
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,060
I'm tired.

613
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,060
Why don't you say something?

614
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,060
I'm not willing to.

615
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,060
But the truth is...

616
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,060
No.

617
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,060
If I can make you suffer,

618
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:36,060
I'm willing to sacrifice for you.

619
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
Okay.

620
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,060
I wish you two a long and long life.

621
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,060
Uncle,

622
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:53,060
Jingjing looks so sad.

623
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
Who made you sad?

624
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,060
I'm Chen Mo.

625
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Welcome to the world.

626
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Why did someone suddenly come

627
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
and leave suddenly?

628
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Actually, there's no sudden person.

629
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,060
He must have thought it through.

630
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,060
He must have understood it.

631
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,060
He must have understood it.

632
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Jump, jump, jump.

633
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,060
What?

634
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Jingjing jumped on me.

635
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

636
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
Hurry.

637
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:00,060
Uncle, are you okay?

638
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,060
Uncle, are you okay?

639
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:09,060
Uncle, please help me.

640
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,060
Why did you go down?

641
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,060
I just wanted to calm down.

642
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:18,060
But you wouldn't swim.

643
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,060
You saved someone.

644
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,060
I was impulsive.

645
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,060
You were impulsive?

646
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,060
I found that you guys are so hard-working.

647
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,060
You're sicker than you are.

648
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,060
You said you'd only tell me after half a year.

649
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,060
I'm not.

650
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
I was so mad that I just told you.

651
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,060
Last month, the kid was shopping with me.

652
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,060
He was so mad.

653
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,060
Your mom didn't want to help me.

654
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:52,060
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,060
We've been together for years.

656
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,060
It's too sudden for me.

657
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:10,060
I know it's not worth crying for such a person.

658
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,060
So I can only allow myself to cry for five minutes.

659
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,060
I can only allow myself to cry for five minutes.

660
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,060
No one is so sudden.

661
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,060
I just want to come back clearly.

662
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
I want to leave after thinking about it.

663
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,060
I found that you're interesting.

664
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,060
You're so weird.

665
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:44,060
What's the point of being so weird?

666
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:47,060
I'm not doing this for you.

667
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,060
I'm afraid you'll die in the name of the Emperor.

668
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,060
What should I do?

669
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,060
Who's going to die?

670
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,060
What's the problem with death?

671
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
Mr. Guo.

672
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,060
I'm so sorry.

673
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,060
I have something to do on the way.

674
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:12,060
I'll be there soon.

675
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,060
I'm on my way.

676
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,060
Don't worry.

677
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,060
Bye.

678
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,060
That's enough.

679
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,060
Enough.

680
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,060
I'm sorry.

681
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,060
I'm sorry.

682
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,060
I'm sorry.

683
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,060
Xu Jingjing.

684
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,060
Love is gone.

685
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,060
Then just do your job.

686
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:48,060
Love is gone.

687
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,060
Then we won't see you off.

688
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,060
I'm sorry.

689
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:03,060
Although I don't know what you've been through,

690
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,060
you're not bad.

691
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,060
Don't be so sad.

692
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,060
You're not bad.

693
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,060
Why are you so sad?

694
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,060
I'm leaving.

695
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,060
Xiaoju.

696
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,060
Live a good life with your father.

697
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,060
I'm leaving.

698
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,060
Uncle, you were so weak just now.

699
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,060
Why are you peeking?

700
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,060
You said don't peek.

701
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,060
I didn't say don't peek.

702
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,060
Stay here.

703
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,060
You can't go anywhere.

704
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,060
You are?

705
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,060
The same-sex express.

706
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:02,060
I wish you a happy life.

707
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,060
How is it?

708
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,060
Uncle, I'm going to make something.

709
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:30,060
Thank you.

710
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,060
Thank you, uncle.

711
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,060
I'm sorry.

712
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,060
The world is so big.

713
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,060
Do you know?

714
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,060
Actually, the world has a lens.

715
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,060
Where are they?

716
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:48,060
Uncle, are these your classmates?

717
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,060
We are college friends.

718
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:55,060
This is Uncle Song Yili.

719
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,060
This is Uncle Fan Kuaqi.

720
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,060
Well...

721
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:03,060
I've never seen him before.

722
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:07,060
But he's the best student I've ever seen.

723
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,060
You're right.

724
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,060
He's called Uncle Li.

725
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

726
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:30,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

727
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

728
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

729
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

730
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:47,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

731
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:51,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

732
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

733
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,060
I'll have a brother like him in the future.

734
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,060
I'm Xiao Ju.

735
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,060
This is my wish.

736
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:28,060
I've never seen my father.

737
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:32,060
Mom said he went to another world.

738
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,060
I'm a kid without a father.

739
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,060
Where have you been?

740
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,060
To find my father.

741
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:50,060
I don't even know your father. How can I take you to find your father?

742
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,060
I've never seen my father.

743
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,060
Why did you ask me to find you a father?

744
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,060
I'm sorry.

745
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:05,060
Where's your mother?

746
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,060
I called your mother.

747
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,060
Hurry up and call her now!

748
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,060
I didn't answer your call.

749
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,060
What happened to your voice?

750
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:25,060
I'm sorry.

751
00:51:27,060 --> 00:51:29,060
How can I believe you?

752
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:34,060
I'm not coming out like this.

753
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
Why are you lying to me?

754
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,060
You're lying to me all the time.

755
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,060
Call me!

756
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:48,060
I don't want you to take me back!

757
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,060
I'll call my mother.

758
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,060
I'll call my mother.

759
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,060
Mom, I'm here.

760
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,060
Mom, don't worry about me.

761
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,060
I'm fine.

762
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:15,060
I'll go back to work.

763
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,060
I'm a little worried.

764
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:20,060
Remember to take the ticket.

765
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,060
I'll put it under your feet.

766
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,060
If you're hungry, you can eat anything.

767
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:31,060
After you go back,

768
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,060
I'll listen to your mom.

769
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,060
Send someone.

770
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,060
You can get off.

771
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,060
Master,

772
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,060
I have a little friend to take care of you.

773
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,060
Please take care of him.

774
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,060
When he's in Nanjing,

775
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:57,060
his mom will pick him up at the station.

776
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:13,060
Uncle, are we going back to the hospital?

777
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:16,060
I know this road.

778
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:18,060
You're lying to me.

779
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:31,060
I don't want to go back to the hospital.

780
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:33,060
I'm going to find my mom.

781
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:40,060
Uncle, I'm sorry.

782
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,060
I'm a little worried.

783
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,060
Please take me down.

784
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,060
You're going to kill me.

785
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,060
Stop!

786
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:18,060
Stop!

787
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,060
Stop!

788
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,060
Stop!

789
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,060
Uncle,

790
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:36,060
I didn't lie to you.

791
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,060
I'm sorry.

792
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:51,060
I'm sorry.

793
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:05,060
I'm sorry.

794
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:08,060
That's the picture that my mom hid.

795
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,060
Actually, when I was little, my dad left.

796
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:21,060
He didn't even leave a picture of me.

797
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,060
I was a useless girl.

798
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:28,060
I didn't do anything.

799
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:32,060
My dad didn't take good care of me.

800
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,060
Uncle,

801
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:40,060
my mom is the one who loves us the most in this world.

802
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:42,060
She won't blame you.

803
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:46,060
I ran out of the hospital.

804
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:50,060
I wanted to see how big this world is.

805
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,060
But only a few days.

806
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,060
I miss my mom.

807
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,060
Uncle,

808
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,060
I'm not afraid to be a uncle.

809
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,060
But I want to live well.

810
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,060
Because I'm with you.

811
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,060
I won't be sad.

812
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,060
Xiao Juan,

813
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,060
let's go back.

814
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,060
I lost a good friend.

815
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,060
Before he died,

816
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,060
I thought I didn't find

817
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,060
he had such a serious depression.

818
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,060
Later, I realized that

819
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:01,060
when someone has a heart of crack,

820
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:04,060
it's all so coincidental.

821
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:07,060
No one noticed.

822
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:11,060
Only when he's in a bad mood,

823
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,060
will everyone listen.

824
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:16,060
I'm asking Feng.

825
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,060
Feng?

826
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,060
Feng?

827
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:25,060
Feng?

828
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:28,060
Feng?

829
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,060
Feng.

830
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,060
Feng.

831
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,260
Feng,

832
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:41,060
Feng.

833
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,060
I'll hit you with a head.

834
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,060
I'll hit you with a head.

835
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,060
You're too young to learn.

836
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,060
Go to sleep.

837
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:07,060
Uncle.

838
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,060
Don't touch me, okay?

839
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:39,060
That was the end.

840
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:44,060
Running again.

841
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,060
My mind.

842
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:52,060
Saving time.

843
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:56,060
I'll give myself to that.

844
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:01,060
That was the end.

845
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:06,060
Running again.

846
00:59:08,060 --> 00:59:11,060
Your mother's age is very serious.

847
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:13,060
She has to be trained by someone.

848
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,060
You don't want to live such a life.

849
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,060
I don't want to either.

850
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:30,060
But if I leave,

851
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:33,060
you'll really live well.

852
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,060
I'll be there for you.

853
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:41,060
Mom.

854
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,060
Mom, wait for me.

855
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,060
Mom.

856
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,060
Uncle.

857
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,060
I'm sorry.

858
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:48,060
What's wrong, Xiaojun?

859
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,060
I'm sick.

860
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,060
Xiaojun, don't be afraid.

861
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:57,060
I'll take you to the hospital.

862
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,060
Xiaojun.

863
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,060
Xiaojun, hang in there.

864
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:11,060
Xiaojun.

865
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,060
Doctor.

866
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:21,060
Where's the doctor?

867
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:24,060
Doctor.

868
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:42,060
What's wrong?

869
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,060
I'm sick.

870
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,060
I'm sick.

871
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,060
Let me go.

872
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,060
What are you doing?

873
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,060
Let me go.

874
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,060
I'm sick.

875
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,060
I'm sick.

876
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,060
I'm sick.

877
01:02:06,060 --> 01:02:08,060
I'm sick.

878
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:10,060
I'm sick.

879
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
I'm sick.

880
01:02:17,060 --> 01:02:18,060
I'm sorry.

881
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,060
We found a treasure in your mother's house.

882
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,060
I'm sorry.

883
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,060
You're the one who said it.

884
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:24,060
But it's your own.

885
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:26,060
I'm sorry.

886
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,060
I'm sorry.

887
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:31,060
I'm sorry.

888
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,060
I'm sorry.

889
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,060
I'm sorry.

890
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,060
I'm sorry.

891
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:45,060
You're the one who said it.

892
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,060
We found a treasure in your mother's house.

893
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:49,060
You're the one who said it.

894
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:51,060
But it's your own.

895
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,060
I'm sorry.

896
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:00,060
I'm sorry.

897
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,060
Take care.

898
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:32,060
The child looks much better than before.

899
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:34,060
He's father.

900
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:35,060
He is at a stука care.

901
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,060
We found a little treasure in him.

902
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:40,060
We found a little treasure in him.

903
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:42,060
He is at a st药 Si Fu already .

904
01:03:42,060 --> 01:03:44,060
You had one at that time,

905
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,060
a little treasure in his father's house.

906
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,060
We found a little treasure in him.

907
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,060
I didn't know what I should be doing.

908
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:57,060
These days, I want to make a dream.

909
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,260
In my dream,

910
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,260
I want to have a baby

911
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,260
and call my uncle.

912
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,060
Uncle, I'm so dizzy.

913
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,560
I should be hungry.

914
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,060
Uncle, you can't drink.

915
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,760
I know.

916
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,460
Let's play a game.

917
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,060
You say, catch a duck, you say, catch a few.

918
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,060
Catch a duck.

919
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,260
Catch a few.

920
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:31,260
Catch.

921
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:31,860
Catch.

922
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:32,760
Catch.

923
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:34,060
Catch.

924
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:34,760
Catch.

925
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:35,760
Hello?

926
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,760
Fang Guai Qi, why are you crying?

927
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:16,760
We haven't seen each other for three years.

928
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:18,760
You've been sick for so long.

929
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:21,760
Why aren't you telling me?

930
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,760
I'm not sick.

931
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,760
I'm not sick.

932
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,760
I'm not sick.

933
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,760
I'm not sick.

934
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:31,760
I'm not sick.

935
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:33,760
I'm not sick.

936
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,760
I'm not sick.

937
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:40,760
Lao Wei often tells you about me.

938
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:43,760
He's afraid you'll be sad.

939
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,760
Mr. Li Shu left.

940
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,760
I'll be the one to discuss with Wen Ke.

941
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,760
But he left us a gift.

942
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,760
It's a letter.

943
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,760
Someone said

944
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,760
I gave up my city life.

945
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,760
It's not easy to get back here.

946
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:27,760
But I think

947
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,760
the suffering of life

948
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:31,760
is not worth living.

949
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:33,760
The children of the hometown

950
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,760
don't have to eat anymore.

951
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,760
They don't have to walk

952
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:39,760
the path they've taken.

953
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:42,760
The lost hope

954
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,760
doesn't have to be with me.

955
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:47,760
The world they see

956
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,760
must be beyond my imagination.

957
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,760
I live in the place I love the most.

958
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:05,760
I do things

959
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,760
for the people I love the most.

960
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,760
I don't need sympathy.

961
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:16,760
I hope

962
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
you don't live for the past

963
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,760
but for the future.

964
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:26,760
People

965
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,760
live

966
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,760
not necessarily winning.

967
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:34,760
But they can't lose.

968
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,760
The End

969
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,760
It's still here.

970
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,760
The End

971
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,760
The End

972
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:30,760
Hello.

973
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:32,760
Hello.

974
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:34,760
Hello.

975
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,760
Mr. Song.

976
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:38,760
I'm Xiao Ju's mother.

977
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:40,760
Xiao Ju said

978
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:42,760
she wanted to see you.

979
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:50,760
Mom.

980
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,760
Why did you eat the baby?

981
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,760
Xiao Ju.

982
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:57,760
Go to bed.

983
01:09:58,760 --> 01:09:59,760
It won't hurt if you're asleep.

984
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:01,760
Mom.

985
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:03,760
Uncle.

986
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:13,760
Mom.

987
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,760
I want to talk to you.

988
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:17,760
Can you?

989
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,760
Yes.

990
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,760
I've finished writing this book.

991
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:33,760
I'll give it to uncle.

992
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,760
When I was in the hospital,

993
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,760
my next-door sister

994
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,760
cried secretly every day.

995
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:57,760
She cried secretly every day.

996
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:07,760
Xiao Ju.

997
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,760
I'll leave this earphone to you.

998
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:13,760
Really?

999
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:15,760
I also like to listen to this song.

1000
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,760
If you finish the operation,

1001
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:26,760
you can come back.

1002
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,760
I'll take you to the concert, okay?

1003
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,760
She gave me the light she liked the most.

1004
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:35,760
She left.

1005
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:43,760
Uncle.

1006
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,760
If I can't come back after the operation,

1007
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:53,760
you can take me to the concert, okay?

1008
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,760
I'll come back.

1009
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,760
Xiao Ju.

1010
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:08,760
Xiao Ju.

1011
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:09,760
Xiao Ju.

1012
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,760
I want to see your uncle.

1013
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,760
Let's clean up, okay?

1014
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:15,760
Let's clean up.

1015
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:16,760
Let's clean up.

1016
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,760
If you agree with this situation,

1017
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:27,760
please sign it.

1018
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:28,760
Your son.

1019
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,760
I saw Xiao Ju's mother.

1020
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:33,760
On her body,

1021
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,760
I saw the shadow of my mother.

1022
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,760
It turned out to be a real despair.

1023
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:41,760
It wasn't my own fault.

1024
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,760
I was so worried.

1025
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:45,760
I was so worried.

1026
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
I was so worried.

1027
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:49,760
I was so worried.

1028
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,760
I was so worried.

1029
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:53,760
I was so worried.

1030
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:55,760
I was so worried.

1031
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,760
I was so worried about your assassin self.

1032
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:01,760
My droplets of sights here...

1033
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
can't stop them playing.

1034
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:06,760
It is a despair.

1035
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,760
It was my own dreams.

1036
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,760
It was my love.

1037
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:15,160
I can't stop living.

1038
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,760
I'm Song Yili.

1039
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,760
My failure may not be special.

1040
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,760
I've been looking for you since my mother's death.

1041
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,760
I'm not sure if I can find you.

1042
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,760
I'm not sure.

1043
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,760
I'm not sure.

1044
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,760
I'm not sure.

1045
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,760
I'm not sure.

1046
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
I grew up looking for my mother.

1047
01:13:56,760 --> 01:14:00,760
I studied, graduated, got married.

1048
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:03,760
And then divorced.

1049
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,760
Maybe you can't look down on me.

1050
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,760
I can't figure out what's going on in the world.

1051
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,760
When I gave up on my dream,

1052
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,760
I met a little angel.

1053
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,760
Her name is Xiao Ju.

1054
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,760
She's nine years old.

1055
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:43,760
She's a child.

1056
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,760
So we fell in love.

1057
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,760
I never thought that

1058
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,760
I wouldn't save her on this journey.

1059
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:57,760
She saved me.

1060
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,760
We met many people, many things.

1061
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,760
We had each other.

1062
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,760
We fell in love.

1063
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,760
I wanted to die.

1064
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,760
My life is not like that.

1065
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:37,760
But she gave me the same thing.

1066
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,760
The courage to live on.

1067
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,760
I want to live on.

1068
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:05,760
Xiao Ju, how is uncle?

1069
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,760
Do you want to come with me?

1070
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,760
I want to live with you.

1071
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,760
I want to live with you.

1072
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,760
I want to live with you.

1073
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,760
I want to live with you.

1074
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,760
I want to live with you.

1075
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,760
I want to live with you.

1076
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,760
I want to live with you.

1077
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,760
I want to live with you.

1078
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,760
Sister Chen Yan.

1079
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:29,760
Yu Xiao Ju, this is a gift for you.

1080
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:33,760
Uncle, you're dreaming, right?

1081
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
This is a gift.

1082
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,760
Yu Xiao Ju, I'm here to cheer you on.

1083
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,760
Yu Xiao Ju, I'm here to cheer you on.

1084
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,760
I know that the people who listen to my story

1085
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,760
are very good at singing.

1086
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,760
I heard that many people in the Tiantang Routine Club

1087
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,760
hope that everyone

1088
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:25,760
can help me to get out of this little hope.

1089
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,760
Xiao Ju said

1090
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:35,760
she wants to go to see this world.

1091
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:41,760
Let's do it again.

1092
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,760
What?

1093
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:50,760
She said she would go to see the show.

1094
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,760
But she may not be able to wait.

1095
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,760
So I hope that

1096
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,760
everyone can

1097
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,760
help me

1098
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:07,760
to get out of this little hope.

1099
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,760
She's nine years old.

1100
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:26,760
Uncle, how did you do this?

1101
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,760
Because everyone is asking you

1102
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,760
to cheer me on.

1103
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:33,760
Uncle.

1104
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:37,760
Where do you want to go now?

1105
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,760
My mom will pick you up.

1106
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,760
Then?

1107
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:44,760
We'll pick up the most favorite characters

1108
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:47,760
and then we'll keep shooting them until the end of the world.

1109
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:03,760
I've been taking medicine for two years.

1110
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,760
I've been working hard.

1111
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,760
I've been having a little bit of a hangover

1112
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,760
and I'm not done with the story.

1113
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,760
The game is over.

1114
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:21,760
It's almost over.

1115
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:23,760
It's almost over.

1116
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,760
It's almost over.

1117
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
It's almost over.

1118
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,760
It's almost over.

1119
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:34,760
Hello.

1120
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:36,760
Hello, how are you?

1121
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:37,760
I'm fine.

1122
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,760
I'll get you some water.

1123
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:41,760
I'm fine.

1124
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,760
Here you go.

1125
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,760
I'll get you some salt water.

1126
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:46,760
Salt water?

1127
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,760
I want a small piece of noodles.

1128
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:50,760
A small piece of noodles?

1129
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:00,760
The End

1130
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:29,760
The End

1131
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,760
What are you doing?

1132
01:23:54,760 --> 01:23:57,760
As long as I can eat this,

1133
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:00,760
I can go to another world.

1134
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:06,760
I'm done.

1135
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:26,760
The End

1136
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,760
You can't find me.

1137
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,760
Uncle,

1138
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,760
I'm going to make a book.

1139
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:01,760
This diary

1140
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,760
is for you.

1141
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:10,760
Actually,

1142
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:13,760
when I saw you wanted to commit suicide,

1143
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:16,760
I was so angry with you.

1144
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:18,760
I thought

1145
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,760
you were so hard to deal with

1146
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,760
when you wanted to commit suicide.

1147
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,760
I thought

1148
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,760
you were so hard to deal with

1149
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,760
when you were born.

1150
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:34,760
But I still want to save you.

1151
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,760
Because

1152
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:51,760
you're alive.

1153
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:56,760
Uncle,

1154
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,760
you look like you're easily deceived.

1155
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:03,760
I wanted to go,

1156
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,760
so I lied to you.

1157
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,760
I'm going to find my father.

1158
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,760
In this way,

1159
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,760
you'll have things to do.

1160
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:17,760
You won't commit suicide.

1161
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:23,760
Uncle,

1162
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:25,760
you're not a fool.

1163
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:29,760
You're just a little silly.

1164
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,760
But I'm happy

1165
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:35,760
to be with you.

1166
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:43,760
I lied to you.

1167
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,760
Don't be angry.

1168
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:17,760
Uncle,

1169
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:22,760
you have to live well.

1170
01:27:22,760 --> 01:27:24,760
Live well.

1171
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,760
I can't stop doing something for you.

1172
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,760
Even you think it's all yours.

1173
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:52,760
If you can't live on,

1174
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,760
you can't find out

1175
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:57,760
what life will return to you.

1176
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,760
The life between men

1177
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:04,760
and women,

1178
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,760
that's why I'm here.

1179
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,760
I'm here to help you.

1180
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:13,760
The life between men is endless.

1181
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,760
That's why I'm here.

1182
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:18,760
It's endless.

1183
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:28,760
Why should people live?

1184
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:35,760
Because people

1185
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,760
are not just for themselves.

1186
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:39,760
Uncle,

1187
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:41,760
I'm here to see if we can be together.

1188
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:02,760
Uncle,

1189
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,760
you're a grown-up.

1190
01:29:04,760 --> 01:29:06,760
Don't ever come back.

1191
01:29:06,760 --> 01:29:08,760
You're not a fast food.

1192
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:12,760
You should open your own restaurant.

1193
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,760
You're right.

1194
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,760
I'll listen to you.

1195
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:22,760
Thank you.

1196
01:29:22,760 --> 01:29:25,760
For telling me this story.

1197
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:32,760
Thank you.

1198
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:38,760
Thank you.

1199
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,760
Thank you.

1200
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:38,760
You are the desert plan.

1201
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:43,760
Where the world

1202
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:45,760
horses run.

1203
01:30:46,760 --> 01:30:49,760
I want you to know

1204
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,760
you're the first thought.

1205
01:30:52,760 --> 01:30:54,760
I want you to know

1206
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:57,760
the grace you're made of.

1207
01:30:57,760 --> 01:31:00,760
I want you to feel

1208
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:03,760
that you're mine and dear.

1209
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,760
And I want you to know.

1210
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:27,760
By the way,

1211
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:28,760
Uncle,

1212
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,760
are you still listening?

1213
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:35,760
Can you promise me one thing?

1214
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,760
I promise.

1215
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,760
Can I call you

1216
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,760
my father?

1217
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,760
I want you to know

1218
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:14,760
you're the first thought.

1219
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,760
I want you to know

1220
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,760
the grace you're made of.

1221
01:32:20,760 --> 01:32:22,760
I want you to feel

1222
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,760
that you're mine and dear.

1223
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,760
What a story.

1224
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:34,760
I want you to feel that you're mine, dear

1225
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:37,760
Whoa-oh

1226
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:44,760
And I want you to know

1227
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,760
I want you to know

1228
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,760
I want you to know

1229
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:17,760
I want you to know

1230
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:22,760
I want you to know

1231
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:27,760
I want you to know

1232
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:31,760
I wanted to say it

1233
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:36,260
I want you to know

1234
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:40,760
I don't want any more

1235
01:33:42,060 --> 01:33:44,760
I don't want to be mean anymore

1236
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,760
I want to say

1237
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:26,760
Like a child, no need to be sad

1238
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,760
But it's hard to be sad

1239
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,760
As time goes by, I'm like a child

1240
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,760
If I'm already hurt

1241
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:37,760
I'll say my love will be forgotten

1242
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,760
Hello

1243
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:45,760
This is for you

1244
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,760
The name of the flower is Wanyou

1245
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,760
She said time is fierce

1246
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,760
Like water on the river

1247
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,760
Don't go far, I'll go home

1248
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,760
Ah

1249
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:32,760
When we were in the old days

1250
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:34,760
We would come back to the childhood

1251
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:36,760
To love and love and love

1252
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:38,760
You don't need to drink

1253
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:40,760
The clothes that are worn out

1254
01:35:40,760 --> 01:35:42,760
Hold that hand

1255
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:45,760
Hold the smile when you see the warmth

1256
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,760
When we were in the water

1257
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:49,760
Like a child, no need to be sad

1258
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,760
In the dream, make a dream

1259
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,760
I saw you, I was old

1260
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,760
That swimming pool was not a lie

1261
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,760
There was no umbrella

1262
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,760
This love is just a fire in another world

1263
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:03,760
If we meet again

1264
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:05,760
Open a new space

1265
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,760
Every dream is just a chariot of time and space

1266
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:17,760
You and I will be together

1267
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:24,760
Please help me to love the universe

1268
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,760
Wanyou, open the flower

1269
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,760
You are not talking in the moonlight

1270
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:48,760
The regret is like a clouds falling

1271
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:52,760
I am willing to float in the deep of the earth

1272
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:28,760
