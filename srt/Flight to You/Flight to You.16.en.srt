4
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,210
Brother-in-law,

5
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,580
Cheng Xiao is nowhere as experienced

6
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,960
in flying as you are.

7
00:01:42,050 --> 00:01:42,970
So her judgment

8
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,280
cannot be as reliable as yours.

9
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,680
The simulation engineer is here.

10
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,840
Let's start.

11
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,729
The company has decided

12
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,940
to change all the tires.

13
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,130
This plane was involved in an accident,

14
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,910
it's a special situation.

15
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,370
The company and the media are paying special attention to it.

16
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,480
We need to fix it as soon as possible.

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,140
We will have to pull an all-nighter.

18
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,760
I'll treat you all to dinner after.

19
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,530
-Okay. -Let’s get to work.

20
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,870
OK.

21
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:32,990
Cheng Xiao.

22
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,780
Why are you here?

23
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,860
Mr. Ni.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,079
I'm here to see Q.

25
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,020
Q.

26
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,490
B-925Q.

27
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,810
Xiao, you are here.

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,390
Fan.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,220
I’m sorry.

30
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:52,490
It's my fault

31
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,530
that you all have to stay up late again.

32
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,500
It's okay. It's our job.

33
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,520
Let me help you.

34
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,850
Y- you don't have to.

35
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:03,920
It's okay.

36
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,770
You'll get your clothes dirty.

37
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,600
Done.

38
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,340
Thank you.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,100
I'll get back to work.

40
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,579
OK. Thank you for your work.

41
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,210
It's not a problem.

42
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,930
How is the plane?

43
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,700
I just told them

44
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,280
it's lucky you changed directions in time.

45
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,290
Otherwise,

46
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,630
Q would have been disfigured.

47
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,810
Or maybe even

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,660
had a brain hemorrhage.

49
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,470
You really know how to comfort people.

50
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,780
Don't blame yourself.

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,200
I heard it's basically agreed upon that this conflict

52
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,250
was Youji Airline's fault.

53
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,579
Don't you have an investigative meeting later?

54
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Go back and get ready.

55
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,260
Your- Your Q

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,670
is in good hands.

57
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,720
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

58
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,500
Don't call me Mr. Ni anymore.

59
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,310
Just call me Ni Zhan.

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,760
How about I call you Zhan?

61
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,210
That's even better.

62
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,200
Okay. Thank you, Zhan.

63
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,210
Go back now.

64
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,350
Okay.

65
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,150
Goodbye, Zhan. Sorry for the trouble.

66
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,300
Fan, I’m leaving. Bye.

67
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:10,810
Okay, bye.

68
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,400
Sorry for the trouble.

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:29,780
It's okay.

70
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,100
Yuheng,

71
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,960
do you also think

72
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,740
I should come clean to Ms. Ai?

73
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,710
It's okay.

74
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,600
Come in.

75
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,330
Conflict!

76
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,900
Maintain the middle line and hit the brakes!

77
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,730
Simulation number three.

78
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,870
After manually braking,

79
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,230
the plane slid 120 meters,

80
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,190
about 30 meters away

81
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,450
from the other plane.

82
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,270
30 meters?

83
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:57,390
It's half the length of the 787.

84
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,720
Braking would have

85
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,010
completely averted the incident.

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,510
Brother-in-law,

87
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,590
it seems that your judgment was the most accurate.

88
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,420
Forget it.

89
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,720
After the accident investigation,

90
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,180
we have confirmed it's the other party's responsibility.

91
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,130
There's something wrong with Youji Airlines' plane's system.

92
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,670
Why did you suddenly call me?

93
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:01,890
It seems

94
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,500
it has nothing to do with work.

95
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,260
Yesterday,

96
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:09,810
I broke the rules.

97
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,430
I've read the company's internal report.

98
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,790
I wanted to see you, but I didn't have time.

99
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,760
To be honest,

100
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,250
I’m surprised.

101
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,150
My students were in danger,

102
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,170
I couldn’t leave them in the lurch.

103
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:26,790
No.

104
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,710
This excuse

105
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,490
may be enough to fool others,

106
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,720
but it won't work on me.

107
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,110
You, Gu Nanting,

108
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,820
have always prioritized safety above all else.

109
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,010
I was wrong.

110
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:49,310
It's not just about right and wrong.

111
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,330
I'm glad

112
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,180
you've finally made up for this lesson.

113
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,990
I didn't tell you before

114
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,580
because you can understand

115
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,070
only by experiencing it in person.

116
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,080
No matter how well designed

117
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,500
a safety manual is,

118
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,710
it's still mechanistic and rigid,

119
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,390
because you've ignored human factors.

120
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,780
while humans are variables.

121
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,370
An excellent system

122
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,490
should be a system with humanity.

123
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,700
Just like what you did yesterday.

124
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,970
You knew it was against the rules,

125
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,650
but you couldn't control yourself. You had to do it.

126
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,870
Where's the other pilot?

127
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,900
I don’t know.

128
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,250
Cheng Xiao.

129
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,070
What's wrong?

130
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,160
Nanting.

131
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,410
Didn't you

132
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:12,620
get along well with

133
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,320
with Li Yuheng?

134
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,010
Why are you—

135
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,520
Master.

136
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,230
I've known Yuheng since I was young.

137
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,280
She's in Luzhou alone,

138
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,400
I have the responsibility to take care of her.

139
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:26,660
It's just that.

140
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,700
I've seen Li Yuheng's resume.

141
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,900
She has a postgraduate degree in Chinese studies,

142
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,920
but she came to Luzhou

143
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,930
to become a flight attendant.

144
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,240
Have you ever thought about why?

145
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,790
My mom said the same thing.

146
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,240
People around you

147
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,310
understand the situation better than you do.

148
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,100
Actually,

149
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,150
I've also noticed something.

150
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,000
But

151
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,650
I'm not good at dealing with such problems.

152
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,300
This is a major task in life.

153
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,320
It's even more difficult

154
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,050
than work issues.

155
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,070
However,

156
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,940
being indecisive

157
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,260
will hurt everyone involved.

158
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,720
I'll find a chance to make myself clear.

159
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:32,840
What about

160
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,820
Cheng Xiao?

161
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,080
She's just my student.

162
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,010
One of my students.

163
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,560
Ask your heart.

164
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,690
Du.

165
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:30,920
Yes.

166
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,550
Set an alarm in seven hours time.

167
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,100
Okay.

168
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,580
I'll remind you

169
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,080
at 6:12 tomorrow morning.

170
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,310
Turn off the lights. Thank you.

171
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:39,650
The lights are off.

172
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,990
It was so dangerous today.

173
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,170
I didn't know

174
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,720
what would happen to the plane next.

175
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,700
Why did you rush up?

176
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,070
Ask your heart.

177
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:09,810
Come in.

178
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,060
Brother Nanting, you wanted to see me?

179
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,230
Tell Cheng Xiao

180
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:14,960
to attend the internal investigative meeting

181
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,000
in the afternoon.

182
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,310
Brother Nanting.

183
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,050
About the investigative meeting,

184
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,650
the company has sent out an e-bulletin.

185
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,290
They should have sent a mass email as well.

186
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,890
My phone was on silent.

187
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
What about

188
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,610
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

189
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:39,970
Wait.

190
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,130
Give this back to Cheng Xiao.

191
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,450
Why didn't he give it to me himself?

192
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,580
How would I know?

193
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,130
Xiao.

194
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,130
Did you fight with Brother Nanting again?

195
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,620
I don't think so.

196
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,300
Brother Nanting saved you two days ago.

197
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,910
Okay. Stop speculating.

198
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,090
It's not what you think.

199
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,760
Do you want me

200
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,590
to bring something to him for you?

201
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,410
Xiao asked me to pass you this.

202
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,300
She said

203
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,520
she wants to express her gratitude to you.

204
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,520
The calories are excessive.

205
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,110
Do you want some?

206
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,270
No, no, no.

207
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:51,310
Xiao said

208
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,910
she prepared this specially for you.

209
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,510
No one else is qualified to touch it.

210
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,290
This is a

211
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,900
glutinous rice ball.

212
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,440
This is a

213
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,630
waffle.

214
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,350
Brother Nanting.

215
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,830
Do you understand?

216
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,180
Don't waste it.

217
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,430
I'll eat it.

218
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:20,390
I’m leaving.

219
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,530
Xiao's coward set meal

220
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,760
was totally lost on him.

Why did you make such a stupid mistake?

225
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,570
I'm sorry.

226
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,510
I was wrong.

227
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,770
I was negligent as well.

228
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,450
It was an emergency.

229
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,930
In order to help an old man,

230
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,580
I didn't stay back.

231
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,020
After confirming the cabin was cleared,

232
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,330
I didn't fulfil my duty

233
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,760
as the Chief Attendant.

234
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,180
I will accept any punishment the company deems fit.

235
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,790
I'm sorry, Ms. Ai.

236
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,130
I've made trouble for you.

237
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,380
Xia,

238
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,680
you've been in the company for almost seven months.

239
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,470
Your monthly performance evaluations

240
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,050
have been below average all this time,

241
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,370
and you have received many complaint letters.

242
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,920
But strangely,

243
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,070
in terms of letters of praise,

244
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,030
you rank second in your batch.

245
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,060
I've been in the Cabin Service department for so many years,

246
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,589
but you are the only one

247
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,180
I cannot understand.

248
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,310
But this time,

249
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,099
your negligence has violated our bottom line.

250
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,800
What we need

251
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
is to operate as stably and safely as we can.

252
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,609
I don't think you can do it.

253
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,089
So,

254
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,119
I suggest you

255
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,740
switch to another position

256
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:24,700
or to another company.

257
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,380
Ms. Liang.

258
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,250
Xiazhi's negligence

259
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,250
didn't cause any actual losses.

260
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,560
And she has admitted to her mistake.

261
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,310
According to the company's rules and regulations,

262
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,040
her punishment can be reduced.

263
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,480
So I suggest

264
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,830
we let her reflect on herself

265
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,970
and fly for another month. Is that okay?

266
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,410
You're still defending her?

267
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,170
You are the best Chief Attendant

268
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,050
in your department.

269
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,450
You have been on the Luzhou Airlines Magazine five times.

270
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,360
But this time,

271
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,260
your management of order in the cabin

272
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,560
and your leadership over your crew

273
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,300
have been problematic.

274
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,170
The department has decided to give you a major demerit.

275
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:13,660
OK.

276
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,230
I'll make up for my mistakes in the future.

277
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:19,670
But Ms. Liang,

278
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,140
I still hope

279
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,540
you can give Xiazhi another chance.

280
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,530
Xia,

281
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,950
you will be suspended for a week to reflect on yourself.

282
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,100
After you return,

283
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,060
I'll arrange for an Inspector Liu

284
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,020
to supervise your work.

285
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,530
If your performance score

286
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,950
is still below average next month,

287
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,630
then

288
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,270
there's nothing we can do.

289
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,700
Thank you, Ms. Liang.

290
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,880
That's all for today's meeting.

291
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:29,990
Ms. Ai.

292
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,720
Thank you.

293
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,370
I'm sorry.

294
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,510
I won't do it again.

295
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,650
Don't thank me.

296
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,790
I fought for your last chance

297
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,630
because I felt bad.

298
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,310
It doesn't mean I still have hope for you.

299
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,700
It's up to yourself now.

300
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:47,640
You're dismissed.

301
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,120
Don't be sad. It's okay.

302
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:54,770
Xia,

303
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:57,790
Ms. Ai may just be trying to motivate you.

304
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,900
Don't give up.

305
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,250
It's over.

306
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,300
It's really over for me.

307
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,800
Honey,

308
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:05,830
don't be sad.

309
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
Sometimes, choices

310
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,210
are more important than hard work.

311
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,170
We can't force ourselves

312
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:12,260
to do things that are not suitable for us.

313
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,760
Good luck.

314
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,320
Xia,

315
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,190
she's right.

316
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,140
I can't do anything right.

317
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,110
I'm a failure of a flight attendant.

318
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:41,450
That's not true.

319
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,470
Don't say that.

320
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,200
Even if no one supports you,

321
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,330
I will support you.

322
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,080
Done.

323
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,460
Done.

324
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,550
Don't cry.

325
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,990
Let's go. I'll take you to eat skewers, okay?

326
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:05,460
Don't cry anymore.

327
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:11,860
The Joint Investigation Team has identified

328
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,690
the reason for the conflict.

329
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,780
According to the regulations,

330
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,270
the captain of Youji Airlines

331
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,200
should have been on standby behind the waiting line.

332
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,070
However, the brakes malfunctioned,

333
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,400
causing the plane to cross the waiting line,

334
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,300
thus creating the subsequent conflict.

335
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,160
Youji Airlines will be taking full responsibility.

336
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,130
There are no objections.

337
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,960
This conflict

338
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,560
has caused injury to a pilot from our company,

339
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,210
damages to an aircrft,

340
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,360
as well as injury to a public figure.

341
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,930
The incident has been escalated

342
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,270
and its societal implications are unimaginable.

343
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,390
Today, we will mainly be looking into

344
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,430
whether our pilot

345
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,620
had operated appropriately at that time.

346
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:54,600
At that time,

347
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,080
there was a conflict.

348
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,360
As the captain,

349
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,990
I issued an order to maintain the centre line

350
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,570
and brake immediately, at the earliest possible time.

351
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:02,740
At the same time,

352
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,000
I acted to brake the plane.

353
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,050
However, my co-pilot

354
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,120
changed the direction of the plane,

355
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:12,670
causing

356
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,050
human injuries

357
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,660
and damages to the aircraft.

358
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,150
I did not operate the wheel

359
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,100
after the captain had given the brake order.

360
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,750
We acted at almost the same time.

361
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,280
You can listen to the cockpit recording.

362
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,530
Play the cockpit recording.

363
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,150
Conflict!

364
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,090
Maintain the middle line and hit the brakes!

365
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,640
I've calculated the time.

366
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,550
Between the captain's order

367
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,410
and the sound created by wheel friction

368
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:55,660
when the co-pilot operated it,

369
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:56,840
the time lapsed

370
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:57,830
was less than a second.

371
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,230
They acted at almost the same time.

372
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,710
The captain was checking the monitor.

373
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,410
I said, "conflict,"

374
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,930
before he looked up and asked me to brake.

375
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:10,260
But by that time, I had already turned.

376
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,750
Under such an emergency,

377
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:13,680
I thought

378
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,270
using the greatest brake force

379
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,220
was not necessarily a better choice than turning.

380
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,020
The 787 is very heavy.

381
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,240
What if the stop distance after braking

382
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:22,940
wasn't enough?

383
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,770
Are you

384
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,890
questioning a captain’s experience and judgement?

385
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,310
I'm just questioning the facts of the matter.

386
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,170
In that case,

387
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,160
we'll let the facts speak for themselves.

388
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,420
I asked Lin Yicheng

389
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:43,490
to recreate the scenario with me

390
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,810
on the simulator.

391
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,550
Now, I'll show it to you.

392
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:05,940
Conflict!

393
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,890
Maintain the middle line and hit the brakes!

394
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,830
As you can see,

395
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,850
if the co-pilot had followed my order

396
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,190
to maintain the middle line

397
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,120
and hit the brakes

398
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,470
in conjunction with me,

399
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,210
after I had given the order,

400
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,730
our plane

401
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,330
would have stopped safely

402
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,550
30m away from the other plane.

403
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,030
It shows that

404
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:39,400
if the co-pilot

405
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,800
had operated according to my orders

406
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,840
during the incident,

407
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,670
the plane could have stopped without any damage.

408
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,220
There wouldn't have been any need to turn,

409
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,620
nor to use the airport's firefighting resources.

410
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,140
It also wouldn't have caused

411
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,890
any negative physical or psychological impacts

412
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,050
on our passengers.

413
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:02,990
Captain Gu,

414
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,290
what do you think?

415
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,710
Do you think that under those circumstances,

416
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:08,710
my decision to turn was wrong?

417
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,450
I admire your courage

418
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,010
to stay on the plane

419
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,210
until you had saved the last passenger.

420
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,150
But based on existing information and evidence,

421
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,640
I cannot judge

422
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,600
they way you had operated.

423
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,220
We cannot make conclusions

424
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:29,320
on an incident so quickly.

425
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,800
We still need to

426
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,240
conduct a more comprehensive investigation.

427
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,120
The investigation will continue.

428
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,240
Before the results are confirmed,

429
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:39,680
Cheng Xiao.

430
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:41,670
The company has decided

431
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,700
to suspend you from flying.

432
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:47,710
OK.

433
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,300
I accept.

434
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,670
But I still think that

435
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,760
my decision was right.

436
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,250
I will find a way to prove my judgment.

437
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,120
Cheng Xiao.

438
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,490
Yuheng,

439
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,540
Are you feeling better?

440
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,450
Much better. How about you?

441
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:32,050
I'm fine. It's just a minor injury.

442
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:37,780
Xiazhi.

443
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,190
Cheng Xiao.

444
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,120
Brother Nanting.

445
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,110
I need to talk to Cheng Xiao.

446
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,360
We’ll leave first then.

447
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,550
Let's go.

448
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,540
You were very objective at the meeting.

449
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,730
You're right.

450
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,970
Before the results are confirmed,

451
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,970
don't be affected

452
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,180
by this matter.

453
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,710
The company is right too.

454
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:06,960
Objectively,

455
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,630
I did

456
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,950
cause injury to passengers

457
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,270
and damage the plane.

458
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:15,290
I want to use a simulator

459
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,570
to recreate the situation,

460
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,940
and use data to find out if I had done anything wrong.

461
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,580
Okay, I'll apply for it as soon as possible.

462
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,630
Do you need

463
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,080
my help on this?

464
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,000
Yes.

465
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,080
OK.

466
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,760
I'll tell you the time when I can.

467
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:45,780
Ms. Ai.

468
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,000
Cheng Xiao.

469
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
How are you feeling?

470
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,790
I'm much better.

471
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,440
I just need some rest.

472
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,380
That's good.

473
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,590
Ms. Ai.

474
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,410
Well...

475
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,890
Xiazhi...

476
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,680
The decision is out.

477
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:00,610
Right now,

478
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,350
she is on her last month of probation.

479
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,660
I hope she can learn her lesson this time

480
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,800
and make it through.

481
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,290
Xiazhi was indeed in the wrong this time.

482
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:12,170
But in order to be a good flight attendant,

483
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,930
she has given it her all.

484
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:15,940
I hope you can

485
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,460
give her more guidance in the future.

486
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,300
Don't worry.

487
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,680
As long as she's in the Cabin Service department,

488
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
that will be my duty.

489
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,730
Thank you.

490
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,410
You're welcome. I'm leaving.

491
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,560
Hello, everyone.

492
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,850
[Luzhou Airlines]

493
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:38,490
I'm at Luzhou Airlines' door right now.

494
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,970
Let's hear

495
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:40,720
what the airline has to say

496
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,800
about Deng Chao's injury.

497
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,280
Move back. Thank you.

498
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,480
Thanks for the gift.

499
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,880
Behind me is Luzhou Airlines.

500
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,250
Stop filming.

501
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Stop filming.

502
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,240
Excuse me.

503
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,160
Move back.

504
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,560
Let's see if they know

505
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,040
what happened that day.

506
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:00,810
There's so many people around. What are they doing?

507
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,190
Stop.

508
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,400
We have the right to know.

509
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,400
We demand an explanation.

510
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,400
Yes.

511
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,360
The public

512
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,390
-has the right to know. -Brother-in-law,

513
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,740
all of them are either reporters or working in media.

514
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,230
Is it because of

515
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,990
Duan Chao?

516
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:25,620
Brother-in-law,

517
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,620
Duan Chao just posted on Weibo.

518
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,600
"I'm too unlucky.

519
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,690
I took Luzhou Airlines,

520
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,640
but the captain's skills were so terrible,

521
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,880
my neck has been fractured."

522
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,210
It's trending now.

523
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,160
It isn't your fault.

524
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,320
You didn't steer the plane.

525
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,440
After what has happened,

526
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,640
they must think

527
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,970
it’s all the captain’s responsibility.

528
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,480
It’s normal.

529
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,840
Why don't we ask the PR department to handle this?

530
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,070
At least explain

531
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,410
that you didn't do this.

532
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,860
Don't worry.

533
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,710
There will be someone to clarify it for us.

534
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,230
Aren't there many aviation bloggers now?

535
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:06,810
This is a major incident.

536
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,940
they will definitely go investigate.

537
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:10,650
Then they'll know

538
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,700
who made the mistake.

539
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,280
You're right.

540
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,300
Your conscience is clear.

541
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,450
Let's go.

542
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,170
Let's go back.

543
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,870
Let's go from the back.

544
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,200
Set the speed, wind speed, and wind direction

545
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,760
according to those at the time of the incident.

546
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,660
Control your speed after landing

547
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,230
to match the incident too.

548
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,330
28 knots away from the runway.

549
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,700
Alright. I'm preparing to land.

550
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,690
Get ready to give the orders.

551
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:52,520
Okay.

552
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,450
Don't do it too early.

553
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,280
Wait for me to say, "Conflict!" before doing so.

554
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,880
You must recreate Jiang Tao's response at that time.

555
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,180
The decelerator boards are rising. It's effective.

556
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,250
No.

557
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,400
You were facing the panel, Captain Jiang.

558
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:24,240
Conflict!

559
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,310
Maintain the middle line and hit the brakes!

560
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,490
Again.

561
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,510
How much money did the company spend on the simulation?

562
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,240
I'll transfer you.

563
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,310
There's no need.

564
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,240
The company will take care of it.

565
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,250
I can't do that.

566
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:39,560
I can't afford to pay back my life, though.

567
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,520
Don't think like that.

568
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,820
The plane didn't catch on fire that day.

569
00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:47,410
Even if I hadn't rushed in,

570
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,730
you would have been safe.

571
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,030
Look.

572
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,200
We did three simulations,

573
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,020
and Captain Jiang was right all three times.

574
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,310
I was wrong again.

575
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,610
Actually,

576
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:04,320
I knew Captain Jiang's data was right

577
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,750
even before we used the simulator.

578
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,700
Then—

579
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,620
I made us use the simulator only because

580
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,190
I wanted you to know Captain Jiang wasn't picking on you.

581
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,290
I understand now.

582
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,100
However,

583
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,150
If I were the pilot,

584
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,900
I would have chosen to steer too.

585
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:25,970
Why?

586
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,500
During an emergency,

587
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,590
braking is risky.

588
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,650
No matter how good a simulation is,

589
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,130
it cannot perfectly model

590
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,020
the force with which a pilot brakes,

591
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,130
and their response time

592
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,220
during an emergency.

593
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,200
Even 1cm

594
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,360
makes a difference.

595
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:43,150
But as a pilot,

596
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,490
you steered precisely, and the plane did not slip.

597
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,330
These are the facts.

598
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,040
So,

599
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,330
you agree with me?

600
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,050
I agree with your choices.

601
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,350
But if Captain Jiang's accusations

602
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,540
were true,

603
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,160
you would be in the wrong.

604
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,860
Obeying the captain's orders

605
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,890
is not only a rule, but also a matter of discipline.

606
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:00,790
But—

607
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,620
No buts. You must accept this.

608
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,510
I accept.

609
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,880
At least the aircraft's safety was ensured.

610
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,340
I will accept the rest.

611
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,060
How will they penalize me this time?

612
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:18,530
Ground handling?

613
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,790
That was a hypothetical.

614
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,030
At the meeting, you claimed

615
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,630
you steered at the same time

616
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,260
that Captain Jiang gave the orders.

617
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,210
Right!

618
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,350
That means

619
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,429
I didn't defy his orders.

620
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,920
I only acted on instinct.

621
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,139
But

622
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,889
I can't prove that.

623
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,409
That's right,

624
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,210
not with the cockpit recording.

625
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,219
But it's different

626
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:45,840
with the flight data recorder.

627
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:47,090
I have already asked Director Xie

628
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,120
to consider both sets of data

629
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,530
in the subsequent investigation.

630
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,949
This can prove

631
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,170
the veracity of your claims.

632
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:56,739
Thank you.

633
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,700
I just want to uncover the facts.

634
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,880
Stop denying it.

635
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,130
You saved my life too.

636
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,390
If this were in the olden times,

637
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,160
I would have to entrust myself to you.

638
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:25,550
I'm just joking, don't be nervous.

639
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,400
You've received my gift?

640
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,380
Yes.

641
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,230
Don't trouble yourself in the future.

642
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:38,250
They're quite unhealthy.

643
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,380
You really ate them?

644
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,110
Yes.

645
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:41,690
I ran five extra rounds.

646
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,720
Instructor Gu.

647
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,980
I will become an excellent captain.

648
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:54,630
I won't let you down.

649
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,120
I'll be off now.

650
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:30,740
Song,

651
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,980
why are you here?

652
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,020
I don't want to talk about it.

653
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,160
We have a leak upstairs.

654
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,570
It's a flood.

655
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:39,040
Have you informed the landlord?

656
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,800
Yes.

657
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,830
But it will take

658
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,680
at least a month

659
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,490
to get it cleaned up.

660
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,260
What will you do in the meantime?

661
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,390
I can only move out.

662
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,950
The landlord refunded me.

663
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,290
I'll return to the hostel.

664
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,470
Since

665
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,120
it's only temporary,

666
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,860
Xiazhi,

667
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,600
shouldn't we lend our extra bedroom

668
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,270
to Song?

669
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,840
I ate too much.

670
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,070
I'll drink some tea to digest it.

671
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:11,660
Yuheng,

672
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,450
I cannot impose on you.

673
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,870
No it's okay.

674
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,840
Xiazhi isn't angry at you.

675
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,390
Why not you take a look at the room before making a decision?

676
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,680
The balcony and the kitchen are a bit small.

677
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,640
I hope you don't mind.

678
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,140
-It’s OK. -You can do your laundry on the balcony.

679
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,340
You can exercise there.

680
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,930
Let me take a look.

681
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,770
Song,

682
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,880
this is your room.

683
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,940
There used to be

684
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,750
three of us here.

685
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,980
The other girl got married and moved out.

686
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,910
It's comfortable here for Xiazhi and I

687
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,110
so we haven't looked for another roommate.

688
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,670
These boxes are ours.

689
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,690
You can move them away at any time.

690
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,160
This bed is new.

691
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:01,490
Let me try it.

692
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,130
Yuheng.

693
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:07,500
Even though this is only temporary,

694
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,440
I will pay the rent

695
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
in full.

696
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,040
There's no need.

697
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:10,480
Excuse me.

698
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:22,820
Song,

699
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,060
I have conditions if you move in with us.

700
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,130
First. You must do all the chores.

701
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,590
Second. You collect all the deliveries.

702
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:32,840
Third—

703
00:38:32,890 --> 00:38:33,840
Other than cooking,

704
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,520
I can also make stews and milk tea.

705
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,450
I can make all sorts of flavors.

706
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,850
Third

707
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,320
is also the most important.

708
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:42,420
You're not allowed to touch my food.

709
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,000
What's up with her?

710
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,170
What are you doing?

711
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:52,820
I'll get going first.

712
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,410
OK.

713
00:39:59,490 --> 00:39:59,890
Yuheng,

714
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,080
why are you here?

715
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,580
You're still suspended, right?

716
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,860
When you left the house this morning,

717
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,810
has Xia woken up yet?

718
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,710
I was scared that she would feel awkward

719
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,500
if I stayed at home.

720
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:18,680
Right.

721
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,090
She was so down yesterday.

722
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,610
Perhaps

723
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,060
she will feel better

724
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:27,090
after her suspension ends.

725
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,340
Yuheng,

726
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,270
you're so nice.

727
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,060
You're always so considerate.

728
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,270
I have to get on a flight now.

729
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:44,870
Bye.

730
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,380
Bye.

731
00:40:59,210 --> 00:40:59,550
Got it.

732
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,540
Hello.

733
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,740
Welcome to my live stream.

734
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:07,090
I am your friend, Xia.

735
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,130
Long time no see.

736
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,680
Do you miss me?

737
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:13,300
There aren't many of you here right now.

738
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,640
I'll sing for you first

739
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,180
to warm up. Okay?

740
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,780
For the simulator. Take it.

741
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:46,870
Why are you here?

742
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,680
I had a meeting upstairs. I came down to see you.

743
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,990
It's been very happening here the past few days.

744
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,830
I've heard about the investigation meeting.

745
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:08,350
Cheng Xiao...

746
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,920
She's okay.

747
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,080
I approve of her actions.

748
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,240
The investigation results will also prove

749
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,060
she didn't defy the captain's orders

750
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,260
on purpose.

751
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,310
Have you seen the netizens' comments?

752
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,550
What comments?

753
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:32,530
Someone got hold of the

754
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,880
land-air communications

755
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,130
and posted it on the Internet.

756
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,270
Some aviation bloggers believe that

757
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,860
the female pilot had acted without permission,

758
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,230
causing a passenger to get injured.

759
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:46,940
I'm afraid that if the matter blows up,

760
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,390
it'd be bad for Cheng Xiao.
