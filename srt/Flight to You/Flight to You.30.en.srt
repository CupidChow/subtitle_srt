You are a passenger on the plane today.

I can let the air police control you.

00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,530
Okay.

179
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:08,700
Start.

180
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,390
Breathing is gone.

181
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,510
One, two, three, four, five

182
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,780
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

183
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,750
Put it on.

184
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,980
One, two, three, four, five

185
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:47,370
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

186
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,920
Breathing and pulse are gone.

187
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,960
After CPR,

188
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,450
there are no signs of life.

189
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,660
This...

190
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,980
What did he say?

191
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,720
What's wrong with my son?

192
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,630
One, two, three.

193
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,080
One, two, three.

194
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,990
Liang!

195
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,060
Liang!

196
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,360
Liang, hang in there!

197
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:55,850
Liang!

198
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,990
Didn't you say he got better?

199
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,580
Why did he suddenly...

200
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,050
He was still breathing before landing

201
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,800
but when we called him just now...

202
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:22,080
But... but we sent him to the hospital.

203
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,450
The healthcare in Singapore is very good.

204
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,020
There will be hope.

205
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:27,690
Right?

206
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:35,850
Captain,

207
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,690
I'll arrange for the passengers to get off the plane.

208
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,560
Wait,

209
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,070
let the cabin crew

210
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,030
recall what happened today

211
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,980
and fill in

212
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,070
the emergency medical report.

213
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,030
I need to report it to the company when I return home.

214
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,890
No matter what,

215
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,280
this is our first flight to Singapore.

216
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,380
Many reporters will be at the airport.

217
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,180
Tell everyone

218
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,030
that no one is allowed to accept interviews.

219
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:04,660
Okay.

220
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,540
Hello, Mr. Liang,

221
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,800
Mr. Feng.

222
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,410
Hello.

223
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,660
Thank you.

224
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,140
I'm sorry,

225
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,810
because of the weather,

226
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,630
we stayed in Guangzhou last night.

227
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,560
We just arrived.

228
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,100
Thank you.

229
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,640
Let me introduce.

230
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,310
This is Jiang Tao, the director of the Flight Department.

231
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,560
Mr. Liang, nice to meet you.

232
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,090
Welcome.

233
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:51,080
Vice director of the Flight Department, Gu Nanting.

234
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,060
Hello, Mr. Liang.

235
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,590
Welcome.

236
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,480
This is Ni Zhan, the Director of the Maintenance Department.

237
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,410
Hello, Mr. Liang.

238
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:57,900
Hello.

239
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,480
I was also an engineer,

240
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,090
it seems that we used to work in the same field.

241
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,140
Then if I have the chance, I'll learn from you.

242
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,600
I'm no longer in the field,

243
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,730
I should be the one learning from you.

244
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,010
How was it?

245
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,960
Did your flight go well today?

246
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,510
Yes, very well.

247
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:15,730
That's good.

248
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,680
Have a seat.

249
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,140
Please.

250
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:21,940
Mr. Feng,

251
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:23,360
let's not waste time

252
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,670
and proceed to check the signing process.

253
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,070
Okay.

254
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,840
Brother Nanting,

255
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,180
I just got a message from the hospital

256
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,580
that the passenger

257
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,430
couldn't be saved.

258
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,660
Xiao,

259
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
Xia Xia said you love black pepper crabs.

260
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,020
Should we order one?

261
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,280
Do you want some noodles?

262
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,460
No, don't mind me.

263
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,720
You guys eat.

264
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,840
I...

265
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,030
will go out for some fresh air.

266
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,650
How could this happen...

267
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,490
How?

268
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,700
You are a pilot,

269
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:13,819
why didn't you fly faster?

270
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,480
If we had arrived earlier, my son wouldn't have died!

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,280
If we had arrived earlier, the doctor would've been able to save him,

272
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,060
my son would've survived!

273
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,250
Why didn't you save him?

274
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,210
I'm sorry, Uncle.

275
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:31,410
We only have one son.

276
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,280
What's the point of me and his mother living now?

277
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,680
My son shouldn't have died!

278
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,810
My son should've lived!

279
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,720
It's all your guys' fault!

280
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,800
Pay for my son!

281
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,560
Sir! Sir! Calm down!

282
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,130
It's not her fault, sir.

283
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,490
Calm down, calm down.

284
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,840
Sir,

285
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,650
your son's passing

286
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,560
also makes us very sad.

287
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,560
As the captain of this flight,

288
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,240
on behalf of everyone in our team...

289
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:07,810
Captain.

290
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,110
Yes.

291
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,770
You are the captain!

292
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,280
Why didn't you fly faster?

293
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,680
We already went at maximum speed.

294
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,380
My son died on your plane!

295
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,930
Pay for my son!

296
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,570
Pay for my son!

297
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,040
Sir, calm down.

298
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Pay for my son!

299
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,740
Sir.

300
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,870
My son...

301
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,170
Come here.

302
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,990
Make sure to keep an eye on this man.

303
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,020
He's very emotional right now,

304
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,880
don't let anything happen to him.

305
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,820
Also,

306
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:54,390
if he asks for anything,

307
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,970
let me know right away.

308
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:56,730
We...

309
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,810
We'll try to satisfy him.

310
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,780
I understand, don't worry.

311
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Brother-in-law.

312
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,050
I... I packed some food for you.

313
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,920
Have some.

314
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,930
Put it there.

315
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,730
Go back to your room,

316
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,230
I want to rest.

317
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,180
Brother-in-law, health is important.

318
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:56,870
You know,

319
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,390
if my sister finds out you're not eating or drinking,

320
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,170
she'll be worried

321
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,330
and she'll scold me.

322
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,190
Just have a bite.

323
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,810
The flight back tomorrow will go as planned.

324
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,860
The captain is Gu Nanting.

325
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,650
Actually...

326
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,880
Okay, I'll go back and rest.

327
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,130
You should rest, too.

328
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,090
I want to be alone for a while.

329
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,160
I've been thinking,

330
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,630
if we chose to divert back then,

331
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,140
would the result be different?

332
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,710
There are many things

333
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,510
that shouldn't be thought about after the result.

334
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,450
It will drag you into

335
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,390
a whirlpool of negative emotions.

336
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:43,550
Ten years ago,

337
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,300
at San Diego,

338
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:50,970
there was a female pilot.

339
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,920
While flying,

340
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,880
she flew into the sea.

341
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,570
That was her first time flying alone.

342
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:10,760
The standards for general aviation in America are very loose,

343
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,090
so she decided her flying route on her own.

344
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,200
I agreed.

345
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,540
Because I fully trusted her.

346
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,280
She flew too low on the sea

347
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,260
and encountered sudden air flow.

348
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,470
I stood on the shore

349
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,980
and saw her overreacting,

350
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,600

to follow the rules strictly,

what we can do

369

is to prevent the pain from repeating.

00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:48,949
Why would Mr. Guo

524
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:50,350
upload a video like this?

525
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,210
It must be the lawyer's idea.

526
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,610
When I signed the contract today,

527
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:55,800
I saw the lawyer

528
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,680
taking him to Mr. Jiang.

529
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,460
He must think it's because

530
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:02,240
we didn't divert

531
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,650
so we missed the best time

532
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,590
to save his son.

533
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,250
Could we have diverted at the time?

534
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,470
At least when I contacted the control,

535
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,010
they didn't reject us.

536
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,520
They just asked us to wait.

537
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,200
So,

538
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,990
if Saigon could divert,

539
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,530
would Mr. Jiang

540
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:20,380
be in trouble?

541
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:23,430
I need to call Tan

542
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,230
and ask the PR department to deal with it.

543
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,530
Brother-in-law,

544
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,450
take a look at the comments.

545
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,040
Many professionals

546
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,130
are commenting.

547
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,000
Once a passenger is found to be sick,

548
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,660
the crew must prepare for landing immediately.

549
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,170
There are so many comments like this.

550
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,240
What professionals?

551
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:45,530
A bunch of trolls.

552
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,460
They're just pretending to know what they're saying.

553
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,230
Brother-in-law,

554
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,930
why don't we clarify this?

555
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,360
At that time,

556
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,220
the passenger's situation on the plane was stable.

557
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,400
Besides, you have decided to increase your flight speed,

558
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,350
which makes sense.

559
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:00,880
Moreover, the medical technology in Singapore

560
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
is clearly much better than Saigon.

561
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,580
Mr. Jiang chose to directly fly

562
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,950
to Singapore which has better medical conditions.

563
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,610
This is not against the rules.

564
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,380
If you were the captain,

565
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,020
would you have diverted?

566
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,720
Of course.

567
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,210
Mr. Guo's lawyer must know this.

568
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,770
Why does he have to make noise online?

569
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,030
To create public discussion, of course.

570
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,510
The greater the negative impact,

571
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,160
the greater the pressure on Luzhou Airlines.

572
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,000
In order to settle things,

573
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:29,390
you have to pay for it.

574
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:30,850
Do you understand?

575
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,020
What are you talking about...

576
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,780
You should learn from me.

577
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,840
I don't think that's what he wants.

578
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,330
Then what is it?

579
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:45,780
An apology

580
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,880
that he may not get.

581
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,480
Who is it?

582
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,750
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

583
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,700
I'm Jia Qi from the security department.

584
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,630
Due to some problems online,

585
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,190
the company has decided to set up a temporary investigation team

586
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,030
to review the case next Monday.

587
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,240
Please coordinate your time

588
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,520
to attend the meeting.

589
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:22,590
Okay.

590
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,760
No problem.

591
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,140
It's my duty.

592
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,650
What’s wrong, brother-in-law?

593
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,570
Mr. Jiang wants to talk to me. I’m leaving.

594
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:08,720
You...

595
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,030
just landed?

596
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,310
Mr. Jiang wants to talk to me.

597
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:16,740
He probably wants to talk

598
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,850
about the video.

599
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,480
I'll go with you.

600
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:22,350
No need.

601
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,080
After all, you weren't in the cockpit.

602
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:33,090
You are just a passenger.

603
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:37,790
He may be

604
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,380
in a bad mood now.

605
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,600
When you go,

606
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,140
listen rather than talk.

607
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,630
Reach out to me if you need anything.

608
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,160
It's fine.

609
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,640
He probably just wants to discuss on

610
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,240
how to deal with the discussions going around.

611
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:57,790
I don't think I need to bother you.

612
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,720
I'll get going then.

613
00:39:24,850 --> 00:39:26,450
There is a heated discussion

614
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,340
regarding this on the Internet.

615
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,480
You've seen it, right?

616
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:32,390
Yes.

617
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,610
Do you want some sugar or milk?

618
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,370
No need.

619
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:37,700
Okay.

620
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,680
Thank you.

621
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,250
Cheng,

622
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,320
us flight crew

623
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,640
have the same fate

624
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,530
as the cabin crew behind, right?

625
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:54,870
A passenger

626
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,980
died on the plane.

627
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,970
No one would've wanted

628
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,250
such tragedy.

629
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,480
A life has passed away.

630
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:06,930
There's no turning back.

631
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:09,410
What we can do now

632
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,180
is to prevent

633
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,530
such tragedy from happening again,

634
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:15,330
right?

635
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,500
This matter

636
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,590
was about to settle down.

637
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,440
But the victim's father

638
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,200
decided to make waves again.

639
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,800
Cheng,

640
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,170
I hope to keep this this matter

641
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,060
simple.

642
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,710
Next week, our company

643
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,940
will be reviewing this case.

644
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,630
At that time,

645
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:46,490
don't mention

646
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,600
the part about diverting at Saigon airport,

647
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,010
Okay?

648
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:50,360
Why?

649
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,920
You want me to hide

650
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,480
the fact that we could've diverted at Saigon?

651
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:58,160
It's not hiding.

652
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,220
Cheng,

653
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:01,020
I just don't want this

654
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,050
to become more complicated.

655
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,330
But your decision was appropriate too.

656
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,180
Cheng,

657
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,460
you don't understand what I mean.

658
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,520
This is not the time

659
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
to fight.

660
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,570
If we let other's know

661
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,060
about Saigon Airport,

662
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,870
we will be in trouble.

663
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,720
There will be a lot of unnecessary discussions.

664
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,120
Right?

665
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,100
There will be malicious rumors made up.

666
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,690
Look at what's going on

667
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,840
on the Internet now.

668
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:31,960
Where the public opinion goes towards,

669
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,890
it's not something we can control.

670
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,320
This is not only about

671
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,590
me as the captain,

672
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,820
it will also implicate the whole team,

673
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,400
and even our whole company.

674
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,340
Can't you imagine

675
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,440
how serious it would become?

676
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:44,880
But,

677
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,340
your decision was not wrong

678
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,450
and I believe the company

679
00:41:49,450 --> 00:41:50,410
will find a way

680
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,360
to clarify the truth to the public.

681
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,910
If there are any consequences,

682
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,570
as a member of the flight crew,

683
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:00,430
I'm willing to bear it together.

684
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,870
If there's nothing else,

685
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:11,040
I'll leave now.

686
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:28,130
Why can't you understand?
