[Episode 34]

4
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,600
In 1984,

5
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,130
many of you were not born.

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,280
That year, I started my flight career

7
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,210
with Fanhai Airlines.

8
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,890
Some young colleagues may not know

9
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:11,510
what I went through

10
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,600
in 2004.

11
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,860
That year,

12
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,970
the plane was at 101 altitude.

13
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,610
The plane was suddenly damaged.

14
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,270
I was the captain then.

15
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,390
Mr. Jiang was the first officer.

16
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,760
We cooperate and

17
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,310
successfully landed in a field outside the runway,

18
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:33,220
and protected all tourists.

19
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:36,230
This event

20
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,000
has changed my life.

21
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,380
I think it also changed everyone

22
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,730
that was on this flight.

23
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:44,200
Later on,

24
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,850
we became known as the Hero Team.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,600
But

26
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,550
I hope that there will be no more heroes

27
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,600
in our industry.

28
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,930
Because this can prove that

29
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,760
our every flight is extremely safe.

30
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:02,640
For me,

31
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,500
protecting every flight

32
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:08,150
is the priority and my only responsibility.

33
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,850
Nothing can

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,960
can surpass their lives.

35
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,680
Unfortunately,

36
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,020
because of my health,

37
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,350
I have to say goodbye to the sky in advance.

38
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,320
The 27,000-hour flight hours I have

39
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,460
will stop today.

40
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,440
In addition to administrative work,

41
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,650
I will continue to be the instructor of the simulator.

42
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:41,960
Lastly,

43
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,180
I want to hold a simple

44
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,030
succession ceremony.

45
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:47,700
May I have

46
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,280
the flight crew that was on the same flight as me today

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
come on the stage.

48
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:04,570
The number is not right.

49
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,300
Why are we all male pilots here?

50
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,380
I remember there was a female pilot

51
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,770
on the plane today too.

52
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,800
Cheng Xiao,

53
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,340
please come up.

54
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,250
I want to ask you.

55
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,070
Every time in the cockpit,

56
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,780
when you se the passenger

57
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,180
from the corridor bridge,

58
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:54,060
what do you observe

59
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,820
and what do you notice?

60
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,490
I will observe

61
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,260
whether the operators on the corridor bridge are in place

62
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,930
and if the tow truck is in place.

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,130
If there is any delay,

64
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,800
it will affect my operation.

65
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:11,740
I will observe

66
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,970
if there are any suspicious passengers

67
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,540
or if there are any mentally unstable

68
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,610
or drunk passengers,

69
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,670
or passengers who'd toss a lucky coin

70
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,130
into the engine.

71
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,600
If we find it immediately,

72
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,200
we can stop the potential danger immediately.

73
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,510
That's right.

74
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,830
Cheng Xiao, what about you?

75
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,790
I would think

76
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,450
of them

77
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,420
are ordinary people.

78
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,540
I'll see if

79
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,100
they're happy or sad today.

80
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,220
I'll think about

81
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,780
what kind of journey they are going on.

82
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,830
Are they going out to work?

83
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,280
Or are they going home to reunite with their family?

84
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,880
In this journey,

85
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,420
would they need any of our crew members' help

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,400
and care?

87
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,490
They are all answers I wanted to hear.

88
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,900
All these years,

89
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,650
the most satisfying moment I had

90
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,510
is not a promotion, a raise,

91
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,030
awards, or praise,

92
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:41,770
but every time

93
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,640
I send every passenger

94
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,330
safely to the destination,

95
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,670
completing their schedule.

96
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,120
I think this is the greatest achievement

97
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,510
as a captain.

98
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,680
Next,

99
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,790
I want to give you

100
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,180
a small gift for you.

101
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,430
This is a luggage tag

102
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,320
made from the external surface

103
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,860
of the 737-300 that year.

104
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,690
Although the plane retired gloriously,

105
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,480
the warning left behind

106
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,270
is always there.

107
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,930
I hope you can always carry

108
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,800
your mission and responsibilities.

109
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:06,860
All the best.

110
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,610
[Panama City]

111
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:57,740
Captain Gu,

112
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,900
the court notified that the trial will start in three days.

113
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,990
Any progress?

114
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,050
Can I help you?

115
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,900
Captain Camil?

116
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,410
Yes, it’s me.

117
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,220
Yes!

118
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,290
At that time,

119
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,060
the Saigon Airport

120
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,550
indeed wasn't closed.

121
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,690
So why should I do like that?

122
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,580
Captain Gu,

123
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,840
it gets me asking you why,

124
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,990
are you going the opposite way of your company?

125
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,180
I want to find out the truth.

126
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,990
I certainly appreciate your courage.

127
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,610
But I disagree

128
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,080
with what you want to do.

129
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,110
Camil.

130
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,530
Camil.

131
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,170
Actually,

132
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,730
I'm doing this

133
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,790
a faithful girl.

134
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,860
She's a co-pilot at that airline.

135
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,600
I've been flying three days straight,

136
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,330
over 40,000 kilometers,

137
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,090
just to find a witness,

138
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,080
someone who can testify in court

139
00:11:04,310 --> 00:11:05,440
that she didn't lie.

140
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,410
I was exactly like you when I was young.

141
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,260
Crazy for love.

142
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,050
But love is nothing.

143
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,760
And no one will be good.

144
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,510
It's not worthy.

145
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,520
Camil.

146
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,620
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry.

147
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,700
Mr. Xie

148
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,050
is really

149
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,000
a respectable senior.

150
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,260
The trial is set.

151
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,980
It's in three days.

152
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,630
Mr. Jiang told me.

153
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,010
He asked me to testify in court.

154
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,060
Yicheng.

155
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,380
I know you have your own concerns and consideration.

156
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,370
But only you know

157
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:56,970
what happened back then.

158
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,210
So I still want to ask you

159
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,840
to tell the truth in court.

160
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,600
When Doudou grows up,

161
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,420
if she know her pilot father

162
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,270
can’t even be honest,

163
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:33,980
what do you think

164
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,490
she will think?

165
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,920
To be honest,

166
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,480
and true to our duties,

167
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,570
this is the oath we took

168
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,050
when we first started.

169
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,490
Sorry.

170
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,640
Doudou’s waiting for me at home.

171
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,730
I got to leave.

172
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,270
Captain Cheng.

173
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,310
Mr. Liu.

174
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,240
I've made up my mind.

175
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,110
I'm willing to testify in court.

176
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,590
Okay.

177
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,280
But

178
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,390
I have to remind you.

179
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,620
I haven't found

180
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,860
other strong evidence.

181
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,390
The outcome of this case...

182
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,050
I know.

183
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,120
It's okay.

184
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,690
Send me the time and location.

185
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,130
Okay.

186
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,010
Cheng Xiao,

187
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,880
I need to go on an urgent business trip for a few days.

188
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,140
Take care of yourself.

189
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,620
Trust me. Everything will be fine.

190
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:51,430
[Two days later]

191
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,190
Cheng Xiao agreed to go to court tomorrow.

192
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,190
Okay, got it.

193
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,340
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

194
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
See you tomorrow.

195
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,150
It's still off.

196
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,800
Song, think about

197
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,680
who else we can get in touch with?

198
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,610
It seems

199
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,690
she really made up her mind.

200
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,280
No.

201
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,280
She just told me two days ago

202
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,710
that she hasn't decided to testify in court yet.

203
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,910
What should we do now?

204
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:37,610
We can't just watch Xiao jump into a fire pit.

205
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,280
Xiao told me that she...

206
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,750
I know. She told us.

207
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,240
Xiao switched off her phone.

208
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,770
No one can persuade her now.

209
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,260
Then...

210
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,150
What about Brother Nanting?

211
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,280
He's on sick leave.

212
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,950
He has been out of touch for days.

213
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,680
He didn't reply to my messages.

214
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:53,430
Aren't you his lackey?

215
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,720
but you can't even find him at critical moments like this.

216
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,250
Oh right,

217
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,310
I texted Auntie Qin a few days ago.

218
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,460
She said she had no idea.

219
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,790
But I asked Mr. Ni later.

220
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,630
Brother Zhan?

221
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,079
But Mr. Ni said he was busy.

222
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,359
He told me not to worry.

223
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,720
-He’s busy?
-He’s busy?

224
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:11,880
Didn't you say he's sick?

225
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,050
Well...

226
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,510
I have no idea.

227
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,810
We can contact either of them.

228
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:20,339
Why do I feel something big is going to happen?

229
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,410
Xiao,

230
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:31,820
I can't hear your voice.

231
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,820
What did you use to call me?

232
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,280
My phone's out of battery.

233
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,940
I called you with my computer.

234
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,580
I have to say...

235
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,080
You two are really...

236
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,470
How did you two end up in court?

237
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:50,500
This is ridiculous.

238
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,850
How about

239
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,990
I go there tomorrow?

240
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,260
No, no, no.

241
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,460
It'll be messier if you come.

242
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,680
Ms. Fang is sure to win.

243
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,060
Don’t worry about her.

244
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,900
What about you?

245
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,560
Don't worry about me.

246
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,140
I'm just telling the truth anyway.

247
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,490
Both of you

248
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,820
are so stubborn.

249
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,490
Alright.

250
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,090
I'll tell you the result tomorrow.

251
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,510
Fine.

252
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,250
Then just tell the truth.

253
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,680
You must control your emotions.

254
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,780
Remember,

255
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,280
don't be agitated

256
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,040
by the opposing lawyer.

257
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:35,720
It's so late.

258
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:37,480
Who could it be at this hour?

259
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,910
Probably the property management.

260
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,240
Dad, I'll hang up first.

261
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:41,970
Okay.

262
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,690
Take care of yourself.

263
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,680
Okay, bye.

264
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,050
You...

265
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,400
You...

266
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,130
Where did you go?

267
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,350
I couldn’t persuade the two captains

268
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,770
to testify in court.

269
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,560
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,240
You went to...

271
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:25,920
Thank you.

272
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,140
You've done enough for me.

273
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,330
You have to testify in court tomorrow.

274
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,920
Don't go. You can't win.

275
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,500
You look

276
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,020
tired.

277
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
Go back and rest.

278
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,890
Don't testify in court.

279
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,890
Let me.

280
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,750
Captain Camil of Mile Airlines

281
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,820
told me that

282
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,120
Saigon Airport wasn't closed.

283
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:00,950
Tomorrow,

284
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,870
I'll testify in court.

285
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,170
-But, you will be...
-I’m your Instructor.

286
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:11,100
Anyway, listen to my arrangement.

287
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,840
Instructor Gu,

288
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,220
I’ve graduated.

289
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,950
Let's go. I'll see you off.

290
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,660
You can send me to here.

291
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,340
Promise me.

292
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,370
Do as I say tomorrow.

293
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,250
You have your own ideas.

294
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:06,740
I won't stop you.

295
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:13,900
Okay.

296
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,850
I will support you.

297
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:18,930
Really?

298
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,450
Zhan?

299
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,640
I couldn't get through to you.

300
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,540
I was just passing by,

301
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,870
so I came to check on you.

302
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,730
You're back.

303
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,960
Did it go well?

304
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,410
So you won't

305
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,940
testify tomorrow, right?

306
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:51,870
Zhan.

307
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,350
I...

308
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,100
What about you?

309
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,740
Did you agree?

310
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:01,940
Since she has decided,

311
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,390
I'll support her.

312
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,960
Gu Nanting,

313
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,730
do you know what you're doing?

314
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,010
You're harming her.

315
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,610
If she doesn't stand up to this,

316
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:14,880
she will live the whole life

317
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,560
in a bigger sense of guilt.

318
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,600
To testify with unreliable memories,

319
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,000
the court won't admit it.

320
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,080
It's bad for both her and the company.

321
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,060
I really don't understand

322
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,120
why you have to make the worst choice.

323
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,280
Zhan,

324
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,670
I've made up my mind.

325
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,700
I will bear

326
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,140
any consequences.

327
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,550
You've become

328
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,740
so irrational for her?

329
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:08,960
If it were me,

330
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,990
I would have done the same.

331
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,060
Ni Zhan.

332
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,210
there's something I want to tell you.

333
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,880
You're finally willing to tell me.

334
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,230
Yes.

335
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,000
I admit I like Cheng Xiao.

336
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,530
I hope I can be with her.

337
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,160
After Yi left,

338
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,060
I was afraid of starting a new relationship

339
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,520
and I just want to be alone.

340
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,860
I never thought

341
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,100
someone could make me change.

342
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,540
In Lanshan,

343
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,280
I admit that

344
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,420
at that time,

345
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,420
I started developing feelings for her.

346
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,580
But it was just a budding feeling.

347
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,880
I tried to convince myself

348
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,590
I was just mistaken about my feelings for her.

349
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,840
But I was wrong.

350
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,560
Actually,

351
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
I've never been honest with myself.

352
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,110
But now I understand.

353
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,670
I shouldn't do this to Cheng Xiao

354
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,610
for what I owe Yi and you.

355
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,750
Anyway,

356
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,600
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,680
Gu Nanting.

358
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,740
What happened to Yi

359
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,690
was just an accident.

360
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:08,890
Also,

361
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,120
you don’t owe me anything.

362
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,300
Captain Cheng,

363
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,160
we’ve arrived.

364
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,840
Thank you for coming.

365
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:28,790
Mr. Guo also asked me

366
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,280
to express his gratitude.

367
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,330
Xiao.

368
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:45,910
Xiao.

369
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,890
-Why do you have to come?
-Xiao.

370
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,700
Who would believe your sole evidence?

371
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,820
We still have a chance.

372
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,150
Think it through, okay?

373
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,320
Xiao,

374
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,910
reconsider it.

375
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:55,790
Yeah.

376
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,290
Auntie and Director Jiang is here.

377
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,440
-Mr. Jiang.
-Mr. Jiang.

378
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,510
I know you care about me.

379
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,540
I've prepared my self for the worst.

380
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,610
If I don't tell the truth,

381
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,660
I will never be at ease.

382
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,170
Let's go.

383
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,250
All rise.

384
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,150
Your Honor.

385
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,000
The trial is ready.

386
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,570
Please sit down.

387
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,580
The case of Guo Weijin and Luzhou Airlines

388
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,180
on air transport personal injury

389
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,270
conflict's trial

390
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,180
starts now.

391
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:57,780
[Plaintiff Witness Room]

392
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,440
President Xu is also here today.

393
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:21,100
Many of people from Luzhou Airlines are here.

394
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,770
Next,

395
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,830
please testify.

396
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Please play the recording in court.

397
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,220
Attention, all units.

398
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,190
Saigon Airport

399
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,920
was closed due to intrusion of unidentified object.

400
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,520
Gaosha 263, please orbit at present position.

401
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,510
Mile 221, please orbit at present position.

402
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,450
Maintain flight level at 24,000 feet.

403
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:51,010
Orbit right and waiting,

404
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,720
Gaosha 263.

405
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,270
Maintain flight level at 22,000 feet.

406
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,820
Orbit right and waiting,

407
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,400
Mile 221.

408
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,710
According to the original recording

409
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,210
provided by Saigon Airport Control,

410
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,600
when Mr. Guo Xiaoliang's

411
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,200
medical illness occured,

412
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,800
Saigon Airport was closed.

413
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,240
There's no condition for a rediversion.

414
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,540
The flight crew of Luzhou Airlines

415
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,420
did their best

416
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,070
to treat Mr. Guo.

417
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,720
and arranged for him to be in the first class.

418
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,880
The flight crew took close care of him.

419
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:22,120
The captain also chose

420
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,920
to fly at the maximum speed of the flight while maintaining safety.

421
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,610
Mr. Guo

422
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,580
died suddenly when the flight

423
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,820
was descending.

424
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,530
Luzhou Airlines is not responsible

425
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,790
for Mr. Guo's death.

426
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,020
Your Honor,

427
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,120
we believe

428
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,430
the recording of the ground to air conversation is suspicious.

429
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,420
We request for a witness to testify.

430
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,890
Witness, please.

431
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,680
Witness Cheng Xiao, please.

432
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,430
Don’t be nervous.

433
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,480
It's just telling the truth.

434
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,680
I’m the co-pilot of flight XD805.

435
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,470
Cheng Xiao.

436
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,420
After Mr. Guo had his medical condition for the first time,

437
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,400
under Captain Jiang’s authorization,

438
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,450
I contacted Saigon Airport's Control.

439
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:08,660
The other party coordinated for a diversion immediately.

440
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,050
Captain,

441
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,150
the nearest airport is Saigon.

442
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,590
Should we divert?

443
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,280
Chief Flight Attendant,

444
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,890
we are making preparations to divert,

445
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:21,250
please take care of the passengers.

446
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,980
Yes, sir.

447
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,050
Notify Saigon Airport Control

448
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,670
and report the flight situation.

449
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:27,150
Tell them what we require for the emergency landing.

450
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,040
As we waited for the coordination,

451
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,750
Captain Jiang asked me to go to the cabin

452
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,640
to check the patient’s condition.

453
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,440
Go to the cabin

454
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,770
to confirm the condition of this tourist.

455
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,430
Okay.

456
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:39,190
I found that

457
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,390
the patient is getting better.

458
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,680
When I returned to the cockpit,

459
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,480
Captain Jiang made his decision

460
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,080
to go straight to Singapore.

461
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,710
But he didn't mention

462
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,220
any relevant information about the airport being closed.

463
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,910
Captain Jiang explained that

464
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:57,210
when I left the cockpit,

465
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,310
the Saigon Airport had communicated with him.

466
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,240
But when I returned to the cockpit,

467
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,890
I heard Captain Jiang telling the control

468
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:09,860
The patient is getting better. Thank you.

469
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,350
But this is not included in

470
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,210
the ground to air

471
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,690
communication recording

472
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,800
we just heard.

473
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,140
Therefore,

474
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,000
I doubt the authenticity of this recording.

475
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,030
Your Honor.

476
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,300
Whether the recording is real or not

477
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,020
has nothing to do with this case.

478
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,480
I request the court to rule out this witness.

479
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,900
The plaintiff wishes for Captain Jiang Tao

480
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,500
to explain why he had altered

481
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,160
the ground to air communication recording.

482
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,290
What is he avoiding?

483
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,750
Defendant, please continue to testify.

484
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,770
Witness,

485
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,580
what’s your relationship with Captain Jiang Tao?

486
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,530
He’s my boss.

487
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,330
During the runway conflict

488
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,240
which occured June 14 last year,

489
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,230
did you have a conflict

490
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,430
with Captain Jiang?

491
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,330
This has nothing to do with this case.

492
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:08,159
Have you had more than one conflict

493
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,310
with Captain Jiang?

494
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:19,810
Witness, please answer.

495
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,080
Yes.

496
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,920
Witness,

497
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,179
did you have a conflict

498
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,840
with Captain Jiang

499
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,340
with Captain Jiang?

500
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:34,440
No.

501
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,290
Your Honor,

502
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,940
the witness has personal feuds

503
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,159
with our client.

504
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,739
The witness has a reason

505
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,260
to frame my client

506
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,780
given her personal feuds.

507
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,040
Therefore, her testimony

508
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:49,500
can't be used

509
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,449
as evidence for this case.

510
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,960
Does the defendant and their representative

511
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,510
have any other evidence?

512
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,780
I have no further testimony.

513
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,910
Witness, please leave.

514
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,290
I've said everything.

515
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
I need some fresh air.

516
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,400
Your Honor.

517
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,650
The plaintiff would like to call for the second witness

518
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,480
to testify regarding the questionable nature of the recording.

519
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,210
Witness, please come forward.

520
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,570
I don't know.

521
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,320
I don't know.

522
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,180
Why is it Mr. Gu?

523
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,340
This witness is

524
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,090
the Deputy Director of the Flight Department of Luzhou Airlines,

525
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,100
and has been working in the company for many years.

526
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,970
He is very familiar with every employee

527
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,430
in the Flight department.

528
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,900
After First Officer Cheng Xiao reported to me

529
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,130
that there was a problem with the air-ground communications recording,

530
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:50,990
I gave her the benefit of the doubt

531
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,340
and took the initiative

532
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,200
to verify the original recording.

533
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,800
I found that nothing was wrong.

534
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,060
However, afterwards,

535
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,400
I met with the observer of flight 805,

536
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:00,600
Lin Yicheng,

537
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,550
and the captain, Jiang Tao.

538
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,400
Lin Yicheng was avoidant regarding my questions

539
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,240
about problems with the recording.

540
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,760
He looked hesitant and guilty.

541
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,560
Captain Jiang

542
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:11,140
refused my request to send an official letter

543
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,110
the the captains of the two aircrafts

544
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,230
who were in the same airspace in Saigon Airport

545
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,690
at the time of the incident

546
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,210
to get their testimonies.

547
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,090
Three days ago,

548
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,640
I spoke to

549
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,360
the two pilots

550
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,600
had been hovering above Saigon Airport.

551
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,340
One of them said

552
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:27,470
the airport was not closed.

553
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,620
Yes.

554
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,260
Yes.

555
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,970
Mr. Gu Nanting,

556
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:40,620
can the captains of those two aircrafts

557
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,330
testify in court

558
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,740
to verify your claim?

559
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,420
Because of various reasons,

560
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,670
they have declined to testify in court.

561
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,300
They claim that the recording department is fabricated.

562
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,420
Do you have any evidence?

563
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,780
No.

564
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,350
Witness,

565
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,720
are you competing with my client, Jiang Tao,

566
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,780
for the position of Vice President of Luzhou Airlines?

567
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,090
Yes.

568
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,910
Do you want to become

569
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:16,370
the Vice President of Luzhou Airlines?

570
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:16,920
Yes.

571
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,000
Your Honor.

572
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,880
The plaintiff hasn't shown

573
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,700
any evidence of modifications made to the recording.

574
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,660
And no one can prove

575
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,820
what this witness claims he has heard.

576
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,800
Moreover, there is a conflict of interest

577
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,000
between the defendant and the witness.

578
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,520
Therefore, we believe

579
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,250
the witness's testimony has no probative power.

580
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,560
What should we do?

581
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,210
[Captain Camil]

582
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,860
Hello, Captain Camil.

583
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,570
Hello, Captain Gu.

584
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,060
I changed my mind.

585
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,260
Thank you.

586
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,260
But the trial

587
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,480
has already begun.

588
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,420
Your Honor.

589
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,480
We request to call a witness to the stand

590
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,260
to testify about

591
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,560
the true situation in the cabin that day.

592
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,720
Witness, please come forward.

593
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:12,090
I was the observer of the flight that day.

594
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,190
After Mr. Guo fell sick,

595
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,660
we applied for diversion first minute

596
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,200
at the earliest possible moment.

597
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:24,950
After that,

598
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,040
Cheng Xiao left the cabin

599
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,880
to check in on the patient.

600
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,150
We received

601
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,310
news from the Saigon Airport Control.

602
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:37,630
It said...

603
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,110
Yicheng.

604
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,360
When Doudou grows up,

605
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,270
if she knew her pilot father

606
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,210
can’t even be honest,

607
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,710
what do you think

608
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:56,860
she will think?

609
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,210
Yicheng.

610
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,110
You're an old employee of the company.

611
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,750
I remember

612
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:05,580
you would attend the company's charity events

613
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,340
every year.

614
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:08,750
In my impression,

615
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,900
you are not only a good father,

616
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,940
but also a kind and honest person.

617
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,040
According to the notice...

618
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,030
By the way,

619
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,210
one more thing.

620
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,530
Didn’t Dou want to go to that private school?

621
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,430
I've asked someone.

622
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,810
It's no problem.

623
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,030
Thank you, Brother-in-law.

624
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,830
We could have made a diversion at Saigon Airport.

625
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:28,380
At the same time,

626
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:30,990
the controller also said

627
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,460
there were two other planes on standby,

628
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,460
so we had to land as soon as possible.

629
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,880
Witness,

630
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,800
in the air-ground communications played in court just now,

631
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,920
The Controller saying that Saigon Airport was closed,

632
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,690
Was that in fact

633
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,710
what you heard in the cockpit?

634
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:50,990
No.
