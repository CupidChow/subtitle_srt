4
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,180
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

5
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,170
Thank you for recommending a lawyer.

6
00:01:52,289 --> 00:01:53,270
You're welcome.

7
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,710
I happen to have a classmate who studied law in my hometown

8
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,940
who had known this lawyer, Mr. Liu.

9
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,759
He is a legal aid consultant.

10
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:01,260
He specializes in helping the unprivileged.

11
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,560
After hearing about Mr. Guo,

12
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,040
he's willing to help for free.

13
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,570
No.

14
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,830
There's no need.

15
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,030
We should pay the lawyer fee.

16
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:10,050
I'll pay it.

17
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,320
After all, Mr. Guo is already in a difficult position.

18
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,740
But Cheng Xiao,

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,690
the passenger is suing our company.

20
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,820
And here you are, getting a lawyer for the passenger,

21
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:23,490
is this really okay?

22
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,730
Yuheng,

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:28,680
actually, no matter what the result is,

24
00:02:29,079 --> 00:02:30,250
the company will not be held responsible.

25
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,240
I just think

26
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,550
this is unfair to Mr. Guo.

27
00:02:37,329 --> 00:02:37,960
Don't worry.

28
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,760
That's all I can do.

29
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,840
Mr. Liu is here.

30
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,250
Ms. Li.

31
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,590
Hello, Mr. Liu.

32
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,750
This is Captain Cheng.

33
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,690
Hello, I'm Cheng Xiao.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,590
Hello, Captain Cheng.

35
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,740
Mr. Liu, have a seat.

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,130
Yuheng, go ahead.

37
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,810
You don't have to keep us company.

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,270
Mr. Liu, I’ll take my leave then.

39
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,720
Okay.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,630
Attorney Liu, please have a seat.

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:09,060
Okay.

42
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,530
Captain Cheng,

43
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:16,730
I’ll get straight to the point.

44
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,010
Regarding Mr. Guo,

45
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,810
his chances against Luzhou Airlines is very low.

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,960
Judging from the materials you gave me,

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,130
we lack crucial evidence.

48
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
The situation will be very unfavorable.

49
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,420
I can handle this case.

50
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,910
But...

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,970
I'll be honest with you.

52
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,060
The probability of winning the lawsuit

53
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,020
is very low.

54
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:51,260
Brother Nanting.

55
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,260
Cheng Xiao asked me to go back first.

56
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,730
She doesn’t want you to get involved.

57
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,270
Actually, I'm fine.

58
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,240
You helping her contact a lawyer that's suitable

59
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,360
is already a big problem solved.

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,920
Why don’t you go in?

61
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,270
Let Cheng Xiao know you're the one helping her.

62
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,460
Given her personality,

63
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,089
she doesn't want to get others involved.

64
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,440
Brother Nanting,

65
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,890
I won't let anyone in the company

66
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,900
know what happened today

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,470
Thank you.

68
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,770
I'm just afraid...

69
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,320
this is an impulsive start.

70
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,880
I will send a legal letter

71
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,970
to Luzhou Airlines' legal department tomorrow.

72
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,240
But before submitting the charges to the court,

73
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,350
I need to see the defendant

74
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,120
to see if there's a chance of mediation.

75
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,710
I'll ask Mr. Guo about his request.

76
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:56,950
He doesn't have to go.

77
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:58,900
But I hope

78
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,400
you can go with me.

79
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,090
Me?

80
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,800
What can I do there?

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,470
Here's the thing.

82
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,750
I asked you to be

83
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,860
Mr. Guo's lawyer in this case.

84
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:16,900
Please try your best to help him.

85
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,160
But

86
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,030
I don't want to get involved in this case.

87
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,070
But the fabricated evidence

88
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,050
is a crucial breakthrough point.

89
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,800
There's no positive evidence for now.

90
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,150
Only you as the witness,

91
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,350
can there be some evidence.

92
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,040
If you attend the negotiation meeting,

93
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,580
you'll put pressure on them.

94
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,610
Maybe we can settle this outside the court

95
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:43,010
without a trial.

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,440
But...

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,210
I know it's hard for you,

98
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,690
But lawsuits need evidence.

99
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,760
If it's really inconvenient for you,

100
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,200
we can discuss it later.

101
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,660
Mr. Liu,

102
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,160
if

103
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:21,940
we negotiate outside of court,

104
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,430
what are the chances?

105
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,340
Let me put it this way.

106
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,620
If you don't go,

107
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,500
the chances for negotiation is zero.

108
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,490
The legal department called.

109
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,570
They received a lawyer letter

110
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,270
from the deceased's family.

111
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,560
Now that the company is in trouble,

112
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,659
we need to take it seriously.

113
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,260
I'll talk to the PR department

114
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,600
and the legal department.

115
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,060
At that time,

116
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,890
appear as the representative of the company,

117
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,560
okay?

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,360
Sure.

119
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,190
Thank you for your support, President Xu.

120
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,960
Brother-in-law, let me tell you something.

121
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,810
Gu Nanting asked about the diversion.

122
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,940
I didn't say anything.

123
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,690
Why does Gu Nanting care about this?

124
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,290
Cheng Xiao is annoying enough.

125
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,430
These two

126
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,060
are so annoying.

127
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,840
Which side are they on?

128
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,710
They're drawing salary from the company

129
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,330
but are causing trouble to the company too.

130
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,490
Brother-in-law.

131
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,600
This...

132
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,850
If someone finds out that the evidence

133
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,880
is indeed fabricated,

134
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,980
and hand it to the other lawyer,

135
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,170
it'll become complicated.

136
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,520
Why could be that capable?

137
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,870
Didn't I tell you? Nothing will go wrong.

138
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:52,150
I...

139
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,390
I think you should

140
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,670
you should talk to President Xu.

141
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm doing this

142
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,300
for the sake of

143
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,080
of Luzhou Airlines, alright?

144
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,260
Actually, I thought about

145
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,560
finding the deceased's father

146
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,620
to talk to him

147
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,900
and try to negotiate.

148
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,530
I even prepared

149
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:12,810
a sum of condolence money for him.

150
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,020
But at this point,

151
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,480
there's no turning back.

152
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,220
If Cheng Xiao and Gu Nanting come to you again,

153
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,010
you...

154
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,050
Don't be affected by them.

155
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,490
Got it. Don't worry.

156
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,070
Go ahead.

Cheng Xiao.

160
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,920
Mr. Liu.

161
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,370
Wait for me.

162
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:49,850
Okay.

163
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,810
It's a negotiation meeting today. Why are you here?

164
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,290
I came to testify for the plaintiff.

165
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,320
Do you know what that means?

166
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,910
I know.

167
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,920
But I...

168
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,850
have decided.

169
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:14,510
Why?

170
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,580
I'm the only witness here.

171
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,090
I might be useful.

172
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,790
Maybe

173
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,150
this might give Mr. Jiang some pressure today,

174
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,440
and we can negotiate it outside the court.

00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,080
Mr. Jiang is just the liability.

176
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:30,050
But the entire Luzhou Airlines could be sued.

177
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:31,780
If you go on impulse,

178
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,460
they will think you are going against Luzhou Airlines.

179
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,920
Have you thought about the consequences?

180
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,050
I believe in Luzhou Airlines' professionalism.

181
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,510
Are you sure if you go up now,

182
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,330
things can be resolved?

183
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,330
I'm not sure.

184
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,550
But it's better than not trying.

185
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll go up first.

186
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,050
[Luzhou Airlines]

187
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,580
This is really serious.

188
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,950
What should we do?

189
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,330
Most importantly, no one expected

190
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,600
such a thing would happen.

191
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:09,980
Let's take it as,

192
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,190
the current situation

193
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,120
is not very positive, right?

194
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,230
We need to think about it from a long-term perspective.

195
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,950
Okay, they're here.

196
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,000
Attorney Liu is here.

197
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,720
Let me introduce.

198
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,260
This is the plaintiff's attorney,

199
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,430
Mr. Liu Cheng.

200
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:38,320
This is Mr. Chen from our legal department.

201
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,560
He is Captain Jiang Tao.

202
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,500
He is

203
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,930
the observer, Lin Yicheng.

204
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,780
This is

205
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:47,100
the first officer of flight 805, Cheng Xiao.

206
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,900
Cheng Xiao is here today

207
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,210
as the witness of the plaintiff.

208
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,830
Please have a seat.

209
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,450
Thank you.

210
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,280
How would I know what's going on?

211
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:22,970
Can we start now?

212
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:24,790
Wait.

213
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,640
Let's wait for my laywer.

214
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:36,820
They're here.

215
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,920
Ms. Fang is here.

216
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,810
That's basically what happened.

217
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,480
You're a lawyer,

218
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,280
you should have a clear judgement on how this case

219
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,250
will end.

220
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,930
For some reason,

221
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,100
Cheng Xiao is now

222
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,740
on the side of

223
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,420
the plaintiff.

224
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
If this continues,

225
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,560
even if I want to protect her,

226
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,170
the other leaders of the company

227
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,450
won't be able to tolerate this.

228
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,140
Best case scenario, she gets fired.

229
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,150
Worst case scenario,

230
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,200
she will never

231
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:54,660
be able to continue working in this industry.

232
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,350
You probably have no idea but

233
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,410
I really don’t want Cheng Xiao

234
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,630
to be a pilot.

235
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,310
I would like to recommend myself to be your attorney.

236
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,280
I won't charge you.

237
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,030
Why?

238
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,990
From what I know about my daughter,

239
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,000
she may become the witness

240
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,000
of the plaintiff on impulse.

241
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,790
If I become

242
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,480
your attorney,

243
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,730
at least psychologically,

244
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,060
I can put pressure

245
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,470
on Cheng Xiao.

246
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,030
This is

247
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,650
good for you.

248
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,840
Let's get started.

249
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,530
Let me state

250
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,820
my client's request first.

251
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,000
As the father of the deceased,

252
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,170
Mr. Guo

253
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,380
hopes that Captain Jiang can publicly apologize

254
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,920
regarding the passing of Mr. Guo Xiaoliang.

255
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,190
My client,

256
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,840
as someone who is highly professional

257
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,510
and humanitarian,

258
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,640
he's willing to provide a sum of

259
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,930
condolence money for the deceased's family.

260
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,730
We can discuss the specific amount,

261
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,480
but we wish to keep everything

262
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,750
private

263
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,070
without any exposure.

264
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,780
Mr. Guo made it clear that

265
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,600
he would like for Captain Jiang to make a public apology.

266
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,610
I’m sorry.

267
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,250
We can't admit to something

268
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:05,490
that we did nothing wrong in.

269
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,850
We are all professionals.

270
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,320
I don't need to explain

271
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,420
what's stated in the Civil Aviation Law, right.

272
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,950
But there is one thing

273
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,190
I have to remind you.

274
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,360
On the plane,

275
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,000
Mr. Guo Xiao Liang made it clear that

276
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,450
he has no medical history.

277
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:23,780
But

278
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,170
this is Mr. Guo's

279
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,460
medical records in the past year.

280
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,100
He has had

281
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,050
insomnia, anxiety,

282
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:35,320
angina and arrhythmia.

283
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:36,530
Also,

284
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,790
this is a copy of his conversation

285
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,590
in eight work-related group chats in the week before he passed on.

286
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,610
Mr. Guo

287
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,600
is on standby for work 24 hours a day.

288
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,810
All the evidence shows

289
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,250
that Mr. Guo's sudden death

290
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,510
was caused by

291
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,600
long-term high-load work.

292
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,320
Mr. Liu,

293
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,060
I don’t think

294
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,590
the blame is on Luzhou Airlines and Captain Jiang,

295
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,280
but Mr. Guo's employer instead.

296
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,190
According to the Civil Law,

297
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,490
Article 822,

298
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,790
the transporter should

299
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,200
do their best to provide medical care for passengers

300
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,990
who have an emergency medical condition, birth delivery, and danger.

301
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,460
So we believe that

302
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,730
as the transporter of this case,

303
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:17,990
he didn't do his best

304
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,410
to save Mr. Guo.

305
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:23,490
After Mr. Guo fainted,

306
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,069
our crew had

307
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,460
tried their best to rescue them.

308
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,420
With that,

309
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,720
I flew as fast as possibly

310
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,080
for the flight to be safe.

311
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,670
After landing,

312
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,970
our crew members

313
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,780
administered CPR on Mr. Guo

314
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,630
until the medical staff arrived.

315
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,050
We can say

316
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,620
that all members of our crew

317
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,020
have tried our best

318
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,330
to save Mr. Go's life.

319
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,060
Unfortunately,

320
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,080
we couldn't bring him back to life.

321
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,550
Why didn't you prepare for diversion?

322
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,800
The first officer mentioned that

323
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,940
when the plane is flying above the sea southeast to Saigon,

324
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,030
she personally

325
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,230
requested a diversion to Saigon Airport.

326
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,040
But after she went out to check on the patient,

327
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,650
and returned to the cockpit,

328
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,890
you've decided to cancel the diversion

329
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,940
and go straight to Singapore.

330
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,020
This has caused the victim to miss

331
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,270
the best time to save him.

332
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,590
Mr. Liu,

333
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
there is a reason for this.

334
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,240
It's not because the plane didn't divert that

335
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,200
Mr. Guo lost his life.

336
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:28,790
Even if we had diverted our flight,

337
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,490
it's still impossible to guarantee

338
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,860
that Mr. Guo could've survived.

339
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:32,930
But a diversion

340
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,660
would give him a higher possibility of surviving.

341
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,430
But this possibility was deliberately ignored

342
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,590
by Captain Jiang.

343
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:41,270
What do you mean?

344
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,620
If the plane's

345
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,090
diversion to Saigon was done,

346
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,810
and Mr. Guo still unfortunately died,

347
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,810
could you have also said that

348
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Captain Jiang has deliberately ignored

349
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,660
the possibility of Singapore

350
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,050
having better medical facilities?

351
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,930
This is why, in the Civil Aviation Law,

352
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,400
it is clearly stated that

353
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,130
when something like this

354
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,400
occurs on a flight,

355
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,050
the captain has the final say.

356
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,080
Be it the captain decides to divert or continue with the flight,

357
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,200
they are all within regulations.

358
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,240
In that case,

359
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,900
why did Captain Jiang

360
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,330
alter the recording of

361
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:22,410
the ground to air recording at Saigon?

362
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,050
What?

363
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,860
Alter the recording?

364
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,040
Altering the recording

365
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,570
has nothing to do with this case.

366
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:37,410
Besides,

367
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,870
do you have evidence?

368
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:44,740
I’m a member of the flight XD805.

369
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,530
I don't remember

370
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,050
this ground to air conversation happening.

371
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:53,380
This recording didn't capture

372
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,260
Captain Jiang saying that the passenger's condition is now better.

373
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,510
So the recording was altered.

374
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,970
In that case, do you have

375
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:04,190
the original recording

376
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,280
for comparison?

377
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,160
It could also be said that

378
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,890
this employee

379
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,260
is spreading malicious rumors

380
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,800
because of work conflicts.

381
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,470
Ms. Fang,

382
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,070
I know why you're taking on this case.

383
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,430
But do you not have any basic professionalism?

384
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,670
See.

385
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,330
It's starting.

386
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,920
Ms. Fang,

387
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,400
there's no need

388
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,790
to point fingers at the witness.

389
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,110
Mr. Liu,

390
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,650
whether it's based on Civil Aviation Law,

391
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,840
or the Civil Aviation Code,

392
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,040
your opinions

393
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,310
don't stand.

394
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,980
Do you think the court would accept

395
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:52,890
whatever this witness says

396
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,070
as evidence?

397
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,470
In that case,

398
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,400
what's the point of having Mr. Guo

399
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,760
waste his energy only for it to end up in vain?

400
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,480
All Mr. Guo wants is the truth and an apology.

401
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,110
The truth you mentioned

402
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,840
is just your imagination.

403
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,050
Cheng Xiao,

404
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,510
please don’t bring in personal conflicts

405
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,580
to such a serious situation.

406
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,770
Captain Jiang,

407
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,810
do you really have a clear conscience

408
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,430
about the recording?

409
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,350
We sympathize with Mr Guo's family.

410
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,270
But this settlement condition

411
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,450
is our bottom line.

412
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,060
Mr. Liu,

413
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:46,050
I hope you can consider

414
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,320
for your client.

415
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,660
I'll talk to my client

416
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:52,660
to further negotiate.

417
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,600
There's nothing more to say, let's just stop at this.

418
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,770
-Okay. -Okay.

419
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,350
Okay.

420
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,030
That's all for today.

421
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,210
Sure.

422
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:13,010
Wait.

423
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,100
I have something to say.

424
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,470
I'll head out first.

425
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,300
Cheng,

426
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,600
come to my office later.

427
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:28,910
Okay.

428
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:58,340
I hope you can withdraw your contract as soon as possible.

429
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,950
I'm a lawyer.

430
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,030
It's my freedom to choose who I want to represent.

431
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,800
You have no right to interfere.

432
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,250
Is it your freedom to abuse your power for personal gain?

433
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,250
Don't talk to me like that.

434
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:15,950
Do you think

435
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,920
I wanted to do this?

436
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,400
Don't you understand my request?

437
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,010
I only have one request.

438
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,170
Listen to me.

439
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,640
Quit being a pilot and

440
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,490
I’ll immediately withdraw my commission contract.

441
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:33,990
I'll say it again.

442
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,210
No way.

443
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,580
You're doing this

444
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,370
to satisfy your desire to control me.

445
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,060
What do you take me for?

446
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,540
I'm your daughter,

447
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,950
not your personal property.

448
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,370
I don't want you to be a pilot,

449
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:46,410
I don't want you to fly anymore,

450
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,900
is this that hard?

451
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,270
I'm your mother.

452
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,030
Can I hurt you?

453
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,320
I don't understand.

454
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,000
I like this job so much.

455
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,420
Can't you see that?

456
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,460
You've been forcing me since I was young.

457
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,590
Shouldn't a mother

458
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,410
support their children to fulfill their dreams?

459
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,850
What’s wrong with being a pilot?

460
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,640
Which nerve did I touch?

461
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,210
I don't want to argue with you.

462
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,580
If you insist,

463
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,520
I have no choice.

464
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:36,100
But

465
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,060
I'm really disappointed in you.

466
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,570
Oh, no.

467
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,320
For real?

468
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,060
Look at this.

469
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:58,430
Seriously?

470
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,120
It can't be true.

471
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,310
Look at the comments. It's impossible.

472
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,050
What are you reading the comments for? These trolls don't think.

473
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,520
Then...

474
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,020
Besides,

475
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,350
it's just a random photo how could they...

476
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,590
What's going on?

477
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,690
Nothing.

478
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:09,640
Zhan.

479
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,870
N-nothing much.

480
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,170
Let me see.

481
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,110
[My goodness. Someone's actually helping a passenger sue the company.]

482
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,030
Nothing happens for no reason.

483
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:39,140
So...

484
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,710
I went to Saigon

485
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,180
and got the recording.

486
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,670
It's no different from what the company has.

487
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,310
But

488
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,930
I also talked to Lin Yicheng

489
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,010
and Mr. Jiang.

490
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,840
My judgment is...

491
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:07,800
You mean

492
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,090
something is up with Jiang Tao?

493
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Yes.

494
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:15,980
The original copy

495
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,680
of the recording has been swapped.

496
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:18,420
It's hard to testify.

497
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,510
But I have some plans

498
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,980
and I plan to report to Mr Xu.

499
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,800
No wonder Cheng Xiao has such a big reaction.

500
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,160
If that's true,

501
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,850
Jiang Tao is too foolish.

502
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:43,950
Master,

503
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,150
I know you and Mr. Jiang are old colleagues.

504
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,770
What do you take your master for>

505
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,590
When a body is having issues,

506
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,070
it's not a good idea

507
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,650
to just ignore it.

508
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,360
Many times,

509
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
only with momentary pain,

510
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,850
can it bring a new life.

511
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,850
Are you crazy? Why didn't you lock the door?

512
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,410
Why didn't you knock?

513
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
How would I know you were inside?

514
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,200
I just bought shampoo and wanted to put it inside.

515
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,640
Besides,

516
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,400
don't you both shower in your bedrooms?

517
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,200
The sewer is blocked.

518
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,430
How would I know?

519
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,080
Tell me.

520
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,610
What did you see?

521
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,100
Nothing.

522
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,740
I saw white everywhere.

523
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,010
Would you dare say if you saw something?

524
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,860

525
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,680
Your diet has been working lately.

526
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,160
Didn't you say you didn't see anything?

527
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,880
Don't hit me! Don't hit me!

528
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,640
Don't hit me!

529
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,480
Why didn't you knock?

530
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,310
I'm just kidding.

531
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:21,790
Why didn't you knock?

532
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,390
This is for you.

533
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:35,290
Song.

534
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:36,370
What's wrong?

535
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:39,900
This...

[PR Director]

537

Have some water.

538
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,620
Thank you, Mr. Tan.

539
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:54,640
Cheng,

540
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,780
at the mediation meeting just now,

541
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:00,280
I heard the conversation.

542
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,130
Let me put it this way.

543
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,310
If Mr. Jiang really made a mistake,

544
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,110
the company will investigate it

545
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,460
and won't tolerate it.

546
00:29:12,670 --> 00:29:13,710
But the problem is

547
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,450
Judging from the current situation,

548
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,760
you're the only one who testified.

549
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,650
But my testimony

550
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,070
is what I really saw and heard.

551
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,890
I'm willing to take responsibility for it.

552
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,550
I heard

553
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,570
you had a conflict with

554
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,340
Captain Jiang at work?

555
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:34,430
I'm telling the truth.

556
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,200
There is no personal factor involved.

557
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,680
I know.

558
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:40,700
Cheng,

559
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:43,110
since you joined the Transport Department,

560
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,110
you’ve been through a lot.

561
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,850
You’re going to be promoted to captain soon.

562
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,660
You have a bright future in the company.

563
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,020
So...

564
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,550
You're trying to say...

565
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,030
What I'm trying to say is...

566
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,760
You're a member of Luzhou Airlines afterall,

567
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:05,470
you should still be on Luzhou Airlines' side.

568
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:12,510
Mr. Tan,

569
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,750
I think you misunderstood.

570
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:15,930
First of all,

571
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:17,100
what I did

572
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,110
has nothing to do

573
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,170
with what's going on between me and Mr. Jiang.

574
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,400
Second,

575
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,570
I know the truth,

576
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,870
but if I kept it a secret,

577
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,280
I don't feel like I'm respecting my job,

578
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,950
neither am I respecting Luzhou Airlines

579
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,290
and how it values

580
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,010
honesty.

581
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,200
Dad.

582
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,540
Xiao.

583
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,920
You met your mother?

584
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:57,010
I was at the settlement meeting in the company.

585
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,470
She has left.

586
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,900
Did you fight?

587
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,420
Mrs. Fang is professional

588
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,170
and also unprofessional.

589
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,510
Originally,

590
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,700
I was going to take a leave to follow her.

591
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,020
But your mother told me

592
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:15,350
if I follow her to Luzhou,

593
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,690
she would divorce me.

594
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,530
I've been so worried these two days.

595
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,970
I almost said something wrong during the trial.

596
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,180
Dad, don't worry.

597
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,710
My mom and I are just doing our job.

598
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,160
Nothing will happen.

599
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,110
Don't fight with your mom.

600
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,440
No matter what happens,

601
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,920
I'll figure something out.

602
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,410
It can be solved.

603
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:35,800
Got it.

604
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,360
Take care.

605
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,280
Okay.

606
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,000
Bye.

607
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,350
Have you heard?

608
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,140
Cheng Xiao is on the side of the passenger

609
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,650
who's suing the company.

610
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,030
Is there something wrong with her?

611
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,890
I saw the photo.

612
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,270
She's so bold.

613
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,190
She's helping others with her company's lawsuit.

614
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,550
Is she giving up her future?

615
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,470
Since she came to the Passenger Transport Department,

616
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,800
she has been making a fuss.

617
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,760
She's always trying to make her presence known.

618
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:18,670
Exactly.

619
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,030
How ungrateful.

620
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,440
It's been a long time since I've been here.

621
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,470
I envy you.

622
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,910
You're smiling.

623
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,160
It must be hard for you.

624
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,780
Even with your family against you,

625
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,930
you can still persevere till now.

626
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,130
What did she offer you

627
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:34,990
to fire me?

628
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,870
As expected of the daughter of a lawyer.

629
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:38,880
You're smart.

630
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,400
But I can't bear to take

631
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,500
your mother's offer.

632
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,260
After all,

633
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,300
I've been raising you as a talent.

634
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,500
How can I

635
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,200
do something like firing you?

636
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:52,270
Really?

637
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,940
Why can't I see that?

638
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,120
Cheng Xiao,

639
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:00,840
Look at you.

640
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,470
Since you came to the Passenger Transport Department,

641
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,470
things has not been going well.

642
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:06,770
What's the reason?

643
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,320
Maybe this place

644
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,480
brings you bad luck.

645
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,639
Even if it isn't,

646
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,070
you've also accumulated

647
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,000
over 3,000 hours of experience.

648
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,130
With this amount of experience,

649
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,699
any airline

650
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,440
would give you the position of a captain.

651
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,480
In your contract,

652
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,370
it's stated that there's a termination fee.

653
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,880
I will

654
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:32,659
waive that fee for you.

655
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,360
On top of that,

656
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:35,600
I will also write a strong recommendation letter for you.

657
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:37,429
You know it.

658
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,620
In this industry,

659
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,239
I am still quite influential.

660
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,250
What are you guilty about?

661
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,270
You came to look for my mom,

662
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,790
and then throw these baits at me.

663
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,239
If you didn't do so much,

664
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:54,090
I would have believed that recording.

665
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:04,590
I know you're under a lot of pressure.

666

But with your current mental state,

For safety,

672
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,680
I will ask the Resources Department

673
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,370
to stop all your flights.

00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:29,780
In the very long free time

Didn't we agree on this?

692
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,580
OK.

693
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,180
Goodbye, Mr. Fang.

694
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,440
Let's keep in touch.

695
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,120
Mr. Jiang,

696
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,150
you suspended Cheng Xiao?

697
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,420
Yes.

698
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,410
Her mood lately

699
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,280
has been completely out of control.

700
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,270
I think she is not fit to fly

701
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,760
for the time being.

702
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,860
Do you have any objections?

703
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,130
Cheng Xiao did do something extreme.

704
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:37,330
But I don’t think it’s appropriate to say she’s out of control.

705
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,400
What do you think we should do then?

706
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,000
Admonishment, dialogue, and adjustment of mentality.

707
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,440
But I've already handed the report

708
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,690
to the president's office.

709
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,980
President Xu's approval...

710
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,170
Nanting.

711
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,120
You have knocked on the wrong door.

712
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,630
Why did you submit this internal Flight department matter

713
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:05,730
to the higher-ups?

714
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:07,420
You know

715
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:09,890
Cheng Xiao has always been

716
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,050
the female pilot President Xu takes note of the most.

717
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,310
How long will she be suspended?

718
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,400
What should we do next?

719
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,840
Well,

720
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,150
that depends on President Xu.

721
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,900
Mr. Jiang,

722
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,940
sincerely, I am begging you

723
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:34,340
to go to President Xu with me

724
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,190
to discuss the decision on Cheng Xiao.

725
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,360
But I think the arrangements now

726
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:40,660
are appropriate.

727
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:53,780
I see.

728
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:54,650
Brother Nanting,

729
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,560
Xiao drank too much at the bar.

730
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,960
No one can stop her.

731
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:05,290
Here.

732
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:08,930
What happened?

733
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,280
Xiao has been suspended.

734
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,510
We just wanted to keep her company

735
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,830
while she drank her sorrows away.

736
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,270
But who knew

737
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:16,830
she couldn't stop drinking.

738
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,670
I heard that Cheng Xiao's mother

739
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,010
was at the mediation meeting this afternoon.

740
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,390
Mr. Jiang even asked her

741
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,750
to represent Luzhou Airlines as their lawyer.

742
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,250
OK.

743
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:32,560
You two

744
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,830
get the other one away first.

745
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:34,810
What about Xiao?

746
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:36,040
I'll find a way. Go.

747
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,540
Xiazhi.

748
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,500
Song?

749
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,600
Where did you go?

750
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,110
You hid because you couldn't beat me, right?

751
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,610
Didn't you say you were going home?

752
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,270
Why are you still here?

753
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,960
Why would I go home?

754
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
I want to stay here with Xiao.

755
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,600
All right, let's stop drinking.

756
00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:57,160
Didn't you say you had an excellent bottle of wine

757
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,250
you wanted Xiao to try?

758
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,310
Ask Yuheng if you don't believe me.

759
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,150
Good wine.

760
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,760
Right, Xia, you did say that.

761
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,600
Let's go.

762
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,360
Xiao.

763
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:07,870
Wait for me. I'll get a bottle of good wine.

764
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,240
-I can’t walk anymore.
-Stop.

765
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,330
Carry me.

766
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,630
You're so heavy. How can I carry you?

767
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,090
Nonsense.

768
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,900
When you peeked at me in the shower this morning,

769
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,050
you said I lost weight.

770
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,460
That was a misunderstanding.

771
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,930
Let's go.

772
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:26,550
Let's go.

773
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:27,710
I'll carry you.

774
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,760
So heavy.

775
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,400
Song?

776
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,920
Brother Nanting, we're leaving.

777
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:34,770
I have something on you.
