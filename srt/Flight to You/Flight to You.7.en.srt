[Episode 7]

4
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,479
Please tell me honestly what happened.

5
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,259
I...

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,000
Just...

7
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,140
Just now,

8
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,430
when these two flight attendants

9
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,500
were delivering drinks to the passengers,

10
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,890
I...

11
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,250
Impulsively,

12
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,009
I touched Miss Li's hips and thighs.

13
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,550
This is really the first time I...

14
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,530
I won't do it again.

15
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,490
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,480
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,660
Please apologize

18
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,460
to our flight attendant.

19
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,190
Miss Li.

20
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,329
I...

21
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,340
I just lost my mind.

22
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,630
I'm really sorry. Please forgive me.

23
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,150
Yuheng.

24
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:28,180
Will you accept his apology?

25
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,470
She just nodded.

26
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,210
If you do it again,

27
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,410
it won't be so easy.

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,640
I won't do it again.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,490
Never.

30
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,570
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,390
Sorry.

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,220
I'm so unlucky this time.

33
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,290
Alright.

34
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,890
I'm really sorry, Ms. Ai.

35
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,760
I've caused you trouble again.

36
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:58,870
What trouble?

37
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:00,670
Take a rest.

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,520
Xiazhi.

39
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,920
Go back to your seat.

40
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,610
I'll get back to work.

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:11,730
Yuheng.

42
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,690
Let's call the police.

43
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,950
Call the police?

44
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,400
Didn't he apologize?

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,940
Besides, we have no evidence.

46
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,160
I recorded it.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,140
But if the police come,

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,270
it will be a big deal.

49
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,630
What if the flight is delayed again?

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,590
The airport police are only two kilometers away from us.

51
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,680
It won't take long.

52
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,070
And this person is definitely not a first offender.

53
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,630
He may continue to endanger the flight safety

54
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,690
during the flight.

55
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,190
We should take necessary measures of restraint

56
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,350
before departure.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,930
Dear.

58
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,210
Do you think there's a need to call the police?

59
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,540
He already apologized.

60
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,910
Just forget it.

61
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:44,930
Forget it?

62
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:48,450
Silence is the greatest indulgence to evil.

63
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
He did apologize.

64
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,290
But, was he sincere?

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,000
He was just afraid.

66
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,170
if he keeps making trouble

67
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,460
in the flight later, are you going to be responsible for it?

68
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,090
Hello, this is flight Luzhou 8307.

69
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,340
We're in the aircraft stand 261.

70
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,920
A passenger is making trouble.

71
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,920
He harassed the flight attendant.

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,850
Please come over and deal with it as soon as possible.

73
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,920
Luzhou 8307

74
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,910
can be pushed back and start out.

75
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,329
Roger.

76
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,730
Push back and start out. Luzhou 8307.

77
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,100
Notify the observer to return to the flight deck.

78
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,230
We're going to push back and start out.

79
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,370
Luzhou 8307.

80
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,340
Cancel the push-back-and-start-out order.

81
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,300
The airport police said they received a report from your crew.

82
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,560
They'll be there soon.

83
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,550
Roger. Cancel the push-back-and-start-out.

84
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,310
Luzhou 8307.

85
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,560
Who called the police?

86
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,060
Did something happen in the back cabin?

87
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:49,980
I sent the sound recording to your email.

88
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,440
Let's wait for the police.

89
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,730
Okay.

90
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,909
I'll go in first.

91
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,790
What happened?

92
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,100
Who called the police in the back cabin?

93
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,590
I did.

94
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:10,780
A pervert harassed the flight attendant.

95
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,530
Why didn't you report to me immediately?

96
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,420
I couldn't care so much.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,150
Without the authorization of the captain,

98
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,440
you interfered with the cabin affairs.

99
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,970
Do you have any discipline?

100
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,440
Do you know how shameless the pervert is?

101
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,850
Do you know what he said?

102
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,420
He said he was really unlucky this time.

103
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,550
What about the past?

104
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,910
What about the future?

105
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,930
What if he makes trouble

106
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,070
during the flight?

107
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I'm killing all the unsafe factors.

108
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,550
Also,

109
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,670
do you know who was harassed?

110
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,670
It's your Yuheng.

111
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,640
If anything happens in the cabin,

112
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,680
the flight attendants

113
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,820
and security officers should be the ones who interfere.

114
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,640
If they can't handle it, tell the captain immediately.

115
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,600
You're not the captain.

116
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,380
Neither a flight attendant nor a security officer.

117
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,440
Do you not even want to be an observer?

118
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,970
Approval for release.

119
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,880
Luzhou 8307 has missed the scheduled release time

120
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,380
due to some cabin affairs.

121
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,260
Please help me arrange the time in advance.

122
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:08,860
Thank you.

123
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,030
Roger.

124
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,470
If you inform me immediately,

125
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:16,670
I'll coordinate with the controller.

126
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,300
The situation wouldn't be so passive.

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,700
The flight won't be delayed for so long too.

128
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,790
I just wanted to get rid of him as soon as possible.

129
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,410
You can't treat the flight operation

130
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,980
as you please.

131
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,110
Hello.

132
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,570
Hello.

133
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,620
Where is he?

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,530
This way.

135
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,000
Please don't take photos. Thank you for your cooperation.

136
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,130
The police are here.

137
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,130
Sir.

138
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,600
Hello, sir.

139
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,260
We received a report

140
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,730
that you were disturbing the order in the aircraft.

141
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,540
Please come with us for investigation.

142
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,940
Stop taking photos, sir.

143
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,920
Investigation?

144
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,410
Do you have any evidence?

145
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:11,530
Why should I go with you?

146
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,520
Sir, please cooperate.

147
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm giving you an oral summons now.

148
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,180
If you don't cooperate,

149
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,710
we will adopt forceful measures against you.

150
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
Forceful measures... Where is your evidence?

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
Show me the evidence and I'll go with you.

152
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,910
If you have no evidence, it means you commit

153
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,600
the excessive use of violence.

154
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,200
I... I can complain against you.

155
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,650
Sir,

156
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
we have recorded

157
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,620
what you just said.

158
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,500
I believe the police

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,360
won't wrong any innocent person.

160
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,140
Who is involved?

161
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,860
That one.

162
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
You're involved.

163
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,240
We also need to ask you some questions.

164
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,560
Will it be long?

165
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,750
I'm afraid it'll delay the flight later.

166
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,670
I'll arrange your work.

167
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,000
You just need to cooperate with the police.

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Take him away.

169
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,600
Let's go.

170
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,620
Please.

171
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,780
Don't touch me.

172
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,150
I‘ll go with you, is that okay?

173
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,920
Go down now.

174
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,830
Stop filming.

175
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:04,760
That's who he is.

176
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,040
He deserves it.

177
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
Stop taking photos, sir. Thank you.

178
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,660
If we delay half an hour more,

179
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,520
it won't affect anything, right?

180
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,390
Look at the weather outside.

181
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,270
It's foggy.

182
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,090
Shall we apply again?

183
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,500
Approval for release.

184
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Luzhou 8307.

185
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,460
The case on the plane has been settled.

186
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,190
Do you have a new take-off time?

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,159
Luzhou 8307.

188
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,640
I've coordinated for you.

189
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,060
But there are too many in the queue.

190
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,590
The flight is estimated to take off in an hour.

191
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,400
Copy that. Luzhou 8307.

192
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,290
Xiao didn't mean it.

193
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,150
There was no one behind

194
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,940
when flying a cargo aircraft.

195
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,350
Let alone something happened.

196
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,350
I just wanted to

197
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,890
catch this scoundrel as soon as possible.

198
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,860
I didn't think too much.

199
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,960
I didn't handle it properly.

200
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,740
Yes, Brother Nanting

201
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,650
When we used to fly a cargo aircraft,

202
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,280
we handled everything by ourselves.

203
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,810
We cook, make tea and clean the bed, all alone.

204
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,860
I wish I could

205
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,810
do everything I could on the plane.

206
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,490
Xiao is just thinking about the safety of the flight.

207
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,670
Now, what matters is we should go home.

208
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,480
It's Chinese New Year, right?

209
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
Look at these people.

210
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,540
What are you waiting for? Why haven't you taken off?

211
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,340
Sorry, madam.

212
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,200
The plane is lining up to take off.

213
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,330
Please understand.

214
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,370
Just now you had maintenance, then you called the police.

215
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:17,530
You are wasting time.

216
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,990
I want to file a complaint.

217
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,270
We want to take off as soon as possible.

218
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,020
We've been waiting for so long.

219
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,990
We understand how the passengers feel.

220
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,130
What important is, let's take off now.

221
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,740
Hurry up.

222
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,300
Hurry!

223
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,770
Hurry up and let it fly.

224
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,560
Hurry up. Sorry.

225
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,400
Sorry, sir.

226
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,930
Can I get you some water?

227
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,590
Wait a minute. Sorry.

228
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,230
Hurry up.

229
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,300
The fog is getting bigger.

230
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,160
The visibility is getting lower.

231
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:02,300
Luzhou 8307.

232
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,930
The Luzhou Airport is closed due to fog.

233
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:08,330
You should discuss the flight schedule with the dispatcher.

234
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:10,260
Copy that. Luzhou 8307.

235
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,250
Dispatcher. Luzhou 8307.

236
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,650
I just received an announcement from the ground.

237
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,110
Luzhou Airport is closed.

238
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,600
Yes, Captain.

239
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,010
The Meteorological Department reported

240
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,960
that the weather in Luzhou won't get better today.

241
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,670
The company has decided to cancel the flight.

242
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,500
I'll arrange for the Ground Handling Department to take over and make up tomorrow morning.

243
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:27,920
Okay.

244
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,960
Ensure good logistical support.

245
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,560
I'll inform the passengers.

246
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,720
Ladies and gentlemen,

247
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,280
we received an emergency notice.

248
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
Due to the weather at the departure airport,

249
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,070
this flight is cancelled and will be replaced tomorrow.

250
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,420
Are you kidding me?

251
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,440
You must fly today.

252
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,720
My dad is sick and lying in the hospital.

253
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,630
He's waiting for me to go back.

254
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,750
You must fly.

255
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,600
No matter what you say,

256
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,480
you must let me fly today.

257
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

258
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,680
please take your luggage

259
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,720
and get off the plane.

260
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,510
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

261
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,440
I'm not leaving.

262
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,650
The flight has been cancelled.

263
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,510
We booked a room in Sanya.

264
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,650
Who will pay for the money that night?

265
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,900
No matter who comes over and persuades me, it's useless.

266
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,300
I'm not leaving today. I'm not getting off.

267
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,680
I'm really sorry.

268
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,490
I'm sorry.

269
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,490
I'm sorry, but please be considerate.

270
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,510
It's because of the weather.

271
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,450
We have no choice.

272
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,710
What's the use of apologizing?

273
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,920
Please cooperate with us.

274
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,530
Please be considerate.

275
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,690
I can't leave now.

276
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,800
this is the chief flight attendant speaking.

278
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,190
We received the Captain's notice.

279
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,910
Since the weather hasn't improved,

280
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:28,640
our flight has been cancelled.

281
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,750
We apologize for

282
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,040
for any inconvenience we caused.

283
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,160
Please take all your luggage

284
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,230
and get off the plane.

285
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,710
Our ground staff will...

286
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,020
It's all wasted now.

287
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,160
Who are you calling sister?

288
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,010
Who are you talking about? It's none of your business.

289
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:41,630
Sorry.

290
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,510
It's all my fault.

291
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,300
Don't touch me!

292
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,590
I told you my dad is seriously ill.

293
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,550
You asked me to cooperate with you.

294
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,790
Okay, I'll leave.

295
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,580
Sorry for the trouble.

296
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,460
You...

297
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,390
Sir, I'm sorry. You may get off here.

298
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:04,880
I know.

299
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,560
Ni.

300
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,180
How is dad?

301
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:12,340
Why haven't you arrived yet?

302
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,630
Hurry up. Dad is dying.

303
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:25,430
None of your business.

304
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,740
Okay.

305
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,090
Keep working overtime.

306
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,910
Others have a 996 work schedule, but ours is 007.

307
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,600
We are going to stay up all night again.

308
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,510
Complaining will only drain your energy.

309
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:41,570
It's better to cheer up and work hard.

310
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,840
I really admire you.

311
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,970
Do you fire yourself up every day?

312
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,930
Without some motivation,

313
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,860
how can we face all kinds of dramas?

314
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,790
The passengers are out.

315
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

316
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,960
Please register for tomorrow's flight

317
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,490
at counter D25.

318
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,240
Travelers who have check-in luggage

319
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,460
please go to No. 34 to pick up your luggage.

320
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,620
Ladies and gentlemen,

321
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,530
please register for tomorrow's flight

322
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,440
at counter D25.

323
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,250
I'm sorry.

324
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,830
These people...

325
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,730
I'm truly sorry.

326
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,980
I'm sorry, ma'am.

327
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,910
I think something happened to her family.

328
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,230
Madam,

329
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,020
Here.

330
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,350
Are you okay?

331
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,800
Ma'am, please stand up.

332
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,160
Are you okay?

333
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:32,930
Madam.

334
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,100
Let me help you.

335
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,120
Why can others fly

336
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,160
but yours?

337
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,630
I have to leave today.

338
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,440
Ma'am, please calm down.

339
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,520
The flight is cancelled

340
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,080
under this condition of the weather

341
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,160
for safety's sake.

342
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,490
Where is your superior?

343
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:52,560
Madam.

344
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,840
Ask your superior to come out. He can't leave.

345
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,160
Let go of me!

346
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,760
Calm down.

347
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm not calm.

348
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,050
I'm leaving now.

349
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,920
Ma'am, calm down.

350
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,880
Calm down.

351
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,360
Let go of me!

352
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,280
Tell your superior to come out. I'm leaving today.

353
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,370
We really can't fly today.

354
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,530
Let's talk nicely, madam.

355
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,330
What's wrong?

356
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,760
It's you.

357
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,130
You called the police to cancel the flight.

358
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,460
You're the one who made us unable to leave.

359
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,270
Ma'am, calm down.

360
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,340
I didn't think it through.

361
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,400
I apologize.

362
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
But because of the fog,

363
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,170
our airport is closed.

364
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,230
We can't fly today.

365
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,910
You deliberately don't let us go.

366
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,480
OK?

367
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,260
Look.

368
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,030
This is the female pilot.

369
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,720
She called the police.

370
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,320
Our flight was cancelled

371
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,040
so none of us can leave.

372
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,800
Madam,

373
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,860
please don't be unreasonable.

374
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,730
Are you saying I am being unreasonable?

375
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,320
Are you saying I am being unreasonable?

376
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,640
Everyone, please be the judge.

377
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,000
Let us judge.

378
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,310
Your airline company says whatever you want.

379
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,290
Who will take care of the passengers' interests?

380
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,360
Who will protect us?

381
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,100
Madam, please calm down.

382
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,610
Do you have any conscience?

383
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,290
She wouldn't be like this if her family was fine.

384
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,560
Her father is in critical condition.

385
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,560
It seems that he's waiting to see her for the last time.

386
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,080
Madam.

387
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,390
Madam, how about this?

388
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,340
Let's go to the lounge and discuss it.

389
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,010
I'll give you a satisfactory answer.

390
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:07,680
OK?

391
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,170
Sorry, madam.

392
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,200
Let's go.

393
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,330
Slow down.

394
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,870
I'm so sorry.

395
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,320
That female pilot called the police.

396
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,160
Isn't that her?

397
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,560
No one knows her dad is in critical condition.

398
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,080
Yeah.

399
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,410
No one intended to force her to this point.

400
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,760
My dad was in the hospital with a stroke.

401
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,760
The doctor said

402
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,910
he can't make it through the night

403
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,110
Because of you,

404
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,970
I can't even see my dad for the last time.

405
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,330
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

406
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,450
But we can't decide

407
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,730
on the flight delay or the cancellation.

408
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,390
It's so foggy outside.

409
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,040
It's not safe to drive a car.

410
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,180
Let alone a plane.

411
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,750
Why did you cancel the flight?

412
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,040
You can fly after the fog dissipates.

413
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:08,920
Don't worry.

414
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,710
Our captain

415
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,760
has arranged for the earliest make-up tomorrow.

416
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
You can arrive in Sanya before noon.

417
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,640
Is that okay?

418
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:15,790
Tomorrow?

419
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,050
I won't have a father when tomorrow comes.

420
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,000
I won't even have a father.

421
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,650
Who can I see when I go back?

422
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:28,190
He's holding his breath

423
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,520
waiting for me to go back.

424
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,800
He's waiting for me to see him for the last time.

425
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,530
You told me to go back tomorrow.

426
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,750
I'm really sorry.

427
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,970
Hold on.

428
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,430
Chief flight attendant.

429
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,000
Please get her ID card hurriedly.

430
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,120
There's the last flight from Quanzhou to Sanya.

431
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:57,920
11:35.

432
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,400
It's not too late to go now.

433
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,140
But we're on a flight departing from Luzhou.

434
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,590
How can we change it to Quanzhou?

435
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,850
It's okay. I'll buy it.

436
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,260
Don't tell her I bought it.

437
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
She's against me.

438
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,520
Hurry up. It'll be too late soon.

439
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,180
Okay.

440
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:14,970
Madam,

441
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,990
We've checked.

442
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,240
We can book a ticket

443
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,140
from Quanzhou to Sanya for you tonight.

444
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,670
Please give us your ID card.

445
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,970
Can I really go back?

446
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:34,220
ID card.

447
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,940
78789.

448
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,640
Done.

449
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,110
Check the high-speed rail ticket.

450
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,190
Go to Quanzhou Airport now.

451
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,920
She should be able to catch up by high-speed rail.

452
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,360
No more tickets.

453
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,580
The bus ticket must be sold out too.

454
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,310
The Spring Festival is coming.

455
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,360
Shall we call a taxi for her?

456
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,840
No way.

457
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,940
All the flights are cancelled today.

458
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,240
There must be a lot of people waiting in line for a taxi.

459
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,700
We don't have time to wait.

460
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,640
What should we do?

461
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,130
Wait for me.

462
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,830
Yuheng, are you okay?

463
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,510
I'm fine.

464
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,250
I just finished the statement.

465
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,950
The passenger was arrested.

466
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,890
You've suffered a lot.

467
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,620
Brother Nanting, I'm sorry

468
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,790
for worrying you.

469
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,890
It's all my fault.

470
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,190
The flight was delayed and cancelled.

471
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:41,450
Gu Nanting.

472
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,450
It's not your fault.

473
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,110
Gu Nanting.

474
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,860
Great, you're still here.

475
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,590
Do me a favor.

476
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,760
Wait. I have something to do.

477
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,010
Can you send a passenger

478
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,540
to Quanzhou Airport now?

479
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,590
What are you up to again?

480
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,040
Only you can help now.

481
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,300
Her father is in critical condition.

482
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,580
She wants to see him one last time.

483
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,910
Now only the last flight

484
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:01,950
from Quanzhou to Sanya

485
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,540
is 11:35 p.m.

486
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,930
The airport shuttle bus is gone.

487
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,420
It's too late to call a taxi.

488
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,180
So, can you give her a ride?

489
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,760
It's really too late.

490
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,800
Please.

491
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,930
My car is in the company.

492
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,180
Well...

493
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,060
Well...

494
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,630
I'll rent a car for you.

495
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,360
Sure.

496
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,630
I'll ask Xiazhi to bring the passenger

497
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,090
to wait for you at the exit.

498
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,120
Let's go. The car will be here soon.

499
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm not going.

500
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,290
The passenger has bad feelings towards me.

501
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,740
You have no idea

502
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
how unlucky I was on my first flight.

503
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,110
I'll tell you the specific reason another day.

504
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,100
Xiaoxiao, I'm going to bed.

505
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,590
Okay.

506
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,510
Song,

507
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,840
send me

Hello.

516
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,600
It's me, Cheng Xiao.

517
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,010
Did she catch the plane?

518
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,740
Yes.

519
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,550
She just passed the security check.

520
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,180
Great.

521
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:47,400
I've caused you trouble this time.

522
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,910
Not only this time.

523
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,880
Can't you just lose your memory once?

524
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,360
How can you be a pilot with poor memory?

525
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,630
Then remember it.

526
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,950
I'll make it up to you later.

527
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,790
Alright.

528
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,780
I have to fly tomorrow morning.

529
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,910
I need two hours to drive home.

530
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,660
That's all.

531
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,560
Wait.

532
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,770
Thank you, Gu...

533
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,730
Captain.

534
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:37,090
[Cheng Xiao]

535
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,970
[Cheng Xiao has requested to add you as her friend.]

536
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,790
[Check]

537
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,920
It's almost midnight when you arrive in Luzhou.

538
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,720
To guarantee your sleeping time,

539
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,980
I act on my own again without permission.

540
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,320
I don't know your home address,

541
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,410
so I arranged for a designated driver to send you back to the company.

542
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:31,700
Take a rest in the car.

543
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,860
After what happened yesterday,

544
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,360
the passengers must be in a very bad mood.

545
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,360
Yesterday,

546
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,470
there were a few passengers with intense emotions.

547
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,340
The security officer needs to focus on monitoring them.

548
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,010
The flight attendants also need to pay attention to them.

549
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:21,360
Report to me if anything happens.

550
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:21,800
Okay.

551
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,250
Yuheng. Do you have something to say?

552
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:29,540
Yesterday, Mr. Zhang

553
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,880
was very emotional.

554
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,270
According to my observation,

555
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:33,870
he had been rubbing his waist.

556
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,650
So today,

557
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,420
I've prepared a backache patch for him.

558
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,880
Also, Mr. Zhao and Ms. Zhou

559
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,800
are newlyweds

560
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,430
on their honeymoon in Sanya.

561
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,050
I've also prepared a greeting card.

562
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:42,420
[Wish Mr. Zhao and Ms. Zhou a happy wedding.] [All crew members of ST8307]

563
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,420
Yuheng is very thoughtful.

564
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,020
The other flight attendants

565
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:49,650
should demand yourselves with this standard.

566
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,990
All right, get ready.

567
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,750
Is your mindset ready?

568
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,250
I'm really fine, Brother Nanting.

569
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,040
Don't worry.

570
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,260
When I'm on the plane,

571
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,160
I will take good care of myself

572
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,070
while taking care of the passengers.

573
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:10,800
That's good.

574
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,910
If anything happens during the flight,

575
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,680
remember to tell the chief flight attendant immediately.

576
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,020
Okay.

577
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,600
I told you he treats her differently.

578
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,620
What's the biggest risk

579
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,680
of today's flight?

580
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,320
Have you thought about it?

581
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,140
It's the mood swing of passengers caused by

582
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,710
yesterday's flight cancellation.

583
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,710
It may bring

584
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,140
a series of risk factors.

585
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,510
We need to be alert

586
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,270
to prevent the extended risks.

587
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:33,210
On the right side is the Queshi Scenic Area.

588
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,660
I went there when I was in college.

589
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
The weird stones there are amazing.

590
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,920
Who did you go with? Your boyfriend?

591
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:41,070
I wanted to, but I didn't have one.

592
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,340
Do you talk so much

593
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,030
when you fly a cargo aircraft?

594
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,130
Silence is golden.

595
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,690
It's an auto cruise. We only need to surveil.

596
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,640
Besides,

597
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,150
during the journey,

598
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,540
we should have a proper chat

599
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,490
to maintain the flight deck atmosphere

600
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,880
and keep situational awareness.

601
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,800
This is written

602
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,860
in the manual.

603
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,090
If you have the energy,

604
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,360
think about the flight path,

605
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,710
the alternate airports, the weather,

606
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,440
the approach procedure, and the emergency plan.

607
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,060
The nearest airport

608
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,210
is Xiantou Airport.

609
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,270
The runway length is 2500 meters.

610
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,980
The airport only has terrain in the southwest.

611
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,530
I've read all the reports.

612
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,470
The weather

613
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,410
is good.

614
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
What's the minimum sector altitude

615
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,150
of Xiantou Airport?

616
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,550
What is the minimum safety altitude

617
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,080
of our current flight path?

618
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,630
Without the controller's instruction,

619
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,160
how high will you fly in an emergency descent?

620
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,620
900 meters east, 1600 meters west.

621
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,240
The minimum safety altitude is 2150 meters.

622
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,840
Descent to an altitude of 3000 meters first during an emergency.

623
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,560
It's all on the tablet.

624
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,380
Human is not a machine. We can check it when we want.

625
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,110
What if the tablet crash at a critical moment?

626
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:54,120
Don't think that you know everything.

627
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,250
No matter how excellent a person is,

628
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,980
there's room for improvement.

629
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:11,110
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning.

630
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,310
It's 9:40 in Beijing now.

631
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,920
Our plane will arrive at Sanya Feng Huang International Airport

632
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,870
at 10:15.

633
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,990
The ground temperature is 28 degrees Celsius,

634
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:21,320
82 degrees Fahrenheit.

635
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,120
The bathroom will be out of service within 5 minutes.

636
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,150
Once again. Happy New Year to all.

637
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,210
Hello, when can we arrive?

638
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,650
Madam, we expect to

639
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:30,650
arrive at 10:15.

640
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,800
...to arrive at Sanya Feng Huang International Airport

641
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,170
at 10:15.

642
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,160
The restroom will be closed within 5 minutes.

643
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,710
Happy Chinese New Year.

644
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,590
Thank you.

645
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,920
There's weather ahead.

646
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:48,630
Go around from the right side.

647
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,670
Turn left.

648
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,800
The left side is further away.

649
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,060
It will take more time.

650
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,240
The wind direction is from east to west.

651
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,710
It may be turbulent if we go to the right.

652
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,430
I know.

653
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,390
But it is normal to encounter turbulence.

654
00:29:58,390 --> 00:29:59,650
When Song and I flew the cargo aircraft,

655
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,970
we often encountered turbulence.

656
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,770
Turbulence is inevitable to us.

657
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,770
Do you forget

658
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,310
there are

659
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,840
178 passengers behind you?

660
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,050
But...

661
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,120
It should be fine.

662
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,490
It's nothing serious.

663
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:13,930
Song,

664
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,550
inform the air traffic control about our intention to go around.

665
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,900
Haikou District.

666
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,840
Luzhou 8307.

667
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,800
Intend to go around from the left side due to the weather.

668
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,230
Navigation 120.

669
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,010
Luzhou 8307.

670
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,160
The airspace on your left

671
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,230
is occupied by other users.

672
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:28,560
You can't take a detour.

673
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,310
Copy that. Luzhou 8307.

674
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,980
Don't worry, Captain Gu.

675
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,590
It's no big deal.

676
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,880
It's absolutely safe.

677
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:39,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

678
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,240
here is the captain speaking.

679
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,800
The plane is crossing the turbulence area.

680
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,960
Please sit in your seat

681
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,920
and fasten your seat belt.

682
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,720
Thank you for your cooperation.

683
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,320
Please fasten your seat belt.

684
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,420
-I'm sorry.
-Be careful.

685
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,830
I'm sorry. Thank you.

686
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,990
What's wrong, Yuheng?

687
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,510
I'm fine.

688
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:24,740
Your hands are cold.

689
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,310
Are you still fine?

690
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,500
Are you afraid of flying?

691
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,850
You seemed fine during your training.

692
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:31,620
I'm  just

693
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,390
a little uncomfortable.

694
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,760
It's okay.

695
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,720
What happened?

696
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,480
Ms. Ai, she's not feeling well.

697
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:42,570
Help her up.

698
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,640
It won't affect, Ms. Ai.

699
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,680
It's okay.

700
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,000
Come, sit here.

701
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,040
You should sit down too.

702
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,930
Okay.

703
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:07,130
Captain.

704
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,530
How long will it take?

705
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,120
Some of our passengers have vomited.

706
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,220
Our flight attendant, Li Yuheng,

707
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,620
is also not feeling well.

708
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:15,910
About ten minutes left.

709
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,230
The plane will cross over the turbulence area.

710
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:17,980
Okay, got it.

711
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,340
Captain.

712
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:25,000
Can we apply to lower the altitude level?

713
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,540
The turbulence may be weaker.

714
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,670
Apply immediately.

715
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,440
Haikou District.

716
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,360
Luzhou 8307.

717
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,600
Request to lower the altitude level.

718
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,000
Sorry, Ms. Ai.

719
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:40,890
I...

720
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:41,690
It's okay.

721
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:43,650
It was a bit bumpy today.

722
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
It's normal that you can't stand it.

723
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,000
Don't blame yourself.

724
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,150
Take a deep breath.

725
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,070
I've never carried anyone before.

726
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,740
I thought this turbulence

727
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,300
was nothing serious to the passengers.

728
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:34,830
You are pilots.

729
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,430
Your resistance to turbulence is far better than regular passengers.

730
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,220
We not only need to protect

731
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,880
the safety of the passengers,

732
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,220
but also ensure their psychological safety.

733
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,480
Don't let them feel anxious and nervous.

734
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:09,179
[Sanya Feng Huang Airport]

735
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,130
Are you okay?

736
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,870
Sorry, Brother Nanting.

737
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,290
I made you worry again.

738
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,380
It's okay. I'll do it.

739
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,130
I'm fine. I can do it myself.

740
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,210
Take a good rest at the hotel.

741
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,040
Done.

742
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:10,620
I'll help you register.

743
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,010
The company

744
00:35:12,090 --> 00:35:14,110
has booked sea view rooms this time.

745
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,140
The company also booked

746
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:17,590
a presidential suite

747
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,940
for us to prepare New Year's Eve dinner.

748
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay.

749
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,300
Xia,

750
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,470
my ID card.

751
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,180
Did I forget to collect yours?

752
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,930
I'm so sorry. Look at me.

753
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,300
I forgot.

754
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,330
Well...

755
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,650
I don't need the sea view room. Just give me an ordinary room.

756
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,080
No.

757
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,410
It's facing the sea.

758
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,990
I'm not interested.

759
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:41,690
Thank you.

760
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:50,400
Captain Gu is really not an ordinary person.

761
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,990
Yeah.

762
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:14,380
Put it there.

763
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,770
Okay.

764
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,600
-Captain Song.
-Let me do it.

765
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,520
It's OK.

766
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,230
Let me show you my strength.

767
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,290
Let me help you.

768
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:19,840
Okay.

769
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,910
Sis, help me find

770
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,730
the oyster sauce with less salt.

771
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,130
Okay.

772
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,500
Here.

773
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:33,280
This is it.

774
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,530
Xiazhi.

775
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:39,210
Give Captain Song a helping hand.

776
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:55,020
The soy milk issue is not over yet.

777
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,730
Pay me the dry cleaning fee

778
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,620
and mental damage compensation.

779
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,750
The dry cleaning fee is fine.

780
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:02,410
Mental damage compensation?

781
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,430
What do you mean by that?

782
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,300
Are you paying me or not?

783
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:10,670
Yue.

784
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,740
I'm in Sanya. Yes.

785
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,170
I'm cooking New Year's Eve dinner. I didn't tell you.

786
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,060
Song,

787
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,500
Are you paying me or not?

788
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,320
What are you saying?

789
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll ask you one last time.

790
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,570
Are you paying me or not?

791
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,280
Xiazhi.

792
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,780
Don't bully Song.

793
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,370
Come and make dumplings.

794
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:37,610
Yue,

795
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,320
you heard it wrong just now.

796
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,560
No hugging.

797
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,360
I'm cooking here.

798
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,620
They said they want to make fried shrimp.

799
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,640
The last dish.

800
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,430
Here are the glutinous rice balls.

801
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,160
Let's eat up.

802
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Song is so capable.

803
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,610
He's not only excellent at his work but also good at cooking.

804
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,310
Of course.

805
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,020
Yes.

806
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,300
If you're capable, you won't worry about getting married.

807
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
Let's eat.

808
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,150
Start eating.

809
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:02,730
Thank you, sis.

810
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,960
Thank you.

811
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,490
Qi Yu.

812
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,850
The crews don't drink at all.

813
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,140
Didn't the company say

814
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,220
we can't drink within 24 hours on duty?

815
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,460
We only fly the day after tomorrow.

816
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,920
That's an ordinary pilot.

817
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,970
We're the students of Mr. Gu.

818
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,960
Can you demand yourself with normal standards?

819
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,580
You're a boot-licker.

820
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,160
Really?

821
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,490
But there's wine

822
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,240
in the glutinous rice balls.

823
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,270
Today is an exception. Drink as much as you want.

824
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,530
Just don't overdrink.

825
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:30,700
No, thanks.

826
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,150
She's allergic to alcohol.

827
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,810
Brother Nanting,

828
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:37,860
I was allergic to alcohol

829
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,240
when I was young.

830
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,680
It's fine now.

831
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,190
Then I'll pour you more.

832
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,850
Yuheng.

833
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,220
Have you known Captain Gu since your childhood?

834
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,370
We were neighbors when we were kids.

835
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,580
Our mums were very close.

836
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,760
But then he moved out.

837
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,960
They are childhood friends,

838
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,880
not a couple.

839
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,510
Yes, it's obvious.

840
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,080
Gu Nanting is so good at pretending.

841
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:07,850
Look at Li Yuheng.

842
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,790
What do you see in her eyes?

843
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:11,870
In her eyes.

844
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,810
Cosmetic contact lenses?

845
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:17,000
Nonsense!

846
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:20,930
She only cares about Gu Nanting.

847
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,430
Pour it yourself.

848
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,550
Here.

849
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,000
I substitute tea for wine.

850
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,820
You all worked overtime during the Spring Festival

851
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,890
and experienced a lot in these two days.

852
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:43,030
Good work, everyone.

853
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,300
Especially the flight attendants.

854
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,700
It's our duty to ensure the safety of the cabin.

855
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,680
Although we can't go home for the Spring Festival this year,

856
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,410
we have the chance

857
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:50,670
to gather us together.

858
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,120
Come.

859
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,490
Come on.

860
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:55,610
Happy New Year.

861
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,070
Cheers.

862
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,520
Come on.

863
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,000
I don't drink anymore.

864
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,550
I'm full. You guys drink.

865
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:14,890
What are you doing, Yuheng?

866
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,880
Cheers.

867
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:16,940
Let's drink.

868
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,250
Cheers.

869
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,750
Fill it up, Qi Yu.

870
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,090
Here.

871
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,950
Thank you, Song.

872
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,370
-It's all yours.
-That's enough.

873
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,180
Go on.

874
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,900
I need to use the bathroom.

875
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:30,960
Are you okay?

876
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,610
I'm fine.

877
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,140
Take care.

878
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,310
Let's continue.

879
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,410
Are you drunk?

880
00:40:51,330 --> 00:40:53,060
Let me get you a bottle of water.

881
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,730
Have a seat.

882
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,110
Here.

883
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,200
Don't act tough if you can't drink.

884
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,600
Why did you drink so much?

885
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,080
Everyone is happy.

886
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,830
I just don't want to disappoint others.

887
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,440
I...

888
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,360
I really

889
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,880
I don't know why I did that today.

890
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,320
I'm embarrassed.

891
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:30,700
Yesterday, because of me,

892
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,010
because of me.

893
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,230
Today, I...

894
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,430
I don't want to let Ms. Ai down.

895
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,770
I don't want to let you down either.

896
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,920
What happened last night was an exception.

897
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,400
Turbulence today is also rare.

898
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:49,410
It's your first time flying.

899
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,860
Don't blame yourself too much.

900
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,400
How about

901
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,000
going back to your room for a rest?

902
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,210
Xia.

903
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,060
Yuheng is drunk.

904
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,460
Take her back to her room.

905
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,830
No problem. Leave it to me.

906
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:05,560
Xiazhi.

907
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:07,830
I suddenly feel dizzy.

908
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,260
What's wrong?

909
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,170
Why did I faint

910
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,530
when I stood up just now?

911
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,710
What are you doing?

912
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:13,770
Give her back to Captain Gu.

913
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,170
Why are you interfering?

914
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,040
Captain Gu,

915
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
I'm sorry.

916
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,340
How about

917
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,250
you send Yuheng back?

918
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,570
Cheng Xiao is drunk too.

919
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,450
I'm not drunk. I'm just a little…

920
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,840
Dizzy. Dizzy.

921
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,370
What should we do?

922
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,010
Take care of her.

923
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,440
Let's go.

924
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,330
Do you want some water?

925
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:34,870
No, I'll be fine soon.

926
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,870
Let me take a rest.

927
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:36,600
Come on.

928
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,260
Look at you.

929
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,140
Why did you drink so much?

930
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,330
Stop pretending.

931
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,230
How is it? Did I cooperate well?

932
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,790
Here you are, your reward.

933
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:49,050
What are you doing over there?

934
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:49,760
It's Chinese New Year. Come here.

935
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,960
Come on.

936
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,070
Let's drink.

937
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,140
Come on.

938
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:55,010
Stop playing.
