Mr. Xu,

6
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,990
for the arrangement to transfer pilots from the Freight Department

7
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,250
to our Passenger Transport Department,

8
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,830
we still want to talk with you about it.

9
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,479
Is there any problem?

10
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,789
I admit that Cai from the Freight Department

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,259
is very

12
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,430
skilled in the techniques.

13
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,009
But this man looks carefree.

14
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,870
The pilots who work under him

15
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,979
all learn from him.

16
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,240
Now such a group of people

17
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,160
will be transferred to our Passenger Transport Department.

18
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,160
I'm afraid it will affect

19
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,560
the image of our Passenger Transport Department.

21
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,270
I want to hear your opinion.

22
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,979
The Passenger Transport Department

23
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:11,710
is applying for new air routes.

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,460
There won't be enough pilots.

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,280
The pilots in the Freight Department

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,490
were also trained by the Luzhou Airlines with great efforts.

27
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,000
They're skilled enough in the techniques.

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,600
I think

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,350
we should give them a chance.

30
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,079
Of course, we must be strict in other aspects.

31
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:26,740
I agree with Nanting.

32
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,150
Okay.

33
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,230
Let's check their performance strictly.

34
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,690
But even so,

35
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,220
let's not accept that girl

36
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,280
from the Freight Department.

37
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,060
We can recommend her to the Freight Department of other airline company.

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,640
Why?

39
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:44,140
She hasn't got married or given birth to a child yet.

40
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,910
Mr. Jiang,

41
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
let's stop talking about this topic.

42
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:49,950
It might cause a problem.

43
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,980
We're talking about it behind closed doors, aren't we?

44
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,590
Besides,

45
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,530
the ability of a female pilot

46
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,870
is not good enough.

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,420
Flight ability has nothing to do with gender.

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,970
It only has something to do with individuals.

49
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,100
What about the usage rate?

50
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,680
The usage rate of female pilots is low.

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,820
Isn't that a consensus?

52
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,240
According to the statistics of our entire industry,

53
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,830
for the female pilots recruited by other companies,

54
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,290
when it comes to the flight time,

55

56
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,760
their performance isn't worse than that of male pilots'.

-Mr. Jiang. -But...

58
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,350
I remember the Flight Department has not recruited

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,680
any female pilots

60
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,250
for five years. Right?

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,160
Last year,

62
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,450
I made a report about the feasibility

63
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,560
of recruiting female pilots for the Passenger Transport Department,

64
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,920
but I didn't get permission to proceed with it all the time.

65
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,980
I've long wanted to

66
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:32,350
discuss about it with Mr. Jiang.

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,360
Whether it's a male pilot or a female pilot,

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,560
they are both pilots.

69
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,470
We should treat them equally.

70
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,710
Well, for this matter,

However, during the interview,

74
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,690
you have to evaluate their performance strictly.

You should ask her questions.

Why did you choose

162
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,120
the career as a pilot?

163
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,250

Of course,

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,410
there is another important and pracitcal reason.

170
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,470
The income is high.

171
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,150
The career as a pilot can give me economic freedom

172
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,680
so that I can follow my heart

173
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:38,930
and live more freely.

00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:39,780
So,

175
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,490
this is your attitude with which you fly a plane?

176
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,920
Flight work is about rules and discipline.

177
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,180
You have to pay the price of freedom

178
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,380
to fulfill your duty.

179
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,520
Do you know how serious this job is?

180
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,230
I joined this company in 2013.

181
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,130
My flight time is up to 3,500 hours.

182
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,680
My flight experience time is as long as 2,700 hours.

183
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,080
There is no error record.

184
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,360
All the evaluations have been passed excellently.

185
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,120
Besides,

186
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,140
I also have the certificate of Aviation English Level Five,

187
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,790
and the qualification of English communication for international flights.

188
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,430
This is my answer to serious work.

[Director of the Security Department of Luzhou Airlines]

191
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,600
For your recent performance,

192
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,720
you landed at the extreme wind speed.

193
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
No matter how stable the landing was,

194
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,600
there should be a comment on it.

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,490
The weather was so bad that day.

196
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,960
With my good skills, I managed to

197
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,300
land the plane safely.

198
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,590
Is there a problem?

199
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,370
Did we have to divert the plane to land it elsewhere,

200
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,850
and make the company lose hundreds of thousands of yuan?

201
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,990
Flight safety is not measured by money.

202
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,990
I'll say it again.

203
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,600
There wasn't any problem with my landing operation.

204
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,450
Nor did I violate

205
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,420
the current flight safety manual.

206
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,510
Since you're in the Passenger Transport Department,

207
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,170
let's wait till the interview is finished,

208
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,340
and then have further communication about

209
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,060
the landing operation on that day.

210
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
What do you think?

211
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,370
I think we still need to discuss

212
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,640
whether Cheng Xiao can join the Passenger Transport Department.

213
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,240
Mr. Gu,

214
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,810
the pilots of the Freight Department are transferred to the Passenger Transport Department.

215
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,810
This is the company's arrangement.

216
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,830
Well,

217
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,900
leaders,

218
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,040
we've just been transferred from the Freight Department to here.

219
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,280
Our working state in ordinary times

220
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,000
may be different from that in the Passenger Transport Department.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,300
We will learn more

222
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,390
and get used to it as soon as possible.

223
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,880
A pilot is the soul of a plane.

224
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,690
Our job

225
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
relates to the safety of passengers

226
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,680
and the company's property.

227
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
We can't be careless whenever it is.

228
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:26,830
I agree with that.

229
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,020
However,

230
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,200
I came back from Hokkaido after my vacation last month.

231
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,330
I took the flight XD884 of our company.

232
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,990
For the Captain's Public Address,

233
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:36,650
I only heard it once while the plane was landing.

234
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,890
Mr. Gu,

235
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,440
is this rigorous enough?

236
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,410
Lin Yicheng.

237
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,430
Mr. Gu.

238
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,000
What was wrong with

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,600
the Captain's Public Address during the cruise?

240
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,530
Yes, I was the copilot that day.

241
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,560
Captain Zhang authorized me to do

242
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,290
the Captain's Public Address.

243
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,590
That's Mr. Jiang's brother-in-law.

244
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,900
There was a lack of one public address indeed.

245
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,710
I was not feeling well that day.

246
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,790
I had a cold.

247
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,550
If you fly a plane while having a cold,

248
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,310
your eardrums might be perforated.

249
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,440
You should've taken a day off that day.

250
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,410
Yes, yes.

251
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,260
I think Cheng Xiao's suggestion

252
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,320
is very good.

253
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,470
Lin Yicheng,

254
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,100
in the future, you must have higher standard

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,730
on the details of your work.

256
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:31,710

Cheng Xiao,

260
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,920
the problem you pointed out

261
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,580
is correct.

262
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,560
Lin Yicheng,

263
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,060
Go back and study the operational manual.

264
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:45,650
Write a self-criticism report with Captain Zhang.

265
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,460
Okay, Mr. Gu.

266
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:49,380
So, Mr. Gu,

267
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,440
please don't look at me with colored glasses.

268
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
And don't doubt my ability in my job.

269
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,760
Ability is the combination of skills and attitude.

270
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,470
Without a serious and modest attitude,

271
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,760
no matter how good your skills are,

272
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,440
you can't guarantee the safety of flight for 100 percent.

273
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,290
Based on your current understanding of this profession,

274
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,280
even if the company lets you to join the Passenger Transport Department,

275
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,940
you must start from working as

276
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,760
an observer.

277
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,920
Observer?

278
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:19,120
Leaders,

279
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,010
isn't this too unfair?

280
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,730
Do you have any objections

281
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,280
to Mr. Gu's conclusion?

282
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,410
According to Cheng's credentials,

283
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,710
she is qualified to get promoted to captain.

284
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,470
It seems a bit inappropriate

285
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,440
to demote her to an observer suddenly.

286
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,100
How about

287
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,990
letting her fly a plane again before we decide?

288
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:00,170
How about this?

289
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,730
I'll arrange you two to fly a plane again tomorrow.

290
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,660
You think Mr. Gu's arrangement like this

291
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,860
is unfair, don't you?

292
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,240
Then fly the plane well,

293
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,010
show your true level of skills,

294
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:10,170
and prove it to him.

295
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,340
Then we'll decide

296
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,530
whether you can

297
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,760
keep your position as First Copilot.

298

The captain has an acute brain infarction and loses his capability.

357

What smell is it?

373
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,430
Be serious.

374
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,640
Didn't the birds get caught up into the engine?

375
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
Can't you smell the burning of them?

Let me treat you to barbecue tonight.

377

You can choose any runway to land.

391
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,250
The plane can't fly to the airport now.

Prepare for off-site forced landing.

393
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:08,190
We must turn the plane into a glider.

394
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,150
Lower the head of the plane a bit.

395

Please confirm where you are going to land.

397
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,040
The grassland which is 20 kilometers away

398
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,300
from my 040 direction.

399
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:27,420
Grassland? Are you sure?

400
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,500
At your 9 o'clock direction

401
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,780
there's the 400-meter-wide Dongpu River.

402
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,580
It's better than the grassland.

403
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,690
We can't go to the Dongpu River now.

404
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,470
The speed of surface wind is 8m per second.

405
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,820
The wind speed will be higher on the river.

406
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,750
The wind direction is unstable, too.

407
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,250
It's easy to make the plane overturn.

408
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:46,250
It's safer to land on the grassland.

Let's stop here.

449

Song Song,

450
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,780
we created a miracle.

451
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,240
Gather in the lecture room.

452
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,340
[Lecture Room 9]

453
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,680
Thank you.

454
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,750
You're welcome

455
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:07,360
Mr. Nanting, thanks for your hard work. Have some water.

456
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,220
I don't like soft drinks. Thanks.

457
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,040
What do you think of

458
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,810
your own performance today?

459
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,560
Under the extreme circumstance that

460
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,770
the captain lost his capability and both engine failed,

461
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,240
I managed to land the plane safely

462
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,110
and there was basically no damage to the plane.

463
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,240
I'm very satisfied with my operation.

464
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,970
What do you mean?

465
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,660
According to the procedures,

466
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,500
if the engine is broken,

467
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,330
it's impossible to reboot it successfully.

468
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,260
Asking Song Song to drag the unconscious captain out

469
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,320
was a waste of time.

470
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,720
Constantly restarting the engines was a waste of time.

471
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,710
According to the procedures,

472
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,050
asking him to help you monitor

473
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,440
each parameter of the plane

474
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
could better increase the success rate of forced landing.

475
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
The procedures are not inflexible.

476
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,740
Procedures

477
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,040
are the summary of experience and lesson.

478
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,440
They're made with blood.

479
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,360
Captain Sullenberger from the US Airways

480
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,000
also encountered the problem of both engines failing,

481
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,440
and he did the forced landing successfully.

482
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,550
Captain Sullenberger

483
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:03,320
didn't follow the procedure.

484
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,420
His first reaction

485
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,520
was asking the copilot to activate the auxiliary power unit.

486
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,780
Captain Sullenberger

487
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,080
has a profound understanding about flying a plane.

488
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,920
That's why

489
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,080
he ventured to adjust the order of the procedure.

490
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,330
As an ordinary pilot,

491
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,120
strictly following the procedures

492
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,710
is the best guarantee for safety.

493
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:19,280
I surely follow the procedures

494
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,540
and respect the rules.

495
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,820
But rules and procedures are not dead.

496
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,270
They are constantly changing and improving.

497
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,200
If you really care about the rules,

498
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,670
when the engines stopped,

499
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,070
you wouldn't have thought about barbeque.

500
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,140
We have to get trained like flying a real plane

501
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,880
and fly a plane like getting trained. This is the rule.

502
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,810
I agree with you.

503
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:39,880
Any flight operation must be done seriously.

504
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
I've always been doing it like that.

505
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,280
But we still need to relax mentally.

506
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,440
If you keep being tense,

507
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,480
it'll be easy for you to make mistakes.

508
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
When you were relaxed,

509
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,270
you had a colleague by your side

510
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:50,720
who needed emergency treatment.

511
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,960
There's the best treatment period for acute cerebral infarction.

512
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,450
But it wasn't true.

513
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,720
It was a simulation.

514
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,700
Based on what you said,

515
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,990
I'm 100% sure that

516
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,320
you have to start over in the training.

517
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,740
You...

518
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,100
Alright. Alright.

519
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,660
About this,

520
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,850
I'll think it over with Mr. Gu.

521
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,080
Come to my office

522
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,080
in ten minutes.

523
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,880
Don't be angry, Xiao.

524
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,900
You made me confused.

525
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:44,340
At first,

526
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:47,200
I was a bit worried about these female pilots.

527
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,660
You insisted on giving them another chance.

528
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,860
Why are you hold an attitude like this now?

529
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,090
I strived for a chance for all the female pilots.

530
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,820
There shouldn't be any difference in treatment because of gender.

531
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,480
Tell me what you think of

532
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,030
Cheng Xiao now.

533
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,270
Today,

534
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,000
it was supposed to be a test for her as a copilot.

535
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,750
When she saw that the captain was me,

536
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:13,210
she tended to think rashly in the beginning.

537
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,990
I set up the situation of both engines failing

538
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:16,790
because I wanted to take the edge off her spirit.

539
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,490
I didn't expect her to land the plane safely.

540
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,890
She is indeed excellent.

541
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,160
However,

542
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,320
her attitude in the evaluation

543
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,620
was not good enough

544
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,420
to meet the standard for a passenger flight pilot.

545
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,170
Look.

546
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,050
I told you so.

547
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,980
The pilots from the Freight Department

548
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,800
developed a habit like that long ago.

549
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,000
It's hard to change it.

550
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,330
Especially Cheng Xiao.

551
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,830
If she really comes here,

552
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,490
there will be a lot of trouble.

553
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,480
After the interview finished yesterday,

554
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,210
I asked each department

555
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,270
and learned about the pilots from the Freight Department in details.

556
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,390
At work, Cheng Xiao

557
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,760
can endure hardships and likes studying challenging problems.

558
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,120
She has outstanding strengths.

559
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,660
So,

560
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,080
I take back my opinion that Cheng Xiao

561
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,950
is not suitable for the Passenger Transport Department.

562
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:01,870
Let her participate in

563
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,870
the transition training for the 787 plane.

564
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,200
Let her go to Australia?

565
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,890
She will have to stay in Australia for two months.

566
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,840
What if she is still unqualified in the end?

567
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,370
Then the company's resources will be wasted.

568
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,840
Any potential talent

569
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
deserves the company's resources.

570
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,020
Come in.

571
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,120
Mr. Jiang.

572
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,030
Let Mr. Gu tell you.

573
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,350
Cheng Xiao,

574
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,040
from now on,

575
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,200
you are going to prepare for the transition training of 787.

576
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,590
After the training, your post will be determined

577
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,290
according to your performance.

578
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,740
You will give me another test?

579
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,400
What kind of attitude is that?

580
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:01,520
It's about the company's rules and regulations.

581
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,410
It's not a difficulty created to you deliberately.

582
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,500
It's settled then.

583
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,630
Mr. Gu will be

584
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,930
the full-time instructor for the pilots of your group.

585
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,340
Mr. Jiang,

586
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,950
can we change the instructor?

587
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,290
Why?

588
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,080
Mr. Gu looks young,

589
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:25,850
but we all know his ability.

590
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,840
However,

591
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:31,010
we have to thank Nanting fo his coming hard work.

592
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,840
I can only rest assured by handing this group of pilots

593
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,760
to your hands.

594
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,310
Okay.

595
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:38,960
Sorry.

596
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,660
I have something to do.

597
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,410
So...

598
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,770
Go ahead with your work.

599
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:36,490
I'll wait for the next one.

600
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,930
I won't give you another chance to get something on me.

601
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,660
See you at the training ground.

602
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,790
You have to keep all the promises

603
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:53,520
you've made.

604
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,300
Not only will I achieve them all,

605
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,900
I'll also do better than you.

606
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,980
Who is this?

607
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,730
You're back.

608
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,240
How long have you been waiting?

609
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,170
If you didn't show up in 30 minutes, I would leave.

610
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,220
It's worth if if I could make Mr. Gu, who cherishes time

611
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,820
so much, wait for 30 minutes.

612
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,690
Why are you here?

613
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,500
I went to Seattle to study for half a month and I've just been back.

614
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,760
I'm going to make a report to the leaders.

615
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:02,860
Have you learnt anything from the Boyin headquarters?

616
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,860
I've learnt a lot.

617
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,050
I even went into the general assembly shop of 787.

618
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,430
Recently, to pilot 787, I've always felt that

619
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,560
the automatic push of the engine has changed rapidly.

620
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,360
The stability of the five sides's pitching is low.

621
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,510
I can solve your problem this time.

622
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,900
I'll go back to the cabin to sort out the information,

623
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,030
and send it to your email box tomorrow.

624
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,960
When you're free, let's play basketball.

625
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,240
I'm going to Australia next week. Two months.

626
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:30,630
Let's make an appointment next time. It's too difficult.

627
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,520
Next time.

628
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,000
Next time.

629
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,440
Xia Zhi.

630
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,440
What's wrong? You lost your key of the house again?

631
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:19,469
This time,

632
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:21,840
it's not about losing the key.

633
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,909
You have no money to pay the rent?

634
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,830
Tell me how much you want to borrow this time.

635
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:42,969
Xiao,

636
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,250
I'm not borrowing money this time.

637
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,480
I want to live here.

638
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,330
Xiao,

639
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,159
you must save me this time.

640
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,060
I saved you every time.

641
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,300
Just live here.

642
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:00,570
But maybe you won't live here for so long.

643
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,110
Are you moving elsewhere?

644
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,060
It's a secret for now.

645
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,370
But it should be fine for you to live here

646
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,830
until you get your salary.

647
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:12,730
Polly. You must be hungry.

648
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,400
Actually,

649
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,650
I think I've lost my job.

650
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,490
You lost your job again?

651
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,580
It's been two years since I graduated,

652
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,970
and I've done seven jobs.

653
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,570
Why didn't I get a stable job?

654
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,530
It's only been two years since you graduated.

655
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:38,930
It's normal to feel lost.

656
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:41,510
Then why do you want to be a pilot?

657
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,000
Maybe I think by being a pilot, I can have no constraint

658
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,400
and have so much freedom.

659
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,200
Who are you fooling?

660
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
How can you say such a vulgar excuse?

661
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,920
With your temper,

662
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,540
who can constrain you?

663
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,610
You have to keep all the promises you've made.

664
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,140
When I viewed the recruitment website today,

665
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,910
I've found that your company is conducting a social recruitment.

666
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,140
Yes. The company has been reorganizing all the departments recently.

667
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,900
I've been suffering from it.

668
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,770
What do you think

669
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,030
if I apply for a job in your company?

670
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:26,500
You want to learn flying planes?

671
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,630
I'm not that stupid.

672
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,500
I mean

673
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,560
I saw that how you were badly tortured

674
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,760
while you were learning to fly planes.

675
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,790
I won't learn it.

676
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,880
So you are...

677
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,450
Actually,

678
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,240
I want to be a stewardess.

679
