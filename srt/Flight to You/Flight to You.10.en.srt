00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,800
Brother Qiao.

177
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,240
Why are you here so early?

178
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,660
I'm sorry.

179
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:34,110
I left early yesterday.

180
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:35,550
Don't say that.

181
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,230
Everyone feels upset

182
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,290
when encountering such a situation.

183
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,670
Are you okay?

184
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
You didn't reply my message.

185
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,520
I'm fine. Thank you.

186
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,250
I've arranged a half-day schedule for you today.

187
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,510
Go back and have a rest.

188
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,090
No, I'm fine.

189
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,980
It's all set. No big deal.

190
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,400
Thank you, Brother Qiao.

191
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:58,820
Cheng.

192
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,210
Can you stop calling me that?

193
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,930
I am a 95s child.

194
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,780
It's just for respect.

195
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:05,790
OK.

196
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,410
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

197
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,070
Try it. My dad made it himself.

198
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,360
Did he make it himself?

199
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,220
My dad has a breakfast shop

200
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
near the airport.

201
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,370
My whole family moved near the airport

202
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,240
just to let me go to work more conveniently.

203
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,560
Tell me if you don't like it.

204
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,040
My dad has made buns for half his life.

205
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,610
He's still afraid that his buns are not delicious.

206
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,020
But if there are any returned customers,

207
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,220
he will be very happy.

208
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,370
He thinks his hard work pays off.

209
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,410
Try it.

210
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,060
It's delicious.

211
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
It's good, right?

212
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,440
Where is the shop?

213
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,360
Turn left after going out from the company.

214
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,160
Then cross the road, it's next to the supermarket.

215
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,210
Is that your dad?

216
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,000
Have you been there?

217
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,450
No.

218
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,640
There was once I passed by,

219
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,440
and my colleague bought it,

220
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,680
I didn't.

221
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,460
I should have bought

222
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,840
thousands of them.

223
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,430
This is today's flight record.

224
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,970
Okay, give it to me.

225
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,690
I’m leaving, Cheng.

226
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,000
See you tomorrow.

227
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
See you tomorrow.

228
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,190
What a coincidence.

229
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,520
We meet each other on every business trip.

230
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,940
Hello, Mr. Ni.

231
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,610
Are you off work?

232
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,060
I don't have much work today.

233
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,180
I'll board in half an hour.

234
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,740
If there's nothing else,

235
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,370
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.

236
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,670
You seem different

237
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,360
from the last few times.

238
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,630
I remember when you were in Australia aviation school,

239
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,730
even if you were sick,

240
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,790
you were still lively and energetic.

241
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,420
Since I was 19,

242
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,950
for ten years,

243
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,110
I've been on a plane.

244
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,260
I thought

245
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,260
it's bad enough that I can't touch the control rod.

246
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,240
Who knows?

247
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,910
I can't even get on the plane now.

248
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Actually, when I was in high school,

249
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,300
I also wished to learn to fly.

250
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,200
My family was poor back then.

251
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,760
I took a great effort to borrowed money

252
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,370
to do laser surgery with hard effort.

253
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,520
But I was rejected

254
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,010
during the enrollment.

255
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:00,330
It comes out that you can't pass the physical examination

256
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,460
after you have done the laser surgery.

257
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:03,750
So,

258
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,650
I had to study maintenance.

259
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,460
I used to think

260
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,080
life is unfair.

261
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,710
All roads lead to Rome.

262
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,140
But some people are born in Rome.

263
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,000
When I first started working,

264
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,180
I couldn't go home for a year

265
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:25,400
with a monthly salary of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

266
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,730
The apron is my living room.

267
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,250
The garage is my bedroom.

268
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,250
I remember once

269
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,160
we needed to replace the heat exchanger of

270
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,000
the air-conditioner compartments after the flight.

271
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,130
It was 50 degrees Celsius at the apron.

272
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:41,750
I was so thirsty.

273
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,680
When I saw there was some water left by the passengers,

274
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:45,320
I drank it.

275
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:46,880
In the end,

276
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,060
I was punished for taking the aircraft supplies.

277
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:50,790
Three months

278
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:52,950
turned into vain.

279
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,580
The scar on your hand...

280
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,000
One time, I was repairing the engine.

281
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,070
My colleague was too sleepy

282
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,550
and ran into the power.

283
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,570
It's not easy

284
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:16,220
in any position in civil aviation.

285
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,490
Luckily, God didn't give you the chance.

286
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,370
Otherwise,

287
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,620
the world will lose

288
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,910
such a great engineer.

289
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,550
So,

290
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,960
from another perspective,

291
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:39,540
maybe it's a good thing.

292
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,890
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

293
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,630
Don’t worry.

294
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,540
Cheng Xiao has 100 lives.

295
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,380
A life without a storm

296
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,530
is incomplete.

297
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,980
This is the Cheng Xiao I know.

298
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:57,870
Here.

299
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,930
No matter how Gu Nanting oppresses me,

300
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,380
I will find a chance to turn the tide.

301
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,400
Do you really treat him

302
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,800
as your imaginary enemy?

303
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,100
He doesn't deserve it.

304
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,290
I'm the only enemy I have.

305
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,110
It was not his idea

306
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,150
to let you become a ground staff.

307
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,570
It was Mr. Jiang’s idea.

308
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,380
Mr. Jiang.

309
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,950
Well,

310
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
why didn't Gu Nanting explain to me?

311
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:50,020
I've known him for more than ten years.

312
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,180
That's how he is.

313
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,580
He never speaks too much.

314
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,150
By the way,

315
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,620
are you going to serve

316
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,480
a flight to Beijing tomorrow?

317
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,530
How did you know?

318
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,850
Because I'll take that flight.

319
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,750
The same goes for the company's leader.

320
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,630
I asked Mr Dai

321
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:19,120
to arrange you for the reception.

322
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
I have to go to the boarding gate now.

323
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,410
See you tomorrow.

324
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,230
Do your best.

325
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,090
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

326
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,040
Come in.

327
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,000
I'll return your clothes after I wash them.

328
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,340
No need.

329
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,860
Don't worry. I'll use the dry cleaning. It won't spoil your clothes.

330
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,930
I only go to a fixed dry cleaner.

331
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:51,680
Well...

332
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,160
I misunderstood you.

333
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,850
I knew it all.

334
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,170
It was Mr. Jiang’s idea

335
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,170
to let me transfer to the Ground Handling Department.

336
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,580
Whatever the reason he believes,

337
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,250
I’ll keep working hard.

338
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,530
Expecting me to give up?

339
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,880
Impossible.

340
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,980
Why didn't you fill in your home address

341
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,400
in the staff records?

342
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,480
I was planning to move

343
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,190
when I was transferred to the Passenger Transport Department.

344
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,110
I thought I could

345
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,270
fill in the address after moving out.

346
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,120
Why are you checking my address?

347
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,960
I'm organizing the basic information.

348
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,520
I'll make it up later.

349
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:54,810
Well,

350
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,870
I'll leave you alone.

351
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,130
Attention, passengers of flight XD8306

352
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,010
to Shenzhen.

353
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,350
Your flight is about to take off.

354
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,880
Please board at Gate 73 as soon as possible.

355
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,480
Thank you.

356
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,910
Two more are left.

357
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,560
Let's broadcast it.

358
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,400
Passengers of Luzhou Airlines

359
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,240
flight XD8306

360
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,660
to Shenzhen,

361
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,120
namely Zhang Jingya and Hu Guoping, please pay attention.

362
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
The boarding gate

363
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,640
is closing.

364
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,320
Please go to Gate 73 as soon as possible.

365
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,920
Thank you.

366
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:31,850
I'm not on this flight.

367
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,920
I'm on the same flight as Mr. Xu.

368
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,850
At that boarding gate.

369
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:38,940
Then, you're for...

370
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,080
There is still plenty of time

371
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,540
so I came to see you.

372
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Mr. Gu.

373
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,670
Cheng has improved a lot.

374
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,400
In our team, she is the first to arrive

375
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,600
and the last to leave.

376
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,460
I think I have to learn from her.

377
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,260
Brother Qiao.

378
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,520
Two more passengers haven't arrived.

379
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,320
But the time is up.

380
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,670
Should we inform the captain about the shortage?

381
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,440
I will do it.

382
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,880
See you later.

383
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,820
Wait.

384
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,400
Let the plane wait a little longer, okay?

385
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,390
Wait for a while.

386
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,900
Are you Mr. Hu Guoping?

387
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,430
Yes.

388
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,680
I... I can't find my wife.

389
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,480
What happened?

390
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,580
After the security check,

391
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,980
we just kept walking ahead.

392
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,730
Later,

393
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:20,170
when I turned around, my wife suddenly disappeared.

394
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,010
Can you wait for us?

395
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,250
We'll help you find her.

396
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:23,820
But

397
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,580
the cabin door is closing soon.

398
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,780
The plane can't wait.

399
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,900
Young man, young lady.

400
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:31,510
Just wait for a moment, okay?

401
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,120
We won't delay you.

402
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,430
Just wait for a moment.

403
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,320
Please. Please.

404
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,120
Please!

405
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,540
Sir, I'm really sorry.

406
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,400
All the flights have their estimated take-off time.

407
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,360
Once we miss it, we'll need to wait for a long time.

408
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,270
It will also cause

409
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,690
a series of flight delays later.

410
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,090
Please understand that.

411
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,050
Cheng.

412
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,820
This old man is quite pitiful.

413
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,080
Do you know the captain on duty?

414
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,810
Should you discuss it with him?

415
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,070
But we can't waste everyone's time

416
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,400
because of a passenger.

417
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,080
What matters is we should find the person

418
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,290
and let them change the tickets as soon as possible.

419
00:29:59,290 --> 00:29:59,790
OK.

420
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,620
Sir.

421
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,800
Is your wife Zhang Jingya?

422
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,380
Yes.

423
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,120
Okay, I'll broadcast it for you again.

424
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,050
Okay, thank you.

425
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,260
Miss.

426
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,990
Forget it.

427
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,190
My wife

428
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,810
doesn't know her name.

429
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,040
What color are the clothes

430
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,120
she wears today?

431
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,040
This is my wife.

432
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:32,850
A purple shirt,

433
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
with purple shoes

434
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,610
and a basket of grapes in her hands.

435
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,540
Okay.

436
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,220
Sir.

437
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,710
Let me see.

438
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,740
Calm down.

439
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,080
I’ll find her at the airport.

440
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,810
Don't you have a plane to catch?

441
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,170
It's okay. Give me a walkie-talkie.

442
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,520
Keep in touch.

443
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:54,880
OK.

444
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,400
I'll look for her too.

445
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,220
Cheng.

446
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,200
Gate 72 in 20 minutes.

447
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,080
Don't forget the time.

448
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:01,480
Got it.

449
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,850
Please wait a moment, sir.

450
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,450
Thank you.

451
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,010
This is a broadcast looking for someone.

452
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,840
Ms. Zhang Jingya.

453
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,760
Your husband, Hu Guoping is looking for you.

454
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,840
Please go to Gate 73 immediately

455
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,250
after this broadcast.

456
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,350
Dear passengers,

457
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,760
if you see a woman in her sixties

458
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,800
wearing a purple shirt and purple shoes,

459
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,230
also holding grapes in her hands,

460
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,930
please contact the staff nearby.

461
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:28,520
Thank you for your help.

462
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,080
This is a broadcast looking for someone.

463
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,970
Ms. Zhang Jingya.

464
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,810
Your husband, Hu Guoping is looking for you.

465
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:45,970
Please go to Gate 73 immediately

466
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,400
after this broadcast.

467
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,010
Manman.

468
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,200
Are you mad at me again?

469
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:06,760
Well.

470
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,720
I found her.

471
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,090
She's in the amusement arcade of Zone C.

472
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,170
Take it.

473
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,000
Auntie,

474
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,600
I've told you many times.

475
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
I don't even know you.

476
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,320
You are my Manman.

477
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,670
I'm not.

478
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,240
Why not?

479
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:18,900
Ms. Zhang.

480
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:21,010
Hello, do you know this lady?

481
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:22,310
Can you take her away?

482
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,650
I have a flight to catch.

483
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,140
Sorry to bother you.

484
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,910
Manman, my son.

485
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,090
Auntie Zhang, he's not your son.

486
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,110
He is not your son.

487
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,630
He is my son.

488
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
He's my son, Manman.

489
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:39,720
Auntie Zhang.

490
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,880
He's really not your son.

491
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,150
Please help me find him.

492
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,070
-Help me get him back.
-Auntie Zhang.

493
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,430
Get up.

494
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,180
Jingya!

495
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:49,440
Look.

496
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,080
Thank you.

497
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,200
It's okay.

498
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,100
Jingya.

499
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,880
How many times have I told you?

500
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,690
Our son is not there.

501
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,250
He's in Shenzhen.

502
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
Did you forget again?

503
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,980
Didn't we agree

504
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,870
to visit him in Shenzhen today?

505
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:05,760
I didn't bring any tissues.

506
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,660
Your clothes.

507
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,410
Nothing.

508
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,760
Uncle, please wipe it for her.

509
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,720
Here, wipe it.

510
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,590
Where are my grapes?

511
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,430
Your hands.

512
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,720
I...

513
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,650
Auntie.

514
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,680
It's rotten.

515
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,450
Our grapes are all rotten.

516
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,200
We don't want them anymore, okay?

517
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,730
We don't want them anymore.

518
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:27,250
We are going to celebrate Manman's birthday.

519
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:27,720
Yeah.

520
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,420
My son loves grapes.

521
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,340
I want to bring them to him.

522
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:35,620
Okay.

523
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,940
I'll pick one.

524
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,610
Go ahead.

525
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,360
Here.

526
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,520
Slowly.

527
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,630
Sir.

528
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,220
Sir.

529
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,960
You've found your wife.

530
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,740
Moreover, you're going to celebrate your son's birthday soon.

531
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,900
You should be happy.

532
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:06,790
Miss.

533
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,350
What birthday?

534
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,239
It's his death anniversary.

535
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,949
We only have one son.

536
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,320
When he was 18,

537
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:18,820
he left us

538
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,860
to work in Shenzhen

539
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,389
and never came back.

540
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,100
In the house he rented,

541
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,960
he got gas poisoning

542
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:30,960
and left.

543
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,659
In a blink of an eye,

544
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,860
20 years have passed.

545
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,620
After my son left,

546
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,520
my wife couldn't accept the fact.

547
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,340
Especially in the past two years,

548
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,010
her brain

549
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,620
was getting worse.

550
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:51,699
She couldn't remember things.

551
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,830
She still thought our son was working in Shenzhen

552
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,260
and insisted on a visit to Shenzhen

553
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,280
to celebrate our son's birthday.

554
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,940
I'm sorry.

555
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,460
Have you decided?

556
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,560
Wipe your hands. Come on.

557
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,100
The next flight is boarding soon.

558
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,050
I'll take them

559
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,510
to change their tickets.

560
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:18,370
Go back to work.

561
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,360
Your clothes...

562
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,320
It's okay.

563
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,830
I'll leave him to you.

564
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,090
Let me take you two to change your tickets.

565
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,450
He said he'll take us to the plane. Let's go.

566
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,370
I'll start the broadcast.

567
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,030
Hello, passengers.

568
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,960
Passengers of Luzhou Airlines

569
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,950
flight XD8155

570
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,090
to Beijing, please pay attention.

571
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,520
The flight you're taking is now boarding.

572
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,360
Please take your belongings

573
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,790
and line up at Gate 72.

574
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,160
I've read the report.

575
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,720
Your Maintenance Department

576
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,860
did a good job

577
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,650
in assuring the safety target last year.

578
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,810
I didn't do it alone.

579
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,780
It's the effort of all engineers.

580
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,400
-Welcome aboard.
-Thank you.

581
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,330
Welcome aboard.

582
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm going to discuss Civil Aviation Maintenance

583
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,530
under Internet and Big Data

584
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,410
in the next Civil Aviation Forum.

585
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,730
We can discuss this with our peers by then.

586
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,140
OK.

587
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:31,340
Welcome aboard.

588
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,140
Hello, Mr. Xu.

589
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:32,800
Hello.

590
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,060
Welcome aboard.

591
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,860
Hello, Mr. Ni.

592
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,440
The girl who just said hello to you

593
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,790
is the female pilot transferred from the Freight Department to the Passenger Transport Department.

594
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,270
Are you talking about the female pilot, Cheng Xiao?

595
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,560
Yes.

596
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,160
Why is she here?

597
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,770
I heard Mr. Jiang

598
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,720
transferred her to the Ground Handling Department.

599
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,860
What can a pilot

600
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,220
learn in the Ground Handling Department?

601
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,710
[Baggage Check-in]

602
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,640
I'm at counter D11,

603
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,650
wearing a grey suit.

604
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,120
Thank you.

605
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,580
Sir, your tickets.

606
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,780
OK.

607
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:13,970
Thank you.

608
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,900
You're welcome.

609
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,720
Take it.

610
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,750
Uncle, auntie.

611
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,160
I chose the first row of economy class for you.

612
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,090
It is more spacious and less noisy.

613
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,280
Look at it, the first row. How nice.

614
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,690
Young man, thank you for your hard work.

615
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,650
You’re welcome.

616
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,000
Mr. Gu, right?

617
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,360
Yes.

618
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,370
These are the grapes and the shirt you ordered.

619
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:36,730
Okay.

620
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,060
This is a free gift.

621
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,040
Thank you. Thank you.

622
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,000
That's not ours.

623
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:42,380
Here you are.

624
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:44,110
I bought it for you.

625
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,430
Take it.

626
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,530
Look at my wife.

627
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,640
Give it to me.

628
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,420
-Let go! Let go!
-No.

629
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,930
Young man, this is for you.

630
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,810
No.

631
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:57,520
Take it.

632
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,950
I can't take this. I really can't take it.

633
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,990
If you don't take it,

634
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,690
we won't dare to take the grapes.

635
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:02,490
Here, take it.

636
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,930
You're welcome.

637
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,060
How about this?

638
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,520
I'll take the grapes. I can't take the money.

639
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:11,390
Young man,

640
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,820
if my son were still alive,

641
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,860
he would be your age.

642
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:20,620
Here.

643
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,620
Come on.

644
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,270
Auntie, let me help you.

645
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,950
No need.

646
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,520
Come on. Lead the way. Lead the way.

647
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,460
This way.

648
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,030
Okay.

649
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,650
Passengers of Luzhou Airlines

650
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,410
flight XD8155

651
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,490
to Beijing, please pay attention.

652
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,610
Your flight is about to take off.

653
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,920
Please board at Gate 72 as soon as possible.

654
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,540
Thank you.

655
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,320
Welcome aboard.

656
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:54,850
Done.

657
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,440
The old man

658
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,700
asked me to give you this

659
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,300
as a token of appreciation to the ground staff.

660
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:06,600
Thank you for your hard work today.

661
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,090
Welcome aboard.

662
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:08,830
Bye.

663
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:17,930
Welcome aboard.

664
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,830
Welcome aboard.

665
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,310
Welcome aboard.

666
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,460
Cheng.

667
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,640
How is it? Is it okay here?

668
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:31,890
Have you got used to it?

669
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:32,690
I'm very fine.

670
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:33,850
I've learned a lot.

671
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,570
Good mindset.

672
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,350
Then continue to study here.

673
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,110
Okay.

674
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:43,120
I won’t let you down.

675
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,480
Mr. Jiang.

676
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,540
Let me ask you something.

677
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,830
Why is the female pilot in your department

678
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,290
working at the Ground Handling Department?

679
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:10,860
It's Cheng Xiao.

680
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:13,170
A while ago,

681
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,830
three complaints letters

682
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,950
were all related to her.

683
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,140
It doesn't make sense.

684
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,550
So I sent her to the Ground Handling Department

685
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,470
and let her study for a while

686
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,150
so that she could fully realize

687
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,610
the mistakes she had made.

688
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,550
But what can a pilot

689
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,040
learn from the Ground Handling Department?

690
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,500
Mr. Jiang.

691
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,960
We can’t assign pilots

692
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:38,320
who the company pays a high price to train at will.

693
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:42,290
My arrangement is a bit inappropriate.

694
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,560
I'll send her back in two days.

695
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,020
Okay, get it done as soon as possible.

696
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:13,590
Xiaoxiao.

697
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,330
Dad.

698
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:15,920
I have a morning shift today.

699
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,580
I can get off work around five.

700
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,780
Sure.

701
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,730
What do you want to eat? I'll buy some groceries.

702
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,680
Stop buying.

703
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,740
I'll treat you to dinner.

704
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,610
Ask mum to come along.

705
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,810
Can your mum come along?

706
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,140
It's been a long time

707
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,740
since we had a meal together.

708
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,770
Let's eat together.

709
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,130
Great!

710
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
You pack up first.

711
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,860
I'll pick you up after work.

712
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,720
Okay.

713
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:43,890
Goodbye.

714
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:44,950
Bye.
