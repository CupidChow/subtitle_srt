[Episode 26]

4
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,120
Well,

5
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,020
where should I keep the key?

6
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,050
No need.

7
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,830
I'll change the lock.

8
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,090
Brother Zhan, thank you.

9
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:59,090
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

10
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,150
I really want to rip you off.

11
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,040
You owe me.

12
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:04,800
I have to go back to the hangar.

13
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,330
We have to stay up late because of a tough task.

14
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,360
Why do you always stay up late?

15
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,900
It's bad for your health.

16
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:12,850
That's what I do. I'm used to it.

17
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,710
Besides,

18
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,140
I have to strive for

19
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,850
the vice president position of the company.

20
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,220
Are you and Mr. Gu

21
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,710
serious this time?

22
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,540
Of course.

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,900
He has his dreams and I have my ambitions.

24
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,240
What?

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,740
Are you afraid of me losing

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,030
or Nanting?

27
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,930
Sure enough.

28
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,670
You are frenemies.

29
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:40,020
Fair competition won't hurt our relationship.

30
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:40,750
Don't worry.

31
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,100
I'm leaving.

32
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:43,820
Okay.

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,770
Bye. Thank you.

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,350
Goodbye, Mr. Ni. Goodbye.

35
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,650
Bye.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,579
Bye. Bye.

37
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,750
I'll shut it. Go ahead.

38
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,390
It's okay.

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
It's been two days. But it feels like

40
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,810
there's no progress.

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,460
This is really...

42
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,000
The flight was delayed last night, right?

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,730
Why don't you go home and sleep?

44
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,500
I'll go back after eating.

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,120
The efficiency of your Flight Department

46
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
is too low.

47
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,530
It's been two days.

48
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,910
You haven't rehabilitated Xiao yet.

49
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:50,950
I think

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,840
the higher-ups want to

51
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,260
settle this by leaving it unsettled.

52
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,850
How can we investigate

53
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:57,990
the hearsay on the Internet?

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,720
Who would spread rumours here for no reason?

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,180
Well...

56
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,530
The suspect must be

57
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,850
one of Xiao's enemies.

58
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:07,870
I didn't hear anyone has a grudge against Xiao.

59
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,770
It may not be against Cheng Xiao.

60
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,640
This matter also has a great impact

61
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,970
on Brother Nanting and Mr. Ni.

62
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,600
Don't let it affect their promotion to vice president.

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,590
Could it be

64
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,660
Mr. Jiang?

65
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,990
How dare you make up stories about your boss?

66
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,520
I think

67
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,190
there's someone else.

68
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:38,920
-Who?
-Who?

69
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,010
Do you mean this?

70
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,770
It is possible.

71
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,730
But in theory,

72
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,260
I should be the one Qi Yu hates the most.

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,460
Although that rumor also involves me,

74
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,460
it doesn't seem to be targeting me.

75
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,070
Wait for me.

76
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,830
Okay.

77
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,730
Coming.

78
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,160
Xia, Yuheng.

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,840
Our handsome Captain Song is here too.

80
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,170
No, no, no, I am not the captain.

81
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,500
I'm only a junior pilot.

82
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,170
Is your hand recovered?

83
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:30,790
Yes.

84
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,930
Today is the first day of flying.

85
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,050
Xiazhi.

86
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,860
I haven't officially apologized to you.

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,159
I was angry that day

88
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:41,700
and caused you suffering.

89
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:42,940
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,360
Don't say that, Qi Yu.

91
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,409
It's all about work.

92
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,980
It's good that you've made it clear.

93
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,270
Qi Yu,

94
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:55,770
are you still blaming me for what happened that day?

95
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,440
Of course.

96
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,610
I was demoted from a trainee chief flight attendant.

97
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,470
I was really angry that day.

98
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,690
But when I got home, I figured it out.

99
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,920
I was too muddleheaded

100
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,580
to argue with the passengers.

101
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Yuheng, you actually helped me.

102
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,240
Otherwise,

103
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,180
if I made a bigger mistake that day,

104
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,120
it would be too late to regret.

105
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,830
Qi Yu, what you said...

106
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,410
Yuheng.

107
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,040
You performed well and were promoted at a fast pace.

108
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,170
I may be demoted now,

109
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,830
but when I am promoted to chief flight attendant,

110
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,430
I'm definitely ahead of you.

111
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,270
Don't be jealous.

112
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,710
Of course not.

113
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,270
Enjoy your meal.

114
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,080
I'm leaving.

115
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,850
Do you think

116
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,580
it is her?

117
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
Don't touch that.

118
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,850
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,250
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,380
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,650
It's okay.

122
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,250
Sorry.

123
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,040
I have a loud voice.

124
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,760
You may work on something else.

125
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,360
Sorry.

126
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,010
I heard from Nanting

127
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,980
you've been doing well lately.

128
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,680
You're really good.

129
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,500
Brother Nanting

130
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,300
has been encouraging me at work.

131
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,170
And my leaders and colleagues at the Cabin Service Department

132
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,830
have been helping me.

133
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,870
But take care of yourself.

134
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,570
You look slimmer.

135
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,400
I've been flying international flights lately.

136
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,860
I always have jet lag,

137
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,640
so I can't sleep quite well.

138
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,510
I heard that

139
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,870
you rented a house with your colleagues.

140
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,630
I wanted to live alone before.

141
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,450
But

142
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,260
a house with a suitable location and condition

143
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,530
is really hard to find.

144
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,210
Nanting has a house.

145
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,750
His tenant just moved out.

146
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,420
You can move to his place.

147
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,000
Can I?

148
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,430
Of course.

149
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,030
The house is empty.

150
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,790
But let's make a deal.

151
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,920
I won't accept your rent.

152
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,400
It's too kind of you.

153
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,100
I must pay the rent.

154
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:21,110
We watched you grow up.

155
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:21,880
How can we

156
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,390
accept your rent with this relationship?

157
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,110
Thank you, auntie.

158
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,620
But I must pay the rent.

159
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,030
Otherwise, I won't move there.

160
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,800
Look.

161
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,360
I'll give you a 50% discount.

162
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,120
It's settled. You can't argue anymore.

163
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,180
Thank you, auntie.

164
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,930
Here, have some coffee.

165
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,520
We were just talking about it.

166
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,640
Didn't your tenant just move out?

167
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,080
Xiao Yu wants to rent a house.

168
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,540
Let her live in your house.

169
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:46,170
You...

170
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,180
don't live with Xiazhi anymore?

171
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,410
We often don't fly together.

172
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,190
We tend to disturb each other.

173
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,170
Auntie Qin said

174
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,320
you could rent that house to me.

175
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,710
I think it is a good idea.

176
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,250
After all, it's not easy to find a house now.

177
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,270
Let me help you find a place.

178
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:09,820
Mom.

179
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,180
I don't want to rent that place

180
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,530
for the time being.

181
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,120
Why?

182
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,840
It's okay, Brother Nanting.

183
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,440
Don't bother.

184
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,760
I'll continue to

185
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,760
stay with Xiazhi.

186
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:30,890
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,910
I'll get some tissues.

188
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,180
What's going on?

189
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,870
Maybe

190
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,450
the last tenant

191
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,760
was too impressive to Brother Nanting.

192
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,410
The last tenant...

193
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,180
Polly.

194
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,090
Take off your jewelry.

195
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,420
Wearing it won't affect my operation.

196
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,240
The company also doesn't have rules stating I can't wear it.

197
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,970
It is my rule.

198
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,220
Please take it off.

199
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,240
Don't you have a pocket?

200
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,170
Zhang.

201
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,170
Yes, it's me.

202
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,770
I want to ask you a favor.

203
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,420
Didn't I rent my house out?

204
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,850
The tenant canceled the lease a few days ago.

205
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:03,430
I suddenly recalled something that I need to contact her about.

206
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,530
I can't remember her name.

207
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:08,570
Right.

208
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,770
Cheng Xiao, yes.

209
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:17,350
OK.

210
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,080
Okay, thank you.

211
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,710
[Cheng]

212
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,800
This girl...

213
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,640
I saw her

214
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,590
when I was in Xi'an last time.

215
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,250
You said she was your student.

216
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,670
Yes, her name is Cheng Xiao.

217
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,360
Cheng Xiao.

218
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,240
Are you two close?

219
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,330
No, mom, you think too much.

220
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,310
What did I think?

221
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:04,310
[One week later]

222
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,670
Hello.

223
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:20,840
Hello, Mr. Gu.

224
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,170
I'm Chen on flight duty.

225
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Captain Fan of

226
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,280
flight 8273 to Xi'an

227
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,620
suddenly had diarrhea and took a sick leave.

228
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,410
8273?

229
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,180
Yes, at 8:30 p.m.

230
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,000
Hold on.

231
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,650
Let me check those who are off today.

232
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,930
[Cheng Xiao]

233
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,430
How about this?

234
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,090
I'll take this flight.

235
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,050
Mr. Gu.

236
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,300
Cheng Xiao will take this flight.

237
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,600
You asked us

238
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:02,640
to minimize...

239
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,400
The situation is special today.

240
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,120
Those who are off are not qualified to lead the flying.

241
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,720
I'll do it.

242
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,190
Captain Fan hasn't arrived yet.

243
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,970
Is it okay?

244
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,370
I think so.

245
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:55,990
Captain Fan is not feeling well.

246
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,190
I'll take over today.

247
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,690
Let's get started.

248
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,360
Glad to fly with you guys.

249
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,130
Flight XD8273

250
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,350
from Luzhou to Xi'an.

251
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,570
Drink the coffee quickly. Don't spill it.

252
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:37,430
It's not for me.

253
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,350
I'm not drinking it, thanks.

254
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,830
It's not for you either.

255
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:49,730
Captains.

256
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,990
The plane is in good condition. There has no retention breakdown.

257
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,140
Brother Fan, come on.

258
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,140
Have some coffee.

259
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you.

260
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,030
How embarrassing it is.

261
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,030
Don't mention it.

262
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:01,530
Sign this.

263
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,580
Captain Cheng,

264
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,870
you are as meticulous

265
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,190
as Brother Zhan.

266
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,670
If the plane is in good condition,

267
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,870
we're ready to board.

268
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:16,840
Yes, captain.

269
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,940
I've been working night shifts lately.

270
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,220
I'm losing all my hair.

271
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,600
Just think that you have saved the shampoo.

272
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,010
Get ready.

273
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,190

You're welcome.

Brother Fan,

300
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,170
I want to go to the bathroom.

301
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,060
Go ahead. I'm watching.

302
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:31,850
I'm going.

303
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,710
Start the auxiliary power unit.

304
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,900
Inform the ground.

305
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,410
Now we got something to work on.

306
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:56,920
What happened?

307
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,330
Why does the light turn dark?

308
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,650
Please calm down and sit down.

309
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:02,900
Why is the power off?

310
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,140
The auxiliary power unit hasn't been activated yet.

311
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,270
Why is the power off?

312
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:08,820
Please don't panic.

313
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,260
Ladies and gentlemen,

314
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,890
here is the captain speaking.

315
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,090
Please stay where you are and calm down.

316
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,720
The power supply is on.

317
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:20,850
It'll be back soon.

318
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm sorry for the trouble.

319
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,420
Thank you for understanding.

320
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,520
The cabin is now in a mess.

321
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,990
Wang Fan didn't answer the phone.

322
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,890
What's wrong, Brother Fan?

323
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,480
Hurry up and turn on the power. Hurry up.

324
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,100
Keep calm.

325
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,980
The power is back on.

326
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,010
It's connected.

327
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,100
It's useless now.

328
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:55,960
The plane has worked on

329
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,490
the power supply by the auxiliary power unit.

330
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,960
Sorry, captain.

331
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,510
What happened just now?

332
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,370
Why did you remove the ground power supply

333
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,750
without the crew's permission?

334
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,700
Sorry, captain.

335
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,130
I made a mistake.

336
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,490
Do you know that

337
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,620
this affects not only the aircraft but also the passengers?

338
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,410
It will make them feel insecure, you know?

339
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,070
I know.

340
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,620
I'm really sorry.

341
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:15,500
Captain,

342
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,360
after resetting the power,

343
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,530
there may be a lot of malfunction information in the plane.

344
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,190
We need to restart the system.

345
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,230
I'll ask my colleague to come over and hand it over to him.

346
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,830
Hand over?

347
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,260
What's wrong with you?

348
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,390
I'll call my colleagues immediately.

349
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,590
Please wait a moment.

350
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,840
Wang Fan made a mistake

351
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,230
and frightened the passengers today.

352
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:40,220
We must report this to the company.

353
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:42,210
But,

354
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,520
in this case,

355
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,280
isn't it enough to report

356
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,000
to the maintenance control center?

357
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,200
No need to report it to the company.

358
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,200
It's about the safety of the flight. We must report it.

359
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:51,650
Wait.

360
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,140
Wait for me.

361
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,380
Cheng Xiao.

362
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,650
Brother Zhan.

363
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,500
Wang Fan cut off the power in advance

364
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,760
before communicating with the cockpit.

365
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,550
Which aircraft stand are you in?

366
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,810
Aircraft stand No.43.

367
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,290
There was a power outage in the cabin.

368
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,730
There was no major breakdown.

369
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:14,920
But logically speaking,

370
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,980
in this situation,

371
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,350
we may have to report to the company.

372
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,350
Who is the leader?

373
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,440
Mr. Gu.

374
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,960
Let him answer the phone.

375
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:28,960
OK.

376
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Is it that severe?

377
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,760
The whole plane had a power outage for two minutes.

378
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,840
Just now, even the system failure popped up.

379
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,640
You tell me if it is severe or not.

380
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,650
The maintenance control center

381
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,780
will criticize him.

382
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,250
Only dealing internally

383
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:51,880
in your maintenance control center,

384
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,160
the warning effect is not enough.

385
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,020
We must report this to the company

386
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,360
to prevent this from happening again.

387
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,940
Let's talk in person. I'll be right there.

388
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,000
Liu, send me to aircraft stand No.43.

389
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,700
OK.

390
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,050
Actually, there's no rule that

391
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,840
issues with this level must be reported

392
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,950
to the company.

393
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,720
Once it is reported to the company,

394
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,320
Brother Fan may be suspended

395
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,210
or even get fired.

396
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,480
Don't be emotional at work.

397
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,700
I know you are close to the Maintenance Department.

398
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,520
But if something like this happens,

399
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,000
it must be highly valued to prevent future troubles.

400
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,260
As the future captain,

401
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,460
any compromise

402
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,800
is a failure.

403
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,040
Hello.

404
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,040
Are you the security manager on duty?

405
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
This is the crew from flight XD8273.

406
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,510
According to Luzhou Airlines's rules,

407
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,600
abnormal cases should be reported immediately.

408
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,400
I'll report what just happened.

409
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,650
Captain.

410
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,850
The second check is done. Everything is fine.

411
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,660
OK.

412
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,270
Are you okay? Brother Fan.

413
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:11,800
I'm fine.

414
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
What happened to your foot?

415
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,220
Brother Zhan.

416
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,080
Sit down first.

417
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,380
Brother Zhan.

418
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,240
What happened?

419
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,750
I fell accidentally

420
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,940
and brought the power line down.

421
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,380
Go to the infirmary first.

422
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,710
I'll talk to Captain Gu.

423
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:28,960
Brother Zhan.

424
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:30,230
No matter what,

425
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,580
it's all my fault.

426
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,800
The captain is supposed to scold me.

427
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,710
Get in the car.

428
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,570
Wu and I are here. Come on.

429
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,060
Let's go.

430
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,360
No.

431
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,550
Wu, thank you.

432
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,380
Be careful, Brother Fan.

433
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,440
Please fasten your seat belts.

434
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,060
Tell me.

435
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,720
Why the power went out just now?

436
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,400
I'm sorry.

437
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,960
Yes.

438
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,060
What's wrong with your plane?

439
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,480
Why is the power out so suddenly?

440
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,240
Captain.

441
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,650
The passengers are worried.

442
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,160
They want to know why the power went out.

443
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,400
I'm afraid they might be upset

444
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
and don't trust our flight anymore.

445
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
I'll explain to them.

446
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:05,850
Wait.

447
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:08,460
You explain the flight principles to passengers,

448
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,990
but they won't understand.

449
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,460
What do you think we should do?

450
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,650
Use this.

451
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,800
You must tell me the reason.

452
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,480
The captain is here.

453
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,610
The captain is here.

454
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
Good evening, everyone.

455
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,250
I'm the captain of this flight.

456
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,040
Due to some minor accidents,

457
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,690
you guys are troubled

458
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:38,900
and shocked.

459
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
I'm really sorry.

460
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:43,570
Let me explain

461
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,920
what happened just now.

462
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,150
Look at the flashlight in my hand.

463
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,600
Let's pretend it is the plane.

464
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,470
The engine is equivalent to this battery.

465
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,330
Usually when the plane is on the ground,

466
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,740
we don't supply the power

467
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,250
but connect external power wires.

468
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,820
It's to save fuel.

469
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,260
Just like this charging wire.

470
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,510
But the external power line was broken by accident.

471
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,860
However, there is

472
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,760
a backup power supply on the plane.

473
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,820
It's called an auxiliary power unit.

474
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:24,170
Just like this power bank.

475
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,640
Nonetheless,

476
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,400
it takes some time

477
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,800
to activate the auxiliary power unit.

478
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,640
So we made you wait for a while

479
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:30,870
in the dark.

480
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:32,330
Now our plane

481
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,440
is fine now.

482
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,480
Just like this flashlight.

483
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,300
Our engineers from Maintenance Department

484
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,070
have just done a full check.

485
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,890
The plane is fine,

486
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,240
and it won't affect the flight.

487
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,120
Don't worry.

488
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,510
You should have said that earlier.

489
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,060
It's okay.

490
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,930
Please trust me

491
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,550
and all the crew members.

492
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,180
We will send all of you

493
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:00,510
to the destination safely.

494
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,940
Thank you for understanding.

495
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,250
Now you may take a rest.

496
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,360
We will be able to take off soon.

497
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,170
Brother Zhan.

498
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,760
I'll be in charge of your clearance on behalf of Wang Fan.

499
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,160
He went to the infirmary.

500
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
What happened to him?

501
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,710
He hurt his foot.

502
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,540
XD8273.

503
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,390
Your expected take-off time is in five minutes.

504
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,590
Ready for the report.

505
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,950
Roger that, XD8273.

506
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,420
Let's talk about Wang Fan later.

507
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,980
I'm going to close the cabin door and hang the tow truck.

508
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,510
Nanting.

509
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,550
Don't report it to the company first.

510
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,550
We'll discuss it when you come back.

511
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,120
It was already reported.

512
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,550
The maintenance control center will decide

513
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,980
whether to report or not.

514
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,560
Do you have a problem with me

515
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
or the Maintenance Department?

516
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,430
I have no grudges against the Maintenance Department.

517
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,430
I just take the matter on its merits.

518
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:11,830
I'll talk to you later.

519
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,190
Brother Zhan.

520
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,320
Why are you here in the hospital? What happened?

521
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,220
The doctor said

522
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,830
my ankle

523
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,550
might have a fracture.

524
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,370
A fracture?

525
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,020
Is it that serious?

526
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,770
That's his condition.

527
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,870
He needs surgery immediately.

528
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,420
Are you his family?

529
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,920
This is our leader.

530
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,210
Isn't your family coming?

531
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,650
It's late.

532
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,640
They're already asleep.

533
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,380
Let's talk to them tomorrow.

534
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:32,890
[Xi'an Xianyang International Airport]

535
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,450
Wang Fan is having bone fracture surgery.

536
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,580
Brother Zhan said

537
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,740
he was trying to reach his earphones, not to cut off the power.

538
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,340
But he slipped on the way

539
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,820
and tripped over the wire.

540
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,740
Start the auxiliary power unit.

541
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,940
Inform the ground.

542
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,960
Now we got something to work on.

543
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,480
Wang Fan didn't answer the phone.

544
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,280
What's wrong with Brother Fan?

545
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,560
Anyway,

546
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,710
it's all my fault.

547
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,950
Captain Gu should be angry.

548
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:23,580
If he wants to report it to the company,

549
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,940
I can understand that.

550
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,200
Brother Zhan.

551
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,850
You don't have to plead for me.

552
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,180
Wang Fan.

553
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:57,990
It's OK.

554
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,880
Don't think about that.

555
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,490
I'll sleep with you

556
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,400
tonight.

557
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,360
Mr. Gu.

558
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,700
I was the security manager on duty yesterday.

559
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,830
Regarding Wang Fan,

560
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,140
I need further information from you.

561
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,380
At that time, Wang Fan caused the power outage

562
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,820
because he fell accidentally.

563
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,550
I'm also responsible for this.

564
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
I didn't notice him falling right away.

565
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,520
The quality control of the whole flight

566
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,780
is not perfect enough.

567
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,280
As the pilot-in-command,

568
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,340
I should take on most of the responsibilities.

569
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,140
Got it, Mr. Gu.

570
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,480
We will follow the company rules

571
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,560
and exercise discretion in light of the circumstances of Wang Fan.

572
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,160
But Mr. Gu,

573
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,720
if you take on most of the responsibilities,

574
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,920
your performance will be deducted in full.

575
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,850
You may also need to be criticized.

576
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:23,870
Follow the rules.

577
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:24,830
Thank you.

578
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:29,850
Nanting.

579
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:46,590
Wang Fan is my brother.

580
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,980
For the sake of our relationship,

581
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,440
you shouldn't be so harsh.

582
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,500
I'm sorry

583
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,350
for Wang Fan.

584
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,560
But I won't be lenient

585
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,650
just because he's your subordinate.

586
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,000
This is a typical case.

587
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,940
We should look into the unsafe factors.

588
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,340
That's why I reported it.

589
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,330
Wang Fan fractured his bone.

590
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,860
He is lying in the hospital.

591
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,400
Do you know his family situation?

592
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,060
His wife is a full-time housewife.

593
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,190
He has two children.

594
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,800
He's already pretty hard up.

595
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,090
Now he can't work for three months.

596
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,010
According to our system,

597
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,510
we would deduct his bonus for three months,

598
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,570
demote him and cut his salary by half.

599
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,050
Isn't that enough?

600
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,260
But because of your report,

601
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,740
he may be fired.

602
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,310
I'm sorry.

603
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,790
This matter

604
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,430
will circulate a notice of criticism.

605
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:40,670
The performance of the entire Maintenance Department

606
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,680
will be affected.

607
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,320
Just because of your report.

608
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,950
You didn't mean to report it, did you?

609
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,140
There are three months left before

610
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,390
the vice president's election.

611
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,240
Any mistake between you and me

612
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,500
may affect

613
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
the final result.

614
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,520
Ni Zhan.

615
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,800
We've known each other for more than ten years.

616
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,560
I thought no one was more clear about

617
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,400
what kind of person I am than you.

618
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,480
I thought

619
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,050
I knew you very well too.

620
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,340
But now,

621
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,600
sometimes I feel that you're strange to me.

622
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,170
You were hurt to this state.

623
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,800
The pilots flew away without a word like that.

624
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,570
Earning such a high salary,

625
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,030
they don't know what we've suffered.

626
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,110
Don't talk nonsense.

627
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,680
I fell on my own.

628
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,820
It has nothing to do with others.

629
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,940
Why did they report it to the company if there's nothing to do with them?

630
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,380
It's not the first time.

631
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,540
Last time, one of them

632
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,300
braked late.

633
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,640
The plane slipped a bit forward.

634
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,470
Eventually, the maintenance team was accused of giving the wrong command.

635
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:32,900
It's not the same.

636
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,960
Captain Gu is here.

637
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,730
Wang Fan.

638
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:45,550
I'm here to visit you.

639
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:48,170
Thank you, Captain Gu. Sorry to make you spend so much money.

640
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:48,660
It's OK.

641
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,410
Let me do it.

642
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,090
How was the surgery?

643
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,450
It went well.

644
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,120
I'm waiting to recover.

645
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,560
Have a seat, Captain Gu.

646
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,250
OK.

647
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,370
Brother Fan.

648
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,800
Captain Cheng is here.

649
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,340
I brought you something.

650
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,440
Thank you.

651
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,490
You see, my falling

652
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,680
caused you so much trouble.

653
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,160
Not at all.

654
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:30,920
I'm sorry.

655
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,470
My wife doesn't know the details.

656
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,890
Don't care about it.

657
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,130
It's not her fault.

658
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,780
You got hurt because of work.

659
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,510
Your family should be worried.

660
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,260
Brother Fan, how's your surgery?

661
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,270
It went well.

662
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,790
I'll be fine after a few days of hospitalization

663
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,300
and recovering at home.

664
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,850
Captain Gu,

665
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,770
I sincerely apologize

666
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,360
for what happened this time.

667
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,820
It's indeed because I fell

668
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,540
and tripped over the power line.

669
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,500
Anyway,

670
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,150
my mistake

671
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,750
caused the passengers to feel shocked.

672
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:08,610
Regarding the report to the company,

673
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:11,310
I hope you can understand.

674
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:12,960
Of course I understand.

675
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:15,850
Actually,

676
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,630
Mr. Gu has told the Security Department.

677
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,490
Don't worry about anything else.

678
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,160
Have a good rest.

679
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:25,910
Sure.

680
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,620
Okay.

681
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,900
Have a rest. I'm leaving.

682
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,760
Take care.

683
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,810
Mind your step, Captain Gu.

684
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:49,280
Captain Gu looks cold,

685
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,240
but he's actually very caring.
