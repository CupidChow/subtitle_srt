00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,450
Does it smell good?

177
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,860
Smell it again.

178
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,720
You...

179
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,180
You used Yuheng's perfume secretly.

180
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,440
I didn't.

181
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,120
How did you know it was Yuheng's perfume?

182
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,920
Of course I know.

183
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,260
I smelled so hard that my nose almost broke

184
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,420
to pick this one.

185
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,880
Were you the one who gave it to her?

186
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,510
Of course. How can you use it?

187
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,480
Why?

188
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,150
Yuheng gave it to me.

189
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,160
She...

190
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,820
She gave it to you?

191
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,640
Don't tell me you have an ulterior motive towards Yuheng.

192
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,990
I knew it.

193
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,560
It took you so long

194
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,890
for fixing the water leak.

195
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:49,900
Are we

196
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,180
exposing ourselves to danger?

197
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:05,300
I was just kidding.

198
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,110
Don't take it seriously.

199
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,530
Give me back my perfume.

200
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,480
Fine.

201
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,740
What are you doing?

202
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,800
I'll throw it away.

203
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,720
Don't pour it. It's a waste.

204
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,680
Give it to me.

205
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,610
My eyes.

206
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,800
Sorry, I didn't mean it.

207
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,880
Slow down.

208
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,160
Here.

209
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:35,110
Here.

210
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,440
Let me get you some pure water.

211
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,840
This tap water will stimulate your eyes.

212
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,070
Go away.

213
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,350
Where is my towel?

214
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,800
Here.

215
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,290
Xiazhi.

216
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm sorry.

217
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,090
I was too emotional just now.

218
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,740
This perfume.

219
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,080
You take it.

220
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,500
Buy me a new one.

221
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,250
Okay, I'll buy it later.

222
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:02,990
Actually,

223
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,280
I really like Yuheng.

224
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,520
Did I use the wrong way?

225
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,250
It doesn't matter what method you use.

226
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,109
What matters is

227
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,470
you want to compete with Mr. Gu.

228
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,339
Brother Nanting told me

229
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,270
he didn't like Yuheng.

230
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,280
What?

231
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,750
Really?

232
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:27,329
Brother Nanting likes someone else.

233
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,870
Who?

234
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,580
I can't tell you.

235
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,200
Who is it? Tell me.

236
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,820
I really can't tell you.

237
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,840
Don't ask.

238
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,790
I hate people like you who talk half only.

239
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,330
Who is it?

240
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,710
I really can't tell you.

241
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:21,950
We'll take the same flight today.

242
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,560
Let me do it.

243
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,190
Song said

244
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,660
the talk show was good yesterday.

245
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,090
What talk show?

246
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,720
Didn't you go?

247
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,580
Instructor Gu,

248
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,630
if you really heard it from Song,

249
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,760
how could he not mention me went or not?

250
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,070
Song.

251
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,640
Put the computer away.

252
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,020
I have to hurry up.

253
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,820
You have a lot of flight tasks recently.

254
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,640
I changed my shift to fly with you.

255
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,600
There are several parts.

256
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
We need to communicate in detail to firm up.

257
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,920
We can do it when we land. It doesn't matter.

258
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,460
Instructor Gu,

259
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:49,760
since the new safety plan

260
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,090
needs manpower so much,

261
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,810
why don't you take me with you?

262
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,120
This job is hard and tiring.

263
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,440
We need to communicate with all departments

264
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,500
and there's no guarantee of results.

265
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,570
So challenging.

266
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,340
Then I must give a hand.

267
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,390
Your flight mission is too heavy. Forget it.

268
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,050
I can spare some resting time.

269
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,280
Just do your own thing during your rest.

270
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,300
Anything related to flying

271
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,360
is my own business.

272
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,860
Besides,

273
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,450
no one is dating me.

274
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,730
I'm free when I'm not flying.

275
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,800
Either you send me a boyfriend

276
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:24,560
or

277
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,780
let me join the safety plan.

278
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
Brother Nanting.

279
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,060
It's so hard. Is there any way

280
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,520
to be satisfactory to both parties?

281
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:42,470
Fine.

282
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,240
You can join.

283
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,520
But remember,

284
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,030
you must ensure enough rest.

285
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:11,390
Hello, Mr. Wei.

286
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,820
Here's your hot towel.

287
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,680
Here's your soda drink with ice. Enjoy.

288
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,730
Let's eat together after landing.

289
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,460
Sorry, Mr. Wei.

290
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,440
After landing,

291
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,050
I have other work schedules.

292
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,820
What a coincidence.

293
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,310
There's always something else.

294
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,260
After landing,

295
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,580
I'll wait for you at the exit.

296
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:04,350
Yuheng.

297
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,960
Why are you standing here?

298
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,490
Nothing, Brother Nanting.

299
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,240
You go back first.

300
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:10,740
I...

301
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,420
I'll go out later.

302
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,050
What's wrong?

303
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,020
Are you not feeling well?

304
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,760
It's Mr. Wei.

305
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,880
He said he would wait for me at the exit.

306
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,960
Yes.

307
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,960
The platinum card holder who testified for you last time.

308
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,360
Why is he waiting for you?

309
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
It's okay. Let's go out together.

310
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:34,840
Yes.

311
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,240
Tell him we're having a team dinner today

312
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,310
and reject him.

313
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,340
But even if I did,

314
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,360
he would still contact me next time.

315
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,800
In recent flights,

316
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,730
he would wait for me after landing.

317
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,130
Once,

318
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,500
he wanted to drive me home.

319
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,240
But he asked the driver to send me to a hotel.

320
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,460
Really?

321
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,990
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

322
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:57,400
I...

323
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,810
After I arrived at the hotel that day,

324
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,010
I went home directly.

325
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,090
I didn't answer his call after that.

326
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,570
How about this? Yuheng.

327
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,230
Tell him you have a boyfriend.

328
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,250
You're getting married soon.

329
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,210
This is also a way.

330
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,380
Okay.

331
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,720
I'll try.

332
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,130
Let's go.

333
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,370
I'll go with you.

334
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,370
Hello, Mr. Wei.

335
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:42,930
You're still here.

336
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,810
I said I would wait for you.

337
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,620
This is for you.

338
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,540
Sorry, I can't take it.

339
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,010
No worries. Come on.

340
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,340
I'm warning you.

341
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,670
Don't harass the flight attendant.

342
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,150
Song.

343
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,280
Sir,

344
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:04,000
aren't you a little rude?

345
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,490
What do you mean by harassment?

346
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,460
I heard you often send things to her

347
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,890
and even tried to take her to a hotel.

348
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:10,930
What do you call this if it is not harassment?

349
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,700
I like her.

350
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,800
I pursue the woman I like.

351
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:15,140
Is this harassment?

352
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,710
Yuheng, take this and let's go.

353
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,600
She has a boyfriend.

354
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,130
This is my boyfriend.

355
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,340
Ms. Li, you...

356
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:50,730
This is your fault.

357
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,740
Why didn't you tell me

358
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,970
you have a boyfriend?

359
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:54,850
I...

360
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,780
Sir.

361
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,530
There's no need for flight attendants

362
00:25:57,530 --> 00:26:00,260
to share their private life with the passengers.

363
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,770
Then why didn't you reject me?

364
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,360
That's because she was nice to you.

365
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,290
She doesn't want to embarrass you.

366
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:11,850
Fine.

367
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:14,240
Be polite to me.

368
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,370
Then why did you give me your flight account?

369
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,380
Is it for my pride?

370
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,000
I can't see through you.

371
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,090
You are neither friendly nor aloof to me.

372
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,220
I thought you were playing hard to get.

373
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,160
I didn't mean anything else.

374
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:35,060
Sir,

375
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,760
no matter what happened before,

376
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,180
now our flight attendant

377
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,380
has made it clear that

378
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:42,310
she has no intention to date you.

379
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,710
I want to hear it from her.

380
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,720
Yes, Mr. Wei.

381
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,290
Please take it back.

382
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:54,710
Thank you.

383
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:16,690
I'm sorry, Brother Nanting.

384
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,870
I was too anxious just now.

385
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,120
Please don't mind.

386
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:20,980
It's okay.

387
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,440
That's good, the issue is settled.

388
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,640
Don't worry about it.

389
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,050
Yuheng.

390
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,130
It's okay.

391
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,200
Let's go back.

392
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,990
It's right for you to report this.

393
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,280
After all,

394
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,410
he is a platinum cardholder of our company.

395
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:56,810
If he complains against you for any reason,

396
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,710
the result will affect you.

397
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,350
Mr. Wei helped me before.

398
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,480
I just wanted to be nice to him.

399
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,060
So, I didn't dare to reject him.

400
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,230
Ms. Ai,

401
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,840
did I really do something wrong?

402
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,520
Whether he really harassed you before,

403
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,560
we won't judge on this.

404
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,030
But Yuheng

405
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,040
neither accepts nor refuses.

406
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,390
There'll be a place for imagination for others.

407
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,810
It's not the only way

408
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,460
to repay others.

409
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,560
Being kind without principles

410
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,960
will only hurt yourself in the end.

411
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,690
Have a seat.

412
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:55,950
Yuheng.

413
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,400
Are you here being a flight attendant

414
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,020
because of Mr. Gu?

415
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,420
Ms. Ai.

416
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,760
Actually,

417
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,460
it's not just for Mr. Gu.

418
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,320
I really want to do this job well.

419
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,820
I saw the photos

420
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,770
on your Moments.

421
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,240
It looks good.

422
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,380
Not really.

423
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,930
I know

424
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,930
you've been working hard.

425
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,330
Whether it's work or other things,

426
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,110
but love and work are the same.

427
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,510
Try to find the right way.

428
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,380
Have you ever thought

429
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,480
maybe Mr. Gu

430
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:50,110
doesn't like the way you work now?

431
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,110
Ms. Ai,

432
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,880
how did you and Mr. Xie get together?

433
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:11,720
We were just colleagues at first.

434
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,960
But after a breathtaking forced landing,

435
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,560
he confessed to me the next day.

436
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:21,500
I always remember what he said.

437
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:23,380
He said

438
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,950
my hands were sweaty

439
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,650
during yesterday's evacuation.

440
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,440
My legs were weak and my mind was blank.

441
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,760
But you could

442
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,080
lead a few girls

443
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,310
and guide the passengers to evacuate safely.

444
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,900
You brought

445
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:42,650
the hope and courage

446
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,550
to all passengers.

447
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,760
At that time, I knew

448
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:50,900
you were my future partner.

449
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,370
Go back and think about it.

450
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,870
Captain Xie. You may leave first.

451
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll clean the cockpit.

452
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,340
Thank you, Cheng.

453
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:47,940
Not at all.

454
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:05,710
Wait for me.

455
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,430
Captain Cheng will be ready soon.

456
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,160
Since August,

457
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,300
many places in the south

458
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:57,000
occurred a wide range of heavy rainfall.

459
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,200
There are heavy rainfall and flooding in some areas.

460
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,720
The more severely affected areas are

461
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and so on.

462
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,840
After the disaster,

463
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,690
various regions actively launched emergency rescue

464
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,840
to transfer the people,

465
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,130
repair the damaged routes,

466
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,020
and repair the power communication wiring as soon as possible.

467
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,470
[Special report]

468
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,470
[A large-scale rain has occurred in Guizhou.]

469
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,380
Here's our reporter's report

470
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,660
from the scene.

471
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,620
Everyone,

472
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,780
the heavy rain in the south is very severe.

473
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,100
The Lanshan County

474
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,090
which Luzhou Airlines is responsible for poverty alleviation

475
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:27,270
also encountered

476
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,560
very serious damage.

477
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,380
The previously targeted poverty relief programs

478
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,710
have been implemented.

479
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,840
Not only did they open the poor-aid route,

480
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,350
and built elementary schools,

481
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,450
but also solved the employment issue

482
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,450
of more than 1,000 local employers.

483
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,400
I'm considering

484
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,320
if we should organize

485
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:45,430
a rescue operation

486
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,010
regarding this flood.

487
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:49,300
I'd like to hear your opinions.

488
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,120
Well,

489
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,450
the damage to the disaster area

490
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,330
is indeed

491
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,260
worrying.

492
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,580
Fortunately, all the support

493
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,530
are in place now.

494
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,580
I think we can

495
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,480
mobilize everyone to donate.

496
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,659
After all, it's the summer.

497
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,310
We are already very tense

498
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,120
about the deployment of personnel

499
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,420
at this peak period.

500
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:23,179
The most urgent thing in the disaster area is supplies.

501
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,199
If we can send the supplies

502
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,199
by air transport,

503
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,830
it should be better

504
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:28,100
than the donation.

505
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,360
But now,

506
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,340
we have no Freight Department anymore.

507
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,400
Our operation is already saturated.

508
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,699
At this time,

509
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,290
it's not worth

510
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:41,929
to transport the supplies using a passenger aircraft.

511
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,070
If we need to transport a lot of supplies,

512
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,469
we must remove the seats.

513
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,550
After the mission,

514
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:49,130
we have to

515
00:34:49,449 --> 00:34:50,580
reinstall the seat.

516
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,949
It consumes manpower and resources.

517
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,270
Indeed,

518
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
it's not worth it.

519
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:56,540
Yes.

520
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,520
President Xu.

521
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,590
Our company

522
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,250
can fully mobilize everyone to make a donation.

523
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,850
We support the disaster area

524
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:04,820
in this way

525
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,700
to express our kindness.

526
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Everyone,

527
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,190
the traffic is remote

528
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:12,390
in Lanshan County.

529
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,700
This time, it was seriously damaged.

530
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,160
What the victims need most

531
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,510
must be the supplies.

532
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:18,970
Donation

533
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:21,340
needs to go through various channels.

534
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,120
After purchasing the supplies,

535
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,400
it takes at least half a month

536
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,400
to send the supplies to the victims.

537
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,490
As the counterpart unit, I think

538
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,450
we should help them directly.

539
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,320
I agree with

540
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,140
Nanting's opinion.

541
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,340
The value of this matter

542
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,940
can't be measured with economic benefits alone.

543
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,020
Luzhou Airlines should also take

544
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,910
more social responsibilities.

545
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:49,520
It's settled then.

546
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,870
All departments,

547
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,830
please inform your subordinates.

548
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,590
Each department will send some volunteers

549
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,850
to deliver supplies to Lanshan County.

550
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,190
There's no time to lose.

551
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,860
Set out in two days.

552
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,710
Our Public Relations Department will cooperate fully.

553
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:09,130
Our Security Department will deploy manpower as soon as possible.

554
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,260
Flight Department,

555
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,570
I'll find a way.

556
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,480
Mr. Jiang,

557
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,510
I'm willing to fly there with my team.

558
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,610
As for the personnel, I will try my best to coordinate

559
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,740
and try not to affect the operation of the normal flight.

560
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,280
Okay.

561
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,160
About the aircraft used for transportation...

562
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,560
Mr. Ni,

563
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm afraid we'll have to bother the maintenance personnel

564
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,720
to modify it as soon as possible.

565
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,420
Reserve at least 30 seats

566
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,910
and remove the rest.

567
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:35,310
We carry as much as we can.

568
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,260
No problem.

569
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:38,190
Since we've decided to do it,

570
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,880
the Maintenance Department will do our best.

571
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,810
I'll go with you as a volunteer.

572
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,600
I can also be the engineer

573
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,720
who ensure the return and forth of the plane.

574
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,130
Okay.

575
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,560
Come in.

576
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,320
Brother-in-law, do you want to see me?

577
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,690
Here.

578
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:06,530
Our company is going to send a rescue team

579
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,250
to transport supplies to Lanshan County.

580
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,350
I should have joined,

581
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,730
but I couldn't.

582
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:14,460
I have to take care of the team.

583
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,630
You go there on my behalf.

584
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,810
Contribute yourself.

585
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Brother-in-law.

586
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:25,760
There'll be a family day at Dou's school next week.

587
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,760
The teacher asked

588
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,600
parents to go compulsory.

589
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:39,900
Yicheng.

590
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,340
You already embarrassed me

591
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,200
in the refresher training last time.

592
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,820
Regarding disaster relief,

593
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,280
don't you think you should

594
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,460
take the initiative and perform well?

595
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,110
Don't let others gossip.

596
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,100
OK.

597
00:37:58,450 --> 00:37:59,340
I'll get ready.

598
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,400
I'll ask for leave from the teacher now.

599
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:01,730
Okay.

600
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:03,930
Yicheng.

601
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,560
Gu Nanting will lead the rescue personally.

602
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,080
Be careful.

603
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:15,250
Listen and watch more.

604
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,680
Okay, I got it, brother-in-law.

605
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,400
Freight transportation is our expertise.

606
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,730
If we don't go, who will?

607
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:41,070
Go back and get ready.

608
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,130
This time,

609
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:44,710
not only deliver the goods to the local airport,

610
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:47,730
but also send them to the backup unit at the designated location.

611
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,190
We're in heaven and earth.

612
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:50,930
Do we have enough people?

613
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,370
Don't worry.

614
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,430
All departments have deployed elites.

615
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:58,090
Apart from you two, the Flight Department also sends Lin Yicheng.

616
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,610
He has a lot to do at home.

617
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,120
Why would he volunteer?

618
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,500
Did you check the luggage cabin?

619
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,180
Yes.

620
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:16,720
Zhan,

621
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,470
I've checked the plane information.

622
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,190
No problem.

623
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,290
What about the cabin?

624
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:23,270
We've checked the cabin

625
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,730
and 30 seats are reserved.

626
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm still a little worried.

627
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,850
This is the first time

628
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,800
we modify a 787-passenger aircraft to a cargo aircraft.

629
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,330
How about

630
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,310
letting our men check it thoroughly?

631
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,600
Don't make any mistakes.

632
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Okay, no problem.

633
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,800
Guys,

634
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,270
let's check again.

635
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:44,770
Be careful.

636
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:45,750
Okay.

637
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:52,810
[Luzhou Airlines]

638
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,920
Brother Yicheng.

639
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,630
I'll check the goods in the cabin.

640
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:12,960
Are you okay on your own?

641
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,440
You're unnecessary here.

642
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,100
Go quickly.

643
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,320
Mom.

644
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,660
-Dad, when are you coming back?
-I…

645
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,520
It's Dou.

646
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:29,710
I'm on a business trip for two days.

647
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,440
Listen to your grandma at home.

648
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,400
Are you not wearing raincoats?

649
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,640
We came half an hour ago.

650
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,170
It didn't rain at that time.

651
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,400
Did you stay up all night again?

652
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:46,930
I'm fine.

653
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,280
I just need to take a nap on the plane.

654
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,770
Brother Wang, you can wear mine.

655
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,700
No, no, no.

656
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,640
I'm fine.

657
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Don't get wet.

658
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,080
You can't fly if you're sick.

659
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,280
It's okay, just a drizzle. It happens all the time.

660
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,970
No need.

661
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:58,770
Captains,

662
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,920
we should prioritize the pilots during a flight mission.

663
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,960
That's the rule.

664
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,840
You stayed up all night.

665
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:06,300
Your immunity will be much weaker. Put it on.

666
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,360
If you don't wear it now,

667
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,020
the four of us are getting wet.

668
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:12,630
Fine.

669
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,650
Put it on.

670
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,320
-The warmth from the brother department.
-Thank you.

671
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,480
Let's take another round.

672
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,360
It'll rain heavily.

673
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:21,710
Okay.

674
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:25,950
Hurry up.

675
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:26,880
Let's hide.

676
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,610
Hurry up and hide.

677
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,330
It's raining heavily.

678
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,760
It's suddenly raining so heavily.

679
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,920
The weather forecast said it was a shower.

680
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,040
It should be over soon.

681
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,920
Let's hide for a while.
