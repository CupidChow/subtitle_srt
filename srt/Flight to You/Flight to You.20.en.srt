"Discussion on the Dialectical Relationship between Pilot Plasticity and Gender".

5
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,890
What do you think

6
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,440
about the title?

7
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,690
Are you serious?

8
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,170
I have analyzed

9
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,910
the characteristics and advantages

10
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:01,700
of female pilots during the flight

11
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,830
from 11 dimensions.

12
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,240
Do you think something is not enough?

13
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,330
Do you think

14
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,960
we are going to a thesis defense?

15
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,620
You are so professional. Who will listen to you?

16
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,940
We are recruiting a professional female pilot for the future.

17
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,360
If we don't care about professionals, what should we care about?

18
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,760
We are using public opinion

19
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,790
to change the views

20
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,940
about profession and gender.

21
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,800
The audience is not a pilot.

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,660
They don't understand what you said.

23
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,920
How can they resonate?

24
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:30,730
You have to treat professional things seriously.

25
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,180
Change your mind.

26
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:36,660
Let's make a metaphor and quote copiously from many sources.

27
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,260
You have to make them listen.

28
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,030
You can have a strict attitude and the content is flexible.

29
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,630
Can't you?

30
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,420
It's about flying.

31
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,070
We should be more serious.

32
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
Have you been traumatized?

33
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,550
You're always so cautious.

34
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,550
This is a speech, not a flight.

35
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,510
It's not that if you make a mistake, someone will die.

36
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,710
Go back first.

37
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,360
I'll amend it myself.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,500
How about this?

39
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,150
I'll go with you to the speech tomorrow.

Xiao,

43
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,930
don't you have a flight today?

44
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,670
Did you just land?

45
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,080
Come on, help me.

46
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,130
Okay, wait for me. I'll buy a ticket first.

47
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,860
What ticket?

48
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:20,019
Mercury Dance Troupe will perform once every three years.

49
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,880
I can't miss it.

50
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,900
Do you like dancing?

51
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,420
I feel ashamed when saying this.

52
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,660
My childhood dream

53
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,450
wasn't to be a pilot,

54
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,430
but a dancer.

55
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,390
What's there to be ashamed of?

56
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,050
It's great.

57
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,970
Because of this,

58
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:40,080
I was often laughed at when I was young.

59
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,450
They said I was a sissy.

60
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,570
Don't listen to them.

61
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,120
If you really had learned dancing,

62
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,320
we wouldn't have met.

63
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,200
You're right.

64
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
I heard that

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,530
most dancers' art career

66
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,290
are not long.

67
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,480
My family is poor.

68
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,820
I am the only boy,

69
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,630
so I signed up for pilots.

70
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,810
I didn't expect that I actually passed.

71
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,680
But sometimes I think

72
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,720
if I could start over again,

73
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:06,410
I wouldn't care about those prejudices.

74
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,290
I must choose

75
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,730
to do what I like the most.

76
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,190
After all, people can only live once.

77
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,990
You inspired me.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,860
I'm going back.

79
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,290
Didn't you ask me to help you?

80
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,080
What help?

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,780
You've already helped me.

82
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,180
How about this?

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,800
I'll go with you to the speech tomorrow.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,100
Rest early.

85
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,880
Don't stay up late even without a flight.

It's at the cafe ahead.

96

Right here.

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,080
By the way,

98
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,220
give me the USB flash drive of your speech.

99
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,550
I'll copy it to the crew.

100
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,850
Didn't you sleep well last night?

101
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,230
I slept very well last night.

102
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,520
I even had a good dream.

103
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,900
Why do you look pale?

104
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,280
Maybe I forgot to put blush on when I went out in a hurry.

105
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,480
Alright, go backstage first.

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,630
I'll go to the directors.

107
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,630
Where is the backstage?

108
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,960
Turn right in front.

109
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,370
Make the voice softer.

110
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,750
Turn off the reverb.

111
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,410
Take a look.

112

This is his speech and the slides.

116

Okay.

117
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,450
We will start recording

121
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,070
Yes.

122
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,870
Because we didn't have many reserves before.

123
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,430

speech themes

126
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,820
are not too intimate with people.

127
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,960
But your theme today is very good.

128
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,760
So our leader hopes

129
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,620
to promote it as soon as possible.

130
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:10,350
Great.

131
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,500
Will there be a telescript later?

If necessary,

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
we can prepare it.

134
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,440
We really need it.

No, thanks.

142
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,640
Just give you some.

143
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,640
This way, the shooting will be good.

144

Sir, I'll put you on some powder.

145

is my script

too dull?

152
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,030
It's useless to think about this now.

153
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,530
Just let it be.

158
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,290
Good afternoon, everyone.

159
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,500
Welcome to the stage of New Sight.

160
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,480
Today,

161
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,760
on my way to the studio,

162
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,530
I found

163
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,630
the outdoor weather is particularly sunny.

164
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:34,960
There are occasionally a few planes

165
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,710
flying across the blue sky

166
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,930
from above

167
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,890
and making a loud noise.

168
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,160
What a coincidence!

169
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
Today in the studio,

170
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,830
we've invited a speech guest.

171
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,760
His identity is also related to the plane.

172
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,560
He is a civil aviation pilot.

173

00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,740
I see the girls sitting in the front row

177
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,690
are already laughing.

178
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,680
I wonder

179
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,550
if he's still single.

180
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,400
Alright.

181
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:06,300
Today, this handsome captain

182
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:08,040
is going to give a speech

183
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,000
with a special theme.

184
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,150
It is full of sociality.

185
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,550
It concerns the deep understanding of each office worker

186
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:17,730
on the site and outside the camera,

187
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,350
especially our female compatriots.

188
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,260
So,

189
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,360
what is he going to share?

190
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,490
Without further ado,

191
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,870
let's welcome

192
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:28,090
Mr. Gu Nanting,

193
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,710
a senior captain at Luzhou Airlines.

194
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,110
Let's welcome him with a round of applause.

195
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,540
This captain is so handsome.

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,130
Does your appearance need to be examined to be a captain?

197
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,320
Hello, I'm Gu Nanting.

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,020
I'm a captain of Luzhou Airlines.

199
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:21,840
Today,

200
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,450
the topic of my speech is...

201
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,410
The topic is

202
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,010
"Profession and Gender".

203
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,360
Since I graduated and worked at Luzhou Airlines

204
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,880
I've been flying

205
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,750
ten million kilometers.

206
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,440
But the most nervous moment is nothing compared to

207
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,640
the 0.01 kilometer

208
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,020
from backstage to here.

209
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,940
Thank you for your encouragement.

210
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:17,870
I'm nervous

211
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:19,660
because I know

212
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,370
the speech I am giving

213
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,380
may affect some's career options

214
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:24,880
for a lifetime.

215
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,360
When you hear about the occupation of pilots,

216
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,640
most people think

217
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,010
it's a man's job.

218
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,530
Captain,

219
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,640
it should be like this.

220
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,190
[Male pilot]

221
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,010
Cool.

222
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,540
Or

223
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:48,320
someone like me.

224
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Many people think

225
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:01,470
a pilot is a typical male profession.

226
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,110
We often hear people say

227
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,140
what professional men are suitable for

228
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,600
and what women are.

229
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,650
But

230
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,170
should we really do this?

231
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,580
We've seen some men

232
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,000
become excellent dancers,

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,340
costume designers, and makeup artists.

234
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,400
There's a nail salon underneath my apartment.

235
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,210
I heard that the best manicurist

236
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,640
for young girls

237
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
is a young man unexpectedly.

238
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,110
On the other hand,

239
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,960
we can see

240
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,390
more and more women

241
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,170
have also become outstanding business leaders,

242
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,890
architects, and soldiers.

243
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,550
Classifying job attributes by gender

244
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,590
is basically a prejudice.

245
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:51,560
In fact,

246
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,870
in every industry,

247
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,910
the difference between individuals is much greater

248
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:57,120
than the difference between gender.

249
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:58,820
That makes sense.

250
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,860
Really, the captain is good at talking.

251
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,050
Back to my industry,

252
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,560
there are 70,000 pilots in the country.

253
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,000
But female pilots

254
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,430
are less than 1,000 in civil aviation.

255
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,640
Why are there so few?

256
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,670
Many people think women can't endure hardships

257
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,000
and are not interested in machines.

258
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,310
They are not good enough at technical issues.

259
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,079
They have a unique problem every month.

260
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,040
There will be the influence of childbirth and family in the future.

261
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,790
Is that true?

262
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,980
Major General Liu Xiaolian

263
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,760
is the first air force female pilot with first-class honors

264
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,550
in the new China.

265
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,060
She has completed countless safe flights

266
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,920
in her flying life for 34 years.

267
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,270
She successfully did the forced landing in five minutes

268
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,300
and saved all crew's lives.

269
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,640
So cool.

270
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,180
Similarly,

271
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,890
some ordinary female pilots

272
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,440
who are unknown to you in our civil aviation.

273
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,350
Female pilots do face

274
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,150
more physiological obstacles.

275
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,350
But it also shows that

276
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,380
they have made more efforts

277
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,130
than male pilots.

278
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:26,360
In our company,

279
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,860
there's a female pilot

280
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:30,320
who has been in her position for eight years.

281
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,430
During every training and assessment,

282
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,260
her grades

283
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,160
are always better than boys in the same batch.

284
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,180
She has encountered

285
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,980
questions from instructors

286
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,310
and misunderstandings with passengers.

287
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,540
But she never gave up her job.

288
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,540
I admire her ability

289
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,320
and her courage, passion,

290
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,040
and persistence for this job.

291
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,260
Now,

292
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,700
many airline companies don't hire female pilots.

293
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,220
They block those girls

294
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,790
who love flying

295
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:16,980
outside the door.

296
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,350
This is caused by

297
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,420
gender bias against the profession.

298
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,550
If there is a chance,

299
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,800
I hope our airline

300
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,090
can provide girls

301
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,520
to participate in the selection equally.

302
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:30,490
There is no difference between men and women in the profession.

303
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:32,680
I hope some people can put aside prejudice.

304
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,140
I also hope that most people can step bravely

305
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,150
to show their talents

306
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:40,630
and fulfill themselves in the profession they truly love.

307
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:42,410
Thank you.

308
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,560
Mr. Gu,

309
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,230
your speech is amazing.

310
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:14,570
We were moved to tears in the studio.

311
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,160
Thank you.

312
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,480
You flattered me.

313
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,420
We finally have shows to be aired tonight.

314
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,400
Tonight?

315
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,800
Yes.

316
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,160
I didn't tell you before. I don't want you to be nervous.

317
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,550
Don't worry, Mr. Gu.

318
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,760
Today's show

319
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,350
is very good.

320
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,340
After the airing,

321
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,400
there will be a good social response.

322
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,360
We're looking forward to it too.

323
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,470
See you later.

324
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,010
OK. Take care.

325
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:39,960
Bye.

326
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,800
Keep in touch.

327
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,560
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,770
I acted on my own again

329
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,130
without your permission.

330
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:03,910
Thank you.

331
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:06,950
I...

332
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,810
like your script very much.

333
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,470
Are you sincerely praising me

334
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,180
in your freestyle part?

335
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,290
I don't say lies.

336
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,630
But

337
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,660
did you stay up late last night?

338
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,920
I'm not flying these days.

339
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,250
It won't affect my work.

340
00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:30,340
That's not what I meant.

341
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:32,400
Alright.

342
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,650
Thank you.

343
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,120
Go home and rest.

344
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,830
Why didn't you see me off?

345
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,520
My mom is waiting for me at home with her cooking.

346
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,650
Go ahead.

347
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,120
Well...

348
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:58,400
Say hello to Auntie Qin for me.

349
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,070
I'm so sleepy. I'm going to bed.

350
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:00,480
Bye.

351
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,340
Nanting.

352
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,530
Why do I feel like you're a little nervous?

353
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,710
This is not your style.

354
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:37,730
Mom.

355
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:40,000
Just take a look and turn it off.

356
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,720
No way.

357
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,190
It's my son's first time on TV.

358
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,590
I have to record it later.

359
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,940
Mom, how is it?

360
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,120
The overall is good.

361
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,300
But I'm not satisfied with one thing.

362
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,830
What?

363
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,970
There are so many female entrepreneurs

364
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,530
and female architects

365
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,440
in your script.

366
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,200
Why can't you mention mothers?

367
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,130
Aren't we representative?

368
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:18,430
You didn't write the script on your own, did you?

369
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:23,650
Mom, do you want some fruit? I'll wash some for you.

370
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,660
Where are the fruits?

371
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,650
We don't have fruits today.

372
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,440
This girl...

373
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,260
I saw her

374
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,100
when I went to Xi'an.

375
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,760
You said she was your student.

376
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,410
Yes, her name is Cheng Xiao.

377
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,130
Cheng Xiao?

378
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,930
Are you two good?

379
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,260
No, mom, you think too much.

380
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,290
What did I think?

381
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:10,970
Nanting,

382
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:13,250
I rarely

383
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:15,810
urge you to get a girlfriend

384
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,820
or to get married.

385
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:19,830
If you don't like it,

386
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:22,220
it's useless even if you are together.

387
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,880
But I want to remind you

388
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,380
once you feel something,

389
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,360
don't miss it easily.

390
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,150
In life,

391
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:31,740
it's hard

392
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,530
to meet the other half of the same mind.

393
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,360
People like you and my dad

394
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,970
are few nowadays.

395
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes.

396
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,360
For me,

397
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,210
it's enough to have this

398
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,650
once in my life.

399
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,910
But for you,

400
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,690
Luo Yi is a good girl.

401
00:24:57,870 --> 00:24:58,940
But it doesn't mean

402
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,260
you can't accept a new fate.

403
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,690
You can't let her go.

404
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,360
Is it because of this person

405
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,470
or your guilt in the heart?

406
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,370
I'm sorry.

407
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,900

♫To fly to the bright and broad sky♫

445
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,970
Back to my industry,

446
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,400
there are 70,000 pilots in the country.

447
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,640
But female pilots...

448
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,040
Brother Nanting is really good at talking.

449
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,720
Yeah.

450
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:18,770
Why is there so little?

451
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,390
But why do I feel

452
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,320
it doesn't sound like Brother Nanting?

453
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,730
What do you mean?

454
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,610
I see.

455
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,230
Xiao wrote the script.

456
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,480
I inspired it.

457
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,590
I'm Xiao's prince charming of inspiration.

458
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,990
Don't flatter yourself.

459
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,420
What?

460
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,950
You are an influencer now.

461
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,530
Why don't you help to share it?

462
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,310
Hurry up.

463
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,480
We must change the situation

464
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:57,030
before the recruitment plan gets announced.

465
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,770
Yes, Xia.

466
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,220
Let me make it clear.

467
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,110
I'm not helping Cheng Xiao,

468
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,970
but Captain Gu.

469
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,550
I have to repost it on Weibo first.

470
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,610
Key opinion leaders from all walks of life,

471
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,070
I'll tag as much as I can.

472
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,600
Now, many airline companies

473
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,060
don't hire female pilots.

474
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,600
They block those girls

475
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,870
who love flying...

476
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,580
There is no difference between men and women in the profession.

477
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,080
Well...

478
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,770
Brother-in-law, he is right.

479
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,340
His speech is really good.

480
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,850
I think

481
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,320
Gu Nanting

482
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,750
won't give up easily

483
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,590
on female pilots' recruitment.

484
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,530
Are you going to be convinced?

485
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,830
That's right.

486
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,570
I can help him.

487
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,930
I can shorten his time.

488
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:15,800
Li,

489
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,230
how do you plan for

490
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,690
the recruitment

491
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,690
for next year?

492
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:53,360
Did you read what I just sent you?

493
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,890
It's viral on the Internet.

494
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:04,990
Mr. Jiang.

495
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,760
I've watched your speech.

496
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:08,860
Very good.

497
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,090
I hope one day our company

498
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,830
can change the recruitment plan.

499
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,160
How about the next year?

500
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,850
The recruitment plan for next year has been announced.

501
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,550
The recruitment plan for next year has been released.

502
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,180
[Job Requirement]

503
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,180
[Gender requirement: only men]

504
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,200
I'm sorry.

505
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,650
President Xu.

506
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,160
I heard that you just came back from Stockholm.

507
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,760
Thank you.

508
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,670
This flight route is indeed a bit long.

509
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,330
But our company's plane

510
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,040
is flying steadily.

511
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,150
President Xu.

512
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,200
I need to report to you

513
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:01,890
regarding some emergencies on public opinion.

514
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,550
Okay, let's talk in my office.

515
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,360
Wait.

516
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,310
President Xu.

517
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:17,770
Mr. Tan.

518
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,680
I'm Cheng Xiao from the Flight Department.

519
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I know who you are.

520
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,260
You are the most famous female pilot

521
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,440
in our company.

522
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,000
What can I do for you?

523
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,670
I would like to take two minutes of your time.

524
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:30,800
It's about recruiting female pilots.

525
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,580
I have a video

526
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,680
to show you.

527
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:34,740
Come in.

528
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:54,350
Nanting.

529
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,100
Please attend the meeting

530
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
in the afternoon.

531
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Everyone is here.

532
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,469
President Xu.

533
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,360
Let's get ready for the meeting.

534
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,860
Mr. Jiang.

535
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,710
Your Flight Department has verified

536
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:42,760
the research report of Nanting,

537
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,850
and made a decision

538
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,880
not to recruit female pilots.

539
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,120
Actually, regarding this,

540
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,830
there's a dispute

541
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,110
between us directors.

542
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,520
But the competition status changes of each airline company

543
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,560
you proposed

544
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:57,480
have been recognized by many people.

545
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,150
So

546
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,300
I approved your recruitment plan.

547
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,020
But now,

548
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,610
the situation has changed.

549
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,050
Nanting.

550
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,140
I saw your speech video.

551
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,250
It's fun

552
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,560
and rarely seen.

553
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:12,450
The PR department told me

554
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,950
this video

555
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,340
had gone viral online.

556
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:17,150
It became a hot topic.

557
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
Our Pilots Admission Office

558
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,040
received many emails as well as calls

559
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,800
from the public

560
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,430
inquiring about our company

561
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,960
have how many quotas

562
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:26,790
for female pilots.

563
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,060
I didn't expect it would cause

564
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,460
such an overwhelming response in society.

565
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,350
At noon,

566
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,180
I had a discussion with several directors online.

567
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,610
We also read the research report of Nanting.

568
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:39,690
Now we

569
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,160
have changed our opinions

570
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,680
about this matter.

571
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,620
The board has decided

572
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,220
to recruit female pilots

573
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,230
for 5 percent

574
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,730
of the recruitment

575
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,360
for next year.

576
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,300
Mr. Jiang,

577
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,850
I know you are considering the cost control

578
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:03,660
and manpower,

579
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,180
and that's why you keep refusing to recruit female pilots.

580
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,580
I think your consideration has no problem.

581
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:10,870
But

582
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,860
I think Nanting's consideration

583
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,790
is more meaningful for the future.

584
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,680
President Xu,

585
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
is this...

586
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,050
I haven't finished it yet.

587
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,100
Our corporate culture

588
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,670
is different

589
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,650
from other airline companies.

590
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,570
Our goal

591
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:31,750
is to become

592
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,960
a leading aviation company guiding positive values.

593
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,410
Besides profit,

594
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,220
we need to make

595
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,920
more breakthroughs in providing social value.

596
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,800
No matter how high the cost is,

597
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,250
it's worth it.

598
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:45,880
But

599
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,580
we've released the recruitment brochures

600
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,160
for next year.

601
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,020
Take them back

602
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,890
and distribute them after amendments.

603
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,950
The way Nanting did this time

604
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,940
was really unexpected.

605
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,970
But I didn't expect the result

606
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,320
was surprisingly good.

607
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:05,040
This also shows your deep consideration for the training of talents

608
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,970
and the future of Luzhou Airlines.

609
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,700
You can be reinstated.

610
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,620
Go back to

611
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:15,070
the deputy director position of the Flight Department.

612
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,640
I hope you can contribute more

613
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,240
to the company.

614
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,710
Thank you, President Xu.

615
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,000
Thank you.

616
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,720
Thank you.

617
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,450
Nanting.

618
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,250
Congratulations on your reinstatement.

619
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:49,320
We have two happy events today.

620
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,080
Let's have dinner tonight to celebrate for you.

621
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,680
Thank you.

622
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,580
But I'm curious about one thing.

623
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,690
I watched your video carefully.

624
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,920
That's a good speech.

625
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,590
But I think

626
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,830
the person on the stage is not like you.

627
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,730
Because

628
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,900
I didn't write the script.

629
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,270
I'm going back to my office first.

630
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,730
I'll contact you tonight.

631
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,920
It looks as if

632
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,450
things have turned around.

633
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,190
I'm texting you.

634
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,580
Let's talk inside.

635
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,150
President Xu has adjusted the recruitment plan

636
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,190
and approved five percent of the female pilots' recruitment ratio.

637
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:56,970
Great.

638
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:59,220
Our efforts are not in vain.

639
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,280
There's another piece of news.

640
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,800
What?

641
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,490
Nothing.

642
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,700
Tell me.

643
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:12,260
I'm reinstated.

644
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:13,520
Really?

645
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,910
Then I brought the right thing today.

646
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,480
I have a good instinct.

647
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,030
Shouldn't you treat me to a meal?

648
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,430
I'll treat you

649
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,720
with Song another day.

650
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,960
It's better to go now instead of another day.

651
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,800
Tonight.

652
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,200
Song won't fly today.

653
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,750
Tonight?

654
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,760
Can you be more sincere?

655
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,830
I stayed up all night to write your script.

656
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,900
Pick a restaurant.

657
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,140
I want the best and the most expensive one.

658
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,600
OK.

659
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,520
Here.

660
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,000
See you in the basement after work.

661
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,080
I'll inform Song.

662
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,990
Good news.

663
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,400
There is two good news. Which one should we listen to first?

664
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,030
None.

665
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,990
You'll regret it if you don't listen.

666
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:10,250
Yuheng, one more bite.

667
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,570
I'm going to die...

668
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:17,080
Brother Nanting is reinstated.

669
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,640
Now he's the deputy director.

670
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,380
Really?

671
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,490
And Xiao texted me

672
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,610
the company has agreed with

673
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:24,870
the recruitment plan for female pilots.

674
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,480
Don't take the credit.

675
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,910
It's definitely my credit.

676
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,400
Everyone did.

677
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,330
And the main credit

678
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,160
must belong to Brother Nanting and Xiao.

679
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:32,820
Do you think

680
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,310
we should let Captain Gu

681
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,750
treat us to a meal

682
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,600
for celebration?

683
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,960
He must treat us.

684
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,400
But at this hour,

685
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,400
he is still busy.

686
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,170
He just got reinstated. He must have a lot to do.

687
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,870
Let's think about what to eat first

688
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,220
and tell him to treat us.

689
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,210
Okay, let's have a barbecue.

690
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,160
Brother Nanting.

691
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,680
I'm so glad I heard you got reinstated.

692
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:06,760
Congratulations.

693
