Xiao.

00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:37,930
Hurry up.

7
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,500
What's the rush?

8
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,790
I have a meeting later.

9
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,990
Just five minutes.

It's refreshing and nourishing.

You're asking for something big?

14
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,000
Xiao,

15
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,620
do you remember

16
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,900
the model airplane Nanting gave me,

17
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,690
J-20?

18
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,260
Sure. You need to let go of the old to make room for the new.

19
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,150
My J-20

20
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,620
shows up.

21
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,410
Come on.

22
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,810
Tell me, who is she?

25
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:19,029
Nanting have a feeling

26
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,279
for Li Yuheng?

27
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,650
Is Li Yuheng your J-20?

28
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,700
I knew it.

29
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,520
No wonder you were in such a hurry to live with them.

30
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,390
It's a coincidence. It's definitely a coincidence to be her roommate.

31
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,290
Do you think

32
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,770
I have a chance?

33
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,210
Yes.

34
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,120
You are both flight attendants.

35
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,920
You would make a perfect couple.

36
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,080
But Xia Zhi said

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,590
Li Yuheng likes Nanting.

38
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,030
That's true.

39
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,920
Then I would have no chance.

40
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Nanting is way better

41
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,430
than me.

42
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,370
It's just 54,000 kilometres.

you'll catch up someday.

45
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,230
Think about it.

46
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,490
Li Yuheng is single now.

47

Besides,

Gu Nanting

50
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,480
doesn't like Li Yuheng.

51
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,130
Really?

52
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,000
As far as I know,

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,660
Gu Nanting treats Li Yuheng

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,830
like a sister.

55
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,620
Who would have a feeling for his sister?

56
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
That makes sense.

57

do you

59
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,560
have a crush on Nanting secretly?

60
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,780
Of course not.

61
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,680
I don't hide my feelings.

62
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,710
I like him openly.

63
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,590
Really?

64

Is this Q you talked about with Ni Zhan?

79
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,670

he immediately forwarded it.

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:35,660
to it.

177
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,720
Is that true?

178
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,590
Yes, Mr. Xu. Her name is Xia Zhi.

179
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,000
She isn't a top performer

180
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,160
at work,

181
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,770
but she is good at networking

182
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,010
and collaboration.

183
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
That's the point.

184
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,410
We must do our best

185
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,580
to unleash their full potential while avoiding their weaknesses

186
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,280
when treating those employees with special talent.

187
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,700
Yes.

188
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,140
We will discuss with the PR Department

189
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,560
and her

190
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,660
how to arrange her future work.

191
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,480
Speaking of our employees,

192
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,560
our hiring requirements

193
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,240
have always been very strict.

194
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,210
Mr. Jiang,

195
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,310
I've reviewed

196
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,580
the hiring plan next year

197
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,150
submitted by your Flight Department.

198
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,190
We haven't hired any female pilot

199
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,060
for the past five years.

200
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,340
So,

201
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm thinking about

202
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,840
hiring a female pilot this year.

203
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,500
At the same time, I want to know

204
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,590
why you

205
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,870
insist on not hiring female pilots?

206
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,830
Not only me.

207
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,200
This is the conclusion we arrived at

208
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,240
after discussion

209
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,590
within our Flight Department.

210
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,000
That means

211
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,960
you all supported this idea?

212
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,580
Not really.

213
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,740
Except Mr. Xie

214
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,660
and Gu Nanting.

215
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,100
Of course.

216
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,700
Nanting is training a female pilot.

217
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,760
There might be some subjective factors.

218
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,100
Ni Zhan.

219
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,020
Although you're not a pilot,

220
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,630
when it comes to the future of the company,

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,530
I want to hear your opinion.

222
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,240
Since the Flight Department

223
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,460
has voted for it,

224
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:17,990
as an amateur,

225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,400
of course I respect

226
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,530
the opinion of the Flight Department.

227
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,920
Theoretically,

228
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,940
we should follow the majority rule.

229
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,270
However,

230
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,240
I think we need to

231
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,650
be more serious and objective

232
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,050
towards the hiring plan.

233
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,000
For example,

234
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,910
we can do more deep research and data analysis about female pilots.

235
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,990
Then we can come to

236
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,210
a more reasonable conclusion.

237
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,230
It makes sense.

238
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,060
Thank you for your advice, Mr. Ni.

239
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,790
It seems that it's really necessary

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,100
to conduct a comprehensive analysis

241
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,840
about every stage of the development

242
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,840
of female pilots.

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,220
How about this?

244
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,880
Let Nanting

245
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,560
do this research.

246
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,350
He hasn't been at the position

247
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,660
of the Deputy Director of the Flight Department for several months.

248
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,320
It's time to give him a chance.

249
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,080
Okay.

250
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:18,680
No problem.

251
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,780
I'll do the research

252
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,360
about female pilots.

253
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,640
How long do you need?

254
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,320
One month.

255
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,880
I'll go to some flight academies for investigation

256
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,240
and make an evaluation

257
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,990
of all the female pilots at our company.

258
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,190
One month is too long.

259
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,100
Mr. Xu is pushing us.

260
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,000
You've only got a week.

261
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:45,620
OK.

262
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,650
I'll figure it out.

263
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,230
Okay.

264
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,970
Brother Nanting.

265
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,780
Brother Nanting, listen to me.

266
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,820
Xiao, are you in the office too?

267
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,220
I just landed. I'm going to hand in the task book.

268
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,880
What's wrong with your phone?

269
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,600
The company still doesn't want to recruit a female pilot this year.

270
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,250
Brother Nanting is doing a research report.

271
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,880
I offered to help him but he refused.

272
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,430
So I took one out secretly.

273
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:37,080
[Survey on Women’s Expectations for Pilots]

274
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,860
But he found out.

275
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,220
He asked me to return it.

276
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,730
He's still working overtime.

277
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,350
I think he'll stay up all night.

278
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,210
The company gave us only one week.

279
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,200
Xiao.

280
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:57,810
Come in.

281
00:15:59,320 --> 00:15:59,990
Instructor Gu.

282
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,990
Brother Nanting.

283
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,170
I heard you are doing female pilot research.

284
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,570
Why didn’t you come to me?

285
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,250
You have your flight mission.

286
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,330
I am a female pilot.

287
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,570
I should be more qualified

288
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,920
than anyone else.

289
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,360
Besides,

290
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,710
you have your flight mission too.

291
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,960
I applied not to work this week.

292
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,160
I won't fly tomorrow.

293
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,160
At least I can stay and help tonight.

294
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,960
According to the safety manual,

295
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,800
we need ten hours of rest

296
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,160
before taking off.

297
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,810
I will catch up on sleep tomorrow morning.

298
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,340
It's not against the rules.

299
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,530
Let me make it clear.

300
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,760
There's no extra pay.

301
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:47,300
But...

302
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
don't do it again.

303
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,410
Brother Nanting, I'll go back first.

304
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,440
Have a good rest, Song.

305
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,460
These are mine.

306
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,250
And this.

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,440
You guys go first.

308
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,200
I'll be right there.

309
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,400
Okay, we're leaving.

310
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,710
Hello, I'm here.

311
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,840
This is

312
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,920
the economy class we're familiar with.

313
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,450
Let's go.

314
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,230
Look.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,440
Our beautiful cleaning lady.

316
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,550
Say hello to everyone.

317
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,510
Okay, hello.

318
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,430
OK.

319
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,480
Let's take a look ahead,

320
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:35,940
OK?

321
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,090
Let me show you.

322
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,680
Do you think aviation

323
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,280
is a very high-end industry?

324
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,450
But actually,

325
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,560
we just have

326
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,350
a glamorous appearance.

327
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,410
Is that right, Brother Fan?

328
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,140
Our maintenance staff

329
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,540
doesn't even have a glamorous appearance.

330
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,940
Let me introduce him to you.

331
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,280
This is our maintenance staff, Brother Fan.

332
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,050
Say hello.

333
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Hello, everyone.

334
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,620
OK.

335
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,200
From now on,

336
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,080
I'll bring you

337
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,440
various civil aviation-themed videos.

338
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,420
Follow me. Don't get lost.

339
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,660
I'm Summer.

340
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,290
I'm a cute and ordinary civil aviation person.

341
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,940
Summer.

342
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:19,960
Ms. Ai.

343
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,000
Can you hurry up?

344
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,840
All crew members are waiting for you in the car.

345
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,050
Okay, got it, Ms. Ai.

346
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:53,510
Mom,

347
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,060
I might have to go home late.

348
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,660
We have a meeting at the training center now.

349
00:19:59,350 --> 00:19:59,860
Xia Zhi.

350
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,240
I heard you're an influencer now.

351
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,850
Not even half of it.

352
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,730
Ms. Liang praised you.

353
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,700
She said the PR department thinks highly of you.

354
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,430
If I transfer you to another department,

355
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,240
will you go?

356
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,370
Ms. Ai,

357
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:29,180
I know I didn't do well in the cabin.

358
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:29,900
But

359
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,630
it's been a long time.

360
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,830
I still have feelings for this job.

361
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,930
And you and Yuheng helped me a lot.

362
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720
I don't want to be a deserter.

363
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:39,540
I...

364
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,220
I...

365
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,570
Do you

366
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,880
still have hope for me?

367
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,900
If I had no hope for you,

368
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,040
I would have let you go

369
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,170
in your first month.

370
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:52,760
Really?

371
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,660
Although I always think

372
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,380
it's not easy to do one thing well

373
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,390
in a lifetime,

374
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:00,590
I know

375
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:02,190
many young people nowadays

376
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,140
are slashies.

377
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,780
So if you can use your talent

378
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,640
and maximize the value,

379
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:10,250
I won't object.

380
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,620
You mean...

381
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,810
Some of our flight attendants

382
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,610
also work part-time at the Ground Handling Department.

383
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,090
But I haven't seen anyone who went to the PR department.

384
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,350
But Ms. Liang said that

385
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,340
we can grant exceptions

386
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,560
for special talents.

387
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:24,930
In the future,

388
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
we will arrange for you less flight.

389
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,450
As for the rest,

390
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,780
you can work in the PR department.

391
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,850
Thank you, Ms. Ai.

392
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,480
Thank you, Ms. Ai.

393
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,350
I will be a good amphibian

394
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,690
in the future.

395
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,620
Alright.

396
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,080
Although you don't fly much in the future,

397
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,920
my requirements for you

398
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,050
will never be lower.

399
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:45,490
I promise I won't let you down.

400
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:46,580
Bye.

401
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,080
Thank you, Jia.

402
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,170
How is it going?

403
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,900
All female pilots' experience reports

404
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,680
of the Passenger Transport Department

405
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,830
are almost done.

406
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,740
But there are still some incomplete files.

407
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,000
Let's go to the archive room and fix them.

408
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:56,730
That's all for today.

409
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,500
By the way,

410
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,240
what are you going to do

411
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,160
about the research on flight universities and ordinary universities?

412
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,090
Time is limited.

413
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,080
We can only use the phone form.

414
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,230
You can contact the student council directly.

415
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,760
It can improve efficiency.

416
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,920
I've discussed with Song.

417
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,140
Our flight will be staggered next week.

418
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,070
We take turns...

419
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,330
Take turns to do it.

420
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,230
Pilots should always take care of their health.

421
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,630
Don’t stay up late again.

422
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,410
Ms. Gu, how many times have you said that?

423
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,550
Besides, you stayed up late too.

424
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,510
It has more influence on girls.

425
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,730
Are you caring about me?

426
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,070
Let me send you home.

427
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,930
Hello, are you Mr. Gu?

428
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,350
Yes.

429
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,880
Did you call a designated driver?

430
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,760
No driving while fatigued.

431
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,780
Oh my god.

432
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,940
Instructor Gu, you live so carefully.

433
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,240
Give it to me.

434
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,930
Thank you.

435
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,370
Get in.

436
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,160
Are you ready?

437
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,260
Yes.

438
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,550
OK.

439
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,100
Come on.

440
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:46,970
Three.

441
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,060
Two.

442
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,080
One.

443
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:49,810
Go.

444
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,720
You only see

445
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:56,750
beautiful flight attendants smiling at you,

446
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:00,140
but you can't see their real life.

447
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,520
It's always midnight after the flight.

448
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,610
She was exhausted

449
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,880
and walked like a shadow

450
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,930
with all the occupational diseases in the dark.

451
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:11,960
At this moment, she just wants to

452
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,270
run into the arms of the one who is waiting for her.

453
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:15,200
And the other one

454
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:19,090
just wants to be in the arms of the barbecue stall.

455
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,120
Unfortunately, no one is waiting for her at home.

456
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,580
The midnight stall has already been closed.

457
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,620
Only we are each other's home.

458
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,960
We rely on each other.

459
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,910
We'll set out again after we wake up.

460
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,750
Xia Xia, you're great.

461
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,990
It's nothing.

462
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:48,980
Yuheng.

463
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,830
There are 250,000 fans.

464
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,160
Gosh.

465
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,920
Great! Great!

466
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,140
250,000 fans.

467
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,290
[One Week Later]

468
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,670
You have four girls in your class, right?

469
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:14,480
OK.

470
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:15,430
Thank you.

471
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,240
Yes, I’m a pilot.

472
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,070
Sure.

473
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,630
After you graduate,

474
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,230
welcome to Luzhou Airlines.

475
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,610
Bye.

476
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,680
What are you thinking?

477
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,470
How's your progress?

478
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,330
After two more calls,

479
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,340
we'll be able to summarize it in the East China region.

480
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,860
Did I delay your plan?

481
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,540
To a tee.

482
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,510
Brother Nanting.

483
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,600
The paper report has been printed and stapled.

484
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,000
Everyone, one copy each.

485
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,990
Thank you for

486
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,690
these days.

487
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:34,840
Same to you.

488
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,460
This is our effort.

489
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,260
It won't be wasted.

490
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,640
In the past week,

491
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,190
we counted 11 aviation schools

492
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,000
26 airlines

493
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,960
and 21 ordinary universities.

494
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,680
Let's take a look at

495
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,410
research data of the aviation school.

496
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,570
The dropout rate of female pilots is 5%.

497
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:11,430
And male pilots

498
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,720
will reach 10% to 15%.

499
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:14,740
Besides,

500
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,450
there are also

501
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,410
the error rate

502
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,480
of female pilots at Luzhou Airlines.

503
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:20,600
The error rate that female pilots

504
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,040
are responsible for

505
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,280
is slightly lower than male pilots

506
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
by three percent.

507
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:26,480
Then,

508
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,350
combined with the in-time and reliable response

509
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:30,740
Cheng Xiao gave in the last accident,

510
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,200
our conclusion is

511
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,740
female pilots

512
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,670
have unique advantages.

513
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,490
Cheng Xiao is a controversial exception.

514
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,610
You are her instructor.

515
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,770
Your judgment

516
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,020
is inevitably mixed with subjective factors.

517
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,090
But the data research of Nanting

518
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:54,980
is very good.

519
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:57,030
I saw

520
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,060
the number of aviation graduates

521
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,550
from 11 aviation schools this year.

522
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,350
The boys are 389.

523
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,570
The girls are 25.

524
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,680
Such a vast gap between men and women.

525
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,580
Even if we recruit female pilots,

526
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:15,700
can we recruit them?

527
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,040
How many girls would like to sign up?

528
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,880
Mr. Jiang,

529
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,490
the last data

530
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:27,240
is the result of the investigation on women’s willingness.

531
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,800
We've investigated the 4th-year female students

532
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,280
who major in aviation-related from 21 ordinary universities.

533
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,740
The result is unexpected.

534
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,160
Their majors

535
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,740
have nothing to do with flying technology.

536
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,610
Most of them are aviation machinery,

537
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:42,270
transportation, communication, and service.

538
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,030
However,

539
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,610
33% of the girls said

540
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,640
they are very interested

541
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,910
in becoming pilots after graduation.

542
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,320
In general,

543
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,250
I suggest

544
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,150
we can boldly

545
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,370
recruit 5 to 8 percent

546
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,590
of female pilots

547
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,890
nationwide.

548
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,690
I didn't expect

549
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,280
there would be so many.

550
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,650
It means many girls nowadays

551
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,890
are very ambitious and strong.

552
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,630
I admire young people like them.

553
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,220
I also hope

554
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,800
more female pilots

555
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,910
will join us at Luzhou Airlines.

556
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,810
Actually,

557
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,050
this week,

558
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,780
I also did a little research.

559
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:31,910
Song,

560
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:34,290
distribute it to everyone for me.

561
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:37,640
I hope I can

562
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,060
share this with everyone.

563
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,300
Two days ago,

564
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,440
I asked my friends from the Civil Aviation Administration

565
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,710
to collect the next year's recruitment plan

566
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,970
for each airline.

567
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,800
There's more than 90 percent of airlines

568
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,400
state clearly in their recruitment brochures

569
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,040
that only men are recruited.

570
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:01,450
Indeed.

571
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,370
Every airline's willingness

572
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,770
to recruit female pilots

573
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,050
in the past few years

574
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,940
was more proactive than ours.

575
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,950
But now they make the same choice

576
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,340
at the same time.

577
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,230
Why?

578
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,830
Everyone,

579
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,090
it's obvious that

580
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,200
the other airlines

581
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,960
want to keep the profit.

582
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,830
The one who saves the profit

583
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,590
will be able to move forward

584
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,850
and grow stronger.

585
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,310
I didn't question other airlines.

586
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,370
But

587
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,830
I think we can make Luzhou Airlines

588
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,440
more open and with more diverse breakthroughs.

589
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,020
Ninety percent of the airlines did that.

590
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,720
Why must we choose something innovative

591
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,920
and bear the unknown management risks?

592
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:50,950
Nanting,

593
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,980
you've worked hard

594
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,100
to do such detailed research.

595
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,640
But it concerns the management of the company.

596
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,680
I have to think about it carefully.

597
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,710
Sorry.

598
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:07,240
I still reject

599
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,550
the female pilot recruitment plan for next year.

600
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,390
How is it?

601
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,880
How could it not pass?

602
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,230
Our research report

603
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,550
should be flawless.

604
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,390
But Mr. Jiang’s reason is more impeccable.

[Luzhou Airlines, Summer]

606
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,280
[Daily Work of A Flight Attendant]

607
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,050
[Hello, Captain Cheng. We are from New Insight, a speech platform. We invite experts from different fields to tell unique stories in each industry.]

608
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,050
[I learned from a friend at Luzhou Airlines that you behaved calmly and solved a flight accident.]

609
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,050
[We would like to invite you to our speech to talk about the story behind the airline industry.

610
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,050
[Thank you for your invitation. My hands are full. I don't have time.]

611
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:29,730
Here.

612
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:39,429
What’s up?

613
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,360
Regarding the female pilots' recruitment plan,

614
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,690
I have good news for you.

615
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,310
Good news?

616
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,679
You know this speech show, New Insight, right?

617
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,620
Yes, I watched it a bit before.

618
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,360
You mean...

619
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,880
Since Mr. Jiang can’t pass,

620
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,600
we can only make a detour.

621
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,490
I contacted the crew

622
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,040
to shoot next Monday.

623
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,800
They welcome it very much.

624
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,420
Besides,

625
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,200
no pilot has given a speech.

626
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,880
It should be interesting.

627
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,690
The content is about female pilots.

628
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,820
We expand the influence through the media

629
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,020
to make the company pay attention to it.

630
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,690
It's quite possible.

631
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,060
Thank you for your help.

632
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,580
You must take it seriously.

633
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,820
I'm not going.

634
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:29,920
You go.

635
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,950
I'm not a female pilot.

636
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,060
It's meaningless for me to give a speech.

637
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,660
We want a man

638
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,600
to speak

639
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,000
for the rights of women.

640
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:40,850
That will be more convincing

641
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,180
and more eye-catching.

642
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,060
Got it.

643
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,330
Your performance must be

644
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,210
better than mine.

645
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,060
OK.

646
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:10,750
Let me do it.

647
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,000
Thank you.

648
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,670
I'm doing this for our female pilot.

649
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,020
I hope one day

650
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,300
everyone can get rid of prejudice.

651
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:24,970
In this way,

652
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,990
everything we do is worth it.

653
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:52,790
Then...

654
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,320
let's go back.

655
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,820
I go back to prepare for the speech.

656
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,450
I'll go home and cook first.

657
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,370
What about you?

658
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,420
Me too.

659
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,700
There's no oil at home.

660
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,970
The supermarket is right after you go out.

661
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,910
The gas stove is broken.

662
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,840
What are you doing?

663
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,760
Call the property management

664
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,620
to check it out.

665
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:24,790
Instructor Gu,

666
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,640
you’d better get back to work.

667
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,900
Business comes first.

668
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,170
What about your dinner?

669
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,300
I'll order takeout.

670
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:38,730
What about me?

671
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,280
Let it be.

672
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,380
Why are you shooting me?

673
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,340
At 7 a.m.,

674
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,170
Captain Song’s day starts.

675
00:38:23,870 --> 00:38:24,800
What do you mean?

676
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,920
I'm making you famous and widely known.

677
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:31,490
This is the aviation video diary.

678
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,520
I can't only shoot the flight attendants.

679
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,380
I have to shoot more about pilots.

680
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,620
After all, you are the fantasy target

681
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,770
of the girl fans.

682
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,410
You can attract fans very quickly.

683
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,680
I'm gonna go get changed.

684
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,100
Don't change. Just wear this.

685
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,350
The contrast is cute.

686
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,890
This way,

687
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:53,910
it'll be a hit.

688
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,080
By the way,

689
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,600
when will your house get restored?

690
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,770
Soon.

691
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,950
The construction team keeps delaying.

692
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,340
I have no choice.

693
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
I'm going to work.

694
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,170
Wait.

695
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,700
Don't worry.

696
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,480
I'll go with you later.

697
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,160
The PR department arranged for me

698
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,490
to take a flight with you

699
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,860
to record your job.

700
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,560
My video is going to be posted

701
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,160
to the official account.

702
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,760
There are over a million fans on the official account.

703
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,210
Then you have to make me look handsome.

704
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:31,040
It depends on your daily performance.

705
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,960
My diet meals...

706
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,600
Don't worry.

707
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,520
In 365 days,

708
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:38,220
I will prepare different ones for you every day.

709
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,150
Come on, brush your teeth and pose.

710
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,160
Smile.

711
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:44,230
Put down your jaw.

712
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,470
Nice.

713
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,010
I need to take this call.

714
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,480
Okay.

715
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,450
Ni,

716
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,720
your cousin's third uncle's second daughter

717
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,200
will get married on the 8th of next month.

718
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:56,960
You must come back.

719
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,080
Mom, I know.

720
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,880
Bye.

721
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,210
I need to go to work. Bye.

722
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,990
Ni.

723
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:04,390
What is this?

724
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,330
Song Xiaoni.

725
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,520
Song Xiaoni.

726
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,840
Song Xiaoni.

727
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:27,980
Song Xiaoni.

728
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:28,770
Look back.

729
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:31,390
Get out!

730
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,120
Alright, I'm sorry.

731
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,050
I'm sorry, okay?

732
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,800
Hero Song.

733
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:36,770
Brother Song.

734
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,890
That’s more like it.

735
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,250
Captain Xie.

736
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,310
This is

737
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,020
the legendary place

738
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,390
with the most buttons in the world.

739
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,370
Luzhou 8251.

740
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,290
According to the arrangement,

741
00:41:01,290 --> 00:41:02,670
now has no take-off time yet.

742
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,600
Wait at the spot.

743
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,570
Copy that. Luzhou 8251.

744
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:22,710
Here.

745
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:24,530
Yuheng.

746
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,880
This is embarrassing.

747
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,000
You should give it to Captain Xie first.

748
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,650
Eat up.

749
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:29,260
Captain,

750
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,130
Ms. Ai asked me to remind you

751
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,380
don't forget to take stomach medicine.

752
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,300
I'll bring you food later.

753
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:35,980
Thank you.

754
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,720
Captain Xie.

755
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,650
Actually, I really envy you and Ms. Ai.

756
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,780
In the future,

757
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,780
I wish I could have

758
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,110
such a gentle flight attendant wife.

759
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,790
Sometimes I think

760
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,380
if anyone marries a pilot,

761
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,420
she suffers a loss.

762
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:03,030
Normally,

763
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,850
when I go out,

764
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,270
she just comes in.

765
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,550
I flew to Europe for the night.

766
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,500
She just flew back from Japan.

767
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:12,310
The number we had meals

768
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,920
at home together

769
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,270
can be counted on both hands.

770
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,770
But being flying families also has benefits.

771
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,320
At least you can understand each other's work

772
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,000
and support each other.

773
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,390
It seems

774
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,420
you have someone in your heart.

775
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,640
Wake up.

776
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,100
Food is ready.

777
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,150
Why hasn't it been mine?

778
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,340
You'll starve to death.
