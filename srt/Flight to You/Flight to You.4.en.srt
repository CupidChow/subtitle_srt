Speak it.

5
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,479
Actually,

6
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:40,180
they asked me to come over

7
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,390
and give you a suggestion.

8
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,120
Suggestion?

9
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,630
What suggestion?

10
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,890
You've been practicing too hard lately.

11
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:52,240
It's already not easy for us to catch up.

12
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,670
Moreover, you applied for extra training.

13
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,800
Even Da Peng who is tall and well-built

14
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,920
has been overwhelmed.

15
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,509
Who asked you to catch me up?

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,100
We have no choice because

17
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:01,840
what Brother Nanting requires

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,580
are all Cheng Xiao's standards now.

19
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,580
Thank him so much.

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,480
He treats me

21
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,580
as a tool.

22
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,120
He can pick on me whenever he dislikes me.

23
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,520
How dare I make a mistake?

24
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,880
You are different.

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,580
You can pass normal training.

26
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,829
Brother Nanting is not as evil as you said.

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,840
That's because you didn't see his behaviour

28
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,240
when he was with me alone.

29
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,300
You two are alone together.

30
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,790
Listen to the point.

31
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,820
Let me ask you.

32
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,280
From the Freight Department to the Passenger Transport Department,

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,720
normally, as long as we pass the pilot transition training assessment,

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,090
the position can't be demoted, right?

35
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,890
Of course.

36
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,520
How did Gu Congxin treat me?

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,160
I’m already qualified to be a captain.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,760
He insisted

39
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,690
to demote me from the first officer to an observer.

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,079
I slapped him in the face with the simulator test result,

41
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,040
but he didn't accept it.

42
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,250
He even gave me the last-place elimination.

43
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,680
The last one is demoted.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,720
Who do you think he is targeting?

45
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,270
He does have something against you.

46
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:51,190
That's why I'm saying he is sinister.

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,180
He is clearly a scheming boy,

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,400
but he still pretends like a very upright, trustworthy man.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,520
He's an undercover

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,720
and hard to deal with.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,040
Do you think the foreigner

52
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,320
is the same species as us?

53
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,450
The water is so cold.

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
There are only cold water and cold water with ice here.

55
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:10,940
Excuse me.

56
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,660
I'd like some warm water.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,570
Sorry, we don't serve warm water here.

58
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,500
Okay, thank you.

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,490
Warm water.

60
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,970
Is it for taking a shower?

61
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,650
I can't refute it.

62
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,660
You have to endure it.

63
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,120
We are not taking the blame for Gu Congxin.

64
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,730
I feel wronged.

65
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,970
Who knows us after the training?

66
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,670
Hold it.

67

Can you guys even understand all the English in the control room?

68
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,320
Can you understand English instructions?

69
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,200
They don't even understand what we're talking about.

70
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:42,840
Like this.

71
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,480
Tower. Tower. I do not speak English.

72
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,620
I hear that Chinese girls

73
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,880
don't have their minds.

74
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,340
Really?

75
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:49,990
Yes.

76
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,490
What are you doing here?

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,380
Didn't you see their instructor?

78
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,360
What can you learn from him?

79
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,079
How to be weak and timid?

80
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,030
Ridiculous.

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:00,680
It's not about being weak or timid.

82
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,710
It's about incapability.

83
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,550
He’s just an instructor who is tough on the surface.

84
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,350

What do you want?

87
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,950
What does she want?

88
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,210
What are you doing?

89
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,649
You must make a formal apology for your remarks.

90
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,850
Apologize, now.

91
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,290
You apologize first.

92
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,300
Why should we apologize first?

93
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,160
You started it.

94
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,160
You started it when you came here.

You speak Mandarin. You speak Mandarin.

Stop, stop, stop.

100
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:32,690
How about this?

101
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,480
We are pilots.

102
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,030
We solve the problems in the pilots’ way.

103
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,170
What do you mean?

104
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,010
The flight simulator test.

105
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,270
If I do better than you,

106
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,420
you say sorry

107
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
to all the Chinese trainees

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,940
in the same way your teacher did.

109
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,750
The flight simulator test.

110
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,570
Sounds funny.

111
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:54,760
But you'd better think about

112
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,470
what happens if you lose.

113
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
There is a strong possibility that it could happen.

114
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,100
I will apologize in the same way

115
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,850
and double the punishment.

116
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,020
Sounds simple.

117
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,470
Double?

118

Yes.

119
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:10,370
Deal.

120
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,650

Why did you go first?

[Luzhou Airlines]

128
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,800
Do you know why I recruited you?

129
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,040
Your height and weight are merely over the acceptance boundary

130
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,970
and you're not behaving properly.

131
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,880
I persuaded Ms. Liang from Flight Attendant Department

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,840
to hire you.

133
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,280
Because I saw

134
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,280
affability and flexibility on you.

135
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,840
I thought that was a good virtue

136
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
to bring you and the passengers closer.

137
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,520
But now I'm worried.

138
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,100
I think it might backfire.

139
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,030
No.

140
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,840

In the future,

143
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
I will study hard and practice hard.

144
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,130
I promise.

145
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,020
Are you sure you want to compete against the female trainee from Gu's team?

146
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:27,690
Yes, sir.

147
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,790
I'm confident I can beat her.

148
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,960
It sounds a bit like looking down on them,

149
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:34,600
but sir,

150
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,830
Eric just simply has

151
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,159
more than 200 hours on

152
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,310
a 787 simulator.

153
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,000
I guess that Chinese girl

154
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,060
has never seen one of those simulators.

155
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,460
It's gonna be so much fun.

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:44,980
And it's gonna be easy.

157
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,510
It will be very good too to see her with buckets of ice on her head.

158
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,330
Yes, I can't wait to see Gu's face.

It's really comfortable.

So,

it's great to waste some time

and take a walk like what we are doing now.

172

There's a lot of fun in life.

175
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,980
You haven't let it go yet.

176
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,360
What?

177
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,990
You know what I'm talking about.

178
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,830
The female pilot who works so hard.

179
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,170
I can tell from your attitude towards her.

180
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,770
You still couldn't let it go.

181
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,380
I'm doing my job.

182
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,090
It has nothing to do with other things.

183
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,370
Nanting,

184
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,950
have you ever thought about

185
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
not only one mode is allowed

186
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
in your life?

187
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,400
Pilots

188
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,230
also have different personalities other than yours.

189
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,060
[Gu is Recalling]

190
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,840
[I miss summer the most.]

191
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,300
I haven't talked to you for a long time.

192
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
I've been busy with work lately.

193
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,520
Ni Zhan is busy too.

194
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:36,950
We're all good.

196
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,740
Disengage the autopilot.

197
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,400
Disengage the autothrottle.

Take off...

200
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,510
Disengage the autopilot.

201
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,170
Disengage the autothrottle.

202

Next group.

203
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,440
You and Cheng Xiao work together

204
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,720
to complete the simulation project

205
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,880
with unreliable air speed.

206
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,310
Okay.

207
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,580
Where is your Wonder Woman?

208
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,010
What do you mean?

209
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,610
I don’t know.

210
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,540
I'll call Xiao.

211
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,770
No one answered.

212
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,610
I saw

213
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,670
Xiao posted something on Moments

214
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,130
in the middle of the night.

215
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,680
I must be staying up in the classroom

216
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,750
if not at the bar.

217
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,900
Cheng Xiao.

218
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,050
Cheng Xiao!

219
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,340
Cheng Xiao!

220
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,240
What's wrong?

221
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,360
Has she been up all night?

222
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,550
Yes.

223
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,400
She has this on her belly.

224
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,030
She must be on her period.

225
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,880
I gave her a glucose transfusion.

226
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,740
Let's wait for her to wake up.

227
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,240
She was overworked

228
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,260
and overtired.

229
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,180
Thanks. We will take good care of her.

230
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,940
I found out yesterday.

231
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,990
I didn't take it seriously.

232
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,680
It's not your fault.

233
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,500
This question is beyond the outline for you.

234
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,870
I'm an instructor.

235
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,720
I can't make any excuses.

236
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,900
Female pilots

237
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,140
have their own unique characteristics.

238
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,940
It’s not easy for a female pilot.

239
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:15,980
Especially Cheng Xiao.

240
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,580
She is too hard-working.

241
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,550
But as

242
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,240
a qualified passenger pilot,

243
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,570
she needs to be self-disciplined.

244
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,080
Actually, I understand you.

245
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,830
Punish her. It doesn't make sense.

246
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,710
But if you just let her go,

247
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,020
she will do that again.

248
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,490
How is it?

249
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,760
You can't do anything when you meet a female pilot like her, right?

250
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,220
She is reckless and lacks self-discipline.

251
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,830
These are all fundamental defects.

252
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:50,370
The point is she doesn't know these.

253
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,110
Go back to work.

254
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,420
I'm free today.

255
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,380
I can stay here.

256
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,000
I have to be responsible for my trainee.

257
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,109
There are more trainees

258
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,510
waiting for you outside.

259
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,210
Fine.

260
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,940
Tell me if you have any problems.

261
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,770
No worries.

262
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:15,960
By the way,

263
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,240
there's something wrong with you today.

264
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,250
What?

265
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,520
I haven't seen you

266
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,230
panicking like this for years.

267
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,850
It's out of control.

268
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,590
I'm not used to it.

269
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:38,640
Thanks.

270
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,250
Song,

271
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,350
I was a little late accidentally yesterday.

272
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,490
Then I might have fainted.

273
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,320
Thank you for sending me to the infirmary

274
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,180
and preparing sandwiches for me.

275
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:48,130
Help me to apply for sick leave from Gu Nanting.

276
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,220
You're awake.

277
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,120
It's difficult to find a cup of

278
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,720
ginger tea with brown sugar.

279
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:06,120
Here.

280
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:07,730
It's hot.

281
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,380
Don't you recognize me?

282
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,330
A car driver.

283
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,010
Mr. Ni.

284
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,960
Thank you.

285
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:21,560
It's hot.

286
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,520
Why are you here?

287
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,180
You fainted in the classroom.

288
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,640
You found me.

289
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,050
It was Mr. Gu.

290
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,780
What?

291
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,730
Are you embarrassed to be a pacesetter

292
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,860
or are you afraid of being criticized?

293
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,490
Mr. Gu is...

294
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,550
What’s his attitude?

295
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,360
He wanted to stay and take care of you,

296
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,960
but I persuaded him to leave.

297
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,890
Why don't I believe it?

298
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,650
Mr. Ni.

299
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you here for training?

300
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,080
This is Mr. Gu’s territory.

301
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,280
I dare not interfere.

302
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,660
I'm here for a meeting

303
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,520
and also an aviation exhibition.

304
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,880
Is it the Silong Aviation Exhibition?

305
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,340
Yes.

306
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,480
I heard that the most advanced fighter aircraft will attend.

307
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,820
And the pilots who do the performance

308
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,350
are one in a million.

309
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,580
I am going to watch it this afternoon.

310
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,600
Can you

311
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,520
cover me?

312
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,900
I want to go too.

313
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,400
Can you stand it?

314
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,680
Have a good rest.

315
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,800
As long as I take a look,

316
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,350
I'll have the best rest.

317
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:22,490
Please.

318
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm looking forward to this aviation exhibition so much.

319
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,180
I've been looking forward to it, please.

320
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,180
No, no, no.

321
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,580
If I take you there,

322
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,510
Nanting will strangle me to death.

323
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,900
The sun is rising from the west today.

324
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,850
I made a mistake twice.

325
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,260
Mr. Gu didn’t reprimand me.

326
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,390
The same goes for me.

327
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,470
I think

328
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,280
Mr. Gu probably thinks highly of my potential.

329
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,080
Enough, both of you. Enough.

330
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,340
Mr. Ni.

331
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,280
You're handsome.

332
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,210
You must be kind-hearted as well.

333
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,280
Please help me.

334
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,060
Please.

335
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:06,180
Listen.

336
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,880
I'm quitting sugar recently.

337
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,110
Your sugar-coated bullets are useless.

338
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:10,680
You...

339
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,490
But I...

340
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,950
[Gu Nanting]

341
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,990
Speak of the devil.

342
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,110
Don't expose yourself.

343
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,080
Just tell him

344
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,480
that I need to stay for observation.

345
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,240
Please.

346
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
How is Cheng Xiao?

347

Xiao is very diligent and serious.

Did she often practice overnight before this?

375
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Of course.

In terms of training,

[Luzhou Airlines, In-Flight Service Training Department]

394
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,050
The core of our training today

395
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,250
is safety awareness.

396
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,990
Many people have misunderstandings

397
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,240
towards flight attendants.

398
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,280
They think we are just waiters in the air.

399
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,060
But in fact,

400
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,950
our first job is to be a cabin expert.

401
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,520
The priority of the flight attendant

402
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,400
is to ensure the safety of the flight

403
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,060
and the safety of passengers.

404
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:30,340
So for the next 90 percent of the time,

405
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,540
we are training for some safety skills.

406
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,800
Today we are training for

407
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,080
the emergency treatment when the cabin caught fire.

There's a fire signal from the restroom.

Is anyone there?

I'm running out of fire extinguishers.

416

Next team, get ready.

421
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,940
During emergency,

422
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,200
every flight attendant

423
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
should put on the life jacket

424
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
before helping the passengers.

425
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,080
Never pump air into the life jacket

426
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,090
when in the cabin.

427
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:05,910
Does anyone know why?

428
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:08,620
Xiazhi.

429
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,570
It is because

430
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,280
the plane has to make a forced landing

431
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,840
on the water surface during an emergency.

432
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,500
If the plane is damaged and the cabin is flooded,

433
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,000
the passengers in the life jacket

434
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,840
may be on the top of this cabin.

435
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,080
But the emergency exit is at the bottom of the cabin.

436
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:24,540
So it may cause

437
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:26,370
the passengers can't evacuate.

438
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:26,910
Good.

439
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,700
I'm still thinking about how to treat it.

440
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I have some ideas.

441
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,430

00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:56,790
One of them will play the role of a passenger.

520
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,520
Go get ready.

521
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,650
Team One, get ready.

522
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,550
Team Two, get ready.

523
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,550
What's wrong, Li Yuheng?

524
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,080
Ms. Ai, I...

525
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,070
I can't swim.

526
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,400
It's okay. You have a life jacket.

527
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,449
Yuheng.

528
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,840
You've been doing well.

529
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,270
It'll be fine too this time.

530
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,469
Believe in yourself.

531
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,199
Come on.

532
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:18,889
Go, Yuheng!

533
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,590
Are you okay?

534
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,290
Xia,

535
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,200
your hair.

536
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,560
I wanted to praise you for being

537
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,480
flexible and team-spirited for the first time.

538
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,180
Is that what you return to me?

539
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,030
I'm sorry, Ms. Ai.

540
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:21,330
I was wrong.

541
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,590
Why on earth did you want to be a flight attendant, Xiazhi?

542
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,270
I...

543
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,500
Some people take this job

544
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,410
as a stepping stone to success.

545
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,770
Once they marry a rich husband, they will change their professions.

546
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,490
Some people

547
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,430
have a real blue sky dream.

548
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,790
But in my perspective,

549
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,710
this is only an ordinary job.

550
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,960
Meet different passengers every day

551
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,620
and send them to their destinations safely.

552
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,620
This is my sense of accomplishment.

553
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,710
Do you know what my biggest reward is

554
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,110
when I feel so tired from working every day?

555
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,600
It is when every time the passengers

556
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,320
give me a sincere smile

557
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,880
and say thank you to me.

558
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:00,800
I think

559
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,820
the effort is worth it.

560
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,380
The flight attendant is never a cushy job.

561
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,560
Suffering.

562
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:10,350
Tiring.

563
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:11,900
Not to mention the stress,

564
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,030
it may lead to occupational diseases.

565
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,200
So if it's just a whim,

566
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,350
I suggest you

567
00:37:17,870 --> 00:37:18,720
quit early

568
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,400
and stop the loss.

569
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:28,920
I admit that

570
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,080
I just wanted to give it a try

571
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,340
during the interview.

572
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,720
I didn't take this job seriously.

573
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,530
But after half a month of training,

574
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,520
I realized that

575
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,000
this job is not easy.

576
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,100
To be honest,

577
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,530
I've done many jobs before.

578
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,550
I've given up many times too.

579
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,810
But if I give up again this time,

580
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,920
I'm afraid that

581
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,110
I won't trust myself anymore.

582
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,600
If you pass the training assessment,

583
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,850
you'll be on the flight in about two months.

584
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,620
There is still time

585
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,270
for your hair to grow longer.

586
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,420
Instructor Gu,

587
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,670
I’ve thought about it.

588
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,050
I have my persistence.

589
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,290
Also, I'm not afraid of your revenge.

590
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,780
My personal advice

591
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,280
won’t affect your evaluation.

592
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,680

593
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,660
wants to stay.

594
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,960
But only if you pass.

595
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,330
I'll prove that I'm qualified.

596
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,350
But I want a fair witness.

597
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,180
No need.

598
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,660
You are the best witness.

599
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,160
I hope you can be fair to yourself.
