You can find these information, right?

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,560
Yes. But you need to memorize them.

38

00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,870
Bye, Auntie.

178
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
Travel safe.

179
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,240
OK.

180
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:46,400
Yu told me that she's also at Luzhou Airlines.

181
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,580
Yes.

182
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,410
To think that

183
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,120
after she finished postgrad,

184
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,120
she made a career switch to become a flight attendant.

185
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,760
You're not like your dad at all.

186
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,760
Mom? You think too much.

187
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,680
That's not what's happening.

188
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,210
Would I lie to you about something like this?

189
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,010
By the way, these are the records

190
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,610
for the eight flights today.

191
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,760
I'll take over later.

192
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
How do you feel after your first day?

193
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,890
Not bad.

194
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,780
Did they tell you where to sit?

195
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,860
Here.

196
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,550
I sit here. We're next to each other.

197
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,000
Okay.

198
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,540
As for the lockers,

199
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,470
you can use whichever one is empty.

200
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,400
Okay, thank you.

201
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,540
If there's nothing else,

202
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,540
you can go back and rest early today.

203
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,730
I'm not going home today.

204
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,080
I'm in charge of the first flight at 5:30.

205
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,070
My home is close to the company and far from the airport,

206
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,100
and it's expensive to cab.

207
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,000
I'll take a nap in the office later.

208
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,520
Here?

209
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,620
How can you sleep here?

210
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,390
It's fine. Anywhere here is OK.

211
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,520
I used to sleep in the cargo cabin all the time

212
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,160
back when I flew cargo planes.

213
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,080
I'm used to it.

214
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,230
OK.

215
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:24,210
Call me if you need anything.

00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,080
How is it?

249
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,040
Nothing went wrong.

Cheng Xiao should return to the Flight Department?

and now you're asking her to come back?

Won't it seem that

259
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,859
our arrangements are not serious?

260
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,160
I think

261
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,880
at least let her stay for a whole month.

It's more convenient to get a car.

320
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
Then you mustn't let her know

321

I'm working on ground service.

322

I'll wait for you.

331

I'm not sure. I'll try my best.

332

Right?

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,910
He just wants to embarrass me.

349
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,590
Why would he embarrass you?

350
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,140
You're thinking too much.

351
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,700
Mr. Gu is not like that.

352
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,780
Approach him and let him know first.

353
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,730
OK?

354
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,480
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

355
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,280
You’re welcome.

356
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,940
Come to me if he doesn't agree.

357

Pilots must obey the rules pertaining to food and drinks

359
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,350
and not bring food into the flight deck.

360
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:37,340
During the outstation period,

361
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:39,550
pilots are not allowed to participate in any high-risk sports.

362
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,720
The metal airline badge is to be replaced with soft material.

363
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,780
In the flight deck,

364
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:43,910
the sharp corners of the metal

365
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,570
can cause accidental injury.

366
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:49,410
There are 128 new regulations in total.

367
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,410
Brother Nanting,

368
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,000
you're so thoughtful.

369
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,030
You have nipped all the risk factors

370
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,330
in the bud.

371
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,260
That's not enough.

372
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,690
I am planning to develop

373
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:03,200
a safety management system

374
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,220
that can cover all aspects

375
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,620
without any blind spots.

376
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,370
I hope

377
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,090
we can achieve the highest safety goal.

378
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,280
What can I do for you?

379
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,320
If you're not afraid of hard work,

380
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,160
you can work on it together with me.

381
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,090
You have no idea.

382
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,040
I love bitter gourd with black coffee.

383
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,720
And I use a bowl of Chinese medicine as mouthwash.

384
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,030
With such tolerance, I'm a prime candidate

385
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,560
to be an assistant.

386
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,450
Fine.

387
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll officially hire you as an assistant.

388
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:33,920
Regarding the extra salary, I'll propose it to the company.

389
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,580
Will there be an extra salary?

390
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,750
I just want to learn from you.

391
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,110
Brother Nanting.

392
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,340
When can Xiao

393
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,820
be transferred back to the Flight Department?

394
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,010
Well,

395
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,550
the company will arrange it.

396
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,070
Send those documents

397
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:06,400
to the Operation Management Department.

398
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:07,770
Okay.

399
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,520

400

You still need to wait.

401
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:49,870

402

Later,

403
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,410
I'll persuade Brother Nanting more.

is having a learning exchange.

421

If so, as a judge,

why don't you have a learning exchange

423

Xiaoxiao is already an adult now.

426

If there's anything,

427
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,530
she can take care of it herself.

428

Let her take care of it?

429
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,500
That only resulted in

430

00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,900
I can transfer to another school.

521
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,200
Xiaoxiao,

522
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,140
I know

523
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,060
you've always liked flying.

524
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,220
Now that you're really studying this major,

525
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,020
I hope you will

526
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,850
hang in there.

527
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,100
I'll always support you.

528
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,570
Cheng, you're so good to me.

529
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,770
I love you.

530
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,160
Don’t worry.

531
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,160
I will become a captain in the future.

532
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,290
I won't let you down.

533
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,490
Hello, are you going to Shenzhen?

534
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,070
Yes.

535
00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:27,240
Okay, you may get in the car.

536
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:27,640
Hello.

537
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,170
Hello.

538
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,000
Let me do it.

539
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,400
Okay, thank you.

540
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,960
Get in the car first.

541
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,760
OK. Thank you.

542
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,820
Cheng Xiao.

543
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,080
Mr. Ni.

544
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,880
Why are you...

545
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,850
I'm training at the Ground Handling Department.

546
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,760
Are you going on a business trip today?

547
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,550
I was going to fly,

548
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,350
but something came up. I changed my flight to this afternoon.

549
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:52,500
When are we leaving?

550
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,070
Soon.

551
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:55,420
Go ahead.

552
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:00,900
Sorry.

553
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,070
It's okay.

554
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,810
Sit tight. Let's go.

555
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,420
Yue.

556
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:36,050
Where are you?

557
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,820
I'm in my boss' office.

558
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,719
I was tidying up the data until late at night,

559
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,580
so I fell asleep

560
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,909
and missed your call.

561
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:42,840
Which boss?

562
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,300
Is it a woman?

563
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,270
No, no.

564
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,130
It's a man. It's definitely a man.

565
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,179
Why didn't you sleep in Cai's office

566
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,440
when you worked in the Freight Department?

567
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,620
Resign from that assistant position immediately.

568
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,290
Can we stop joking, Yue?

569
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
If you don't quit,

570
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,860
let's not be together.

571
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,450
Don't be unreasonable.

572
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,130
Hello.

573
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,940
You are...

574
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,360
Mr. Ni from the Maintenance Department.

575
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,830
I'm here to wait for Nanting to come to work.

576
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,170
When Brother Nanting doesn't fly,

577
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,330
he comes to the office at 9 am.

578
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,280
Not even a second off.

579
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,630
He's just a walking clock.

580
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,560
Why are you here?

581
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,820
I need to talk to you.

582
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,200
Here.

583
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,670
Your taste.

584
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
No sugar, no milk.

585
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,460
Did you sleep here last night?

586
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,940
I slept on time. I didn't stay up late.

587
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,970
I'm leaving now.

588
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:00,200
Goodbye, Brother Nanting. Goodbye, Mr. Ni.

589
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:00,630
Bye.

590
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,410
Tell me.

591
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:07,790
You won't treat me to coffee

592
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,840
in the early morning without any purpose.

593
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,460
What is it?

594
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,660
Let me ask you something.

595
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:16,490
What's wrong with that female pilot?

596
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,450
Do you mean Cheng Xiao?

597
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,030
I heard about the flight during the Spring Festival.

598
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,490
But she doesn't have to go to ground service.

599
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,390
It was Mr. Jiang’s decision.

600
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,120
I also think that

601
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,800
no matter what mistake Cheng Xiao made,

602
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,110
she shouldn't be transferred to ground service.

603
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,730
I plan to

604
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,280
talk to Mr. Xu

605
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:38,580
once he returns.

606
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,700
You're going over Mr. Jiang's head?

607
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,900
It's inappropriate.

608
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:44,010
We will just talk about the facts.

609
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:46,040
It's indeed your personality.

610
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,300
Actually,

611
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,390
we can be more tactful.

612
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,260
What's the reason for the delay?

613
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,010
Shouldn't we

614
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,540
explain it to the passengers?

615
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,570
We haven't received

616
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,030
any specific reasons yet.

617
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,560
There is a thunderstorm on the flight path.

618
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,200
The nearest route to Guangzhou

619
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,130
is also covered by thunderstorms.

620
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,300
The airport needs to be adjusted, and the route needs to be controlled.

621
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,390
Moreover, there's a go-around difference.

622
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,320
We don't know how long it will take.

623
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,050
God is just like humans.

624
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,870
Sometimes he's in a bad mood.

625
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,770
Zhengyu.

626
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:42,720
The food is here.

627
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,000
Deliver them the food first.

628
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,330
Okay.

629
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,410
Hello, passengers.

630
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,840
Attention all passengers

631
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,860
herading to Guangzhou

632
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,570
aboard flight XD8311 with Luzhou airlines.

633
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:55,690
We will now distribute meals for you.

634
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,400
Please have your boarding pass ready

635
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,950
and wait patiently in your seats.

636
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:01,810
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

637
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,870
Here's your meal.

638
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

639
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,240
The meal is ready.

640
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,770
Are we not allowed to leave?

641
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,400
Yeah, how long is it going to take?

642
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,620
How long will it take?

643
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:12,750
Sorry.

644
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,980
We’re waiting for the captain’s order.

645
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,460
When can we take off?

646
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,000
We, as the ground staff, are also unclear

647
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,440
about the situation.

648
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,520
So we can't give

649
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,200
the exact time.

650
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:21,680
Please understand that.

651
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
Why didn't you report

652
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
the delayed flight?

653
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,340
Yeah.

654
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,490
You have to tell us the reason.

655
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,390
Otherwise, we wouldn't know

656
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,360
what's going on, right?

657
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,320
Yes, give us a reason. Yes.

658
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,630
It's because of the weather.

659
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,210
Weather?

660
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,660
The weather is so nice outside.

661
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,300
I checked the weather in Guangzhou.

662
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,320
There's no wind or rain, and no fog also.

663
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Here's the thing.

664
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,440
There are many different situations that could happen with the weather.

665
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,170
Apart from an inability to takeoff at the departure airport

666
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,370
and to land at the destination airport,

667
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:50,480
there is another situation.

668
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,960
It is that the weather on the flight path

669
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,880
is not suitable for flying.

670
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,200
We just checked.

671
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,880
There's a thunderstorm area on the flight path.

672
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,920
The sky is so big.

673
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,520
Can't you just take a detour?

674
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
There are many planes in the sky,

675
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,080
just like on a road.

676
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:06,160
Besides, due to flight safety and national defense needs,

677
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,550
the flight path for commercial flights is limited.

678
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,480
There's very little room for a detour or a go-around.

679
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,110
Alright.

680
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,380
You're wasting time.

681
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,480
You go first.

682
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,590
How is your work?

683
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:59,190
Are you still in charge of me even when I'm a ground staff?

684
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:02,650
After all, you are still a member of our Flight Department.

685
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,300
So,

686
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,720
when can I return to the Flight Department?

687
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,210
Hello.

688
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,110
Okay.

689
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,830
Mechanical malfunction.

690
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:27,990
Dear passengers,

691
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,240
I'm sorry to inform you

692
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,310
that flight XD831 to Guangzhou

693
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,440
has had a mechanical malfunction.

694
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,220
The repair cannot be done in a short period.

695
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,190
Please wait patiently for further notice.

696
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:37,790
Thank you.

697
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,370
Mechanical malfunction.

698
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,740
Didn't you say it's because of the weather?

699
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,750
What's going on?

700
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,790
We just received a notice that it's a mechanical malfunction.

701
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,650
But there was indeed a thunderstorm on the flight path.

702
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,650
Cut the crap.

703
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,170
You need to compensate if it's a mechanical malfunction.

704
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,450
But you don't need to if it's because of the weather.

705
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,760
Are you trying to deny our compensation?

706
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,860
If it's delayed by a mechanical malfunction,

707
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,670
you must compensate us immediately.

708
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,870
Sir, we have a rule.

709
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,520
Only when it's delayed for more than four hours,

710
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,960
can we arrange for accommodation

711
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,840
or make compensation.

712
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,080
Please wait patiently.

713
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,440
I don't have that patience.

714
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,880
How long do we have to wait?

715
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,600
Sorry, sir.

716
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,000
We can't be sure.

717
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,480
It depends on

718
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,160
what has caused the mechanical malfunction.

719
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:12,840
Here's the thing.

720
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,440
If it's a flight control computer,

721
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,120
it will take two hours to repair it.

722
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,200
If it's a severe malfunction,

723
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,600
such as an engine,

724
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,640
it may take three hours

725
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,560
because we need to change the plane.

726
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,520
Nonsense.

727
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,320
I can't wait anymore.

728
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,240
Sir, calm down.

729
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,330
Please calm down.

730
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,030
Sir.

731
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:27,480
Cheng.

732
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,350
I...

733
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,850
I...

734
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,170
What are you doing?

735
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,360
Do you want to hit me?

736
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,800
Someone is making trouble at Gate 79.

737
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,860
What are you doing?

738
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,260
Let go!

739
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,180
Let go!

740
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,950
There are surveillance cameras at all the boarding gates.

741
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,680
I recorded everything you did.

742
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,780
What happened?

743
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:09,520
This man was making a scene

744
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,320
and splashed water on our staff.

745
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,240
Hello, passenger.

746
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,320
I'm a police officer at the Luzhou Airport.

747
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,200
What you did just now

748
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,480
is suspected of endangering public safety.

749
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,540
Please cooperate with our investigation

750
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,800
at the police station.

751
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,660
Please come with us

752
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:25,970
to help us understand the situation.

753
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,370
Let's go.

754
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,770
I want to take leave tonight, is that okay?

755
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:38,970
No problem, Cheng.
