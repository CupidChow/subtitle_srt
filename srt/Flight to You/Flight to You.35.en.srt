4
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,070
Witness,

5
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,000
in the air-ground communications played in court just now,

6
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,120
airport control informed you all that the airport was closed.

7
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,890
Was that in fact

8
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,950
what you heard in the cockpit?

9
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,160
No.

10
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,430
Witness,

11
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,900
during the emergency medical investigation

12
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,370
held by Luzhou Airlines regarding Flight 805,

13
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:00,370
how did you describe the situation?

14
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:01,440
I...

15
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,110
Witness, please answer.

16
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,639
At that time...

17
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:12,980
I...

18
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,670
According to the meeting records,

19
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,430
Observer Lin Yicheng said,

20
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,270
"We didn't proceed with the diversion.

21
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,010
On one hand, the patient's condition

22
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,800
had improved.

23
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,570
On the other hand,

24
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,060
the only airport available for a diversion

25
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,980
had been closed

26
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,860
due to special circumstances."

27
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,350
right?

28
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,110
Yes, but that's not the truth.

29
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,490
What do you mean?

30
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,540
You mean you lied

31
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,760
at the investigation meeting?

32
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,840
Did you lie?

33
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,070
I...

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,200
I was thinking about the company's interests.

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,490
Yes.

36
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,840
I did lie.

37
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,510
Are you

38
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,150
lying right now?

39
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,630
Is he lying?

40
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,900
Your Honor.

41
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,560
His testimony

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,190
and his statement at the company's investigation meeting

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,330
are contradictory.

44
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,350
We believe

45
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,640
the witness' testimony is not reliable.

46
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,470
Do either party

47
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,620
have any further objections?

48
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,829
I have no objections.

49
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,990
No objections.

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,770
Witness, please leave.

51
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,170
Your Honor.

52
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,740
My goodness.

53
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,420
Lin Yicheng is on our side.

54
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,670
Yicheng.

55
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,040
Thank you.

56
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,840
I might not have been

57
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,220
of any use.

58
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,360
Thank you.

59
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:58,130
The trial has already started.

60
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,460
Is it too late?

61
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,850
But I'm already at Luzhou Airport.

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,480
What?

63
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,330
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:09,590
In our country,

65
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,200
this is called romance.

66
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,360
Your Honor,

67
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,490
we request the third witness

68
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,160
to be called to the stand.

69
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,850
I'm the captain of Merians Airlines,

70
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,900
Camille Ferris.

71
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,400
At the time of the incident,

72
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,260
I was about to enter the airfield.

73
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:51,270
I heard the communication between airport control and flight XD805.

74
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:57,430
Airport control approved their request for a diversion

75
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,790
and commanded my flight

76
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,600
and a flight from Gansa Airlines

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,730
to remain on standby

78
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,990
so as to stay clear of XD805.

79
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,300
About five minutes later,

80
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,460
I heard the captain of Luzhou Airlines tell airport control

81
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,460
that the patient had gotten better.

82
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,640
He decided to head straight to Singapore

83
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,100
and cancel the diversion.

84
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,320
So I prepared to enter the airfield once again.

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,500
So, at that time,

86
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,850
were Saigon Airport's runways closed?

87
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,190
Were Saigon Airport's runways closed?

88
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:36,920
No.

89
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,330
Thank you, Captain Camille.

90
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,390
You’re welcome.

91
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,980
Are you the first officer?

92
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,620
My name is Cheng Xiao.

93
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,540
Nice to meet you.

94
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,740
Nice to meet you too,

95
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,400
Camille.

96
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,350
Why did you change your mind?

97
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,520
Well...

98
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,550
After you left, when I went back to the hotel,

99
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,520
my first officer said

100
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,090
you had waited for me

101
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,250
in the countryside for two whole days.

102
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,180
So I thought

103
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,600
which airline had pilots

104
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,060
who were so steadfast in their common faith.

105
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,310
You see.

106
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,990
I once thought

107
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,090
my husband and I really loved each other.

108
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,520
But in the end,

109
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,650
he didn’t want me to fly.

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,010
He wanted me to stay at home and take care of our child.

111
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,770
Later on,

112
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,010
we got divorced.

113
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,640
After that, I never found

114
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,300
another person

115
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,240
who could truly appreciate me and support me.

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,090
That's why

117
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,480
I decided to be a witness.

118
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,310
I really envy you.

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,770
Of course,

120
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,220
I really admire your courage to pursue the truth.

121
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,260
So I decided to be a witness.

122
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,570
Thank you.

123
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:28,600
Thank you, Camille.

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,390
My pleasure.

125
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,220
Thank you.

126
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,240
Thank you.

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,130
I'm going to pick up my luggage.

128
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,620
See you.

129
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:34,289
See you later.

130
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:34,760
See you.

131
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,240
Out of all our testimonies,

132
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,840
perhaps the only one the judge can believe

133
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
is Camille's.

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,260
So we can't be sure

135
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,870
of the final result.

136
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,690
You're not alone now.

137
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,010
I'm here.

138
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,270
So many people are supporting you.

139
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,140
The court debate is over.

140
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:11,820
We will proceed to mediate this case

141
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,360
according to

142
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,320
Article 9,

143
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,920
Subarticle 93

144
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,190
of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China.

145
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,380
The two parties must agree

146
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,750
to the content of the resolution of the mediation.

147
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,320
It must abide by the laws,

148
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,460
and cause no harm to the country

149
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,320
and other people's legal rights.

150
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:31,770
Do both parties

151
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,590
consent to mediation

152
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,940
by the court?

153
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,710
Just reject it.

154
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,730
We won't lose.

155
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,990
I will accept mediation.

156
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:15,660
Your Honor,

157
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,120
I need to discuss this with my client.

158
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,470
Why did you accept mediation?

159
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:24,800
The probability of the judge

160
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
ruling against us is extremely low.

161
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,200
Even if it's proven that the recording was falsified,

162
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,400
that's what happened after the flight.

163
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
It has nothing to do with

164
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,760
your decision on the flight.

165
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,760
You and Luzhou Airlines

166
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,880
will not face any civil liabilities.

167
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,890
Think about it.

168
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,000
Mr. Guo,

169
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,870
I'm willing to

170
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,350
publicly apologize

171
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,140
and compensate you for your loss.

172
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,290
We agree

173
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
to the mediation.

174
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,820
It's been settled?

175
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,110
It's been settled?

176
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,630
That’s rare.

177
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,100
Mr. Jiang proposed the settlement.

178
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,430
He agreed to apologize?

179
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,340
Captain Cheng.

180
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,240
Thank you.

181
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,910
Thank you.

182
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:34,890
Thank you.

183
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,520
No, no, no.

184
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,420
Go back and rest.

185
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,600
I’m worried about you.

186
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,340
Do you like being a pilot that much?

187
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,370
Do you have to be a pilot?

188
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,230
Yes.

189
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,570
Ms. Fang,

190
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:36,100
the plaintiff's lawyer is waiting for you in the lounge.

191
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,860
So,

192
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,480
it's time for me to leave.

193
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,970
Have you arranged your schedule for the next few days?

194
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,300
Do you need a tour guide?

195
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,340
Thank you, but it's okay.

196
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,890
I often fly to China.

197
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,970
It's not difficult for me to find my way around.

198
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,040
Look.

199
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,480
I have even rented a car.

200
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,190
It's so convenient.

201
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,280
Good choice.

202
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,900
Thank you.

203
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,350
We'll go visit you in France in the future.

204
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,420
With pleasure.

205
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:22,600
Cheng Xiao,

206
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,630
I hope you can become a captain soon

207
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,530
and keep flying, like me.

208
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,210
Bye.

209
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,020
Take care.

210
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,650
After you get back,

211
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,200
please send me the bill for the ticket.

212
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,880
I'll pay.

213
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,810
I won't forget that. Believe me.

214
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,230
Okay.

215
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,560
Okay, take care.

216
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,690
-Bye. -Bye.

217
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,030
Bye.

218
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,900
Bye.

219
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,740
Brother Nanting, Cheng Xiao.

220
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,930
You are the bravest people I've met at Luzhou Airlines.

221
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:56,190
You're my role models.

222
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,420
Let's go back.

223
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,530
I'm starving.

224
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,120
Let's go home and cook.

225
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,890
We must make a feast today to celebrate.

226
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,480
Aren't you going to invite me?

227
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:14,980
What?

228
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,800
I can't hear you.

229
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:17,940
Bye.

230
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,520
Let's go.

231
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,170
Let me see you off.

232
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:46,760
Thank you.

233
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,120
It's okay.

234
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:50,390
No, rather,

235
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,400
This had nothing to do with you.

237
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,920
Now you've gotten involved.

238
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,330
The result doesn't matter.

239
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,190
What matters is

240
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,920
I'm willing to do this for you.

241
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,620
Cheng Xiao,

242
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:18,430
I have something to tell you.

243
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,620
Wait.

244
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,530
Zhan.

245
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
I'm sorry.

246
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,990
It's been difficult for you

247
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:51,020
during this time.

248
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,790
I wasn't on your side.

249
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,570
I'm the one who should be sorry.

250
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
You did it for my sake. I know.

251
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,660
I have always treated you

252
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,790
the way I thought would be good for you.

253
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,069
But I have never thought about

254
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,780
what you wanted.

255
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,420
Don't say that.

256
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,369
Cheng Xiao,

257
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,050
there's something

258
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,040
I have to tell you face to face.

259
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,260
Go ahead.

260
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,150
I've liked you

261
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,480
for a long time.

262
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,050
Actually, I know

263
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,540
you already know this.

264
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,260
You have also

265
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,990
rejected me in your own way.

266
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,030
I...

267
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,660
If I can say it,

268
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,720
it means

269
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,030
I've let it go.

270
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,120
I just had to say it out loud in person.

271
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,180
Otherwise,

272
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,860
I would be too much of a coward.

273
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,180
I don't know what to say.

274
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Has he confessed?

275
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm afraid

276
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
I can't be at ease with you two

277
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,080
for a while.

278
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,400
But I hope

279
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,000
we can be friends again in the future.

280
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,830
In my heart, you've always been my friend.

281
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,860
My good friend.

282
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,850
A congratulatory hug...

283
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,990
You're not that stingy, are you?

284
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,480
I'll get going then.

285
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,080
Thank you.

286
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:21,750
Ni Zhan...

287
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,390
He's my buddy.

288
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
What's wrong?

289
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:35,620
Let's go.

290
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,170
I have something to tell you.

291
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,200
-Cheng Xiao. -I…

292
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,200
Come back to Qingdao with me.

293
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,600
What are you doing?

294
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,330
Why are you forcing me?

295
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,880
Don't think that today's lawsuit

296
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,780
is satisfying.

297
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,140
Do you think you can stay for long

298
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,270
at Luzhou Airlines?

299
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,000
Even if the company fires me,

300
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,400
I will stay until the end.

301
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,520
What is the point

302
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,930
of this meaningless persistence?

303
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,060
Cheng Xiao, can you be more dignified?

304
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,860
Auntie,

305
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,430
actually, the company may not decide—

306
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,900
Shut up.

307
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,670
I’m talking to my daughter.

308
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,500
Ms. Fang,

309
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,600
even if Luzhou Airlines fires me,

310
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,380
I will apply for a job at another airline.

311
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,250
If it doesn't hire me,

312
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,980
I'll find a second, and a third.

313
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,310
Let me put it this way.

314
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:32,410
I want to be a pilot even if it kills me.

315
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,160
You...

316
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,300
-Auntie. -Mom.

317
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,160
President Xu.

318
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,330
I dragged the company down.

319
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm willing to compensate the deceased's family

320
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,510
out of my own pocket,

321
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,340
and accept any punishment

322
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,890
the company deems fit.

323
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,620
The fraudulent action of Saigon Airport Control

324
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,570
has been reported to the local supervisors.

325
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,210
You must cooperate with their investigation.

326
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,970
The company will hold a press conference tomorrow.

327
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,990
The decision on your matter

328
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,280
will be announced during the conference.

329
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,110
The patient's blood pressure has dropped.

330
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,600
After the examination,

331
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,350
we didn't find any complications with cerebrovascular disease.

332
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,280
She is doing well.

333
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,970
Doctor,

334
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,380
why isn't she awake yet?

335
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,850
She just took some medicine. She needs more rest.

336
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,400
Please be careful.

337
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,130
Don't provoke the patient.

338
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:28,730
Thank you, Doctor.

339
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,130
This was the only one downstairs.

340
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,950
I asked the shopkeeper to heat it up.

341
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,350
Thank you.

342
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,760
Have some.

343
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:06,060
You still have to take care of your mother.

344
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,070
Don't go to

345
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,030
tomorrow's press conference.

346
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,100
I want to go.

347
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,090
I want to see Mr. Jiang apologize.

348
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,840
And then...

349
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,550
I want to take a few days off.

350
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,990
I'll take care of it.

351
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,280
Did you inform your father?

352
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,670
He's on his way.

353
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,970
Dad.

354
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,220
You must be tired.

355
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,710
Go to my place and rest.

356
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:51,110
I'll keep an eye on her.

357
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
I'll be wherever your mom is.

359

You have to go to the company tomorrow.

360
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
Rest early.

361

Dad.

362
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,140
It's all my fault.

363
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,020
It's okay.

[Luzhou Airlines Press Conference]

366
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,140
On behalf of Luzhou Airlines,

367
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,160
I wish to express our deepest condolences

368
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,890
for the unfortunate passing of Mr. Guo Xiaoliang

369
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,600
to our respected passengers.

370
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,500
The Board of Directors has decided

371
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,760
to compensate Mr. Guo's family

372
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,500
with one million RMB

373
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,390
to express

374
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,350
our deepest apologies.

375
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,980
Through this incident,

376
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,550
Luzhou Airlines has also identified

377
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:27,210
many internal problems.

378
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,900
We will learn from them

379
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:33,280
to strengthen our employee training and management.

380
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,420
We welcome everyone's supervision.

381
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,020
Thank you.

382
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,130
In addition,

383
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,060
with respect to Jiang Tao's

385
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:46,890
the company will dispense

386
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,350
the harshest punishment.

387
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,000
From now on,

388
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,300
he will be stripped of all duties.

389
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,820
The Civil Aviation Bureau

390
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:55,070
has also decided to revoke

391
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,330
his Commercial Pilot Licence

392
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,810
for life.

393
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,350
First,

394
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,060
I want to apologize to

395
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,500
Mr. Guo Xiaoliang's parents.

396
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:36,850
The company

397
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,860
will pay them one million RMB in compensation.

398
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:44,180
I have requested to take on this responsibility myself,

399
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,010
in hopes of receiving your forgiveness.

400
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,400
In addition,

401
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,330
to the management and my colleagues at Luzhou Airlines,

402
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,770
although I had been given

403
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,410
the final say

404
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,020
as a captain,

405
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,490
I am aware

406
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,640
I hadn't fulfilled my duty as a captain.

407
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,660
I didn’t put the safety of the passengers

408
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,720
in the first place.

409
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,340
Moreover, due to my own selfish interests,

410
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,510
I even attempted to cover up the truth.

411
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,700
I have damaged the reputation of the company

412
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,670
and the image of pilots.

413
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,850
For this,

414
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,740
I am very ashamed.

415
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,550
I'm sorry, everyone.

416
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,670
When I saw you two

417
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,030
in court yesterday,

418
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:40,290
I felt respect for you

419
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,730
from the bottom of my heart.

420
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,340
I have high hopes for one of you

421
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,450
as a pillar of the future,

422
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,120
and the other as a representative

423
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,320
of all female pilots.

424
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,440
In this case,

425
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,960
I have seen the steadfastness

426
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,160
of the two of you, as well as Lin Yicheng.

427
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,610
I am very glad.

428
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,580
I didn't expect

429
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,490
the younger generation at Luzhou Airlines

430
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,890
would be able to maintain

431
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,220
the most righteous

432
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:11,520
and the most honest of characters.

433
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,250
Thank you for your understanding, President Xu.

434
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,960
Nanting.

435
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,950
After Jiang Tao is removed from his position,

436
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,030
you’ll take over his duties

437
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,080
in the Flight department.

438
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,180
In addition,

439
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,050
only you and Ni

440
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:31,070
will be competing for the position of Vice President.

441
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,720
Due to the complications of this incident,

442
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,150
the list of elected candidates

443
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,810
will be announced next month.

444
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,840
Good luck.

445
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,440
Thank you for trusting in me, President Xu.

446
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,600
However,

447
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,520
I wish to withdraw

448
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,630
from candidature for Vice President.

449
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,740
Why?

450
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,400
Ms. Fang's questions of me in court

451
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,790
are highly relevant.

452
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,620
What Luzhou Airlines needs now

453
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,040
is unity and energy,

454
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,630
not suspicion and opposition.

455
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,870
I think you have a point.

456
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,210
But

457
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,850
if you do this,

458
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,100
wouldn't you feel wronged?

459
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,500
What I did

460
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,410
has affected the company.

461
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,250
This is the price I should pay.

462
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,200
Fine.

463
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,420
Let me

464
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,460
think about it.

465
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,910
Cheng Xiao,

466
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,160
your suspension

467
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,050
is officially cancelled.

468
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,740
I hope you can

469
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,720
prepare yourself mentally

470
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,070
to resume flying as soon as possible.

471
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,730
I have always had faith in you.

472
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,240
Thank you, President Xu.

473
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,560
What's wrong?

474
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,520
Isn't this good news for you?

475

She...

476
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:06,190
Her family member has fallen sick and been hospitalized.

477
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,520
How is the situation?

478
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,300
How about this?

479
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,850
Put a hold on the work you're doing

480
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,810
right now.

481
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,710
Go to the hospital and keep your family company.

482
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,150
Only when your situation at home is stable

483
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,480
can you commit yourself fully to your work,

484
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,810
and fly safely.

485
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,170
Go.

00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:31,449
Do you feel better?

490
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:40,480
Xiao.

491
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,389
The doctor said he wanted to change to a new medicine.

492
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:45,719
Come with me and ask about what's going on.

there's something

501

I planned to

502
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,490
never tell you.

503
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,750
But look at your mother now.

504
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:52,680
After having deep consideration,

505
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,830
I should let you know about it.

[Jiang Tao]

507
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,880
Sorry.

The number you dialed is unavailable.

509

Please try again later.

How could this happen?

511
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,780
You don't understand

512
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:21,010
why she doesn't want you to be a pilot.

513
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:24,390
Actually, she doesn't look down on this job.

514
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,350
She is just

515
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,580
afraid of losing you.

516
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,430
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

517
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,990
Your mother is so strong.

518
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:42,370
She wouldn't allow me to tell you.

519
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:44,240
She also doesn't want you to know

her fragile side.

521
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:48,930
At first,

522
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,400
she could visit a psychologist

523
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,410
and take medication regularly.

524
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,540
Then she refused to do so.

525
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,830
I thought

526
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,240
maybe time could heal all wounds.

527
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,220
But I didn't expect

528
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,680
you would apply

529
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,560
to be a pilot in college.

530
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,530
Your mother is sick,

531
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,570
so she can't control her temper.

532
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,820
She wanted what was best for you.

533
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,140
But in the end,

534
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,790
she did many things that made you upset.

535
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,360
Especially the last time when she came back from Luzhou,

536
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,810
she didn't go out for days

537
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,520
and locked herself at home.

538
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,640
She really cares about you.

539
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:49,390
Dad.

540
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,040
Do you remember when I was young,

541
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,040
I had gastroenteritis?

542
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,320
I was alone at home.

543
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,750
I called my mom.

544
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,180
She said,

545
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,530
"Find some medicine on your own."

546
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,230
At that time, I thought

547
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,450
if other mothers

548
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,710
knew that their children were sick

549
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:12,170
even if it was a small cold,

550
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,050
they would be so worried.

551
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,630
After that,

552
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,160
I fainted.

553
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,920
If you hadn't sent me to the hospital,

554
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:28,660
I would have died.

555
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,500
You misunderstood your mother.

556
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:33,590
I remember

557
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,620
the one who sent you to the hospital

558
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,550
was your mother.

559
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
Because during that time,

560
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,010
she was preparing for an important trial.

561
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,400
She was called away before you woke up.

562
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,290
Xiao,

563
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,630
we're a family.

564
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
There's nothing we can't overcome.

565
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,920
I believe everything will be fine.

566
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,240
But

567
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,770
your mom is sick.

568
00:40:02,930 --> 00:40:04,460
If you have anything to say,

569
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,740
speak nicely to her,

570
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:06,990
okay?

571
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,260
[Nurse Station Examination Room]

572
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,690
Xiaoyun.

573
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,430
What are you doing?

574
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,400
I am not seriously ill.

575
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,100
Why should I stay here?

576
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,840
The doctor said you need to stay here for observation for two more days.

577
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,880
I know the condition of my own health.

578
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:55,450
Xiaoyun.

579
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:06,220
Mom.

580
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,950
You haven't been to my new house.

581
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,840
You can stay at my place for two days.

582
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,440
I dare not.

583
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,920
I'm afraid

584
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:14,880
I'd be a burden.

585
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,640
Mom.

586
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,080
It was my fault.

587
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,330
Please forgive me.

588
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,320
Xiaoyun,

589
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,310
Xiao already said so.

590
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,680
We can stay there for a few days to relax.

591
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,250
My luggage is still in the hotel.

592
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,290
I'll get it.

593
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:48,890
Mr. Gu.

594
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:49,890
Uncle.

595
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,930
Come in, please.

596
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:55,710
Auntie.

597
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,800
Isn't this the boss who held his female subordinate's hand?

598
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:00,350
Mom.

599
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,020
Auntie.

600
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,990
My name is Gu Nanting.

601
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,560
I'm Cheng Xiao's friend.

602
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,830
Hope you get well soon.

603
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:23,950
Well,

604
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,390
I won't bother you anymore. I'll go now.

605
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,320
Are you leaving?

606
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,310
Xiao, see Mr. Gu off.

607
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:32,130
I have the key. See you at home.

608
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,980
I'm leaving.

609
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,520
Let's go.
