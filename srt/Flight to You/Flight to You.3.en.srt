00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,200
Okay, thank you.

Xiazhi.

7
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:47,229
My name is Xiazhi.

8
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,780
It's one of the 24 festivals.

9
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,640
But my friends said I look more like scaring people.

10
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,940
Just kidding. It's a little cold.

11
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,080
Do you think you have any advantage?

12
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,540
I can suffer,

13
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
and I'm cheerful.

14
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,250
I have a lot of friends.

15
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,630
My WeChat contacts are full.

16
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,970
Communicating with others is my strength.

17
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,930
I'm so down-to-earth.

18
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,790
I can get closer

19
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,190
with passengers easily.

20
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,520
As a flight attendant,

21
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,760
if any passengers approach you,

22
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,350
and ask for your contact information,

23
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,440
what will you reply?

24
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,650
My appearance is not attractive.

25
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:26,280
I promise that

26
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,730
this won't happen to me.

27
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,650
I can spare more energy

28
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,090
to serve the passengers

29
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,220
and ensure the safety of the flight.

30
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,820

It seems that Xiazhi is the last one.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,600
But no matter how I try

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,840
she doesn't look like

35
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,260
a flight attendant to me.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,590
But she has a kind of intimacy.

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:54,040
Her language and expressions are also very appealing.

38
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,079
I believe our passengers

39
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,000
can feel it.

40
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:58,550
In the past two years,

41
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,970
the resignation rate in our Flight Attendant Department is very high.

42
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,550
The core reason is the lack of anti-pressure ability.

43
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,120
We've interviewed so many people.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,340
Xiazhi is the least nervous.

45
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,570
Based on her previous experience,

46
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,560
I think

47
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,820
we can trust her anti-pressure ability.

if you fail the evaluation,

72

then, unfortunately,

73
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,500
you will be eliminated again.

in our team.

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,890
But I need to remind you.

81
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,720
According to our interview rules,

82
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,920
you need to do an updo.

83
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,710
And your hair shouldn't reach the collar.

84
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,790
You didn't do that.

85
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,520
Sorry, teacher.

86
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,850
I took the metro this morning

87
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,290
and my scrunchie broke accidentally.

88
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,210
So...

89
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,600
Being a flight attendant

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,670
requires comprehensive ability.

91
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,240
There will be many emergencies

92
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,580
in the flight cabin.

93
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,780
You must adapt yourself to changing circumstances.

94
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,380
I get it. Thank you, teacher.

95
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,360
Don’t call me a teacher.

96
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,420
Just call me Ai Jia.

97
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,360
Xiazhi,

98
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,240
first and foremost, you have to change your way of speaking.

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,160
After you go back,

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,020
practice your standing posture.

101
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,820
Also,

102
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,760
you need to lose weight.

103
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,370
Okay.

104
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,680
Good luck.

105
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:53,880
It's okay.

106
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,640
From now on,

107
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,680
we can take the metro together for work.

108
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,190
Sure.

109
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:58,700
Yuheng.

110
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,570
I'm leaving, Yuheng.

111
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,530
-Bye.
-Bye.

112
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,420
Finally, I catch you up.

113
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,840
Yuheng, let's add each other on WeChat.

114
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,350
Sure.

115
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,480
Isn't your WeChat full of contacts already?

116
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,480
The limit of WeChat contacts is 5,000, right?

117
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,670
I only have around 4,800.

118
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:17,390
I still can add you.

119

120
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,250
Hello, Mr. Gu.

When I'm in Australia,

122
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,070
inform me immediately if anything happens.

123
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,730
No need to think about jet lag.

124
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,730
Give me a moment.

125
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,960

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,650

127
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,640
Where are you going today?

128
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,920
It's a round trip to Beijing.

129
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,150
Is the chief flight attendant strict?

130
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:41,850
Not bad.

131
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,790
Ours is fine too.

132
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,880
Why didn't you notice me

133
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,730
in advance?

134
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,850
I wanted to give you a surprise.

135
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,200
I was preparing for my homework half a year before graduation.

136
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,330
I didn't expect the interview to pass.

137
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,950
That's your reward for your hard work.

138
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,030
Long time no see.

139
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,040
In the past two years,

140
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,060
you and your mum didn’t visit Suzhou at all.

141
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,460
My mum misses you so much.

142
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,740
How is your mum?

143
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,810
She's fine.

144
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,620
By the way,

145
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,400
I went home to pack my things a few days ago

146
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,190
and accidentally found the old photos.

147
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,590
Look.

148
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,740
This is the time I went back to my hometown to visit my grandma.

149
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,810
From now on, I can see you more often.

150
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,770
How is Aunt Qin?

151
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:29,050
She's fine. She can't stay idle.

152
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,440
She's still doing her design research.

153
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,680
When I settle down,

154
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,250
I'll make time to visit her.

155
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,540
You don't have many friends here.

156
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,470
Tell me if you need any help.

157
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,080
Thank you, Brother Nanting.

158
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,010
You're welcome.

159
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,560
Xiaoxiao.

160
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,500
Why are you here? Your hair.

161
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,200
Didn't I tell you?

162
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,660
I'm taking the flight attendant exam today.

163
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,850
What do you think?

164
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,940
Will the wish of travelling around the world

165
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,240
and tasting delicious food come true?

166
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,870
Of course.

167
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,090
I, as an unlucky person,

168
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,940
am going to make a comeback.

169
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,080
Did you pass?

170
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
Well done.

171
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,790
You blinded Luzhou Airlines.

172
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,170
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,310
Congratulations.

174
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,470
But don’t be happy for me first.

175
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,910
I have training later.

176
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,230
I might be eliminated.

177
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,850
You're indeed my good friend.

178
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,309
The situation is the same.

179
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,750
What's wrong?

180
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,429
I'm going to Australia for a two-month closed training.

181
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,690
What takes you so long?

182
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,240
I don't know.

183
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,940
I was kicked to the bottom of the pyramid.

184
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,660
I wonder what I will become when I come back.

185
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,650
Who?

186
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,150
Who bullied you?

187
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:04,310
Tell me. I'll deal with him for you.

188
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:06,850
No need.

189
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,960
I'll do it myself.

190
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,990
Nanting is back.

191
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,950
Brother Wang.

192
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,560
Nanting is back.

193
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,220
Aunt Zhang.

194
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,100
Aunt Li.

195
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,770
Nanting is back.

196
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,880
Your tangerine looks good.

197
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
It looks good.

198
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,690
Mum.

199
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,840
What brings you here today?

200
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,400
It's easy to catch a cold these days.

201
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,370
I've prepared two boxes of cold medicine for you.

202
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,590
Are the oil and salt at home running out?

203
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,990
I bought some for you too.

204
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:49,880
Do you really think

205
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,800
a person who can't take care of herself?

206
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,260
You even worry about the daily necessities.

207
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,160
It's not the first time you lack the oil and salt

208
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,610
when you cook.

209
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,160
Are you going on a business trip again?

210
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,760
Yes, I'm going to Australia.

211
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,970
It's a pilot transition training.

212
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,840
Mum.

213
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,200
Take care of yourself. Don't overwork yourself.

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,770
I'm not.

215
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,560
What you do

216
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,960
is exactly what you like.

217
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,970
How many people are so lucky?

218
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,850
I was rehired by our design institute last month.

219
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,710
Can't you let go of your work?

220
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,160
As long as I don't see the home-made aircraft

221
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,520
is allowed to fly commercially,

222
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,630
I won’t let it go.

223
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,680
The pneumatic appearances

224
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,310
that our team has worked hard for many years

225
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,170
also needs further improvement.

226
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:38,740
Keep working.

227
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:46,680
Mum,

228
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,990
you should move to our community.

229
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,680
It's easier for me to take care of you.

230
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,680
You keep taking care of me.

231
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,210
Do you really think I'm a kindergarten child?

232
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,510
Our house is more comfortable.

233
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,860
This house looks old,

234
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,140
and small.

235
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
When your dad got assigned,

236
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,200
this house was the biggest and the best.

237
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,940
I'm used to it. I don't want to move.

238
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,720
Fine.

239
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,090
The seed.

240
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,560
I swallowed it.

241
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,320
Grapes seeds can resist oxidation.

242
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,120
You can't have tangerine seeds.

243
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,700
It's not about health care. I just think it's troublesome.

244
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,480
Don't keep transferring me the rent.

245
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,340
Take care of it.

246
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,400
That house is for you.

247
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,800
If you don't stay, you should at least keep the rent.

248
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,380
It's troublesome.

249
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,110
I don't want to get involved.

250
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,710
Your tenant.

251
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,790
She's a girl, right? Yes.

252
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,230
Have you seen her before?

253
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,760
But she's quite responsible.

254
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,360
She should be an honest girl.

255
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:07,690
Ms. Cheng.

256
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,580
Mr. Sun.

257
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,240
Well,

258
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,800
can you adjust

259
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,640
the house design?

260
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,290
Sure, but are you in a hurry?

261
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,720
No, I'm not.

262
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I'm going on a business trip anyway.

263
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,440
But there's an emergency.

264
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,200
The budget may be reduced.

265
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,320
Okay, no problem.

266
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,390
Thank you so much.

267
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,740
OK. Thank you, Mr. Sun.

268
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,650
What are you doing?

269
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:37,700
I'm training my stance.

270
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,940
My aviation limited edition.

271
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,060
Xiazhi, you...

272
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,540
My neck.

273
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,820
Why?

274
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,160
Why does Li Yuheng

275
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,610
walk so elegantly?

276
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,660
I walk like a man.

277
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,410
Who is Li Yuheng?

278
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,110
My new idol.

279
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,700
I have a feeling that

280
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,430
she will be the best flight attendant in the future.

281
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,940
I'm an old idol now.

282
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,480
Once an idol, forever an idol.

283
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,480
Okay.

284
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,940
Alright, I got it. Go away.

285
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,240
Let me tell you some gossip.

286
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,930
I saw Li Yuheng's boyfriend

287
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,830
in our company today.

288
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,700
He seems to be a captain.

289
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:24,410
Captain?

290
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,330
Who is it?

291
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,750
How would I know?

292
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,510
His surname is Gu.

293
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,880
He's so handsome.

294
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:33,910
Gu...

295
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,350
Tell me.

296
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,130
If I become a flight attendant,

297
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,830
and marry a handsome and rich captain,

298
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,010
You wish.

299
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,360
I'll introduce you to my landlord

300
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,160
to become her daughter-in-law.

301
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,660
Your landlord?

302
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,650
Her son?

303
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,950
Is he

304
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,410
your mysterious male friend?

305
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:54,770
Nonsense, I've never met him.

306
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
The landlord doesn't care about many things.

307
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,930
She always let her son handle them.

308
00:13:59,440 --> 00:13:59,930
No way.

309
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,100
The son of the landlord gets married early.

310
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,140
That's not necessary.

311
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,080
His contact information is

312
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,210
the email, different from the others.

313
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,010
Based on my instinct,

314
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,710
he must be a boring single man at his age.

315
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,870
I'll introduce him to you later.

316
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,070
I don't like this.

317
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,670

325
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,220
[Australia]

326
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,960
Meet here

327
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:15,610
at 7 a.m. tomorrow.

328
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,370
Set off to the airport

329
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,300
and learn the outside check of 787.

330
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,460
I hope you can take it seriously.

331
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,170
Gu Nanting.

332
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,660
I finally see you again.

333
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,120
I missed you so much.

334
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,320
Hello, Kain.

335
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,540
I have been back here twice. I haven't seen you.

336
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,080
Today is my lucky day.

337
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,410
When will we compete again?

338
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,560
I'm here to work.

339
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,010
What about you?

340
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,620
Me too.

341
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,260
Me too.

342
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,870
Look.

343
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,860
Brother Nanting has a wide relationship.

344
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
You probably can't pass the exam.

345
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,040
Why?

346
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,920
You're blind and deaf.

347
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:08,770
You‘re still strong as ever.

348
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,080
Same to you.

349
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:13,970
Alright.

350
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,240
See you around.

351
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,530
See you.

352
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,850
These people are making trouble here.

353
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:29,630
Don't look.

[Melbourne]

355
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:40,160
[Tullamarine Airport]

356
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:43,720
No matter what

357
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,180
you have achieved before,

358
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,730
after changing the model,

359
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,480
everything has to start all over again.

360
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,030
You must adjust

361
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,170
your idle attitude very quickly.

362
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,250
As an instructor,

363
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:04,220
I will be responsible for your training results.

364
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,740
I hope you all can

365
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,700
be the most reliable

366
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,430
and responsible pilots

367
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,630
in the future.

368
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,329
Today,

369
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,109
let's start with the 787's outside check.

370
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,680
Xiao,

371
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,319
the UV in Australia is so strong.

372
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:26,890
This one.

373
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:28,990
The sunscreen index is 50. Put it on.

374
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,070
No, I've applied it. You do it.

375
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,310
Cheng Xiao, Song.

376
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,680
What are you doing?

377
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,370
Sir,

378
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,990
we are using sunscreen.

379
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,340
Pilot team

380
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,250
is an organized and disciplined team.

381
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,850
Who allowed you to be absent-minded?

382
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,440
What about your discipline?

383
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,560
We are pilots,

384
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,550
not soldiers.

385
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,340
We don't need to be disciplined.

386
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,590
We apply sunscreen to protect ourselves.

387
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,060
Protecting ourselves is protecting the plane,

388
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,120
and also protecting the passengers.

389
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,440
From now on,

390
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,000
Cheng Xiao and Song are assigned as temporary instructors.

391
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,860
The rest of you,

392
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
apply sunscreen.

393
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,010
Execute.

394
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,800
Don't put too much on it.

395
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,830
Song,

396
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,890
what do you think about being an instructor?

397
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:53,680
A... A little inappropriate.

398
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,140
Cheng Xiao, what about you?

399
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,960
You're dilly-dallying

400
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:00,300
and scattered.

401
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,640
We are not soldiers,

402
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:06,980
and no one

403
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,750
is stopping you from using protective products.

404
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,340
But these

405
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,680
should be settled before class.

406
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,880
You may think it's just a little sunscreen,

407
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,540
there is no need to make a fuss.

408
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,880
What about the others?

409
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,650
If everyone does that in class,

410
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,850
how can we maintain a serious learning attitude?

411
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:24,110
How can we master these delicate skills?

412
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,930
In summer in the south,

413
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,760
the terrain of the apron can reach over 50 degrees Celsius.

414
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,480
During the winter in the northeast, the temperature can reach minus 30 degrees Celsius.

415
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,680
Under any condition,

416
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,200
pilots must be

417
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,250
in a stable state.

418
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:36,760
Can you do it?

419
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,430
I can.

420
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:43,490
And I've been doing this for seven years.

421
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:44,380
Not only me,

422
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,010
everyone here

423
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,290
are qualified pilots.

424
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,580
Forget your previous achievements. Start all over again.

425
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,520
Did you forget what I just said?

426
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,530
In this class,

427
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:00,830
Cheng Xiao, Song, reflect on yourself.

428
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:03,050
Others continue to study.

429
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,340
Can you hold on?

430
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,170
Yes.

431
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,640
Xiao.

432
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,830
It's all my fault.

433
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,080
I dragged you down.

434
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,670
What are you talking about?

435
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,760
Actually

436
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,410
Brother Nanting has a point.

437
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,780
Don't mention him again.

438
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,460
He is Thanos in my heart.

439
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,810
He just manipulated you.

440
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,390
What he said...

441
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,000
Yes, nothing wrong.

442
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,770
But we're not elementary school students.

443
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:58,420
There is only one standard answer.

444
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,550
We are the captains.

445
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,510
To solve a complicated problem,

446
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,910
we need to be flexible

447
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,980
and find the best solution among all the solutions.

448
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,610
If Cai

449
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:10,450
is here today,

450
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,240
what would he do to us?

451
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,250
Have class like normal,

452
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,920
and scold us in private.

453
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,910
That’s the best solution.

454
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,200
For Thanos,

455
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,540
he's mechanical and rigid.

456
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,000
He must be the victim of cramming education.

457
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,190
The focus points of the outside check.

458
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,590
How much do you remember?

459
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,650
We're too far away. I didn't hear it all.

460
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,070
Let's revise together later.

461
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,540
Complement it as much as we can.

462
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,940
Don't miss our homework.

463
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,050
Stand straight.

464
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,890
You said it before.

465
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:49,260
We're not soldiers.

466
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,330
Why do we have to stand so straight?

467
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:55,040
This is the legendary "stand straight when you get hit."

468
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,200
I’m exhausted.

469
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,080
I thought when I was a pilot,

470
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,240
I flew here and there and played happily.

471
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,280
I didn't expect it to be so tiring.

472
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:09,930
Yeah.

473
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,170
I'm speechless.

474
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,020
It's all because of that devil.

475
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,110
The devil is here.

476
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,550
-Hello, Instructor Gu.
-Good day, Instructor Gu.

477
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,380
I wonder what’s wrong with Mr. Gu

478
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,810
to train us so hard.

479
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,840
This is not training pilots.

480
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,850
They are sending us to the Olympics.

481
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:54,620
Xiao.

482
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:56,460
Are you feeling better?

483
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:00,690
Here.

484
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,640
Are you crazy?

485
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,360
If Brother Nanting sees this,

486
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,220
you'll be dead.

487
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,760
We're not flying.

488
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,000
What's wrong with drinking?

489
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,990
Yesterday, Shaohui ordered a dish of beer chicken

490
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,000
in the canteen yesterday.

491
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:11,280
What happened?

492
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,410
He was scolded badly.

493
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,080
Really? Why?

494
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,450
Yes.

495
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:16,010
I heard that

496
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,640
he has some private rules.

497
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,920
When flying with him,

498
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,360
a lot of things are not allowed.

499
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,250
It's so troublesome.

500
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,620
Enough. Bear with it.

501
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:23,820
Put it away.

502
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:24,780
See?

503
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,320
These Chinese trainees don’t even dare to drink.

504
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
It's because they are still minors.

505
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,470
It's them again.

506
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,490
Song! Song!

507
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,720
Sit down.

508
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,420
Don’t mind them.

509
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,750
Aren't you afraid of being scolded by Thanos?

510
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,240
Besides, with your body size,

511
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,680
are you sure you won't get beaten up?

512
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:42,990
I...

513
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,000
There are so many of us.

514
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,430
That's right.

515
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
Alright, come on.

516
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,540
Try the coffee I made.

517
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,760
Thank you, Xiao.

518
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,490
Xiao, why are you so calm lately?

519
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,600
Thanks to the Thanos.

520
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,490
Now I only feel calmness.

521
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,150
This is the physical examination result you took a few days ago.

522
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:20,170
You ran 3 kilometres for 13 minutes.

523
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,880
Even the hanging ladder had only 30 laps in a minute.

524
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:22,620
Every result

525
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,760
you were at the edge of passing.

526
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,960
What about the others?

527
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,800
You're the last.

528
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,680
Their grades are normal. They are all boys.

529
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,720
Don't exhaust yourself

530
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,980
in these unrelated things in the future.

531
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,990
What you said is a part of me.

532
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,120
It's my life.

533
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,260
Not everyone is as boring as you,

534
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,460
living without life.

535
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,040
Don’t choose this job if you want to live a wonderful life.

536
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,120
What a pilot needs are

537
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,780
to have sharp eyes and keen ears.

538
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,640
Not only in the few square meters of the flight deck.

539
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,790
Let me remind you.

540
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,490
According to the company rules,

541
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,570
the nine trainees

542
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,520
can stay in their original positions.

543
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,070
The last one will be eliminated

544
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,970
and demoted.

545
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:20,910
What are you doing?

546
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:22,980
Go on.

547
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,190
I need to talk to you.

548
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,080
Read while listening to the music.

549
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,240
How can you focus?

550
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,830
Instructor Gu is right.

551
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,910
How can we speak with this loud noise?

552
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,710
The sound on the plane is louder.

553
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,290
I'm trying to cultivate self-awareness.

554
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,160
What can I do for you?

555
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,640
The jewelry I kept for you last time.

556
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,360
You don't need to return it to me.

557
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,690
I can't wear it anymore.

558
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Fold the blanket.

559
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,330
My blanket is fine.

560
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,440
Fold it like tofu pieces.

561
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,510
Is it necessary?

562
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,120
This is not your cargo aircraft.

563
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,920
Flying a passenger aircraft needs to pay attention to public image.

564
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,550
This is my bedroom.

565
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,930
This is not a plane.

566
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
Don't you care too much?

567
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,600
Look carefully, I'll only do it once.

568
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,270
I...

569
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,300
What are you doing?

570
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,000
Delete it.

571
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,190
I have deleted it.

572
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,370
I don't want to repeat it.

573
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,500
What?

574
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,610
Are you invading my privacy?

575
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,190
Do you still aware of personal privacy?

576
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
I have deleted it.

577
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,760
Instructor Gu,

578
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,680
you’re a complete formalist.

579
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,320
I really don't understand.

580
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,720
What does folding a blanket have to do

581
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,560
with me flying a plane?

582
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,300
Any details in the air

583
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,560
may become a fuse

584
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,620
to trigger danger.

585
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,440
Only by putting a serious attitude

586
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,910
into every aspect of life

587
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,720
can ensure a safe flight.

588
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,720
You live so meticulously every day.

589
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,800
So unfree.

590
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,790
Is it fun?

591
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,280
True freedom

592
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,530
comes from self-discipline.

593
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:40,560
Instructor Gu,

594
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,880
I’m going to bed.

595
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,650
Can I open the blanket now?

596
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:48,880
Approved.

597
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,440
[Luzhou Airlines, In-Flight Service Training Department]

598
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,560
Stand properly.

599
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Straighten, balanced, comfortable,

600
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,590
and energetic.

601
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,460
Look straight ahead.

602
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,640
Relax your eyes

603
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,410
and smile.

604
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,490
A smile

605
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,240
may bring

606
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:13,200
a nice day to the passengers.

607
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:14,690
Xiazhi.

608
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,680
You'll scare the passengers.

609
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,020
Look at Yuheng.

610
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,690
A smile should be sincere and from the bottom of your heart.

611
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,530
Practice nicely on your own.

612
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,560
You need to get used to saying "please".

613
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:37,240
When you say "please" to the passengers,

614
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
you leave a sense of respect for them

615
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,920
so that they can feel respected.

616
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,030
After that, end it with "thanks".

617
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,360
It can convey kindness to the passengers

618
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,890
and also get closer to them.

619
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,080
Please put the tray table in place. Thank you.

620
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,210
Please show me your boarding pass. Thank you.

621
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,220
Please fasten your seat belt. Thank you.

622
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,510
Please make sure your seat back is back to the upright position. Thank you.

623
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,970
Your tone is too harsh.

624
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,450
Your voice is too loud.

625
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,400
One more time.

626
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,660
Please open the window shade.

627
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,640
Thank you.

628
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,920
Do you know how loud the noise

629
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,700
on the plane is?

630
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,870
Can the passengers hear your voice like this?

631
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,410
You can't walk properly, stand properly, or sit properly.

632
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,390
Now you can't even talk properly.

633
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,190
Moreover, your smile is so ugly.

634
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,230
This is the first time I found out that I'm a loser.

635
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,220
Take your time.

636
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:33,040
You all have better smiles than me.

637
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,750
Why?

638
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,270
I bite my chopsticks and practice at home every day.

639
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,430
You can relax

640
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:38,650
your facial muscles more.

641
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:40,250
Open your mouth like how I do.

642
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,360
Just relax your facial muscles

643
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,720
and make a sound.

644
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,120
Ah-oh-yee.

645
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,500
Yes.

646
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,920
You can relax your facial muscles

647
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,120
after practicing ten times.

648
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,720
Let me try.

649
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,730
Ah-oh-yee.

650
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,280
Big news.

651
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,200
Do you know why those two foolish foreigners

652
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,390
always pick on us?

653
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,250
Why?

654
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,000
They are

655
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,640
all Kain’s students.

656
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,370
Do you still remember Kain?

657
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,910
The one who shook hands with Brother Nanting

658
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,240
when we first came here.

659
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,080
A few years ago,

660
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:26,920
he competed with Brother Nanting

661
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,180
on the simulator.

662
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:29,820
He was heavily defeated

663
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,320
and was poured three buckets of ice water in public.

664
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,650
It was so embarrassing.

665
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:36,110
So we took the blame for Thanos.

666
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,680
I knew there was something wrong on the first day we met.

667
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,440
There must be something going on.

668
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,910
No.

669
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,750
We can't take the blame.

670
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,890
What do you mean?

671
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,940
I need to go to Mr. Gu

672
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,490
and let him have another match with Kain.

673
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,310
Not only will we have fun,

674
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,780
Mr. Gu doesn’t have the energy

675
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,980
to bother us anymore.

676
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
That makes sense.

677
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,280
Based on my judgment of Thanos,

678
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,480
no way you can make it.

679
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,970
We can use another way.

680
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,070
We can irritate Kain to revenge.

681
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,070
What do you think?

682
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,230
It seems to be a way.

683
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,430
But...

684
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:15,740
Who is going to do it?

685
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,970
Who?

686
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,720
How about...

687
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,040
How about...

688
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,930
How about...

689
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:24,040
Me?

690
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,840
Xiao, how about you?

691
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,200
You are the most suitable one.

692
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,260
The weaker you are,

693
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,780
the more irritated Kain will be.

694
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,490
Think about it.

695
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,780
Terrain, terrain, pull up.

696
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,910
Obstacles, pull up.

697
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,130
If there's a warning regarding the land approach,

698
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:45,530
disengage the autopilot

699
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,580
and disengage the autothrottle.

700
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,440
Use the maximum push decisively.

701
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,120
Start pose 20 degrees.

702
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,850
The spoiler has been up.

703
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:01,860
Polly.

704
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,790
Welcome on board.

705
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,320
I practice at home all day.

706
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,850
My pet parrot can even do it.

707
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,480
Polly is a captain.

708
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,679
Don't let it become a flight attendant.

709
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,159
You are so sleepy.

710
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,820
How's your practice?

711
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,260
Don't mention it.

712
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,480
I thought it was easy to be a flight attendant.

713
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,310
I was so miserable in training.

714
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,409
I do the same movement 100 times a day

715
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,400
and say the same thing 100 times.

716
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
I'm almost a repeater.

717
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,639
When are you going to give up?

718
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,020
I won't.

719
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,920
Just wait and see.

720
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:36,350
Okay.

721
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,340
Then I'll wait to fly with you.

722
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,159
Terrain, terrain, pull up.

723
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,389
Obstacles, pull up.

724
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,590
If there's a warning regarding the land approach,

725
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,989
disengage the autopilot

726
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:50,210
and disengage the autothrottle.

727
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,560
You all need to review carefully the key points we learned today

728
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,370
when you go back.

729
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:08,360
The goal

730
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,400
is to complete the operation without any mistakes.

731
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,860
I thought we were friends.

732
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:16,410
But it looks like somebody likes to play dirty.

733
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,880
What are you talking about?

734
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,880
Oh, it's nothing.

735
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,720
We have freedom of speech.

736
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,380
But this concerns my professional honor.

737
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,400
You were lucky

738
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,520
to steal a victory last time.

739
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,360
Now I want to prove myself

740
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,440
to the class.

741
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,570
Your capability

742
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,810
has won the respect and recognition in our industry.

743
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,160
You don't have to prove it anymore.

744
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,870
They are questioning my ability

745
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,780
because of the rumors you have been spreading.

746
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,990
It looks like we have to fight face-to-face.

747
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,660
You and me.

748
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,060
What rumors did I spread?

749
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,670
Be more specific.

750
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,790
Fine.

751
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,060
You don't scare me.

752
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,640
Mr. Gu, teach them a lesson.

753
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,260
Mr. Gu, teach them a lesson.

754
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:03,370
Alright.

755
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:04,560
Quiet.

756
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:05,780
Come on.

757
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:12,930
What is it gonna be?

758
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,760
I have already told you

759
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,620
I'm here to work.

760
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,340
I told you.

761
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,410
Bye.

762
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:22,940
Mr. Gu.

763
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,380
You don't have to step in, I'll help you.

764
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
I'll do it for you.

765
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:27,010
I'll go.

766
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,120
I'll do it.

767
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,400
All of you, assemble at the field.

768
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,520
Practice with ten-kilometer running.

769
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,750
Now, right now.

770
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,140
How many laps are left?

771
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,220
Five more laps.

772
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,880
Hang in there, Xiao.

773
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,360
But how did you know

774
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,760
it won't work today?

775
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,010
You all overestimated him.

776
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:00,910
Do you think he's the captain of China?

777
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,080
He's a bully.

778
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,560
I hereby announce

779
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,510
he is no longer a Thanos.

780
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,000
Let’s call him Mr. Gu.  For the sake of security reasons.

781
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,350
No.

782
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,070
His name is Gu Congxin.

783
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:11,760
Gu Congxin.

784
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,530
He's a coward.

785
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:35,920
Why are you here?

786
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,650
The safety maintenance community

787
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,050
has decided to stay here.

788
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,970
It wasn't my job.

789
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,680
I got it from others.

790
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,910
Military aviation exhibition.

791
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,240
You know me well.

792
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:52,790
Have you eaten?

793
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,970
I found a Chinese restaurant

794
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:55,770
and packed you some siu mei rice.

795
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,170
Thanks.

796
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,710
Among the pilot transition trainees,

797
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,930
there's a female pilot named Cheng Xiao.

798
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,620
Do you know her?

799
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:12,830
She impressed me before.

800
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,660
She's in there now.

801
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,070
Her training for this period has reached the standard.

802
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:19,600
But she insisted

803
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,860
to finish the rest of her training hours.

804
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,170
Does she work so hard?

805
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:24,850
These days,

806
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,710
she exercised for four hours a day

807
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,980
and trained on the simulator for another four hours.

808
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,040
The rest of the time

809
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,680
she was in the classroom.

810
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,420
I thought

811
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,510
she is a crazy girl who likes playing.

812
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,040
She's a bit crazy.

813
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,790
Unfortunately,

814
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,500
she is not suitable for this industry.

815
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,580
You don't think highly of her.

816
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,360
She is still practicing inside.

817
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,840
I'm going to grab some food.

818
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,770
She's all yours.

819
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,120
Okay.

820
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,800
Indeed.

821
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,680
I'll leave you to it.

822
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,100
Okay.

823
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,160
You need to rest.

824
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,930
I still have many training hours to use.

825
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,830
Self-discipline is not all about hard training.

826
00:39:39,830 --> 00:39:41,130
You need to balance work and rest.

827
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,320
You reprimand me when I don't do much.

828
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,160
Now I do a lot, you also reprimand me.

829
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,450
Set me a difficult one.

830
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,560
For example,

831
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,100
the air speed is unreliable.

832
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,500
The gear fails to change.

833
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,760
That's all for today.

834
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,030
I'll do it myself.

835
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,910
Without instructors,

836
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,770
you can't train in the simulator.

837
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,970
Since you are so competitive,

838
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:08,600
go practice the fixed simulator.

839
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,660
As long as you want.

840
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,230
OK.

841
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,380
It smells so good.

842
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,970
Did Song bring it to me?

843
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,240
In the aviation school,

844
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,480
it is unbelievable that it has such delicious siu mei rice.

845
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,740
Why didn't I notice it?

846
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,370
Don't leave any trash behind.

847
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:20,900
[Luzhou Airlines, In-Flight Service Training Department]

848
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,430
Sir, the orange juice you ordered.

849
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,030
Thank you.

850
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,400
Madam, what would you like to drink?

851
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,000
Black tea.

852
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,670
Okay.

853
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Madam, what would you like to drink?

854
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,220
No.

855
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,150
Give me orange juice.

856
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,610
Okay.

857
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:38,500
Forget it.

858
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,040
I still want black tea.

859
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,800
No.

860
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:45,310
Orange juice.

861
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,750
Madam,

862
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,140
what is your zodiac sign?

863
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,840
Why are you so hesitant?

864
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,230
Madam,

865
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:03,260
if it's so hard to choose

866
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,250
between black tea and orange juice,

867
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:07,110
how about a glass of wine?

868
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,780
Wine is much more expensive than beverages.

869
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:09,780
It's more worthy.

870
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,270
Who asked you to decide for the passengers?

871
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,960
Ma'am, here's your orange juice.

872
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,270
And a cup of black tea, please wait a moment.

873
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,470
Give me the black tea.

874
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,790
Madam,

875
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,320
I suggest you drink black tea first,

876
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,430
and drink the orange juice after half an hour.

877
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,160
Otherwise, it's bad for your stomach.

878
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,760
Thank you.

879
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:29,710
You're welcome.

880
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,530
Xiao.

881
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,160
Shaohui has brought you snow fungus soup

882
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,820
to moisten your throat and replenish your skin.

883
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,290
Tell me.
