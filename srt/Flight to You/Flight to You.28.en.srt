4
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,020
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

5
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,170
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

6
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,789
Why are you here?

7
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,539
We just flew back.

8
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,070
We're having dinner here.

9
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:39,800
Just you two?

10
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:41,850
-No.
-There’s a friend who couldn’t come.

11
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,110
It's just the two of us.

12
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,840
What a coincidence.

13
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,039
I have a meeting here.

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,320
I'm reporting our progress

15
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,210
to our board of directors.

16
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,960
Do you want to join us?

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,440
I–

18
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,160
Sure! Thank you Mr. Jiang.

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,259
It’s our honor

20
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,600
to be able to communicate with the company's leaders.

21
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,320
Let's go.

22
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,800
Let us go to the bathroom first.

23
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
We'll be right there.

24
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,990
It's the room in the innermost.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,890
I'll wait for you.

26
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,290
Okay.

27
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,180
I...

28
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:08,270
Stop talking. Let’s go.

29
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,169
Sister Qi Yu.

30
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,699
Let’s go.

31
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,040
This place tastes good.

32
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,040
It's authentic.

33
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,329
Yes, it's authentic.

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:20,650
Cheng.

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,130
Come on.

36
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,340
Let me introduce.

37
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:26,970
Cheng Xiao.

38
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:28,760
This is

39
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,950
the new director of Luzhou Airlines,

40
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,650
Mr. Sun of Xingyuan Group.

41
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,190
Hello, Mr. Sun. Hello.

42
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:34,990
Hello, Cheng.

43
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,190
I just saw your introduction.

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,090
Women are as good as men.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,040
Cheng Xiao, take a seat.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,800
Sit here. Come, Cheng Xiao.

47
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,010
Ni, let's change seats.

48
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,010
Let me talk to Cheng Xiao.

49
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,160
Sit.

50
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,050
She just came and you're getting her to

51
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,320
sit next to the main seat.

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,120
Seems like Mr. Sun values female pilots very much.

53
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,620
Yes.

54
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,450
Captain Cheng.

55
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,410
How many years have you been flying?

56
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,140
Eight years.

57
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,760
I was in the Freight Department.

58
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,100
She was transferred to the Passenger Transport Department last year.

59
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:09,910
It's not easy.

60
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:12,200
It must be hard for a girl to fly a plane.

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,340
Come on.

62
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,750
Let's raise our glasses

63
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,270
to our model female pilot.

64
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:20,820
Alright.

65
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:22,130
Come, Cheng Xiao.

66
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,220
Sorry, I don't drink.

67
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,870
Let me toast you with tea.

68
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:32,910
To all of you.

69
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:36,690
A toast with tea

70
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,120
is also a way of showing appreciation.

71
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,460
Come on.

72
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,160
[Sorry, you don't have the right to download.]

73
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,180
Yuheng, sorry to bother you.

74
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,120
My account

75
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,329
doesn't have the right to download the new cabin information.

76
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,360
Can you send it to me? Thank you.

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm having dinner with the board of directors.

78
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,159
I'll send it to you later, okay?

79
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Dinner with the board of directors?

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
Brother Nanting,

81
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:49,940
I'm a little worried

82
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:52,000
If Mr. Sun asks me to drink,

83
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,850
should I drink or not?

84
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,140
If you don't want to, just reject it.

85
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,180
Tell me if you need help

86
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,910
Thank you, Brother Nanting.

87
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:16,730
By the way,

88
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
Cheng Xiao is here too.

89
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,920
I think

90
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,450
Cheng Xiao is in a bad mood.

91
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,580
[Where are you?]

92
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,270
Alright.

93
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,310
Let's go.

94
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,090
Okay.

95
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:20,520
Bye.

96
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:21,450
Bye.

97
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:22,950
Bye.

98
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,590
Zhan.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,730
Are you okay?

100
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,700
Let me take a breath.

101
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,680
Yuheng, let me take you home first.

102
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,400
I'll call a taxi for you.

103
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,930
It's okay. I'll go with you.

104
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,080
Cheng Xiao will send me home. Go back. It’s late.

105
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,200
I'll get going then.

106
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,530
Okay.

107
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,950
Call me when you get home.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,610
Okay.

109
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,330
Zhan, are you okay?

110
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,990
I'm fine. I'll take a rest.

111
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,990
Brother Nanting.

112
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,890
Let go!

113
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,340
Are you okay?

114
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:10,800
What's wrong?

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,860
What are you doing?

116
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,650
Nanting.

117
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,330
This is Mr. Sun.

118
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,680
So what if he's Mr. Sun?

119
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,650
It's a misunderstanding.

120
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,600
Our car is here.

121
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,280
The car is here. Let's go.

122
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,980
This...

123
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,140
Who are you?

124
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,490
Are you really okay?

125
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,010
What did he do to you?

126
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,460
What are you doing here?

127
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,800
You said you were going to bring her out for dinner

128
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,890
but you brought her here to entertain the guests?

129
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,420
I'm asking why you're here.

130
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,810
Why did you bring her here?

131
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,340
It's none of your business.

132
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,510
Who are you to care about what she's doing off duty?

133
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,850
Who is Cheng Xiao to you?

134
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,240
No matter what she does, or where she goes,

135
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
it's none of your business.

136
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,520
Who are you to her then?

137
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,790
Why did you bring her here?

138
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:51,620
It’s not him.

139
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,310
Mr. Jiang asked me to come.

140
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,720
Zhan helped me drink,

141
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,380
so I didn't drink a single sip.

142
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,530
But Gu Nanting,

143
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,570
what does this have to do with you?

144
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,410
Who are you to question us?

145
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,840
Why are you angry?

146
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,180
Who are you to be angry?

147
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,820
Zhan, let me take you home.

148
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,210
Let's go. I'll take you home.

149
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,169
Wait here. I'll go check on him.

150
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,370
Are you feeling better?

151
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,350
I'll get you some water.

152
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,100
No need.

153
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,720
I have something to ask you.

154
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,680
Last time you went to Cheng Xiao’s home,

155
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,110
because she was injured, right?

156
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,010
What about this time?

157
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,160
Why are you so worried about her

158
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,800
when anything happens?

159
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:25,600
Since

160
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,670
the emergency evacuation from last time,

161
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,130
where you risked your life

162
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,090
to save her...

163
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,000
Since then...

164
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,870
Ask yourself.

165
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,600
Is there a single moment you haven't cared about her?

166
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,480
Ask yourself.

167
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,970
Since you care so much about her,

168
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,800
why did you reject her?

169
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,930
You gave her hope

170
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,460
yet let her down.

171
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,400
I like her.

172
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,190
I won't make her sad.

173
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:14,100
I will only treat her wholeheartedly.

174
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,410
Do you understand?

175
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,290
You're drunk.

176
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,010
No matter what it is,

177
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,610
let's talk when you sober up.

178
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:28,890
Don't think I don't know.

179
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,340
You're going to say...

180
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,560
You're going to refuse to admit

181
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,270
that you like her because of me, right?

182
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,140
You want me to have her instead, right?

183
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,650
What do you take me for?

184
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,160
What do you take Cheng Xiao for?

185
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,320
Gu Nanting,

186
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,180
how virtuous you are!

187
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:54,730
Let's go home.

188
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,250
Why does she like you?

189
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,010
Why?

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,460
Zhan, are you okay?

191
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,240
It's okay.

192
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,290
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

193
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:54,500
Slowly.

194
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,160
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

195
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,050
No need.

196
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,760
It's late. Let me give you a ride.

197
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,780
Don't you have anything to say to me?

198
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:18,610
I didn't know until today

199
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,850
that you did something this virtuous,

200
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,390
giving me to Zhan.

201
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,180
Cheng Xiao.

202
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,120
I...

203
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,190
I didn't mean it that way.

204
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,610
You don't belong to me anyway.

205
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,180
How could I–

206
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,980
That's because you rejected me.

207
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,530
I rejected?

208
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,990
Cheng Xiao, you are a good person.

209
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,370
It's my problem.

210
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,260
I...

211
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,640
Please take good care of Zhan.

212
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,300
♫Another day has passed♫

213
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,560

♫This moment♫

00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,150
♫My thoughts are rushing and lost in the sea of people♫

218
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,180
♫The city is soaked with panic, and there's no escape♫

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,140
♫This distance♫

220

♫I can't lay out even a single word of love♫

221
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,830
♫It's missing and parting♫

229

[Yi, I don't want to hurt Ni Zhan. Neither do I want to hurt her. But everyone's getting hurt because of me now.]

230
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,530
♫Thorns and rainbows will always be together♫

♫Reachable to the dream at the beginning♫

239
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,770
Yuheng.

240
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,040
You're back.

241
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,210
Did you drink?

242
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,430
Wait for me.

243
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,760
I'll make you a hangover soup.

244
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,270
No.

245
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,890
No, it'll be ready soon.

246
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:49,290
Song,

247
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:53,950
Can we talk for a while?

248
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,300
This is the first time

249
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,220
we are talking this formally.

250
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
Maybe it's because I drank a little.

251
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,370
Otherwise, I don't know when

252
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,500
I can muster up the courage to say this.

253
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:18,070
Song,

254
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,090
you're a good colleague.

255
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,670
A good roommate.

256
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,020
A good friend.

257
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,520
I see.

258
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,940
You're rejecting me.

259
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,890
It's over before it starts.

260
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,860
In fact, this short period of a year I have been in Luzhou

261
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:53,370
feels like a dream.

262
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,590
Maybe it's a nightmare.

263
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,370
But this is my choice.

264
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,260
I've been persevering.

265
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:03,720
I know

266
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,010
my opponent is Cheng Xiao.

267
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,920
You will definitely be on her side.

268
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,140
Song Song,

269
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,660
I just want to work alone

270
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,980
and live a good life.

271
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:25,200
I...

272
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,120
I don't want to be affected by anything else anymore.

273
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,000
I see.

274
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:38,470
The apartment opposite should be almost fixed,

275
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,650
I'll move out right away.

276
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,430
No, Song Song,

277
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,090
I'm not asking you to move out.

278
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:44,880
I'm just staying here temporarily anyway.

279
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,660
It should be almost fixed over there.

280
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,720
I'll go pack up now.

281
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,160
You're all here.

282
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:56,010
I'm exhausted.

283
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,600
What are you doing?

284
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
Having a meeting?

285
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,980
Song Song said he's moving out.

286
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:09,980
Moving out?

287
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,220
Where to?

288
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:13,700
Back to that hostel?

289
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,530
I'll move back to the opposite apartment.

290
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,480
What opposite apartment.

291
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,970
It's been rented out.

292
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:22,960
What?

293
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:25,480
I mentioned it to your landlord last week.

294
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,880
You...

295
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,220
I've discussed this with Yuheng.

296
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,430
We agree that

297
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,040
you're a good housemate.

298
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,760
You can become a permanent housemate.

299
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,290
Why didn't you ask me first?

300
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,670
Is there a need to?

301
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,540
It's different now.

302
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,940
What's different?

303
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,190
What's different?

304
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,050
Give me a moment.

305
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:03,190
What's the difference?

306
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,300
Yuheng is still Yuheng.

307
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,850
Song Xiaoni is still Song Xiaoni.

308
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,050
What's the difference?

309
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,220
He took it.

310
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:12,560
You're the witness.

311
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,930
This is a renewal gift.

312
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,350
It's a fantastic water flosser.

313
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,410
After taking this,

314
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:18,750
the three of us will be a family.

315
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:19,980
Let me tell you.

316
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,350
After you become a proper housemate,

317
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,450
you have to cook with all your heart.

318
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,460
What's with that look on your face?

319
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:27,940
Smile.

320
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,920
Smile, you hear me? Smile.

321
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,690
Okay, okay.

322
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,850
Are you not going to smile?

323
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:34,890
Smile!

324
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,730
Morning.

325
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,690
Morning.

326
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,590
The coffee is on the table.

327
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,350
Why am I here?

328
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,330
I remember drinking at the dining table yesterday.

329
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,170
I lost my memory after that.

330
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,600
You were drunk. I was worried.

331
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,550
Your birthday didn't go well last night.

332
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,080
I'll make it up for you with birthday noodles.

333
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,080
Thank you.

334
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,170
And this one, please.

335
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,150
I went to Chicago last month

336
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,510
and saw a limited edition for the 30th anniversary.

337
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:51,120
I wanted to

338
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,260
to give it to you last night.

339
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,010
I remember my first genuine shoes

340
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,380
were from you.

341
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,740
Eat up. The noodles are soggy.

342
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,700
Here.

343
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,920
Have a taste.

344
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,190
Let's have a game when you're free in these two days.

345
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:32,940
Okay.

346
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,080
Let's play when we're free.

347
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,120
[Flight Department Deputy Director]

348
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:58,680
Come in.

349
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,500
Brother Nanting.

350
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,880
This is...

351
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,460
Didn't you ask me about

352
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:09,190
the training materials for the cabin last night?

353
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,000
Yes.

354
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,330
Thank you.

355
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:17,700
I didn't see you

356
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,320
when I went there last night.

357
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,510
I went back first.

358
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,940
I sent you an email yesterday, but you didn't reply.

359
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,990
I was afraid you didn't receive it.

360
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:29,750
so I specifically

361
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,350
printed it and sent it to you.

362
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,560
I didn't have time to reply.

363
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,560
I'm really sorry.

364
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,050
Brother Nanting.

365
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,990
Besides being my leader,

366
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,990
you are also my family.

367
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,820
Don't say that.

368
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,160
Actually, I know

369
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,530
you only have one person in your heart.

370
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:08,070
Love is not like work.

371
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,710
There's always a reward for what you've done.

372
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,050
All these years, I've been climbing a mountain

373
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,910
that I couldn't reach the peak of.

374
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,360
When I climb up a little bit,

375
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,770
I'll slide down again.

376
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:19,510
I...

377
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,170
The harder I try, the faster I slide.

378
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,990
It's been so long.

379
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,840
I decided to let go of this obsession.

380
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:36,540
Actually, I applied for the flight attendant

381
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:37,550
to

382
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,160
get closer to you.

383
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,800
I should thank you.

384
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,000
If it weren't for you,

385
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,280
I wouldn't have found

386
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,800
such a fulfilling job.

387
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,920
I won't find my own value.

388
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,540
Yuheng.

389
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,520
One day,

390
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,360
someone else will come.

391
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,930
I'll get going then.

392
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,150
You must tell me if you need anything.

393
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,320
Don't treat me as an outsider.

394
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,720
Okay.

395
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,330
Yuheng.

396
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,800
Aren't you flying today?

397
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,220
Where are you going today?

398
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,680
We're going on a round trip to Qingdao today.

399
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,280
Brother Zhan.

400
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:38,620
Why are you here?

401
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,960
You...

402
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,470
Are you okay?

403
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,930
I embarrassed myself in front of you last night.

404
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:46,480
so I came to apologize to you.

405
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,770
Don't say that.

406
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,690
You drank for me last night.

407
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,750
I would feel bad.

408
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,450
You helped me under the higher-ups' pressure

409
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,610
on the table yesterday.

410
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:54,610
You're a real man.

411
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,960
But today,

412
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,010
I wish to make up

413
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,740
with sincerity.

414
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,960
Brother Zhan,

415
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:06,510
take a rest.

416
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,560
We still have a long way to go.

417
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:09,340
I promise

418
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:11,960
I will celebrate your birthday next year.

419
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,480
Cheng Xiao.

420
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,820
Actually, I...

421
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,620
Brother Zhan.

422
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,180
Look, I'm used to calling you Brother Zhan.

423
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,640
If I call you Mr. Ni

424
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,600
one day,

425
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,780
it will be awkward.

426
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,960
Just call me Brother Zhan.

427
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Why call me Mr. Ni?

428
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,090
I...

429
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,200
go back to sleep.

430
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:53,990
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

431
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,850
No need. I'm just going to the supermarket. It's just a few steps away.

432
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,430
This will do.

433
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:29,960
Okay.

434
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:32,950
Thank you.

435
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,240
-Hello.
-Hello.

436
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,470
May I ask

437
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,000
where Mr. Gu works?

438
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,480
Do you have an appointment?

439
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,820
No.

440
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:41,490
Sorry, sir, we...

441
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:41,960
Hello.

442
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,120
Are you looking for me?

443
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,530
Mr. Gu.

444
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,160
Hello.

445
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:52,880
Who are you?

446
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,590
I'm Cheng Xiao's father.

447
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,880
Hello, uncle.

448
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,280
Hello.

449
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,820
Please come to my office.

450
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,410
Okay, thank you.

451
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:01,870
Please.

452
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,800
Have some tea.

453
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,680
OK. Thank you.

454
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,760
Cheng Xiao told me

455
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,560
her instructor's surname is Gu.

456
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,900
I searched online.

457
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,930
It should be you.

458
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:20,210
I'm here

459
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,740
to ask for your help.

460
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,320
What is it? Go ahead.

461
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,120
I hope you

462
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,380
persuade Cheng Xiao to change her job.

463
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:32,780
Why?

464
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,120
All these years, because of this job,

465
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,480
the relations between Cheng Xiao and her mother were very strained.

466
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,140
Last week, I found out

467
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,210
Cheng Xiao was the first officer

468
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,430
Cheng Xiao was the first officer of the flight.

469
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,420
Well,

470
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,940
their official account

471
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,270
updated quite quickly.

472
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:01,620
Look.

473
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,090
Isn't it good

474
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,550
we care about Xiao's work remotely?

475
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,110
There's no need to chase after her.

476
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:08,590
Besides, after so many years,

477
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,080
she's still safe.

478
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,380
What's wrong?

479
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,720
Call her now.

480
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,440
She can't be a pilot anymore.

481
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,000
Okay.

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,460
Okay, calm down. I'll get you your medicine.

483
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,310
Her mother knew

484
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,400
something happened to Cheng Xiao on the plane

485
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,530
and got hospitalized because of this.

486
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:50,010
The likelihood

487
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,860
of this happening is slim.

488
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,380
If we ask Cheng Xiao

489
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,190
to give up her dream job just because of this

490
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,040
is too cruel.

491
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,110
But all these years,

492
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,370
her job

493
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,850
may be something crueler

494
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,320
to her mother.

495
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,600
Why does Cheng Xiao's mother

496
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,830
against her work so much?

497
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:17,000
Because in 2004,

498
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,260
she encountered an aviation accident.

499
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,600
The depressurization event of Fanhai Airlines.

500
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,260
You know it.

501
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,930
I analyzed many aviation accidents.

502
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,990
That accident was very typical.

503
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,100
At that time,

504
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,800
when the plane was 10,000 meters above the sky,

505
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,730
the ceiling of the plane exploded,

506
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,950
causing the cabin to lose pressure.

507
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,120
Fortunately, the crew

508
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,380
forced the plane to land in a paddy field.

509
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,770
When the accident happened,

510
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:47,190
the flight attendant

511
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:50,290
was pouring tea beside Cheng Xiao's mom.

512
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,650
Suddenly...

513
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,240
Since then,

514
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:02,240
Cheng Xiao's mother has never taken a plane.

515
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
She is very hypersensitive

516
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,620
to anything related to aviation.

517
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,310
Her temper can become

518
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,239
irritable and repressed at times.

519
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,940
At that time, Cheng Xiao was at a boarding school.

520
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,600
We didn't tell her about this.

521
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,310
But no one expected that

522
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,719
after Cheng Xiao grew up,

523
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,790
she would want to learn to fly.

524
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:27,940
Since then,

525
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,449
the relationship between the mother and daughter is getting worse.

526
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,010
Mr. Gu,

527
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,860
I have no choice.

528
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,530
I hope you can persuade Cheng Xiao to resign.

529
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,080
Uncle.

530
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,120
Forgive my asking,

531
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,370
but have you ever taken auntie

532
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:52,630
to see a psychiatrist?

533
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,909
During the few years when it happened,

534
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:56,929
we went there,

535
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,200
but it didn't work.

536
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Then she stopped.

537
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:01,210
The doctor said

538
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,910
it was post-traumatic stress disorder.

539
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,070
Post-traumatic stress disorder is indeed hard to heal.

540
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,150
But you should

541
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,010
insist on seeing a psychiatrist.

542
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm afraid that the outside world will stimulate her.

543
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,110
I think

544
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,000
if Cheng Xiao stops flying,

545
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:19,900
it will significantly relieve

546
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,860
her mother's psychological pressure.

547
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,520
It will be beneficial for her future treatment.

548
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,480
Sorry, uncle.

549
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,540
I may not help you

550
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,900
with this favor.

551
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:43,620
I can imagine

552
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,350
if Cheng Xiao loses this job,

553
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,790
to her,

554
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,430
it would be like the whole world collapses.

555
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:09,070
From the time Cheng Xiao joined the Passenger Transport Department to today,

556
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:11,010
she has flown for 724 hours,

557
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
670,000 kilometers,

558
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:16,070
and carried over tens of thousands of passengers.

559
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,070
I can be very responsible for saying

560
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,720
her sense of honor in this profession

561
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,720
and her faith

562
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,690
is stronger than any pilot in the company.

563
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,580
No one is eager to be a captain

564
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,320
and willing to take on the responsibility more than her.

565
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,120
So, I'm sorry.

566
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,130
I can't help you with this.

567
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,420
I always thought

568
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,900
Cheng Xiao just likes flying

569
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,670
and freedom.

570
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,580
To be honest,

571
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
in the beginning,

572
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:02,660
I also thought

573
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:05,060
she's not suitable to be a passenger pilot.

574
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:05,960
But now,

575
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,770
I can be very responsible for saying

576
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,790
no one

577
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,400
is more suitable for this task than her.

578
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,830
Uncle,

579
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,160
Cheng Xiao is a tough girl.

580
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,120
But she also needs approval

581
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,520
and protection from her family.

582
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,230
I'm really sorry.

583
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,010
In these years, I know less

584
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:37,000
about my daughter than you.

585
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:39,870
Mr. Gu,

586
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,920
thank you for telling me so much today.

587
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,760
Sorry to bother you.

588
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,360
It's okay.

589
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,120
If you need,

590
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:48,920
I can help auntie

591
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,830
contact therapists.

592
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,800
Don't bother.

593
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,560
Don't tell Cheng Xiao

594
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
about her mother.

595
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,960
Nice to meet you.

596
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,090
Don't bother to see me out.

597
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:10,160
Dad.

598
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,310
Xiao.

599
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,650
Why are you here?

600
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,280
Why are you still sitting here?

601
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,130
I'm a little tired on the way.

602
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,440
My waist can't stand it.

603
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,440
I want to take a rest before going up.

604
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,590
Your mom isn't here. I'm alone.

605
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:24,980
You...

606
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,610
Why didn't you call me?

607
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,360
-Let’s go.
-No need.

608
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,760
Let me do it.

609
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,800
Go upstairs.

610
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,650
Dad, come in.

611
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,230
Okay.

612
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,730
Here, change your shoes.

613
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,300
Let me help you.

614
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,470
I can do it myself.

615
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,850
Let me take a look.

616
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,970
A new house.

617
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,650
Your new house

618
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,710
is very cozy.

619
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,750
It's all thanks to dad.

620
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,030
Let me make you some tea.

621
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,160
Xiao, don't be busy. Have a seat.

622
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,160
I came here this time

623
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,250
to discuss

624
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,740
something very important with you.

625
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,360
What's wrong?

626
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,790
There was

627
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,990
an emergency avoidance accident

628
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,300
at Luzhou Airlines.

629
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:27,880
Your company posted

630
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,630
photos of the accident scene

631
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,370
on the official website.

632
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,350
Your mother and I saw it.

633
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,840
I didn't want you to worry.

634
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,080
But I was fine.

635
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,280
I have no hurts at all.

636
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:41,450
This time,

637
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,200
your mother has issued a deadly order

638
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:45,310
to bring you back.

639
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,270
You should let her come over

640
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:51,570
and make it clear to me.

641
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,990
Why would she bother you?

642
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,960
Xiao.

643
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,650
Your mother is in hospital.

644
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,440
What happened to her?

645
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,680
She knew you were injured.

646
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,150
Her blood pressure

647
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,730
lost control.

648
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,130
Who would take care of her if you came here?

649
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,500
I hired a nurse.

650
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:26,830
Xiao.

651
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,820
I'll make the bed for you.

652
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,790
With three days of annual leave,

653
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,520
I'll give you a week off.

654
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,060
Is that enough?

655
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:04,630
Yes.

656
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,330
Thank you, boss.

657
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,690
It's the peak season of flight.

658
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:13,940
Pilots' deployment is tense.

659
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,470
Got it.

660
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,150
I'll return to work as soon as possible.

661
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,390
As for the welfare benefits,

662
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:27,270
if you have any ideas,

663
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:29,880
the company will take them seriously.

664
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,530
Why are you telling me this?

665
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,720
Are you worried that I'll change my job?

666
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,240
No.

667
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,050
If you can't make up your mind,

668
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,490
you can discuss it with more people.

669
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:47,250
Including me.
