00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
what are you doing here?

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,320

No, I want to go in.

I want to go in. Let me go.

19
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,820
There's a kid outside.

20
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,480
He wants to visit the cockpit.

21
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,950
Why didn't you stop him?

22
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,160
I was busy with other passengers.

23

she's very nervous.

The child's emotions

95
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,070

How about this?

104
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,409
I'll take you in

105
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,830
and take a look secretly, okay?

106
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,310
No.

107
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,300
This is against the operational manual.

108
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,040
The operational manual only says

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,040
irrelevant people are not allowed to enter the cockpit.

110
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,700
It didn't say we can't take a loot at the cockpit.

111

Let's go.

and I sit on the right.

117

We can both fly the plane

Come here.

121
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,230
Let me tell you.

122
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,150
The captain seems making a face,

123
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,940
but he's very skilled.

124
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,400
He is the best pilot in our company.

125
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,720
No one can beat him.

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,400
Except me.

127
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,300
I have been

128
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,159
flying for almost eight years.

129
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,159
Is this number bigger than your age?

130
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,640
I'm six years old.

131
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:54,480
Right?

132
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,210
What are you afraid of?

133
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,200
We will protect you and your mom.

134
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:00,110
Then why is the plane shaking?

135
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,650
My mom is afraid of shaking.

136
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,720
Have you ever taken a car?

137
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,080
When you ride a car,

138
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:08,070
the car shakes some times.

139
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,030
Yes, you're so smart.

140
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,620
That's because

141
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,100
the car is passing the pits

142
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,690
on the road.

143
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,440
Planes are the same.

144
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,550
It will encounter some air pits

145
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:19,920
in the sky.

146
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,260
That's why it's shaking.

147
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,390
But,

148
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,520
we just need to get through the pits.

149
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:26,300
So,

150
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,770
don't be afraid.

151
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,030
No matter where you and mom want to go,

152
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,030
the captain and I can take you there.

153
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,540
I want to go...

154
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,490
Where do you want to go?

155
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:37,970
I want to find my dad.

156
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,500
Sure, no problem.

157
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,750
Where's your dad?

158
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,040
I don't know.

159
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,920
Mom said my dad went to another world

160
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,270
even before I was born.

161
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,690
Actually, I miss him.

162
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,560
I really want to see him.

163
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,030
You all fly in the sky.

164
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,560
I'm sure you can find my dad.

165
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:15,910
Here,

166
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,310
I'll tell you where your dad is.

167
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,760
Close your eyes.

168
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,350
Look carefully.

169
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:40,789
Can you see your dad clearly?

170
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,720
He can tell you stories

171
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,350
and sing for you.

172
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,700
On your dad's shoulder,

173
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,490
you can see far away.

174
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,730
Every time a plane flies in the sky,

175
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,160
you would run after it

176
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,300
and tell everyone proudly that

177
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,210
that's dad drving the plane.

178
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,500
My dad can fly a plane?

179
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,270
He's not around,

180
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,360
so you have to be a man

181
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,770
and protect mom like your dad protect you.

182
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,140
Can you do that?

183
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,670
I'll protect my mom.

184
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,300
I'm going to protect her now.

185
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,210
Mom.

186
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,180
My baby.

187
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,320
That kid was quite good.

188
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,880
I've never heard you talk so much.

189
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,000
What's wrong?

190
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,670
I saw the estimated departure time

191
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,870
is about half an hour.

192
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,170
Are you really okay?

193
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:46,070
If you don't want to tell me, just don't.

194
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:52,510
We still have half an hour to do something big.

195
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,140
Let's work together.

196
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,650
Isn't that mother afraid of flying?

197
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,110
For those who fear flying,

198
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,730
comforting is useless.

199
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,310
Yes.

200
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,720
Only by letting her understand the flying principle

201
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,580
can she really overcome her fear.

202
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:36,600
Ladies and gentlemen,

203
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,260
our plane is about to take off.

204
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,560
Please check again.

205
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,370
Buckle up and fasten your seat belt.

206
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,190
Mobile phones and other electronic devices

207
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:44,340
are powered off.

208
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,930
Mom, don’t be afraid.

209
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,500
We have to trust the pilots.

210
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,090
I've investigated them.

211
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,990
They are fine.

212
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,170
Okay, I got it.

213
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,260
Go back and sit.

214
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,720
Fasten your seat belt too.

215
00:11:58,710 --> 00:11:59,890
Sit down, kid.

216
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,650
Let me help you fasten your seat belt.

217
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:02,980
No, I'll do it myself.

218
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,290
Madam,

219
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,040
the captain asked me to give this to you.

220
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,390
Please open the first one before taking off.

221
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,790
Please open the second one before landing.

222
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,340
Okay, thank you.

223
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,430
Call me if you need anything.

224
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,380
When you feel the inclination of the plane,

225
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,110
this is the initial ascension.

226
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,890
When pilots

227
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,580
control this plane manually.

228
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,420
Lift the front wheel.

229
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,440
Don't worry.

230
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,720
We'll operate it by one person.

231
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,580
The other will check and confirm.

232
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,310
There won't be any mistakes.

233
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,080
In about 30 minutes,

234
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,070
it will rise to cruising altitude.

235
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,230
The sound of the plane is getting smaller.

236
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,560
Because we don't need

237
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,660
that much thrust.

238
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,890
We will connect to automatic driving.

239
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,050
This is far more stable than controlling manually.

240
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,060
During this period,

241
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,710
you can enjoy the food

242
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,830
and the scenery.

243
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,880
Take it as a trip on the clouds with your kid.

244
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,800
Ladies and gentlemen,

245
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,480
our plane is landing soon.

246
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,520
Please check your seat belt again and fasten it.

247
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,200
Madam, please put the tray table in upright position

248
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,760
And your phone and other electronics are turned off.

249
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,480
Kid,

250
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,920
please put the tray table in upright position.

251
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:49,400
Thank you.

252
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

253
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:52,480
our plane is landing soon.

254
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,770
Please check your seat belt again and fasten it.

255
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,270
Thank you.

256
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,070
Descending.

257
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,520
Because of air pressure,

258
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,580
your ears might feel uncomfortable.

259
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:07,070
As long as you swallow,

260
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,420
it can reduce the pain.

261
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,090
Soon,

262
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,370
you will hear the sound

263
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,870
and feel something vibrating under the floor.

264
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,930
This is the landing gear.

265
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,980
The tires of the plane are put down.

266
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,860
And the plane will enter the last landing stage.

267
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,620
If the weather is good,

268
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,980
excellent pilots

269
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,940
will make a very light landing.

270
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,300
You can't even feel it.

271
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,420
Congratulations, Ms. Wang.

272
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,520
You complete your first journey

273
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,720
at 30,000 feet

274
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,670
with your son.

275
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,740
I hope in the future

276
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,790
you will love this kind of journey.

277
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:24,570
Take care.

278
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Take care.

279
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:27,710
Here.

280
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,270
Bye.

281
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:29,870
Bye.

282
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,370
Ms. Wang,

283
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,370
are you feeling better?

284
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,820
I feel much better now.

285
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,090
Thank you so much.

286
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:39,470
You're welcome.

287
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,200
We are waiting for the captain.

288
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,050
Hello.

289
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,610
I was so scared just now.

290
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,750
Thank you.

291
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,570
Don't be afraid.

292
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,880
Someone has calculated that,

293
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,380
it takes 3,223 years

294
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,150
to encounter an air crash

295
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,580
even if you fly everyday.

296
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,420
So,

297
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,270
even the probability of choking during shower

298
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,870
is 20 times the probability of the plane crash.

299
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,590
There is indeed data prooves that

300
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:06,810
airplanes are the safest transportations

301
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:08,030
in the world.

302
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,910
Its safety is 18 times higher than the train.

303
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,840
And 20 times higher than the bus.

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,400
I see.

305
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,010
Yes, let me tell you.

306
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:17,430
The most dangerous moment of the flight

307
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,280
was on your way to the airport.

308
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,890
Actually, I knew I was afraid of flying.

309
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,680
The kid saw the photo of his dad

310
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,560
working in Kuala lumpur.

311
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,250
He insisted to go there.

312
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,310
I thought I could get through with it.

313
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,070
But it turned out like this.

314
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,040
By the way,

315
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,910
every time I take a plane,

316
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,680
I'll bring these two pieces of paper with me.

317
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,400
It works.

318
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,280
I want to fly a plane when I grow up.

319
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,420
And fly with my mom.

320
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,580
Can you teach me how to fly a plane?

321
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:48,060
Sure.

322
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,400
Let me ask you a question.

323
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,810
If you can only choose one person

324
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:53,530
to be your teacher,

325
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,720
will you choose him or me?

326
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,060
You.

327
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,750
He's so cute.

328
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,680
Captain, I want you two together.

329
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,829
I want to take a photo with you two.

330
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,690
OK. Come here. We will stand here.

331
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,329
Instructor Gu.

332
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,280
Come on.

333
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,079
I won't do it.

334
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,099
Come on.

335
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,619
It's a child's wish.

336
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,650
Come on.

337
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,460
Xiazhi,

338
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,080
take a photo with my phone.

339
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:30,840
Ok.

340
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,720
Come on, kid.

341
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,600
Take a photo.

342
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:41,910
Hold on.

343
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,280
Here,

344
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:49,730
put this on.

345
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,520
Okay, look here.

346
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
Three, two, one.

347
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:11,400
Cheese.

348
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,050
You look so energetic. All right.

349
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,520
All right.

350
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,930
Give me back my hat.

351
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,540
Zhou,

352
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:21,880
this aeroplane model is for you.

353
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,800
All of us will

354
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,880
wait for you to grow up

355
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
and ride the plane you drive.

356
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
Okay, thank you.

357
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,070
You're welcome.

358
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,660
Give me a hug.

359
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,050
Let's go.

360
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,940
Shouldn't you get off work too?

361
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,120
We have to go back.

362
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,870
It might be midnight when we get home.

363
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,070
Thank you so much.

364
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,620
Say goodbye.

365
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:42,170
Bye.

366
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,800
Bye. Bye.

367
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,560
Take care.

368
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,320
Thank you.

369
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,160
Bye. Bye.

370
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:16,390
[Luzhou Airport]

371
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,530
The journey back is really bumpy.

372
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,930
My neck is about to fall apart.

373
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:27,800
I have some plasters.

374
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,060
Let me put it on for you.

375
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,550
Thank you, Chief.

376
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,510
You're welcome.

377
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,290
I noticed that you like kids.

378
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
How old is your child?

379
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,030
I don't have a child.

380
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,070
You're brave to give up having children

381
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,270
for your career.

382
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:53,980
Put it here.

383
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,440
I didn't give up.

384
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,020
When I was young, I was busy with work

385
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,710
and often separated from Xie.

386
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,420
So we missed the chance.

387
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,850
Sometimes when I see Xie, I can't help thinking

388
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,400
if we had a child,

389
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,480
would the child be more like him

390
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,550
or more like me?

391
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,330
So,

392
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,060
whether for men or women,

393
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,340
career is important,

394
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,920
but it's not everything in life.

395
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,850
You're still young.

396
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,680
You still have many choices.

397
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:40,710
Mr. Xie.

398
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,300
Captain Xie, what a coincidence.

399
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,250
I didn't even see you at home.

400
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,180
But we meet here.

401
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,310
I landed an hour ago.

402
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,750
I'm waiting for you.

403
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,760
Let's go home. I'll make soup for you.

404
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,860
No need, it's too late.

405
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,120
Give me your suitcase.

406
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,230
We're leaving.

407
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,640
Bye.

408
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,480
Take care.

409
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:16,850
How is it?

410
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,160
I heard that you

411
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,910
kneeled and hugging the traveler who is afraid of flying.

412
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,730
Is that why you feel uncomfortable?

413
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,050
Is that why you got cramp?

414
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,000
I was fine on the plane.

415
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,540
It suddenly hurts.

416
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,560
Don't wait for me.

417
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,760
Didn’t you ask Cheng Xiao out for dinner?

418
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,420
But how can I

419
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,840
leave you like this?

420
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,670
Stand up. Stand up straight.

421
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,760
Do you feel better?

422
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,800
What's wrong?

423
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,620
Captain Gu,

424
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,130
Yuheng has a leg cramp.

425
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:56,750
Is it serious?

426
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,040
Do you need to see the aviation doctor?

427
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,640
It's okay. I'll be fine soon.

428
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,500
You two live together, right?

429
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,860
Let me take you home.

430
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:05,420
No need.

431
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,150
Thank you, Captain Gu.

432
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,010
You're so nice.

433
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,850
I'm worried about her.

434
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,450
Let's go.

435
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:21,920
Let's go.

436
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,290
But Captain Gu,

437
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,080
I'm not lucky enough to take your car.

438
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,630
I have a dinner to go.

439
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:30,360
You go first.

440
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,370
Take care.

441
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,750
Then we'll leave first.

442
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:38,970
Okay, take care.

443
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:45,990
Bye.

444
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,280
I didn't know you like kids so much.

445
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,800
Kids?

446
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,880
I think

447
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,880
he's quite cute.

448
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,170
Come on.

449
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,200
Yuheng is so tired

450
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,490
dealing with that kid.

451
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,380
I will never

452
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,110
have children in the future.

453
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,090
light soup for this side, please.

454
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:44,550
Don't you only love spicy food?

455
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,310
I'm changing my taste recently.

456
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,040
I don't drink this. I drink water.

457
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,750
People say the water is tasteless.

458
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,350
But it actually tastes good.

459
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,910
It really tastes good.

460
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,780
What are you talking about?

461
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,640
Isn't Coke your favorite?

462
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,920
Thank you.

463
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,340
You're welcome

464
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,840
Thank you, Nanting.

465
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,440
Have some water.

466
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,300
I don't drink beverages, thanks.

467
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:26,910
Your face is cramping.

468
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,680
Why are you laughing?

469
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,680
What do you think of Gu Nanting?

470
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,530
Did he torture you

471
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,760
in the cockpit today?

472
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,920
Don't blame him too much.

473
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,390
You

474
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,010
just happened to see

475
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,640
the proud side of Captain Gu.

476
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:47,980
Actually,

477
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,840
he cares about others but never say it.

478
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,200
Now that you mention it,

479
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,310
It's seems a bit like that.

480
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,190
Not just a little.

481
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,180
Look,

482
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,260
he cares about Yuheng,

483
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,030
but he never shows it

484
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,120
in front of others.

485
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:07,710
Didn't you say it's one-sided love?

486
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,550
Things have changed.

487
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,240
Before you came,

488
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,770
Yuheng and I were standing in front of the company.

489
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,830
Her leg got cramp.

490
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,060
You have no idea how anxious Captain Gu was.

491
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,810
He wanted to send Yuheng home,

492
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,600
but he said he would send both of us home.

493
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,350
Isn't it obvious that he was

494
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,680
hinting me to disappear.

495
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,960
Should I go back home

496
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,930
later tonight?

497
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,920
How about I stay in your house?

498
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,070
Well,

499
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,280
what if Captain Gu

500
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,210
stays at my home tonight?

501
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,680
You think too much.

502
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,080
Actually, I really hope that

503
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,310
they can be together.

504
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,500
Think about it.

505
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,580
If Captain Gu

506
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,320
can be loved

507
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,950
by such a lovely girl,

508
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:52,830
maybe

509
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,020
he will slowly become warm.

510
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,790
In the future,

511
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,890
he won't be so harsh on the subordinates.

512
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,740
Isn't that beneficial to you?

513
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,450
The pig brain is ready. It's good for your health.

514
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:02,800
Okay.

515
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,280
What are you doing? It's not fully cooked yet.

516
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,600
Don't you want light soup?

517
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,130
Light soup doesn't suit me.

518
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,320
He cares about Yuheng,

519
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,110
but he never shows it

520
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,200
in front of others.

521
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,920
Yuheng's leg got cramp.

522
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:33,960
You have no idea how anxious Captain Gu was.

523
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,240
Should I go back home

524
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,340
later tonight?

525
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,250
How about I stay in your house?

526
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:40,870
Well,

527
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,010
what if Captain Gu

528
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,120
stays at my home tonight?

529
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,060
It still hurts.

530
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,140
Do I come back too early?

531
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,450
Gosh.

532
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:43,970
They're hungry?

533
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,760
Captain Gu.

534
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,430
I'm sorry. I don't know anything.

535
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,550
Did I come back too early?

536
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,010
What Captain Gu?

537
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,850
Why is it you?

538
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,230
Where is Captain Gu?

539
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,850
Didn't he send Yuheng back?

540
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,760
I don't know.

541
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,950
I didn't see him.

542
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,580
I'm here to borrow the detergent for my collar.

543
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,990
Xia, you're back.

544
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,920
Yuheng, why are you out?

545
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,270
Yuheng, how's your leg?

546
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,490
I went to the hospital.

547
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,570
The doctor said I'll be fine after some rest.

548
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:22,040
I made you banana milk.

549
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:22,930
See,

550
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,650
banana contains potassium

551
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,640
and milk can supplement calcium.

552
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,160
I'll get you soy milk

553
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,770
before my flight tomorrow.

554
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:29,590
No need.

555
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,930
This recipe is too middle-aged.

556
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,080
Thank you, Song.

557
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,210
You found me

558
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,530
such a cost-effective house.

559
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,270
It's my duty.

560
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,100
Try it.

561
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,260
How is it? Is it good?

562
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,820
Well,

563
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,940
she drank the milk and chatted with you.

564
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,800
What time is it?

565
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,800
What kind of decent person

566
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,950
comes to a single girl's home at this hour?

567
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,480
And even dressed like this?

568
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,420
Yuheng,

569
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:01,750
you must be tired from flying all day.

570
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,960
I'll go home then.

571
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,770
Good night, Yuheng.

572
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,770
Good night, Song.

573
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,900
Close the door.

574
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,030
Don't get your tail caught.

575
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,720
Annoying.

576
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,600
Yuheng,

577
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,460
don't open the door for everyone.

578
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,800
He looks like a beast,

579
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,020
dressing like that.

580
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,560
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

581
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,380
Gu Nanting!

582
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,210
Let's go.

583
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,290
Are you crazy?

584
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,000
What are you doing?

585
00:29:51,770 --> 00:29:53,300
What's the matter with you?

586
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:55,840
Who let you swim?

587
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,350
Why can't I swim?

588
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,340
From now on,

589
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,270
you can't swim in the sea,

590
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,720
and you can't ride a sea motorcycle.

591
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,040
You are forbidden to do any high-risk exercise.

592
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,970
Who are you to tell me what to do?

593
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:05,170
I'm your instructor.

594
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,520
Mr. Landlord,

595
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,470
have you received the rent?

596
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:43,430
You have solved the economic crisis?

597
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,580
I didn't resign,

598
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,220
and I was reinstated.

599
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,130
I was a little impulsive back then.

600
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,280
I want to thank you.

601
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,800
It's your choice.

602
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,010
Don't thank me.

603
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,640
Actually,

604
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,600
I have something

605
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,390
to ask for your opinion.

606
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,290
You have trouble in work again?

607
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,730
It's actually about relationship.

608
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

609
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,330
Listen to me first.

610
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,330
Here's the thing.

611
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,230
If a man

612
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,890
is strict, like extremely strict

613
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,230
to others,

614
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,790
but he treats a girl well

615
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,190
and becomes tolerant.

616
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:48,110
Do you think

617
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:49,410
he likes that girl?

618
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,560
But he is nice

619
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,690
to another girl too.

620
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,120
He saved her from potential danger once.

621
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,850
I suggest you

622
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,370
stay away from him.

623
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,840
Why?

624
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,480
Two-timing.

625
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,970
He's not worth it.

626
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,440
You mean he may be a scumbag.

627
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:55,900
Duer.

628
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:56,890
I'm here.

629
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,790
What is a scumbag?

630
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,820
There are 50 words said by scumbags.

631
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,750
You can see which kind you are.

632
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,850
I really like you,

633
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,500
but I don't want to be in a relationship.

634
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,790
You are too good for me.

635
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,140
Forget me.

636
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,930
You're a very nice girl.

637
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,330
She's just my friend.

638
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,080
Can't I have female friends?

639
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,160
Actually, I'm not as good as you think.

640
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,380
I don't want to waste your time.

641
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,980
You deserve someone better.

642
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes.

643
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,380
Thank you.

644
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,340
I'll be careful.

645
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,980
It's late. Good night.

646
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:00,760
Duer.

647
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,200
I'm here.

648
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,900
I just asked you what a scumbag is,

649
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:06,750
not whether I'm a scumbag.

650
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,770
All right, you don't have to answer.

651
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,330
I invited President. Xu to attend

652
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,770
the coordination meeting of the Flight department

653
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,560
and In-Flight Service Training department today.

654
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,320
I have something to report.

655
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:27,860
Our company

656
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,480
just received an important task.

657
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,320
Next week, a group of leaders of

658
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,780
Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China,

659
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,739
and their senior engineers and test pilots

660
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,060
are going to their base in Xi'an.

661
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,790
It's for the second test flight

662
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,150
of the third prototype

663
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,190
of D191.

664
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,810
D191 is a trunkliner

665
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,710
invented by our country.

666
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,090
Its successful invention broke the

667
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,690
long-term monopoly of European and American.

668
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,389
So this time,

669
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,260
sending their staff

670
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,400
is an improtant and

671
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,600
meaningful mission.

672
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,540
I'll be the captain

673
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,020
to make sure the flight goes smoothly

674
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,110
and nothing goes wrong.

675
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,710
Very good.

676
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:05,740
President. Xu,

677
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,070
should we

678
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,200
promote the cabin for their staff?

679
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,410
Promote the cabin?

680
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:13,940
Is this inappropriate?

681
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,920
Was it proposed by them?

682
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,200
No.

683
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,480
But it shows our passion.

684
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,570
I think

685
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,330
we should follow their will.

686
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,840
After all, these experts are used to living a simple life.

687
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,430
Don't let others gossip

688
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,800
because of our kindness.

689
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,600
It's not good.

690
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,240
Is that right?

691
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,790
Yes.

692
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:35,890
And

693
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,810
ask Nanting to go with you this time.

694
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,670
He is not busy with management.

695
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:42,640
I checked the schedule.

696
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,370
It was not easy to arrange

697
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,040
because Nanting will fly to special airport that day.

698
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,900
How about this?

699
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,050
I can choose

700
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,540
an excellent co-pilot

701
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,530
to carry out this flight with me.

702
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,630
As for co-pilots,

703
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,220
you can choose Cheng Xiao.

704
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,170
She has been doing well recently.

705
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,100
She was praised by the passengers.

706
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:06,470
But after all,

707
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,250
she's a newcomer in our Flight department.

708
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,120
Isn't it inappropriate?

709
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,300
President Xu,

710
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,170
I think

711
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,640
everyone knows

712
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,560
Cheng Xiao's progress and capability.

713
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,090
Now that we have the chance,

714
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,100
we should train young pilots.

715
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,760
I think what Nanting said makes sense.

716
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,090
The outstanding young people in our company

717
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,520
may become

718
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,830
a pilot of D191.

719
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,510
It can be considered as reserve talents for the company.

720
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,390
So let's work together.

721
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,680
Your department

722
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
can send more new staff.

723
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:42,870
Mix the new and the experience.

724
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:43,870
Ok, President Xu.

725
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,030
Tell me when you land.

726
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,160
I need to talk to you.

727
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,300
OK.

728
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:00,990
Captain Xie.

729
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:06,920
Cheng,

730
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,590
I saw Luzhou Airline's magazine.

731
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:11,480
Good job.

732
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,930
No matter what a pilot does,

733
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,780
in the end,

734
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:17,300
it's for passengers.

735
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,710
I...

736
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,150
Magazine?

737
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:21,710
You don't know?

738
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,240
You're on the company magazine.

739
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,570
A passenger

740
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:28,440
wrote three commendation letters to the company.

741
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,500
Congratulations.

742
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:30,800
Thank you.

743
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,000
And that photo

744
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,440
surprised me.

745
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,440
Which photo?

746
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,490
The photo of you two.

747
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,560
I've never seen Nanting smiled like that.

748
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,290
I thought

749
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,520
Nanting was helping you.

750
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:47,730
Now it seems

751
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:50,020
you're helping him too.

752
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,100
From now on,

753
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,400
you two should

754
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,880
cooperate well.

755
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,880
It's good

756
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,330
for both of you.

757
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,380
I ate too much breakfast.

758
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,870
Yuheng.

759
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,750
Yuheng, please monitor me.

760
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,060
I won't have lunch.

761
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:30,050
I won't have dinner either.

762
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,560
I have a flight today.

763
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,890
Keep an eye on yourself.

764
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,470
Yuheng, you have a call.

765
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,940
Ms. Ai.

766
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,780
Ms. Ai.

767
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,760
Yes, Ms. Ai.

768
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:58,600
I will work hard.

769
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,070
Ok.

770
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,820
What happened?

771
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,350
It's the key flight next week.

772
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,550
Ms. Ai asked me to go.

773
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,440
Is it the flight that many experts

774
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,880
fly to Xi'an?

775
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:11,410
Yuheng,

776
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:13,200
you are going to be successful!

777
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:13,920
But,

778
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,580
I'm already getting nervous.

779
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,310
I envy you.

780
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,600
When can I be the one

781
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,450
when will it be my turn?

782
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,420
It's alright.

783
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,050
Ms. Ai.

784
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,260
Yes, Ms. Ai.

785
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,170
I will complete the task

786
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,130
and do my best.

787
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,870
OK.

788
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:52,760
Yuheng.

789
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,430
Brother Nanting.

790
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,410
You just landed?

791
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,240
About serious bumps and the cooperation

792
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,610
with the aircraft team.

793
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,390
And what you told me last time.

794
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,770
I went back to study

795
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,020
and wrote some thoughts about it.

796
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,230
Am I processing this right?

797
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:48,630
I think something is wrong with this part.

798
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:51,090
In the future, when the plane is seriously bumpy,

799
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,090
you should protect yourself first.

800
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,750
Only by protecting yourself

801
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,550
can you protect the passengers.

802
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,400
I see.

803
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:17,990
If you have any questions,

804
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
you can come to me.

805
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:24,850
Yuheng,

806
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,030
I have work to discuss with Cheng Xiao.

807
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,510
I'm going back.

808
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:34,390
Thank you, Brother Nanting.

809
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,320
You're welcome.

810
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:45,760
Cheng Xiao, have a seat.

811
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,240
Won't your Yuheng get angry?
