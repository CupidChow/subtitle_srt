[Episode 24]

4
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,540
You're up so early.

5
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,360
When I woke up,

6
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,839
I found I was second again.

7
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,610
You've led so many trainees.

8
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,730
Do you know

9
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,740
what they like to

10
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
eat and drink in the morning?

11
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,780
No, I don't.

12
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,650
What does Cheng Xiao like to drink?

13
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,820
Coffee. Black tea is acceptable if no coffee.

14
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,380
She...

15
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,600
will ask the flight attendants

16
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,400
to order a cup of coffee or black tea for her

17
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,770
every morning flight.

18
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:16,820
Do you like her?

19
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,160
She

20
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,590
is my favorite trainee.

21
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,210
Is she just a trainee? That's all?

22
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:34,430
How is that possible?

23
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,460
That's good.

24
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,930
After all, you are in a mentor-apprentice relationship at the company.

25
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,860
If you like her,

26
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,810
I'll be in a tough spot.

27
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:57,330
Do you think Cheng Xiao and I are a good match?

28
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,220
What?

29
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,310
Do you think I'm not good enough for her?

30
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,150
No.

31
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:19,530
How could it be?

32
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,760
I've just started to have some directions in a romantic relationship.

33
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,020
You have to support me.

34
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,000
Nanting.

35
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,659
Tell me the truth.

36
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,380
Do you really have no feelings for her?

37
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:58,409
No.

38
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,210
Okay.

39
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,930
I'm relieved then.

40
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,450
I think Yuheng treats you well.

41
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,150
You two

42
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,530
grew up together.

43
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,660
Haven't you thought about it?

44
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,150
I don't drink anymore.

45
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,580
I'll check out the car.

46
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,610
Morning.

47
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,420
Where is he going?

48
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,559
He was worried about the car so he went to check it out.

49
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,159
Black tea.

50
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,500
Okay, thank you.

51
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,720
Here comes the bread.

52
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,340
Good morning, sister.

53
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,180
Morning.

54
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,520
What did you call me? Call me auntie.

55
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,090
Call you sister.

56
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,700
Captain Cheng, we have one more portion of the soup.

57
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,830
Take it for you guys.

58
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,990
Okay, thank you.

59
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,190
It smells so good.

60
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,720
What smells so good?

61
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,450
Let me try it.

62
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,900
The water is ready. Pour it yourself.

63
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,210
Cheng Xiao, you've changed.

64
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,870
Come on. Let me get it for you.

65
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,100
The bowl is clean.

66
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,080
OK.

67
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,450
Thank you, teacher.

68
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,170
Smells good, right?

69
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,150
Are you touched?

70
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,980
No, thanks.

71
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,250
Ni Zhan.

72
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,180
Take care of the car.

73
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,380
I'll arrange for today's schedule.

74
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,680
Gu Nanting.

75
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,960
Gu Nanting.

76
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,080
You don't look well.

77
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,450
Did you catch a cold yesterday?

78
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,410
What's wrong with you?

79
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,310
I need to check the return route for today

80
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,910
so that we can go back safely.

81
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,470
What's wrong with you?

82
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:11,490
Song,

83
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,550
do you have something to take?

84
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,070
Yes.

85
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,320
I got it wrong. It's in the classroom downstairs.

86
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,850
Let's go.

87
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,280
If there's nothing else,

88
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,990
go out and help them clean up.

89
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,230
OK.

90
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,430
Then arrange your route well.

91
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,180
I'll leave the rest to you.

92
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,830
Don't worry, Captain Gu.

93
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,050
The volunteer team

94
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
will arrive soon.

95
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,600
Whatever you want to eat,

96
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,860
just tell the teacher.

97
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,960
Ask the teacher to call us.

98
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,540
Teacher,

99
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,410
we're leaving.

100
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,600
Thank you so much this time.

101
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,290
Well...

102
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,050
Have a safe journey.

103
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,670
The kids and I are here.

104
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,350
If you have holidays,

105
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,440
you can visit us when you are free.

106
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,790
Okay.

107
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,560
Welcome to Luzhou also.

108
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,240
Okay.

109
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,480
Are you really leaving?

110
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,500
Yes, Xiao Le.

111
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,220
We're really leaving.

112
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,090
Study hard

113
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,320
and listen to your teacher.

114
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,160
Come to us

115
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:03,920
when you get enrolled in the university, okay?

116
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,720
I want to go to Beijing University or Tsinghua University.

117
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
If so, you need to pay a lot of effort.

118
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,630
By then,

119
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,850
you take the plane this uncle flies

120
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:13,850
to Beijing, okay?

121
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,810
It's a deal.

122
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,200
Okay, let's make a pinky swear and seal it.

123
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,470
How about we take a photo together?

124
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,580
Okay.

125
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,920
Let's use this

126
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,020
"study hard and make progress every day"

127
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,880
as the background, okay?

128
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:27,090
Okay, come here.

129
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,360
Come on.

130
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,870
Let me take a photo for you.

131
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,150
Okay.

132
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,030
-Come on, kid.
-Come on.

133
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,170
Come.

134
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
Brother Nanting, come here.

135
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:45,700
Come on.

136
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:47,290
Ready.

137
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,280
Three.

138
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,310
Two.

139
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,980
Captain Gu, smiles.

140
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,090
Smile.

141
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,800
Come on, get ready.

142
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,030
Three.

143
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,450
Two.

144
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,580
One.

145
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Cheese.

146
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,300
Liven up the atmosphere. Say something.

147
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
Regarding the analysis and organization of safety information,

148
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,920
I have some new ideas.

149
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,540
When can I meet you?

150
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,520
No need.

151
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,730
Just write a report.

152
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,680
You're not even interested in it.

153
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,280
The words are more accurate.

154
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,140
What's the matter?

155
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,160
I like you.

156
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,790
You know that, right?

157
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,700
Why are you avoiding me all of a sudden?

158
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:22,550
If anything I did before

159
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,950
made you misunderstand,

160
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,250
I'm sorry.

161
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,490
You are just my student.

162
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,340
That's all.

163
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,480
You mean

164
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,300
you rushed onto the plane to save me,

165
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,630
climbed into the ruins and rescued me,

166
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,400
we prepared for the speech and celebrated together...

167
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,060
I misunderstood all of those.

168
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,300
It's for work.

169
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:56,790
Last night,

170
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,900
did I

171
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,530
also misunderstand?

172
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,240
I'm sorry.

173
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,810
I've never had

174
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,390
any cross-boundary feelings for you.

175
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,260
I hope

176
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,109
you don't have other thoughts.

177
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,800
Gu Nanting, ask yourself.

178
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:23,359
Have you really never liked me?

179
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,339
Even for a minute,

180
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,329
a second,

181
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,770
haven't you?

182
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,060
No.

183
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Okay.

184
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,550
I see.

185
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,010
It's my own wishful thinking.

186
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,210
I misunderstood you.

187
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:40,830
Yuheng.

188
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,810
We're home, Yuheng.

189
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,180
She's not home.

190
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,510
Be careful.

191
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,230
Don't expose the secret about Xiao.

192
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,060
Don't worry. You've been talking all the way.

193
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,470
[Xia, I applied to go to Madrid-Sao Paulo. I've decided to train myself.]

194
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,470
[Don't worry. I'll take care of myself. Yuheng]

195
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:04,710
Oh my!

196
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,060
Yuheng flew Madrid-Sao Paulo.

197
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:09,900
Madrid and Sao Paulo?

198
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,640
That's our company's longest air route.

199
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,550
The round trip takes more than ten days.

200
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,750
Yuheng is so unlucky.

201
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,540
She volunteered

202
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,940
to train herself.

203
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,350
What's wrong?

204
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,810
Nothing.

205
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,220
I just feel

206
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:31,910
Yuheng is so pitiful.

207
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,640
When I was in Mount Lan,

208
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,370
I'd been observing Captain Gu.

209
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,180
I found that

210
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,200
the look he looked at Yuheng

211
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,150
is totally different

212
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,880
from the look he looked at Xiao.

213
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,480
How different?

214
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:44,810
Here.

215
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,510
Look at me.

216
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,920
This is the look in Captain Gu's eyes when looking at Yuheng.

217
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,510
It's without any waves.

218
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,940
But the way he looks at Xiao

219
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,400
is completely different.

220
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,510
Really?

221
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,380
When I think about

222
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:09,590
both of them

223
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,940
appear in front of me at the same time,

224
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,180
I think I'll go ballistic.

225
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,090
Why do you go ballistic? It's simple.

226
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,700
What do you mean?

227
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,140
We just get along like

228
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,490
how we got along before.

229
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,800
Your two best friends

230
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,040
are not three years old.

231
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,400
They can solve it themselves.

232
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,600
Why bother to meddle?

233
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,330
Regarding the romantic relationship, we should

234
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:31,860
let nature take its course.

235
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:33,260
Yeah.

236
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,490
Why did I get myself involved?

237
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:39,030
I haven't found my true love yet.

238
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,640
What am I thinking about every day?

239
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,620
You encountered something.

240
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,850
You sharpening the pencil

241
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,730
causes my blood pressure to go up.

242
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:16,660
Let me do it, mom.

243
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,790
If you don't want me to worry about you,

244
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,360
I won't ask anymore.

245
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,030
I know

246
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,200
you're temporarily trapped.

247
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,690
When you've made up your mind,

248
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,830
you'll make the right decision.

249
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:40,750
Thank you, mom.

250
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,720
What's up?

251
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,450
Besides the summary of safety information,

252
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,350
I also asked the Security Department

253
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,230
to analyze

254
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,720
the flight data recorder.

255
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,590
During this period,

256
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,100
there may be a rise

257
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,850
in causing heavy landings.

258
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,120
We need to be alert.

259
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,540
The draft is ready.

260
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,260
You may take a look.

261
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,460
From now on,

262
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,650
let Song take over

263
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,060
your safety information summarizing.

264
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,890
I will finish

265
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,340
this job.

266
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,870
This is called carrying something through to the end.

267
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:46,180
OK.

268
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,150
Do you have something to say?

269
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,340
I have something

270
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,430
to inform you in advance.

271
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:38,470
I had a meeting this morning.

272
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,950
Recently, the company has added more airlines

273
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,480
and brought in 4 new planes.

274
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,500
All departments

275
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:47,150
are making bring-in plans. We need more manpower.

276
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,580
President Xu asked

277
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,600
the Flight Department to follow the talent incentive plan

278
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,040
and select the left seat

279
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,490
from the excellent first officers in advance.

280
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,090
Next week,

281
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,180
you will be listed

282
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,870
for the first batch of upgrading training.

283
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:00,470
You can be assessed for the left seat position.

284
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,070
If I pass the test,

285
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,000
I can be the left-seat driver.

286
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,180
Well,

287
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,770
are you still the one who trains me?

288
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,780
I am tied up.

289
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,390
Although I'm not the instructor this time,

290
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,190
I hope you can take it seriously.

291
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,370
You think too much.

292
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,390
I'm not training for you.

293
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,970
This is the last stage before becoming a captain.

294
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,790
I know its importance very well.

295
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
I just don't want any other factors

296
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,630
affect your progress.

297
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,170
Don't worry.

298
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,140
I'm not that unprofessional.

[Two weeks later]

334
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:25,830
Today,

335
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,840
I have something very important

336
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,880
to announce.

337
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,830
Mr. Gao of our company

338
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,160
rarely gets involved in the company's affairs

339
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,360
due to his health problems.

340
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,120
He is also ready to

341
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,680
request a formal resignation from the board.

342
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,670
So after a careful decision from the board,

343
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,360
we are going

344
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,980
promote

345
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,640
a new vice president.

346
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:49,440
Currently,

347
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,720
we have nominated three candidates.

348
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:54,550
The first one

349
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:57,200
is Mr. Jiang Tao of the Flight Department.

350
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,450
The other

351
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:03,410
is Mr. Ni Zhan from the Maintenance Department.

352
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:06,960
Regarding the post-disaster support of Lanshan County,

353
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,850
after the news is released on the official account,

354
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:09,510
it brings a very high reputation

355
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,050
to our company.

356
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,560
Nanting.

357
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,900
You really contributed much

358
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,450
in this support operation.

359
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,040
You insisted to take part in the operation

360
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,970
and led the crews to make all-out efforts.

361
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,270
The board saw all of this.

362
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,450
So after discussion,

363
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,330
we decided to

364
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,770
leave the third candidate for you.

365
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,110
Thank you, President Xu and the board.

366
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:47,930
In the next four months,

367
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,720
the company will conduct a systematic inspection

368
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,430
for your work.

369
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,760
I hope you can

370
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,870
show me your ability and strength

371
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,230
in this period.

372
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:10,909
Brother-in-law,

373
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,050
Mr. Gu

374
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,710
is your subordinate.

375
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,880
His age and experience

376
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:18,620
are all his weaknesses.

377
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,880
The company arranged for him

378
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,540
to run for vice president with you.

379
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,600
Isn't this a bit...

380
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,370
Gu Nanting also contributed to disaster relief.

381
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:30,650
The company did this

382
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:32,190
to encourage young people

383
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,630
and give them a chance.

384
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,860
There's nothing wrong with that.

385
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,020
That's true.

386
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,469
Gu Nanting contributed much

387
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:41,969
for our company.

388
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:43,699
Brother-in-law,

389
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,260
I heard from Song that

390
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,400
he was planning a new safety system.

391
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:51,130
He wants to improve and optimize the original system.

392
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,440
I built the original system.

393
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,900
His doing

394
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,970
is questioning my ability.

395
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,130
But

396
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:03,220
his stuff is too childish.

397
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,140
Don't think about

398
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,500
the position of vice president.

399
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,820
Brother-in-law,

400
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,200
apart from Gu Nanting,

401
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,910
Mr. Ni is your other rival.

402
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:14,560
I remember

403
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,500
Mr. Ni joined the company one year earlier than Gu Nanting.

404
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,190
Not long after that,

405
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,990
he became the boss of the Maintenance Department.

406
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,510
I don't have much contact with him,

407
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,720
but he has a good reputation.

408
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,080
We were together

409
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,640
during the disaster relief.

410
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,520
He got along well with everybody.

411
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,680
Everyone likes him.

412
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,300
Nanting.

413
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,970
Congratulations.

414
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:51,580
You know,

415
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:56,080
I never thought about running for the vice president position.

416
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,610
And I never thought about competing with you.

417
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,160
I know.

418
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:01,620
But this is also the approval

419
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,820
of higher-ups to you.

420
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,190
What do you think?

421
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,940
Do you remember

422
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,190
I told you

423
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,840
I want to modify the operational manual

424
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,300
and build a new security management system?

425
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,120
Of course I do.

426
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:31,740
You also wish the company

427
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,600
can build our own aviation school

428
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,410
and cultivate the talents.

429
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,910
So that we can bring forward the safety pass

430
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,850
and implement the safety concept.

431
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,860
Vice President.

432
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:45,490
To me, it's not about power and profits.

433
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,700
It's about I can do what I want.

434
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,770
Ni Zhan,

435
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,170
since I have the chance now,

436
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,240
I want to try my best.

437
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,740
Then let's

438
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:57,780
work hard together.

439
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,450
I hope this

440
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,610
won't affect our relationship.

441
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,350
Of course not.

442
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,790
If you are promoted,

443
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,210
you will get this done well.

444
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,130
If I am promoted,

445
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,470
I'll do this for you.

446
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:16,830
Thank you.

447
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,880
Let's play for a while.

448
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,250
Sure.

449
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,130
Cheng.

450
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:58,590
Good.

451
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,060
The test results of the left-seat training are excellent.

452
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,820
From now on,

453
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,970
as a senior first officer,

454
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,800
after completing 200 hours of left-seat flying

455
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,930
under the monitor of your instructor,

456
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,810
you can pass the test and

457
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,170
be the captain and lead the team alone.

458
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,490
The day after tomorrow,

459
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,910
you fly with me first.

460
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:35,310
Now you have become a left seat.

461
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,270
In the future,

462
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,170
you should not only focus on the skills,

463
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:38,870
but also

464
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,380
how to manage the team

465
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640
and make the operation more smooth.

466
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:44,350
No problem.

467
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,810
I'm leaving, Mr. Gu.

468
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:08,620
Let's celebrate Captain Cheng passing the assessment.

469
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,480
Cheers.

470
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,750
By the way,

471
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,990
have you heard

472
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,710
the company's election for vice president?

473
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,640
Who wouldn't know such a big thing?

474
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,540
Do you think

475
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,060
will Brother Nanting

476
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,190
be able to become the vice president this time?

477
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,990
With Mr. Jiang pushing him down,

478
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,400
and Mr. Ni,

479
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:30,900
it would be difficult

480
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,770
for your Brother Nanting.

481
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,710
I have faith in Brother Nanting.

482
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,200
Otherwise, why would the company nominate him?

483
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,960
He's just there to accompany them.

484
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,430
Ask Xiao if you don't believe me.

485
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:42,530
Does Mr. Gu have confidence in himself?

486
00:39:42,530 --> 00:39:43,990
I don't know. Don't ask me.

487
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:44,780
I don't care.

488
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,470
Mr. Gu.

489
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Brother Nanting.

490
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:04,920
Brother Nanting.

491
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,410
You look good.

492
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,050
I heard you volunteered for the Sao Paulo flight.

493
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:16,060
I learned a lot from this long-haul flight.

494
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,320
There must be a lot of stories

495
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,880
from your journey to support the disaster areas, right?

496
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,450
Yuheng?

497
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,500
Xia Xia!

498
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:25,800
Yuheng, I miss you so much!

499
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:27,930
Why did you cut your hair?

500
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,600
I got it cut in Sao Paulo. It's not too bad, is it?

501
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,380
You look so cool and full of vigor. It's perfect!

502
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
I'll leave you to it. I'll get going.

503
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,160
You're in a good state.

504
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:37,720
Keep it up

505
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,820
Thank you, Brother Nanting.

506
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,160
Goodbye, Brother Nanting.

507
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:48,720
You're so beautiful.

508
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,980
Where did you buy this?

509
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,310
I bought it in Sao Paulo.

510
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:51,880
So pretty.

511
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,100
You've lost weight.

512
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,230
Really?

513
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,460
I see you're talking to Cheng Xiao again.

514
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,990
In the elementary school in the mountains,

515
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,570
we managed to talk it out.

516
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,450
Cheng Xiao seems to be in a bad mood.

517
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:13,890
Is it because of me?

518
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:15,770
How is that possible?

519
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,670
It's because–

520
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,920
she is struggling with her work.

521
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,400
What a pity.

522
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,560
I couldn't even go to the mountain with you.

523
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,910
There must have been a lot of meaningful things.

524
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,600
Well...

525
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,560
It is quite meaningful.

526
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,040
Well...

527
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,160
I found that after you came back,

528
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,760
you've completely changed.

529
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,390
You're shining.

530
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,630
What happened?

531
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,800
I've been thinking a lot lately.

532
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,080
I've decided

533
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,820
to change myself.

534
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,250
It's great to see you like this.

535
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,710
Yuheng is getting better and better.

536
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,240
Brother Zhan.

537
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:35,720
Are you in a hurry to fly?

538
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,140
There's still some time.

539
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:40,310
There's something I want to talk to you about.

540
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,110
You guys talk.

541
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,280
I'll go to the preparation room.

542
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,830
This is your first time sitting on the left seat, right?

543
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,560
Here's a gift for you.
