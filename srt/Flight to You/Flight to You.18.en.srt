It's right across the street.

Five.

11
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:05,810
Is this the one?

12
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,160
The lights are already out at this hour.

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,440
It is Instructor Gu’s style.

14
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,670
It's this one for sure.

15
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,290
What do you think

16
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,380
about me?

17
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm asking you.

18
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,310
What do you think about me?

19
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,490
Today,

20
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,950
President Xu will also be attending our investigation meeting.

21
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,640
Cheng Xiao has submitted a comprehensive written report

22
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,970
and explained the reason for her decision

23
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,600
at the time of the incident.

24
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,230
According to Cheng Xiao,

25
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,190
at that moment,

26
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,270
she believed only steering

27
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:38,330
could guarantee a collision wouldn't happen.

28
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,290
The experts of the investigation team and I

29
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,010
are all in agreement

30
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:42,640
regarding this.

31
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,550
Sorry.

32
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,580
I have a question.

33
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,370
I want to ask Ms. Cheng,

34
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,530
when you were steering,

35
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,610
did you think

36
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,350
it could possibly lead to slipping?

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
That thought did occur to me.

38
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,560
But I had enough confidence

39
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,580
in my skill.

40
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,430
Captain Jiang also proved after the fact

41
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,080
using the simulator

42
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,250
that braking would have avoided a collision.

43
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,190
Although simulators

44
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,550
cannot model real situations perfectly,

45
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,810
the investigation team

46
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,610
concurs with Captain Jiang’s simulation result.

47
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,370
Currently,

48
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,300
the contention is regarding

49
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,580
whether Cheng Xiao had defied

50
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
the Captain’s orders

51
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,440
when she steered the aircraft.

52
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:32,540
Based on

53
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,510
the cockpit recording data,

54
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,060
it is hard to determine

55
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,930
whether Cheng Xiao had ignored the captain’s orders.

56
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:40,630
However, in conjunction with

57
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,200
an analysis of the flight data recorder,

58
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,840
the details are very clear.

59
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,120
0.1 seconds after the captain gave his orders,

60
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,980
Cheng Xiao steered the aircraft.

61
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,270
This means that

62
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,659
at the same time that Cheng Xiao heard the Captain’s order,

63
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:54,730
or even before,

64
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,940
her brain had sent a signal to act.

65
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,170
The testimony of the two pilots

66
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:01,120
corroborates this situation.

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,080
Captain Jiang was operating

68
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,530
the landing procedure,

69
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,660
and didn't look up in time

70
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,400
to notice the situation ahead.

71
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,200
In an emergency,

72
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,500
Cheng Xiao executed what she believed

73
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,730
was the most reliable course of action to avoid a collision.

74
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,820
The investigation team believes

75
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,600
Cheng Xiao did not break the rules

76
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,460
by defying the captain’s orders.

77
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,390
Great.

78
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,380
The results

79
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,350
of the investigation have finally come out.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,060
However,

81
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,110
as the passenger who was injured

82
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,950
due to the steering

83
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,460
has a special identity,

84
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,540
there have been serious societal repercussions.

85
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,570
President Xu,

86
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,930
do you think the company

87
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,940
needs to

88
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,340
apologize and offer compensation?

89
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,120
We were just about to report on this

90
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,340
to President Xu.

91
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,840
This is the Chief Attendant

92
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,590
for that day, Ai Jia.

93
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,130
President Xu.

94
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,290
The Cabin Service department has something to report.

95
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,820
Go ahead.

96
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,680
Actually, the passenger's injuries

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,170
were not caused by the steering of the aircraft,

98
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,200
but because he didn't fasten his seat belt.

99
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,930
He didn't fasten his seat belt?

100
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,030
Why didn't you

101
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,580
remind the passenger?

102
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,790
We warned him repeatedly,

103
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,120
but he declined to do so.

104
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,290
Of course,

105
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,310
the flight attendant on duty was at wrong.

106
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,910
We will handle it seriously.

107
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:24,870
Also,

108
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,680
why didn't you

109
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,940
report this to the higher-ups promptly?

110
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,410
Because in the beginning,

111
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,240
only the flight attendant could testify.

112
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,750
Outsiders would not have been persuaded.

113
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,680
Only yesterday,

114
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,290
we found a witness among the passengers.

115
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:40,200
He's also a Platinum card holder of our airline.

116
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
He's willing to testify.

117
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,130
Good.

118
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,190
Very good.

119
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,310
The Cabin Service department

120
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:49,170
is to submit a detailed report of the matter

121
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,280
to the PR department as soon as possible.

122
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,680
We can't delay this any further.

123
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,620
We will hold a press conference tomorrow

124
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,440
to clarify the artiste's injury

125
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,770
as soon as possible,

126
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,159
in order to quell the negative public opinion online

127
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,590
and restore the company's image.

128
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:58,930
Okay.

129
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,650
President Xu.

130
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,390
Cheng Xiao...

131
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:11,950
Cheng Xiao is not liable.

132
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,420
I've read the report.

133
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,210
When Cheng Xiao was evacuating the cabin,

134
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,310
she discovered and rescued

135
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,310
a passenger on the plane

136
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,240
who had been trying to commit suicide.

137
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,300
Her courage and professional spirit

138
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,210
deserve our praise.

139
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:30,120
She has set a great example.

140
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,789
By the way, Mr. Jiang,

141
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,929
you should follow up on this.

142
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:37,549
We need to interview her

143
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,280
for the Luzhou Airlines Magazine.

144
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:41,049
OK?

145
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:41,770
OK.

146
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:43,710
Cheng Xiao,

147
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:45,820
you have done very well.

148
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,020
You have a promising future.

149
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,510
Thank you for your recognition, President Xu.

150
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,310
Thank you for your recognition.

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,000
I will keep working hard.

152
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,290
Keep it up.

153
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,610
Will Li Yuheng

154
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,370
receive severe punishment?

155
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,560
Everyone makes mistakes in work.

156
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:26,960
But admitting your mistake

157
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,360
is at least the first step to become better.

158
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,100
She

159
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:33,580
needs to learn her lesson and undergo more training.

160
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:36,100
Why do I feel like you're commenting on me?

161
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,310
Including this time,

162
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,200
I’ve been featured on Luzhou Airlines Magazine twice.

163
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,460
Both times have something to do with you.

164
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,900
The first time, the mother who was afraid of flying

165
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,630
wrote a letter of praise for us.

166
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,270
This time,

167
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,540
you risked your life to save me.

168
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,800
It has nothing to do with me this time.

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,330
You did a good job yourself.

170
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,160
Instructor Gu,

171
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,890
are you proud of me today?

172
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,140
Can you not be so stingy

173
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,160
with your praise?

174
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,320
Tell me.

175
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:18,180
What?

176
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,210
Tell me you’re proud of me.

Hello, Captain Gu.

178

We’re at the company. Be serious.

179
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:42,190
Right, I'm not at home.

180
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,750
By the way,

181

182
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:53,670
I've reported the people

183
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,800
who threatened you.

184
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,630
If you cooperate with the investigation,

185
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,740
it won't affect your life

186
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,470
negatively.

187
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,620
I haven't even

188
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,420
dealt with these things myself.

189
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:03,970
Instructor Gu,

190
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,330
you are so worried about me?

191
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,550
I’m doing this for the company.

192
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,850
I hope you can resume flying

193
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,080
without any worries.

194
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,370
I don't believe

195
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,900
you have no feelings for me.

196
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,840
Since you are walking so slowly,

197
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,040
I'll pace myself too.

198
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,400
One day,

199
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,970

200

202
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,120
Although Cheng Xiao hasn't been held liable,

203
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,000
it doesn’t mean it’s your fault.

204
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,560
You don’t think it’s her fault either?

205
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,590
She operated without permission and disrespected the captain.

206
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,590
Isn't this wrong?

207
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,620
She's so full of herself.

208
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
She doesn't take anyone seriously.

209
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,580
Isn't she like this?

210
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,840
If she didn't have that attitude,

211
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,240
she wouldn't have done it subconsciously.

212
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

213
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,320
You're right.

214
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,710
How long have you been flying?

215
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,410
Have you accumulated enough?

216
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,790
I'm still short about 100 hours,

217

218

Cherish it.

Not every first officer

220
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,940
can become a captain.

If I could have pacified that passenger

225
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,370

Flight attendants cannot indulge passengers.

I told you this when you first joined us.

Flight attendants are not the passengers' servants,

we are the hosts of the cabin.

233

Taking care of the passengers is important,

234
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,590
but more importantly,

235
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,390
we must protect the passengers.

You are gentle.

You can bring comfort to passengers.

That's your strength.

But Yuheng,

240
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,370
sometimes you have to be firm

241

so that you can shoulder greater responsibility.

242
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,360
I'll try to change myself.

I don't think so.

how can I deal with him in the future?

262

He saved you,

cleared your name,

264
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,420

You've been acting weird with Xiazhi lately.

Nothing.

how you became best friends with Xiazhi.

It's a long story.

Are we talking about the same person?

289
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,840
Maybe she doesn't treat you as a friend.

290
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,480
She'd better not treat me as a friend.

Alright.

292

350
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,450
The lift was working just now.

351
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,470
Why is it overweight all of a sudden?

352
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,250
Yeah.

353
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,340
Why didn't you wait for me this morning?

354
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:25,690
Song.

355
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,840
Is it overweight?

356
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Xiazhi, come out!

357
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,540
Come out!

358
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,180
Why should I go out?

359
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Is she a newcomer?

360
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,640
You don't know?

361
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,440
She is an important hire in our department.

362
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,940
Well...

363
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,890
A nepotism hire?

364
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,380
Don't say that.

365
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,440
Come out now.

366
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,030
The door won't close.

367
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,350
I'm coming out.

368
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,310
Come out.

369
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,720
Come out. Don't leave it to chance.

370
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,640
Come out.

371
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,610
You guys go.

372
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:04,710
Bye, Song.

373
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,980
-Bye. -See you later.

374
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,630
Take this one.

375
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,530
It's coming.

376
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,190
Aren't you taking the lift?

377
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,310
Xiazhi.

378
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,770
Wait.

379
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,020
Xiazhi.

380
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,070
Wait for me, Xiazhi.

381
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,420
What are you doing?

382
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,350
Don't listen to them.

383
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,860
Don't take it to heart.

384
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,660
What they said is true.

385
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,480
I don't deserve to be a flight attendant.

386
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,410
Everyone thinks I'm unqualified.

387
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,400
Actually,

388
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,780
your chubby round face

389
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,860
stands out among the attendants.

390
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,030
You mean to say

391
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,360
I am fat?

392
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,520
That's not what I meant.

393
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,120
I mean

394
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,940
you are so stubborn,

395
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:19,480
you must be able to

396
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,000
protect passengers at critical moments.

397
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,130
No one wants to be in a critical moment.

398
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,350
Even if I did,

399
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,130
I didn't do well, right?

400
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,630
That's not what I mean.

401
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:49,990
I quit.

402
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,130
I quit.

403
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,250
Come and take a break.

404
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,720
Let me try attacking later.

405
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,490
It's boring always defending.

406
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:05,700
I'd like to change my role and try to see if I can get my old self back.

407
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,110
What's wrong with you?

408
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:08,890
Why?

409
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,370
Did something good happen?

410
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,720
I can't have dinner with you tonight.

411
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,640
I have plans.

412
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,450
Did something good happen?

413
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,150
This is an instagrammable restaurant.

414
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,940
Xiao, you really have good taste.

415
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,670
Of course.

416
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,450
There you go. Have some juice.

417
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,440
Thanks.

418
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,520
Have some juice.

419
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,420
Thank you, Xiao.

420
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,350
You're welcome.

421
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,410
Xiazhi.

422
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,580
Welcome. Please come in.

423
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,650
Brother Nanting, here.

424
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,940
Hello, Captain Gu.

425
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,810
Brother Nanting.

426
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,800
Am I late?

427
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,250
We knew you would be punctual?

428
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,650
We came early on purpose.

429
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,940
How can we make Instructor Gu wait for us?

430
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,140
Nanting, have a seat.

431
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,840
I need to wash my hands.

432
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,440
You start first. Don't wait for me.

433
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,970
The bathroom is over there.

434
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,320
Everyone is here. Let's start grilling.

435
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,820
Wait, there's one more.

436
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,090
And...

437
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,460
-Zhan, we’re here. -Mr. Ni.

438
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,040
-Hello, Mr. Ni. -Hello, Mr. Ni.

439
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,060
Sorry, I'm late.

440
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,020
To congratulate you ladies on coming back safe and sound,

441
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,680
I prepared some gifts for you.

442
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,790
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

443
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,040
Wish you all the best.

444
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,150
Thank you. I didn't expect we would have gifts.

445
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,980
Mr. Ni, you're so sweet.

446
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:38,240
I've been wanting this toothbrush for a long time.

447
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,620
I heard it cleans the best.

448
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,340
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

449
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,500
My pleasure.

450
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,580
Ni Zhan.

451
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,260
Don't you have plans?

452
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,220
What a coincidence.

453
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,130
This is my plan.

454
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:00,940
Have a seat please.

455
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,620
Come on.

456
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:14,270
Cheng Xiao.

457
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:16,490
Congratulations.

458
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,580
Look.

459
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,970
[Luzhou Airlines Magazine]

460
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,160
You all brought it.

461
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:28,870
I feel embarrassed.

462
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,080
I look so bad in this picture.

463
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,590
It's so embarrassing. I'm gonna put it away.

464
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,190
Thank you.

465
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,170
You must be hungry.

466
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,030
Let's grill it.

467
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,420
I want sake.

468
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,240
You should drink today.

469
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,850
Yuheng, can you drink?

470
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,780
I can drink a bit.

471
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,570
Xiazhi.

472
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,160
Did you just land?

473
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,050
You want some?

474
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,820
I don't want it, either.

475
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,020
I'll have some juice.

476
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:57,380
Okay.

477
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,700
Today, the two of us

478
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,040
will be your drivers.

479
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:02,920
You guys

480
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,660
can drink as much as you want.

481
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

482
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,670
I want to thank everyone

483
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,140
for what you did this time.

484
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,290
First, to Yuheng.

485
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,850
Thank you for having that platinum passenger

486
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:17,550
to testify.

487
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,580
I feel sorry for getting you punished.

488
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,310
Cheng Xiao,

489
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,350
I should have told you earlier.

490
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,600
It's my fault you were misunderstood by those fans.

491
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,200
I'm sorry.

492
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,690
It's not the first time I've been misunderstood.

493
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,450
But these two days,

494
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,100
I've been asking myself

495
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,430
if I did anything wrong.

496
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,360
Why didn't I

497
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
notice Youji Airlines' plane earlier?

498
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,740
You did a good job.

499
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,350
Instructor Gu,

500
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,270
I should thank you

501
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,240
the most.

502
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,860
I won't say too much.

503
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,020
There's a long way ahead of us.

504
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:09,570
Zhan,

505
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,910
thank you for taking care of Q.

506
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:15,930
It's my pleasure.

507
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,130
Who is Q?

508
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,010
You have a pet again?

509
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,240
It's a secret.

510
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,660
Song.

511
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,060
To me?

512
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,170
I didn't help much this time.

513
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,290
Have you forgotten?

514
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,140
Xiazhi.

515
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,600
You're only eating.

516
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,150
This time,

517
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,600
I didn't think about your feelings.

518
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:02,880
Let's talk

519
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,830
when you're not angry anymore.

520
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,430
I can't drink much.

521
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,120
This one is to everybody.

522
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,230
Thank you.

523
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,330
Mr. Ni, the meat is ready.

524
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,240
Thank you.

525
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
Brother Nanting.

526
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Thank you.

527
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,440
Although

528
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,450
this matter is over,

529
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,870
I saw

530
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:43,830
there is more and more false news about Luzhou Airlines.

531
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,440
Our company held a press conference

532
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,970
and posted an investigation notice on Weibo.

533
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,120
But I saw someone still picking on us

534
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,030
in the comments.

535
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,860
I'm wondering

536
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,790
if there's any way

537
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,040
for us

538
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,700
to clear the company's name.

539
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,170
Zhan,

540
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:00,580
are you familiar with the people in the PR Department?

541
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,970
We have a bit of history.

542
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,220
Can you ask them

543
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,590
to make a simple animated video

544
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,180
to explain this accident.

545
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,780
The reason the male celebrity got injured

546
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,010
is because he violated the safety rules.

547
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,890
In this way,

548
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,090
not only can we restore the situation,

549
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:15,550
but also

550
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,540
publicize safety knowledge.

551
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,280
Kill two birds with one stone.

552
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,310
This kind of publicity

553
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,450
needs a budget.

554
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,870
I'm afraid we're not close enough for that.

555
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,420
That's a good idea.

556
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,140
But indeed,

557
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,440
the PR Department belongs to another system.

558
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,520
Besides, to the company,

559
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,060
this incident is over.

560
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,220
They may not approve

561
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,740
an additional budget for publicity.

562
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
I can give it a try.

563
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,550
It's just an animated video.

564
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,810
I know a bunch of advertising companies

565
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:48,370
from my previous job.

566
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:49,940
They must be willing

567
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,660
to collaborate with a big company like Luzhou Airlines,

568
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,320
even if it's for free.

569
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,540
Besides,

570
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,190
the head of the PR Department

571
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,510
is my good friend.

572
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,410
I can persuade him with a free meal.

573
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,850
Xia is good at networking.

574
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:02,510
Drink more.

575
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,070
This is good for Luzhou Airlines.

576
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,450
I'd like to

577
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,480
propose a toast to Xia Zhi.

578
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,300
Come on.

579
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:11,730
Wait.

580
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,680
Who should pay for

581
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,130
that meal?

582
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,970
I'll transfer the money to you.

583
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,170
Come on.

584
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,400
Let me send you back home.

585
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,950
Thank you so much, Mr. Ni.

586
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,640
Thank you.

587
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,480
His car can't fit so many people.

588
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,360
Yuheng.

589
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,940
Take Captain Gu's car.

590
00:30:57,950 --> 00:30:59,280
Let's go. Get in the car.

591
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,540
We live so close. Why don't you give me a ride?

592
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,330
I'm sorry.

593
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,820
I need to go to the airport.

594
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,300
A batch of parts have arrived.

595
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,760
I need to go back and check.

596
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,640
Okay.

597
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,130
Thank you, Mr. Gu.

598
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,050
Bye, Zhan.

599
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,210
Bye, Mr. Ni.

600
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,460
Bye.

601
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,360
Bye.

602
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,590
Let's go. Get in the car.

603
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,110
Let's sit in the back.

604
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,270
Song, take the passenger seat.

605
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:38,600
Okay.

606
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,440
Wait, wait.

607
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,110
Yuheng, you take the passenger seat.

608
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,200
Come on. Get in the car.

609
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,740
Hurry, get in the car.

610
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:07,830
Nanting.

611
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,540
Your car is so spacious.

612
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,340
It can definitely fit three people in the back row.

613
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,620
You three live together, right?

614
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,020
Yes.

615
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,560
Actually, Song lived across the street.

616
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,800
He had a leak in his home

617
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,760
so he moved here temporarily.

618
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,220
Yes.

619
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,750
Brother Nanting.

620
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,010
why don't you send Cheng Xiao home first?

621
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,120
I feel sorry

622
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,320
for making her spend so much tonight.

623
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,780
You can send us back later.

624
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,170
You all go first.

625
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:34,300
I live in the same building complex as Instructor Gu.

626
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,600
What a coincidence.

627
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,740
You wouldn't believe it,

628
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,540
I'm a tenant of one of Instructor Gu's apartments.

629
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,370
What a small world!

630
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:44,590
Xiao,

631
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,890
you live so close to Brother Nanting.

632
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,440
If you have any problems at work,

633
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,480
it's convenient for you to ask him.

634
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm so jealous of you.

635
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,390
Why are you so talkative?

636
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,310
What a coincidence.

637
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,430
Brother Nanting.

638
00:32:58,430 --> 00:32:59,160
Is Cheng Xiao

639
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,100
living in Auntie Qin's apartment?

640
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,990
Yes.

641
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,040
I didn't know anyone in Luzhou when I first came here.

642
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,120
I have to thank Auntie Qin

643
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,180
for inviting me over for meals often.

644
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:12,840
Instructor Gu,

645
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,320
I've lived in that apartment

646
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,640
for almost three years.

647
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,100
I haven't seen Auntie Qin.

648
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:18,830
Should I go

649
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,570
visit the landlord?

650
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,900
Didn't you meet her before?

651
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,190
When?

652
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,140
There was a female engineer

653
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,630
on the last protected flight to Xi'an.

654
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,980
That's Auntie Qin.

655
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,540
She was so beautiful and elegant.

656
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,870
She even encouraged me.

657
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,110
She said

658
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,890
she likes you very much.

659
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,770
Auntie Qin has good taste.

660
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,770
I really should pay her a visit then.

661
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:48,830
Yuheng.

662
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,570
We're closer to your house.

663
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:51,970
I'll send you back first.

664
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,850
Yuheng.

665
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:20,429
What's wrong?

666
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,820
I'm fine.

667
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,040
Yuheng.

668
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,739
Why don't you go up first?

669
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,040
Song and I

670
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:34,500
need to buy some water from the convenience store.

671
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,130
Okay.

672
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,949
There's no water at home again?

673
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:40,940
Come here.

674
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:48,630
Mind your tongue

675
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
when we're back home.

676
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,489
You...

677
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,230
Can't you tell that Yuheng likes Captain Gu?

678
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:01,630
Really?

679
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,730
Are you blind?

680
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,100
It's so obvious.

681
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,650
Yes.

682
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,960
Is it Yuheng's one-sided love

683
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,640
or does Brother Nanting feel the same?

684
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,100
Why are you asking so much?

685
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:18,660
Didn't you ask me to mind my tongue?

686
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:20,230
I have to find out more.

687
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,300
Anyway,

688
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,770
help wingman Yunheng

689
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,810
when we're with Captain Gu.

690
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,960
But

691
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,350
Xiao seems to

692
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:33,450
have have feelings for Brother Gu too.

693
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:33,990
Xiao?

694
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,840
When did that happen?

695
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Why didn't I know?

696
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,340
Why are you asking so much?

697
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:38,990
You...

698
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:41,250
I won't tell you if you don't tell me.

699
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,190
You're obviously making it up.

700
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,250
Trying to trick me?

701
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,090
No way.

702
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,360
Aren't we going to buy water?

703
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,220
What water? We have water at home.

704
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,260
It's here. Thank you, Instructor Gu.

705
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,480
Good night.

706
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,250
I have something for you.

707
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,040
What is it?

708
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,340
Get off the car.

709
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:25,510
Go to my house.

710
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,250
Let's go.

711
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,890
How about

712
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,350
you bring it to the company tomorrow?

713
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,840
It's not convenient to bring it with me.

714
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,430
What are you thinking, Instructor Gu?

715
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,170
Nothing.

716
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,620
Fine.

717
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,320
It's good to check out the apartment.

718
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:07,180
Let's go.

719
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,500
Come in, my landlord.

720
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:28,350
We're landing.

721
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,000
Is someone home?

722
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,220
Should I not intrude?

723
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,380
This is my buddy, Polly.

724
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:36,400
Come in.

725
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,880
It's taking off.

726
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,450
Why does it seem different?

727
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,810
I made a little change.

728
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:55,130
The house looked too cold before.

729
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,400
I couldn't do too much.

730
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,200
It's not as good as your collection.

731
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,730
Why are they all colourful?

732
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,870
Colorful?

733
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,000
It's just graffiti.

734
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,490
It suits your personality.

735
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,960
Where did you get this?

736
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,860
I guess you have one too, right?

737
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,730
Mr. Ni gave it to you, right?

738
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,090
How did you know?

739
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,380
Because I recommended this to him

740
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,330
in Australia.

741
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,560
This is my motivation to move forward.

742
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,930
Instructor Gu's teaching method

743
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:52,610
is unique.

744
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,240
Doesn't it look familiar?

745
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:07,850
This is…

746
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,560
Here's every route

747
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,180
you've flown

748
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:12,210
from the first day

749
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,820
of your career.

750
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,260
It's Rome.

751
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,000
It was on my first day

752
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,500
as the captain of 787.

753
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,750
How did you know that?

754
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,950
I have my ways.

755
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,590
Come on, let me test my instructor.

756
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,360
Are you interested

757
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,040
in my work

758
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,970
after I joined the Passenger Transport Department?

759
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,780
I'm done.

760
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:39,940
You missed one.

761
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,150
From Xi'an to Luzhou.

762
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,290
I remember.

763
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,210
But you had some problems landing

764
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,750
during that flight.

765
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:50,860
I don't think it was successful.

766
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,330
Although it was not perfect,

767
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,770
it's my favourite one.

768
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,730
This map is yours.

769
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,080
From now on,

770
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,080
every time I fly,

771
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,700
you need to draw a line for me

772
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,980
and see how long it takes before I catch up with you.

773
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:37,720
What?

774
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,120
As an instructor,

775
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,360
you don’t even

776
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,640
want to monitor the work of your trainee?

777
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,420
One day,

778
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,740
this map will cover as many places

779
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,340
as that map.

780
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,620
At that time,

781
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,050
I'll probably have become a great captain,

782
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:07,380
just like you.

783
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
Welcome on board.

784
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,270
Welcome on board.

785
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,260
He must be hungry.

786
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,170
Go have a look.

787
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,470
I have to go. Good night.

788
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,230
Don't miss any route.

789
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,430
Bye.

790
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,330
Polly, you're in big trouble.

791
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,570
You're in big trouble, you know?

792
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,710
Shut up!
