4
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Please open the door.

5
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,140
Here are your slippers.

6
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,550
Instructor Gu, you raise plants?

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,259
Come with me.

8
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,620
Her name is Luo Yi.

9
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,500
She's Ni Zhan's sister.

10
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,880
She's also

11
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,660
my ex-girlfriend.

12
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,620
Is she the female pilot

13
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
you talked about?

14
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,330
After she left,

15
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,160
I think I don't deserve anything

16
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,180
except for work.

17
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,840
So I rejected everyone,

18
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,110
including you.

19
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,370
You were right.

20
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,710
I've actually liked you even

21
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,130
way before Lanshan.

22
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,160
But I didn't have the courage to admit

23
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,610
I chose to be cold to you and stay away from you.

24
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,240
I thought by doing this,

25
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,510
I can go back to my normal life,

26
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,070
to work, rest, and continue working.

27
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,340
But I failed.

28
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,980
Because there's a new person

29
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,360
in my heart.

30
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,510
I'm not saying this

31
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,320
not to defend myself,

32
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,709
but to show you

33
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,040
a complete me.

34
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,590
I want to tell you myself that

35
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,540
I like you.

36
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,490
Gu Nanting.

37
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:41,340
I want to ask you a question.

38
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,150
Answer me honestly.

39
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,270
Have you

40
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,240
ever seen me as Luo Yi's replacement?

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,080
How is that possible?

42
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,450
Why would you think that way?

43
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
She is a female pilot.

44
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,750
I am one too.

45
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,520
I like you not because you are a female pilot.

46
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,270
But because you are Cheng Xiao.

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,840
I don’t need your answer now.

48
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,470
Actually,

49
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,160
I'm ready to be rejected by you.

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,050
Thank you for being honest with me.

51
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:41,920
But my mind's in a mess now.

52
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,960
I just want to work again

53
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,000
and fly again.

54
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,490
I...

55
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,670
Let's make a deal first.

56
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,450
Go ahead.

57
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,300
In the company,

58
00:05:58,930 --> 00:05:59,990
we're colleagues,

59
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,590
you are my leader.

60
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,090
In private,

61
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,470
can we be friends first?

62
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,230
We are already friends.

63
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,430
You are an important friend to me.

64
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,360
I need to

65
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,840
go back and see how my mom is doing.

66
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,730
It's late.

67
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,840
See you.

68
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,920
Why are you still up?

69
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
-Xiao is back.
-Xiao's back.

70
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,320
How is it?

71
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,850
What do you mean?

72
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,810
Couple time.

73
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,250
Tell me the truth.

74
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,970
Say it.

75
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,350
Alright, let's not talk about this.

76
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,810
Your mom and I have decided to stay in a hotel.

77
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,350
Why?

78
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,500
Isn't it good to live at home?

79
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,130
You think my house is small?

80
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,659
That's not what I mean.

81
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,370
We don't want you to keep sleeping on the sofa.

82
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,170
I'm willing to sleep on the sofa.

83
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,050
Look at you.

84
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,080
We've booked a hotel.

85
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,920
It's next to Dr. Yu's clinic,

86
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,180
it's very convenient.

87
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,170
I even rented a car on Yihai.

88
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,350
You can fly without worries.

89
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,900
When you stop flying,

90
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,610
our family will be reunited.

91
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,840
You...

92
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,950
Your mom is rich.

93
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,110
Fine.

94
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,350
What about your work?

95
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,130
I've applied to decrease my workload.

96
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,900
Your mother

97
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,210
wants to withdraw from the law firm.

98
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,770
When she gets better,

99
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
we've discussed,

100
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,450
we'll go travelling

101
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:22,390
twice a year.

102
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,580
One short distance and one long distance. How's that?

103
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:26,730
I didn't agree

104
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,920
to go with you.

105
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,900
I want to go with Xiao/

106
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,110
What do you mean?

107
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,059
You two love each other

108
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,600
so you're leaving me to be

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,590
alone at home?

110
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:39,110
Okay, I'll take you with me.

111
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,260
-That’s right.
-Let’s take your dad.

112
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,040
In the company,

113
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,820
we're colleagues,

114
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,390
you are my leader.

In private,

116
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,450
can we be friends first?

117
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,760
I like you not because you are a female pilot.

118
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,480
But because you are Cheng Xiao.

119
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:13,560
Polly, do you think

120
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,420
I should be calculative with him?

121
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,420
If you don't say anything,

122
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,750
then I will let him off the hook?

123
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,460
Don't talk.

124
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,560
I won't listen to you anyway.

125
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,690
-Xiao. -Xiao.

126
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,980
Xiao is back.

[Flight Safety Manual–Edited]

128
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,790
Thank you everyone

129
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,180
for volunteering to participate in the safety manual

130
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,640
of the Flight Department.

131
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,440
As for the latest flight safety manual,

132
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,840
under the approval and guidance of the Operation Standard Department,

133
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,500
it has already been enforced.

134
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,160
This is a new safety manual.

135
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,920
Compared to the old version,

136
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,560
this version

137
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,220
has modified 362

138
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,040
rules.

139
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,040
Among them, 69 of them

140
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,690
were proposed by Mr. Jiang who has resigned.

141
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,280
The enforcement of this new manual

142
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,310
means that Luzhou Airlines

143
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,710
will lead the way to build

144
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,470
a more perfect civil flight system.

145
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,890
From now on,

146
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,640
I hope that Luzhou Airlines' pilots

147
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,370
should not only be highly skilled,

148
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,340
but should also have the utmost

149
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,570
safety awareness among the airlines.

150
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,110
Trainee Captain Cheng Xiao and I

151
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,680
have been working for a long time on the Safety Manual.

152
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,770
The new safety manual

153
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,310
will be continuously updated

154
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,370
for a long time in the near future.

155
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:52,460
Every time it's updated,

156
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,120
we will relay it to everyone as soon as possible.

157
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,800
The new safety system

158
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,380
needs everyone's efforts

159
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,840
to continue

160
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,800
collecting safety information.

161
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,340
Luzhou 8301,

162
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,300
runway 34 left, ready for take off.

163
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:08,670
Runway 34 left, ready for take off.

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,700
Luzhou 8301.

165
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,170
In the next three months,

166
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,190
we hope everyone can take the time to

167
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:17,130
of the new safety manual.

168
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,010
In the future processes,

169
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,530
if you find any problems

170
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,740
or have any new ideas,

171
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,020
please

172
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,630
feel free to say anything.

Congratulations, Zhan!

176
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,960
Congratulations, Zhan!

177
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,460
Congratulations, Zhan!

178
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,290
Congratulations, Zhan!

179
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,470
This is your idea, right?

180
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,020
Zhan,

181
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,890
after you become the president,

182
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,290
will you leave the mechanical department?

183
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,730
The mechanical department will always be my home.

184
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:58,240
I

185
00:13:58,410 --> 00:13:59,810
will always be your boss.

186
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,320
Do you hear me?

187
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,520
What should I do?

188
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,830
What are you doing? Get down.

189
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,110
Get down.

190
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,160
Come down.

191
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,280
Zhan,

192
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,080
You have to treat us, right?

193
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,700
At least a seafood meal, right?

194
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,340
Yes.

195
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,650
That's right.

196
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,220
You left too fast after the meeting.

197
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,900
I didn't get to congratulate you.

198
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,900
I heard from President Xu that

199
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,280
you left the election.

200
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,610
I didn't mean to let you win.

201
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,020
Let me?

202
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,530
What do you mean?

203
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,310
I'm confident I can win against you.

204
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,780
But I'm good at turning the tide.

205
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,220
Not convinced.

206
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,440
Let's have a match up some day?

207
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:08,960
Okay.

208
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,900
Get the tissues ready.

209
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,290
I'll beat you to tears.

210
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,570
There's something

211
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,630
I haven't been able to tell you.

212
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,680
Some time ago,

213
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,960
I thought Mr. Jiang would win for sure.

214
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,890
When Mr. Guo posted the video online,

215
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,120
I contacted online trolls

216
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,030
to make the situation even bigger.

217
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,770
But

218
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,790
you didn't do that in the end.

219
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,150
Because I suddenly realized,

220
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,430
I'm starting to not know myself anymore.

221
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,040
I don't know when

222
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,490
I started becoming like this.

223
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,380
When you have more thoughts,

224
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,920
it's inevitable that you will be at loss.

225
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,570
But luckily,

226
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,460
you still have your own bottom line.

227
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,730
You're still the Ni Zhan I knew.

228
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,500
I'm your leader now.

229
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,190
I don't need you to lecture me.

230
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,620
How are things going with Cheng Xiao?

231
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,230
It's going okay.

232
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,240
You explained yourself?

233
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,970
Looks like you got rejected.

234
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,160
It was my fault.

235
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,000
I hurt her.

236
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,990
Do you think we've been fighting for a long time

237
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,630
in the end,

238
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,220
someone took advantage of it.

239
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,859
It's possible.

240
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,630
What's with you?

241
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,150
Aren't you devil Gu?

242
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,580
I'm really not good at things like that.

243
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,330
Men can't say they can't.

244
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,280
Go after her!

245
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,360
A good girl will fall to pestering men.

246
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,910
You pestered her a lot, didn't you?

247
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,490
But what happened?

248
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,440
Yes, I can't.

249
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,240
Men can't say "no."

250
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,570
Fine, I can't.

251
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,300
But you have to make it.

252
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,870
Sure.

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,480
Sure.

254
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,060
Come on in.

255
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:35,970
Wait for me.

256
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,750
Excuse me. Excuse me.

257
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,030
Let's squeeze.

258
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,160
Make way for Xia Zhi.

259
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,690
Thank you.

260
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,150
Thank you.

261
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,240
Xia Zhi,

262
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,960
it's overweight again.

263
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,830
What do you mean again?

264
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,140
It's me.

265
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,660
I've gained weight recently.

266
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,110
I'm sorry. I'll get out.

267
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,920
Why isn't it working?

268
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,050
I can't leave.

269
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,570
Why did you follow me out?

270
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,140
Don't pretend to be nice.

271
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,850
I did gain weight recently.

272
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,410
Besides, why did you glare at me just now?

273
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,630
We are on the same flight.

274
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,530
Why didn't you wait for me?

275
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,520
You were putting on makeup in your room.

276
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,050
I've urged you three times.

277
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
It's normal for that girl to be slow.

278
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,630
Just rush me more.

279
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:48,290
Before I went out,

280
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:50,150
I rushed you for the fourth time.

281
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,730
Okay, I'll wait for you.

282
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,220
I will wait until the sea withers and stone rots, okay?

283
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,750
No thanks. Making it look like we're a family.

284
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:17,140
By the way,

285
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,790
I haven't congratulated you yet.

286
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,990
You're finally in the second cabin.

287
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,070
When I return this time,

288
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,180
I'll treat you

289
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,850
a movie.

290
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,650
That'd depend on my mood.

291
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,880
But,

292
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,760
there's an animation that's quite popular recently.

293
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,570
Animation?

294
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,460
Only a kid would watch animation, how childish.

295
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,090
Do you want to see it?

296
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,720
Yes.

297
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,140
This one's coming.

298
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:08,730
Xiao,

299
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,560
we're going through security check.

300
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,230
Go back.

301
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,140
I'll wait a little longer.

302
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
If the flight is cancelled,

303
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,010
you can go back with me for a few more days.

304
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:19,890
Xiao,

305
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,840
I know you don't want your mother to leave.

306
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,970
But we need to go back to make arrangements to retire.

307
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,420
Yun,

308
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,640
don't be nervous.

309
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,010
Dr. Yu said,

310
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,130
you're recovering very well.

311
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,980
But no matter what,

312
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,500
it's real flying.

313
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,340
Yes, it is.

314
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,480
So don't treat it as a treatment.

315
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,100
Just think of it as a wonderful journey.

316
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,630
You can't give up.

317
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,480
These two tickets

318
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,280
costed me half a month's salary.

319
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:01,440
Exactly.

320
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,210
Besides,

321
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,130
this time,

322
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,560
Gu, Xiaoxiao's instructor, will be flying it personally.

323
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,360
It'll be fine.

324
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:07,790
Oh right,

325
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,770
how's it going with Gu?

326
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,960
I told you

327
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,000
we're just colleagues.

328
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,160
What about Ni?

329
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,250
It's time. Are you still flying?

330
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,250
Xiao, I think Mr. Gu

331
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,210
is a nice person.

332
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,040
You must think about it carefully.

333
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:25,840
Do you hear me?

334
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,510
Alright, we're leaving.

335
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,280
We're leaving.

336
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,210
Let's go.

337
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,660
When you

338
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,390
board the plane later, text me.

339
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:43,680
Tell me when you land too.

340
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,560
Okay.

341
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,720
-Have a safe trip.
-Go ahead.

342
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,280
We're leaving.

343
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,690
Okay.

344
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,730
Go back.

345
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:16,330
Song Song.

346
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,470
You

347
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,150
know Cheng Xiao well.

348
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,950
Do you know

349
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,020
she likes

350
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,050
like

351
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,130
what kind of–

352
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,580
Gift?

353
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,860
Are you chasing Xiao?

354
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,370
I’m not being gossipy.

355
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,730
I just want to know

356
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,910
what stage

357
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,140
you're at with Xiao?

358
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,420
I can make

359
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,950
a detailed plan for you.

360
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,290
She...

361
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,850
I apologized to her.

362
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,810
She hasn't forgiven me yet.

363
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,640
Xiao

364
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,170
is able to let go of things easily.

365
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,590
If she really wants to let go,

366
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,590
this would

367
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,980
be a difficult situation.

368
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,230
Just tell me the plan.

369
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:27,750
Yun,

370
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,020
relax.

371
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,330
Take a deep breath.

372
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,370
Hello, Uncle and Aunty.

373
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,150
I'm Xia Zhi,

374
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,470
We met at the plane's hanger earlier.

375
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:43,950
I remember.

376
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:44,900
Xia,

377
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,810
thank you for what happened last time.

378
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,870
No problem, Uncle.

379
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,120
Auntie Fang,

380
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,480
Cheng Xiao has already

381
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,850
for you today.

382
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,760
They are all your favorite.

383
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:54,960
Thank you.

384
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,000
By the way, come to Qingdao when you have time.

385
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,130
Okay, I'll get back to work first then.

386
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:05,770
Mr. Zhao.

387
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,440
When you land in Qingdao,

388
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,160
Mr. Chen and the others

389
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,280
will accompany you to inspect the park

390
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,190
and then attend the charity dinner.

391
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,050
This is the schedule. Take a look.

392
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,190
Okay, got it.

393
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,160
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

394
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,850
It's a long journey.

395
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,560
If you feel tired,

396
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:29,310
you'll feel better if you take off your coat.

397
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,290
Okay.

398
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,840
Please hang it for me.

399
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,310
Okay.

400
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:45,930
The fabric is so good.

401
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,470
Your wife has good taste.

402
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:50,730
I wonder

403
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:51,980
where my wife is.

404
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,620
You're so funny.

405
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,610
Let me help you.

406
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,180
Have a rest.

407
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,010
Call me if you need anything.

408
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,400
Okay.

409
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,310
[Your admirer, Luzhou Airlines Qi Yu]

410
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,440
Qi Yu.

411
00:26:57,770 --> 00:26:59,570
Taxied out. Don’t worry.

412
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,430
Stay safe.

413
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,960
Landed in Qingdao.

414
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:03,720
Dad.

415
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:04,850
Xiao,

416
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,720
we've arrived safely.

417
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,080
I know.

418
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,290
How is mom?

419
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,350
She's fine.

420
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,010
The plane was flown steadily.

421
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,070
I didn't even realise when we landed.

422
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,590
Thank Gu for us.

423
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,350
My parents want me to thank you.

424
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,930
Xiao sent the message?

425
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,060
Let's take our return flight.

426
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:50,120
Cheng Xiao.

427
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,000
Yuheng. You just landed?

428
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,230
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

429
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,490
Not at all. Have a seat.

430
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:01,890
Are you working?

431
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,280
I'm working on the

432
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,880
safety data from last month.

433
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,260
It's too quiet at home.

434
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,720
It's almost like my ears are on noise-reduction mode.

435
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,180
I still have to work in the company after all.

436
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,120
I went to visit Aunt Qin last week.

437
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,850
Aunt Qin also talked about you.

438
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,720
Me?

439
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,940
Aunt Qin has mentioned it to Brother Nanting many times.

440
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,940
She wants to invite you to her place.

441
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,130
But Aunt Qin and I

442
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,640
only met once.

443
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,260
Cheng Xiao,

444
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,350
you should know

445
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,680
why I've decided to become a flight attendant.

446
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,080
For... Gu Nanting?

447
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,530
Brother Nanting has always

448
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:51,830
treated me as his sister.

449
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,320
When I knew he liked you,

450
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,280
I was very jealous at first.

451
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,030
But I'm curious too.

452
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,530
Curious about what he likes about you.

453
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,470
So for a while,

454
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,430
I've been observing you secretly.

455
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,010
From you,

456
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,270
I see independence and courage.

457
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,440
You're always full of fighting spirit.

458
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,570
I didn't have these qualities before.

459
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,890
So afterwards,

460
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,770
I've been secretly

461
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,720
looking towards you as my goal.

462
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,980
Don't learn from me. I...

463
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,660
I'm pretty bad.

464
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,710
No way.

465
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:29,400
Many people have seen your strengths.

466
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,040
Such as Xia Zhi, Song Song,

467
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,120
Brother Nanting and even Auntie Qin.

468
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,600
Yuheng,

469
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,080
why are you telling me this suddenly?

470
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,020
Cheng Xiao,

471
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,170
actually,

472
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,720
I wanted to tell you something long ago.

473
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,080
I've made it clear to Brother Nanting.

474
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,000
I've already let it go.

475
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,790
Are you still going to continue to fly?

476
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,420
Of course.

477
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,330
I've started to enjoy

478
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,270
flying.

479
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,810
Although it’s hard, I’m satisfied.

480
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,760
I never thought

481
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,280
I would really fall in love with this job.

482
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:25,250
Cheng Xiao,

483
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,390
let's make a pact

484
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,770
to keep flying like this.

485
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,390
Stirring ice,

486
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,460
you have to stick the ice to the glass and spin it around.

487
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,260
Open up the palm of your left hand

488
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,360
to feel the temperature of ice.

489
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,740
I’m Xie Zetian.

490
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,160
What?

491
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,090
What?

492
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,190
Really?

493
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,490
Of course.

494
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,420
They're rushing to the Air Operation Center.

495
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:07,730
What are you doing?

496
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:08,940
I'm calling Shaohui.

497
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,740
Put it back.

498
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,090
I have to tell him about this.

499
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,850
What's going on?

500
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,290
Xiao.

501
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:14,580
Xiao.

502
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,710
What's wrong?

503
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,110
I heard something when I went to the flight department just now,

504
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,080
saying that there's a Luzhou Airlines return flight,

505
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,800
which had a landing gear malfunction warning

506
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,280
as they were about to put it down for landing.

507
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,440
The plane is currently orbiting above the airport.

508
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,500
If the landing gear

509
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,770
is not locked in place,

510
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,880
when the plane lands,

511
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,270
when the plane lands.

512
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,530
That's serious.

513
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,800
Which flight? Who is the captain?

514
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:36,900
I don't know yet.

515
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,100
I think it's a flight from Qingdao.

516
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,290
The news has been blocked.

517
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:41,800
Yes.

518
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,660
Xiao. Xiao.

519
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,140
Hello, you can't go in.

520
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,390
I’m from the flight department.

521
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:15,250
You can't go in.

522
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,440
Please let me in.

523
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,840
It's urgent. I'll leave after asking.

524
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,640
I'll be quick.

525
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,720
Hello.

526
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,990
Did 8868 malfunction?

527
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,730
You are...

528
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,480
Cheng Xiao from the flight department.

529
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,320
It is 8868.

530
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,040
What's the situation now?

531
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,000
Has the malfunction been solved?

532
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:46,900
I'm not sure,

533
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,580
you'd have to ask those in the maintenance department.

534
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,000
Sorry, I have to go.

535
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,020
Hello.

536
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:01,220
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

537
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,370
Please wait a moment.

538
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,950
[Zhan]

539
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,610
Hello.

540
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,150
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

541
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,770
Please try again later.

542
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:21,080
Hello.

543
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,409
The subscriber you dialed is busy now.

544
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,730
I’m at the door.

545
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,250
Cheng Xiao.

546
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,080
Zhan.

547
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:46,000
Isn't 8868 malfunctioning right now?

548
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,130
Why is Gu Nanting...

549
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,900
There's a flight in Qingdao that was delayed.

550
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:50,960
The aircraft crew is overdue.

551
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,330
Nanting and the others were transferred

552
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,590
to fly that flight instead.

553
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:55,440
The captain on 8868 now is Sun.

554
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,650
The flight crew has changed.

555
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,370
What about the passenger crew?

556
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,830
It's still the same group.

557
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,120
I have to go.

558
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,140
I have to go in now.

559
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:10,630
Song, Song.

560
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,330
Xiao, Xia Xia...

561
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,060
I know. Calm down.

562
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,310
Where are you now?

563
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,390
Xiao.

564
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,890
It's been an hour.

565
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,290
Why hasn't it landed yet?

566
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,750
It should be soon.

567
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,870
In situations like this, they have to exhaust the oil to lighten the plane's weight

568
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,000
they won't stay in the air for too long.

569
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,720
Zhan said

570
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,610
it's a mistransmission from the landing gear.

571
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:10,870
The plane has landed safely.

572
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:11,430
Really?

573
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,330
Let's go pick up Xia Xia.

574
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:34,870
Xiao.

575
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,620
It's okay.

576
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,640
You have no idea how nervous I was at first.

577
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,810
I was so scared.

578
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
But our flight attendant said

579
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,680
you must trust that our captain

580
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,400
is completely capable

581
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,130
to deal with such emergencies.

582
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,130
So what we need to do

583
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:50,840
is not to

584
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,120
show our nervousness to the passengers.

585
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,980
After hearing that, I immediately got into the zone.

586
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,210
I was so calm throughout.

587
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,810
What a pity.

588
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,680
You didn't see

589
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,280
the Xia that's worthy of the best actress award.

590
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,540
Shouldn't I be awarded

591
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,890
an Oscar flight award?

592
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,380
OK. OK. I’ll give it to you.

593
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,010
What's with that look?

594
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,070
Nothing.

595
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,120
I'm glad you're fine.

596
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:19,360
Song,

597
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,370
Do you have anything to say? You can say it now.

598
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,500
I...

599
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,750
If it's inconvenient for me to stay here, I'll leave.

600
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:29,500
No need.

601
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,210
I just wanted to say,

602
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,620
you must be hungry.

603
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,530
Yes.

604
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,640
I'm starving.

605
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,670
We must have a big meal today.

606
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,280
I'll see where to eat.

607
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,910
You can eat whatever you want.

608
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,730
Xiao,

609
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Brother Nanting said

610
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,800
he wants to analyze the case as soon as possible

611
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,300
I'll go with you.

612
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,630
You're abandoning me just like this?

613
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,120
Sorry.

614
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,300
Wait for me.

615
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,790
I'll make you a feast.

616
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,970
Why are you acting so weird today?

617
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,280
You...

618
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,250
Song Xiao Ni.

619
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,230
Just you wait.

620
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,840
I'll call you if I need anything.

621
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,370
What are you talking about?

622
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,460
What did you say?

623
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:33,890
Let's go.

624
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:35,500
Tell me.

625
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,270
Okay, I got it.

626
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,000
Okay, bye.

627
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,870
I want to join too.

628
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,350
Okay.

629
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,690
Let's start right away.

630
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:36,440
The plane put out the spoiler

631
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,440
on both sides of the plane after the flight has landed.

632
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:49,840
Hello.

633
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,020
I'm not home.

634
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:54,900
Flowers?

635
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,100
I didn't buy flowers.

636
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,980
Please put it at the door. Thank you.

637
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:08,840
That's weird.

638
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,290
I'll check it when I get home. Let's continue.

639
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:12,920
Go on.

640
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:18,650
Where was I?

641
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,810
The camera and the two sides of the plane.

642
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,130
Yes.

643
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,210
So...

644
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,810
the camera and the frame are completely connected.

645
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,320
Thank you for sending me home.

646
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:28,630
Well,

647
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,580
go to bed early.

648
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,070
You too.
