Mr. Gu from the Flight Department sent it here.

Mr. Gu said

00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,000
he saw Brother Fan wearing a pair of old shoes.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,020
He guessed his injury

31

Brother Zhan,

36

I tried it just now.

37
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,340
It's much more comfortable than what our company distributed.

38
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,240
Actually, people like to wear old shoes

39
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,970
because the shoes from the company are too stiff.

40
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,000
Since they are comfortable,

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,930
just put them on.

What are you going to do with the chicken?

121

A roasted chicken.

122

Not bad.

123

You are not only good at repairing the plane,

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,430
but also can handle the chicken bones and pizza dough.

125

Did you call 120?

157
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,540
I wanted to call, but Xiao didn't let me.

158
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,940
I think it's very severe.

159
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,490
Send me the address.

160
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,380
Brother Zhan.

161
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,180
You have a hidden skill.

162
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,090
You are indeed a top engineer.

163
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,370
You flatter me.

164
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,250
I didn't drive today and

165

Why are you spacing out?

Let me.

175
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,550
Someone is coming, Xiao.

176
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,240
Who is it?

177
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,160
Are your hands okay?

178
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,170
Your hands...

179
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,590
It's fine.

180
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,980
What a coincidence.

181
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,200
Why is Brother Nanting here?

182
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
Let's go in and eat together.

183
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:04,800
What are you doing here?

184
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,970
I...

185
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,430
I came to give you this.

186
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,980
I found it on the sofa.

187
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,230
Thank you.

188
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,000
Cheng Xiao is having a housewarming party today.

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,260
Come in and have a seat.

190
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,350
Cheng Xiao, is that okay?

191
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,220
Come in.

192
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,110
I'll add another bowl and another set of chopsticks.

193
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,890
Brother Nanting, sit here.

194
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,370
Here.

195
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:28,920
Thank you.

196
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,930
You aren't flying tomorrow, right?

197
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:36,810
No, but I don't drink.

198
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,650
You have to drink a little

199
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
on this occasion.

200
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,180
Come on.

201
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,710
I want to thank my best friends

202
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:54,050
and Brother Zhan,

203
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:55,990
and Mr. Gu

204
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,360
for coming to support me.

205
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,920
To purchase this house,

206
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,410
I spent almost all my savings.

207
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:06,450
If my dad hadn't sponsored me,

208
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,400
I couldn't even afford the renovation.

209
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:08,930
Luckily,

210
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,450
now I finally have

211
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,560
my own home.

212
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,110
I don't have to worry

213
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,410
about that I can't pay the rent

214
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,560
and get kicked out by the landlord.

215
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,390
I can dig a hole in the wall as I wish.

216
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,840
I can do whatever I want.

217
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,880
The most important thing is my household registration

218
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,640
can finally be transferred back from the company.

219
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,480
The bitterness has come to an end.

220
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:25,940
Cheers!

221
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,290
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

222
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,700
Cheng Xiao,

223
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,800
I wish you all the best and success,

224
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,000
peace and joy be with you in your new home.

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,330
Here.

226
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Thank you.

227
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,310
Come on, try Brother Zhan's cooking.

228
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,520
He made this pizza himself.

229
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,440
Let me cut it.

230
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,150
Here, Nanting.

231
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,730
I didn't know you had this skill.

232
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,590
By the way,

233
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,630
this is my housewarming gift for you.

234
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

235
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,640
[Cheng Xiao]

236
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,710
This is different from

237
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,170
those you can buy outside.

238
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,550
Every part is made of

239
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,420
the skin of retired Boeing Aircraft.

240
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,150
I reforged it, then assembled it and coloured it.

241
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,060
Let me see.

242
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,710
CX0920.

243
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,360
Is it your birthday?

244
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
Brother Fan told me about it before.

245
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,160
Brother Zhan

246
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,720
made a model car

247
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,070
on his kid's birthday.

248
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,880
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

249
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,940
I like it very much.

250
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm glad you like it.

251
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,380
Here, a toast to you.

252
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,970
Let's have a toast.

253
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,320
Together.

254
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:41,900
Come on. Cheers.

255
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,500
To our awesome Brother Zhan.

256
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,360
Bluff you off.

257
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,040
You drink.

258
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:07,780
I'll drink it.

259
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:08,840
Cheers.

260
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,000
I can't.

261
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,910
I'll lie down for a while.

262
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,540
You're a noob.

263
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:25,760
Cheers.

264
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:26,920
OK.

265
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,190
You still drink when you're already at this point.

266
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,320
That's how they are.

267
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,880
They don't obey each other.

268
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,370
I brought you some snacks.

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,600
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

270
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:45,990
Oh my god.

271
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,330
Where did you hurt?

272
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,340
My knees.

273
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,710
I remember there's an ice pack in the fridge.

274
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:55,310
I'll get it.

275
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:55,910
Thank you.

276
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,220
Here.

277
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,280
I can do it myself. Thank you.

278
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,890
It's late. I'm leaving.

279
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,010
Brother Zhan.

280
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,400
You should go back too.

281
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,280
I'll clean up here tomorrow.

282
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,320
You two, go home.

283
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,800
I'll deal with them later.

284
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:37,970
Let me see you off.

285
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:38,600
No, no, no.

286
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,430
Apply it for a while.

287
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,030
Tell me if you need anything.

288
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,470
Okay, be careful on the way.

289
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:46,730
Let's go.

290
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,130
Good for you.

291
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,980
I think you

292
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,830
sent me a blanket on purpose.

293
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,160
But there's only one here.

294
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:48,990
That's it.

295
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,160
They look good together.

296
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,220
Why are you here today?

297
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,460
Song...

298
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,680
I asked you twice

299
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,100
at Mount Lan.

300
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,340
What did you say?

301
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,880
Cheng Xiao is my student.

302
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,520
I care about her

303
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,580
is the same as you care about Wang Fan.

304
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,600
Nothing else.

305
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,140
No way.

306
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,200
Why is it so itchy?

307
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,880
Let me take a look.

308
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,720
Your face!

309
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
What about my face?

310
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,280
Your face.

311
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,000
It's like a bee's nest.

312
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,480
Look.

313
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,830
See for yourself.

314
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,640
Are you allergic to alcohol?

315
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:11,100
I know.

316
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,090
It's the milk tea from afternoon.

317
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:13,680
Milk tea?

318
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,770
I'm allergic to milk products.

319
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,080
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

320
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,650
I even ordered double milk foam.

321
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:22,120
You looked so happy too.

322
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,120
It's not easy for you to be so nice.

323
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,180
I can't refuse you.

324
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,240
Who forced you?

325
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,660
You're the cause of your own trouble.

326
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,970
Or rather, I'm the one sacrificing my life for you.

327
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:30,880
Fine.

328
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,920
I'll be responsible for you.

329
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,380
Okay?

330
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,300
Hold on.

331
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,470
I'll go buy medicine for you.

332
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,770
I'll go by myself.

333
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,320
It's fine.

334
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,130
Who do you want to scare by going out with that face?

335
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:40,790
Your phone.

336
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:09,850
I'm back.

337
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,350
I got them all.

338
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,920
Why are you sweating so much?

339
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,570
Did you run to buy it?

340
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,520
Of course.

341
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,460
It's late at night.

342
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,920
It's better to run than to take a taxi.

343
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,310
Here.

344
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,600
Xia Zhi,

345
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,930
thank you.

346
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,950
It's fine, take the medicine.

347
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:40,800
Look at your face.

348
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,800
My trypophobia is going to act up looking at your face.

349

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,840
In the past two years,

521
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,920
we've been innovating maintenance concept.

522
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,520
Recently,

523
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,740
we have plans to use AI

524
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,860
to replace various low-level tasks

525
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,120
to monitor the plane from various aspects

526
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,390
to improve the efficiency of the department

527
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,550
and lower the breakdown rate.

528
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,350
That's right.

529
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,700
The efficiency of maintenance

530
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:26,290
also helps avoid delays.

531
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,680
Avoiding delays is not only about the safety of civil aviation,

532
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,600
but also

533
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,690
the stability of the social economy.

534
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:33,870
Mr. Feng.

535
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,680
Mr. Sun.

536
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,320
Luzhou Airlines has been established for 16 years.

537
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,800
We've never been

538
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,360
a conservative company.

539
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,080
I believe in the future,

540
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,620
through actual innovation,

541
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,750
we can let the social interests and economic interests

542
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,860
thrive together.

543
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,930
I'm just here to listen in.

544
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:52,720
It's mainly Mr. Sun.

545
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,250
This is his first time here.

546
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:57,110
Thank you for your recommendation

547
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,750
for letting me join.

548
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:00,480
Over the past two years,

549
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,390
I've been following Luzhou Airlines.

550
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,990
Last year,

551
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,690
the net profit rate of Luzhou Airlines

552
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:06,130
has increased by 7%.

553
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,060
It gives our investors

554
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,900
a huge boost in confidence.

555
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:13,400
I hope we can work well together in the future.

556
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,310
After you start,

557
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,400
this will be your starting point.

558
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,580
Look.

559
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:33,570
A female pilot.

560
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,390
Amazing.

561
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,390
We can be just like her too right?

562
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:43,660
She is one of

563
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,110
the most brilliant pilots in Luzhou Airlines.

564
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,160
So handsome.

565
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,220
So handsome.

566
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,580
Instructor Gu.

567
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,470
Instructor Gu.

568
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:22,810
Let's go.

569
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,850
I'll take you to the hangar.

570
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,640
Mr. Sun.

571
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:32,980
How do you feel?

572
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,820
I've learned a lot.

573
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,060
Mr. Feng and Mr. Sun seldom come here.

574
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,920
The company has arranged dinner.

575
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,240
I have a strategy meeting with Mr. Feng.

576
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,550
Serve Mr. Sun well.

577
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,920
Dear leaders,

578
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,920
I have an urgent training task tonight.

579
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,240
Please excuse me.

580
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,200
It's okay. Work is more important.

581
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,840
Mr. Ni, why do you keep checking the watch?

582
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,360
Can't you go tonight?

583
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,450
No.

584
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,170
It's rare to see Mr. Feng and Mr. Sun.

585
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:59,030
Of course we should get together.

586
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,600
Sorry.

587
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,480
I have an urgent mission.

588
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:10,190
Do you have time tomorrow?

589
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,510
We've done dozens of research,

590
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,680
hoping to fill

591
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,380
the technical gap of the maintenance industry.

592
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,870
Young people are indeed passionate

593
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:26,930
and enthusiastic.

594
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,350
If you don't challenge yourself,

595
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,950
how do you know where the most beautiful scenery is?

596
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,350
With a young man like you,

597
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,560
I'm looking forward to the future of Luzhou Airlines.

598
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,160
Mr. Jiang,

599
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,800
to recruit female pilots is indeed a pioneering plan.

600
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,010
I was just looking

601
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,440
at the photos of our female pilot published on our official site.

602
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,940
A model female pilot

603
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,850
left me a lasting impression.

604
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,000
You're talking about Cheng Xiao, right?

605
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,340
Yes, Cheng Xiao.

606
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,590
Not only is she good at flying,

607
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,050
but she's also beautiful.

608
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,940
I didn't expect

609
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,190
that Luzhou Airlines has such a talent.

610
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:58,410
I must meet her when there is a chance.

611
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,640
Mr. Sun wants to see her.

612
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,090
Isn't that easy?

613
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Let me make a call.

614
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:05,480
Look.

615
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,690
Mr. Jiang is very efficient.

616
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,540
Mr. Jiang.

617
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,390
Cheng Xiao is busy with her flight.

618
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,990
No matter how busy she is,

619
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,850
she has to report to her superior.

620
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,900
Thank you for your hard work.

621
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:20,610
Okay/

622
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:46,100
[Director Jiang Tao]

623
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,480
Mr. Jiang.

624
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,620
Cheng Xiao, are you not flying today?

625
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,420
I just landed.

626
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:56,140
Great.

627
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,470
Today,

628
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:01,380
several directors of the group are here for an observation.

629
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,970
We are currently having a meal together after all that.

630
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:04,030
Come here quickly.

631
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:05,510
I...

632
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:09,000
You are the representative of our company's female pilots.

633
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,960
Mr. Sun wants to see you.

634
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,600
Nanting is not here either.

635
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,760
Just come and report to the directors

636
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,080
about the situation with female pilots currently.

637
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,380
Don't mess this up.

638
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:19,800
Hurry up.

639
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,900
Okay, send me the address.

640
00:41:27,530 --> 00:41:27,960
Bye.

641
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,210
My skin is breaking again.

642
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:36,640
I've been working night shifts for several nights straight.

643
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,970
No amount of face masks can repair my face.

644
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,080
Yuheng.

645
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,060
The kid on the flight today is so annoying.

646
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,760
Thanks for helping me out.

647
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,410
Thanks.

648
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,220
Qi Yu,

649
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,590
the kid is also our guest.

650
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:52,960
Alright.

651
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,880
No need to say things

652
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,230
like this here.

653
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,480
The company says things like this

654
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,880
to use us to our last drop.

655
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,590
You can't say that.

656
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,860
What we are doing

657
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,300
is for ourselves.

658
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:11,950
Don't be naive.

659
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,060
A flight attendant is a short-lived career.

660
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,240
After flying for more than 20 years,

661
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,040
your body will be full of problems.

662
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,240
So before

663
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,540
we start looking old,

664
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:23,770
we need to find a good husband.

665
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,250
The Mr. Gu you chose is good.

666
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,610
How is it going?

667
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,360
Did Cheng Xiao snatch him from you?

668
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,880
Tell me about it.

669
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,410
Let me give you some advice.

670
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,440
Tell me about it.

671
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,070
Let me give you some advice.

672
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:43,090
Why can't you tell me?

673
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,040
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

674
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,230
Hello, Mr. Jiang.

675
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,820
Why are you here?

676
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:49,660
We just flew back.

677
00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:51,100
We're having dinner here.

678
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,830
Just you two?

679
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,870
-No.
-There's a friend who can't come.

680
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:54,420
Just the two of us.
