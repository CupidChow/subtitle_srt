4
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,200
This is your first time sitting on the left seat, right?

5
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,400
Here's a gift for you.

6
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,680
It's too kind of you.

7
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:42,900
Open it.

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,620
A fountain pen?

9
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,170
I gave this pen

10
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,490
to Nanting before too.

11
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:09,520
This is specifically for the captain.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,270
When the plane takes off and lands,

13
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,230
the air pressure will change dramatically.

14
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,950
Pressure will push the ink out.

15
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,680
Nanting's hands used to be always stained by ink.

16
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,160
I got the aircraft material company

17
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,620
to customize this pen nib.

18
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,100
Aur bubbles can't enter the ink cartridge,

19
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,790
and the ink won't come out.

20
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,390
Unfortunately, the craftsmanship is complicated

21
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,850
so it can be mass-produced.

22
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:26,780
That's amazing!

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,880
I will accept it then. Thank you, Brother Zhan.

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,350
It's just something small. I'm glad you like it.

25
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,200
Go get ready.

26
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:34,850
I'll go get ready.

27
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,180
Okay.

28
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:35,800
Thank you.

29
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,090
Hello, Mr. Ni.

30
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,100
Qi Yu,

31
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,070
I heard you got promoted to chief flight attendant.

32
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,620
No, I'm just a trainee.

33
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,100
I have to do well.

34
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,420
Yuheng.

35
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,840
You're flying this flight too?

36
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,660
Don't mention it.

37
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,290
I finally switched shifts with someone else.

38
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,380
I found out this morning

39
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,760
that this is Xiao's first flight she's the captain.

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
I can't miss something

41
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,510
this important.

42
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,690
Captain,

43
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,150
the plane is in good condition, there are no faults.

44
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,079
Okay, sign this.

45
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,820
Okay.

46
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,400
Use this.

47
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,040
Thank you.

48
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,970
You're welcome.

49
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,130
Thank you.

50
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,130
Thank you too.

51
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,209
Have a safe trip.

52
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,210
Hello.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:29,860
Welcome aboard.

54
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,659
Go straight and turn right, it's the next passage.

55
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,130
Chief flight attendant,

56
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,190
I'm counting on you to guide me today.

57
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,010
No problem.

58
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,270
Most of the guests are on board,

59
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,610
go ahead with your tasks.

60
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:45,990
Okay.

61
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,570
Sir, let me help you.

62
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:57,760
Thank you.

63
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,360
I'm sorry.

64
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,320
I went the wrong way.

65
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,310
Hello.

66
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,040
Help me carry my luggage.

67
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,260
Excuse me, Madam.

68
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,380
I'm doing something else at the moment,

69
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,580
please wait a moment.

70
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:22,870
I just saw you

71
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,040
helping that man in the first class with his luggage.

72
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
You won't even help me with this.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,450
What kind of service attitude is that?

74
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:29,390
Please wait a moment.

75
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,920
I'll help you when I'm done.

76
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,330
You're treating your guests differently.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,060
Madam, be careful.

78
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:47,659
Are you okay?

79
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,740
Are you okay?

80
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:49,880
I'm fine.

81
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,840
How's your hand?

82
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm fine.

83
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,450
Madam, please take a seat.

84
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,220
Okay.

85
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,400
Thank you.

86
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,280
Are you okay?

87
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,890
I'm fine.

88
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,610
Go back to work.

89
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,350
I can deal with this.

90
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
I'll tell the chief flight attendant.

91
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,290
I'll help you with your job.

92
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:15,980
No, don't.

93
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,910
Today is Xiao's first day flying as a captain,

94
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,970
I don't want to cause her any trouble.

95
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,200
I can do it. You go first.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,480
Go.

97
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,790
Bye. Bye.

98
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,770
Goodbye.

99
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,220
Thank you. Bye.

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,700
Goodbye. Watch your step.

101
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,030
Watch your step.

102
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,240
Thank you. Goodbye.

103
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,100
Bye. Thank you.

104
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,670
Goodbye.

105
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,400
Check the food and

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,200
catering for the return flight,

107
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,930
and report to me after that.

108
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,190
Chief flight attendant,

109
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,090
how is the cabin?

110
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:27,240
Is everything going well?

111
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,680
Yes.

112
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,810
Nothing went wrong.

113
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,100
Xia Xia, let me take you to the hospital.

114
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,680
What's wrong?

115
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,990
I accidentally...

116
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,800
Well...

117
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,409
How did you get hurt?

118
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:55,930
My hand slipped.

119
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,370
I got stuck while pulling the trolley.

120
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,740
We have three hours till our flight back.

121
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,970
Go to the emergency center at the airport

122
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,940
to get it checked up.

123
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,070
I'll go with Xia Xia.

124
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,200
But Captain,

125
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:09,240
there is another reason

126
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,610
why Xia Xia got injured.

127
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:15,420
I'll report to you

128
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,440
when I return from the hospital.

129
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,920
Let's go.

130
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,950
This is what happened.

131
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,059
Why didn't you report back then?

132
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,590
It's nothing.

133
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,080
I asked Yuheng not to report.

134
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,830
If it weren't for Xia Zhi's timely help,

135
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,630
the one going to the hospital this time

136
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,960
might be the passenger.

137
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,260
Well,

138
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,420
the doctor said

139
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,970
this is just a minor fracture

140
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,480
and it will recover in two weeks.

141
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,940
It won't affect anything.

142
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,910
Trainee chief flight attendant,

143
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,570
please tell me what happened.

144
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:00,950
I...

145
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,300
I was serving other passengers.

146
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,390
She insisted on lifting the luggage,

147
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,660
it's not my fault.

148
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,450
She was just

149
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,600
arranging the overhead luggage racks.

150
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,190
D-don't talk nonsense.

151
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,080
I'm just reporting the truth.

152
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,710
I kept the contact information

153
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:16,700
of the passengers who have witnessed it.

154
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,830
We can reconfirm it.

155
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,630
According to the flight attendant handbook,

156
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,810
we can help the passengers with their luggage.

157
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,720
This refers to those who have difficulties

158
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
and can't do it themselves.

159
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,320
It's not like this passenger's old, weak, or disabled.

160
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,770
She was obviously picking a fight.

161
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,550
This kind of tourist is just being a baby.

162
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,100
The more we spoil them, the more arrogant they are.

163
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,240
The passengers have their own difficulties too.

164
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,870
Just because

165
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,190
you've met a few unreasonable passengers,

166
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:42,200
doesn't mean you can hold a grudge against all the passengers.

167
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,760
The most important job of a chief flight attendant

168
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,660
is to make preparations for other aspects

169
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,520
and ensure the safety of a flight.

170
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,440
Regardless of what the passenger requested,

171
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,040
is this called ensuring the safety of a flight?

172
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,870
To make up for your work,

173
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,990
you got your colleague injured,

174
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,340
and are not sorry about it at all.

a scandal regarding a pilot

346
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,450
in our Flight Department.

347
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,680
It's unfortunate that

348
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,080
something like this

349
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,010
is happening in our Flight Department.

350
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,850
On behalf of the Flight Department,

351
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,250
I would like to apologize

352
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,310
to all my colleagues.

353
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:05,560
We will investigate

354
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,660
the truth of this case.

355
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,410
If this situation is true,

356
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,350
we will definitely

357
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,970
reprimand this pilot.

358
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,580
At the same time,

359
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,090
we also reserve the right to punish them.

360
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,660
Lastly,

361
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:21,330
I hope you can learn from this

362
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,260
and take the right path

363
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,420
and be

364
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,980
an upright person.

365
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,460
Thank you.

366
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,450
Alright.

367
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,060
Thank you for your speech.

368
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,680
If you have no questions,

369
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,960
that's all for today's meeting.

370
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,100
Dismissed.

371
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:41,920
Wait.

372
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,750
Dear leaders,

373
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,410
colleagues,

374
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,600
please allow me to take a few minutes of your time.

375
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,930
I have something to say.

376
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,600
I'm the pilot

377
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,620
Mr. Jiang mentioned just now.

378
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,040
My name is Cheng Xiao.

379
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,490
I know

380
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,130
some people in the company hate me.

381
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,230
It's no problem. This is your right.

382
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
But if you hate me,

383
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,420
please stand up to me and scold me.

384
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,410
Don't play tricks behind my back.

385
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,610
Defamation.

386
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,990
Humiliation.

387
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,540
Fabricating facts, spreading rumors,

388
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,760
These are violations of the law.

389
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,310
If you know your place,

390
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,390
delete the post.

391
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,270
If you do this again,

392
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,400
I'll make you take legal responsibility.

393
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,370
Those who said I got to where I am today thanks to unspoken rules,

394
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:01,100
this is my resume, with my university qualifications,

395
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,270
my experiences in the Freight Department,

396
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,860
as well as the Passenger Transport Department.

397
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,230
My scores are excellent

398
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,780
in every assessment.

399
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,760
If you ask how I got to where I am,

400
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:10,690
listen,

401
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:12,970
I did it with my own hard work.

402
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,010
It's said that I live at Mr. Gu's house.

403
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,050
Ridiculous.

404
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:21,730
Since you took pictures of Mr. Gu and I

405
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:23,590
entering the same neighborhood,

406
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,020
Then why didn't you get a photo

407
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,820
of us entering different units?

408
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,760
Just letting everyone know,

409
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,040
I've been renting this place since four years ago.

410
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,330
This is my rental contract

411
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,930
and all my transfer records.

412
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,890
I was still working in the Freight Department four years ago.

413
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:39,350
I didn't know Mr. Gu at all.

414
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,000
It was only three months ago

415
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,490
when I coincidentally found out that

416
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,660
my landlord is Mr. Gu's mother.

417
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:57,580
As for

418
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,490
my relationship with Mr. Gu,

419
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,900
I admit

420
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:06,770
I do like him.

421
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,930
She really likes Mr. Gu.

422
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,870
But the scandals mentioned in the post

423
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:15,470
is completely a mare's nest.

424
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,260
Because

425
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,900
he never accepted my confession.

426
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,240
From now on,

427
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,950
I'll stop renting Mr. Gu's place.

428
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,010
Everything is on the table.

429
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,940
Have a look if you don't believe me.

430
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,660
I hope all the rumors

431
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,380
can stop today.

432
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,620
Ni Zhan.

433
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,080
Cheng Xiao and I...

434
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,370
It's her business that she likes you.

435
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:08,480
I like her

436
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,650
is my business.

437
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,350
Xiao, you were so cool just now.

438
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,720
The entire Ground Handling Department got your back.

439
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,650
Thank you, Qiao!

440
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,680
Where did he go?

441
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:00,330
Xiao.

442
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:00,960
Xiao Xiao!

443
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,850
You walk too fast.

444
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,930
Xiao,

445
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,280
are you really going to move out because of those rumors?

446
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,220
I don't want those rumors to affect

447
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:13,120
Mr. Gu and Brother Zhan.

448
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,560
So,

449
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,490
you're going to move into that house you bought?

450
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,180
The house hasn't been renovated yet.

451
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,270
There's water and electricity, I can stay in it as long as there's a bed.

452
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,520
If you move you'll be far away from Brother Nanting.

453
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,250
Are you really going to give up?

454
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,080
Brother Zhan,

455
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,220
I'm sorry for causing you all this trouble.

456
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,820
It's okay.

457
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,710
Didn't you explain everything?

458
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,710
Do you need me to find a place for you?

459
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,080
No.

460
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,400
I bought a small apartment last year.

461
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,390
You should have quite a bit of stuff right?

462
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,440
Do you need my help?

463
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,940
Yes, we can help you.

464
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,440
Thank you.

465
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,880
There's no need.

466
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,110
I can find a moving company.

467
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,570
Bye. I'll make a move first.

468
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,100
Cheng Xiao

469
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,270
really surprised me.

470
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,670
She's so daring and bold.

471
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:29,450
Brother-in-law, are you still investigating?

472
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:31,260
Investigate what?

473
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:33,010
She has already clarified it herself.

474
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,140
Still investigate.

475
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:35,230
So,

476
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,830
you believe Cheng Xiao too?

477
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,830
This matter

478
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,400
is very complicated.

479
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,250
We have three candidates for the vice president of our company.

480
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,570
This scandal

481
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,440
got two of them involved.

482
00:28:52,990 --> 00:28:55,720
What do you think the people outside would think?

483
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,610
That you're the one who made up this rumor?

484
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,410
Why would you do something like this?

485
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,400
Even if they don't think so,

486
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,360
tell me,

487
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,780
once this is exposed,

488
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,460
as the manager of the Flight Department,

489
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,390
what should I do?

490
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,220
Do I investigate it or not?

491
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:11,730
If I do,

492
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,250
it looks like I'm doing it as part of a malicious competition and an act of revenge.

493
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,250
If I don't investigate,

494
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,650
I've done nothing again.

495
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,660
So this situation got you in a tight spot.

496
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:24,430
So,

497
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,790
with Cheng Xiao clarifying,

498
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,600
she actually helped me out.

499
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:30,830
Brother-in-law,

500
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,490
I'm curious about something.

501
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,060
It's the encouragement plan

502
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,480
that Mr. Xu has created.

503
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,760
Why did you send Cheng Xiao to the first batch?

504
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,090
Didn't you think she's–

505
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:42,080
She is still quite competent.

506
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,110
Besides,

507
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,480
besides Gu Nanting,

508
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,360
even President Xu likes her so much.

509
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,580
Why don't I help her?

510
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,260
Cheng Xiao

511
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,010
is not a person who can be easily tortured.

512
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,990
She's better than others,

513
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,260
and is unique.

514
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:02,680
Let's see,

515
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,640
if she can hold her left seat.

516
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,720
Let's wait and see.

517
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,590
Mr. Sun.

518
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,070
Ms. Cheng?

519
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,130
Why are you here?

520
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:42,830
Mr. Zhang.

521
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,640
Thank you.

522
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,280
That test is fine.

523
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:46,880
Alright.

524
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:48,440
This is...

525
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,560
I'm here to check formaldehyde.

526
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,460
Good timing. Have a look. Are you satisfied?

527
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,710
But I remember I told you

528
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,290
I have to suspend the work.

529
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:58,990
This is...

530
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
Here's the thing.

531
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,360
I planned to

532
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,720
to report this to you next week.

533
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,510
I didn't expect it to be exposed in advance.

534
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,680
Didn't anyone

535
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,470
tell you about this?

536
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,510
Tell me?

537
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,040
What's going on?

538
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:17,910
I see.

539
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:20,270
Looks like your father

540
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,890
didn't tell you anything.

541
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,020
My dad?

542
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,140
Uncle contacted me

543
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,420
and paid

544
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,490
to restart the renovation.

545
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,470
I guess

546
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,510
he's trying to give you a surprise.

547
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,600
Xiao Xiao,

548
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,960
I want to apologize to you today in your mother's stead.

549
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,370
She shouldn't have gone through your stuff.

550
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:04,580
Sorry, dad.

551
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,570
I didn't tell you I bought a house.

552
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:09,470
It's okay.

553
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,880
When the renovation is complete,

554
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,210
I will come to visit you.

555
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,130
I'll come alone, okay?

556
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:45,910
Xiao Xiao,

557
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
how have you been?

558
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,580
Are you coming back for New Year?

559
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,280
It's no rush.

560
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,400
It's still early to celebrate New Year anyway.

561
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,000
It depends on your work schedule.

562
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,280
If you can't come back,

563
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I'll go visit you.

564
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,110
Dad.

565
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:15,710
Thank you.

566
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,199
Xiao Xiao,

567
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,820
What's wrong?

568
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,699
What happened?

569
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,130
I know everything.

570
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,920
I went to the house.

571
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,670
Is that why?

572
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:36,080
How is it? Are you satisfied with the renovation?

573
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,860
I told the designer

574
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,880
to follow the blueprint.

575
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,489
No other way around it.

576
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,570
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

577
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:49,110
Aren't you busy?

578
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,840
I planned to tell you later.

579
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:02,840
I love you.

580
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:12,490
You're an adult.

581
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,110
Why are you suddenly saying this?

582
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,050
It's so cheesy.

583
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:50,300
Done.

584
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:51,710
Thank you.

585
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,610
What time is your flight?

586
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,830
In two hours.

587
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
You can't stall for any longer then.

588
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,700
Go ahead.

589
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,420
What?

590
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,080
You still can't say it?

591
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,580
When did this happen?

592
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,250
After coming back from Mount Lan,

593
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,660
Cheng Xiao came to talk to me.

594
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,510
And you rejected her.

595
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,200
Why?

596
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,440
I...

597
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:02,830
I'm undecided.

598
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,780
You...

599
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,280
Your brain cells update too slowly

600
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,430
and is not forgetful enough.

601
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Cheng Xiao is a good girl.

602
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:17,920
You'll regret it.

603
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:21,530
Also,

604
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,680
if you don't want to be with her,

605
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,140
then make a clean cut.

606
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:27,760
Don't delay her.

607
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:32,560
Are you done?

608
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,100
Go for your flight.

609
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,420
The flight was delayed until

610
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,500
the night shift became the morning shift.

611
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,350
I'm so sleepy.

612
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,240
Clean up the cockpit by yourself today.

613
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:51,980
I have to go.

614
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
Brother Nanting.

615
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,000
I heard

616
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,740
Xiao is moving today.

617
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,420
Are you gonna miss her?

618
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,190
I'm the landlord.

619
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,080
I need to hand it over to the tenant according to the procedures.

620
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,570
Isn't the handover supposed to be done at night?

621
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,590
I came to see the house.

622
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,670
Come in. I'm packing up.

623
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,070
Then you can count the items

624
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,520
such as electronics, floors, and so on.

625
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,920
The curtains.

626
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,640
I'll take it down later.

627
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,840
And some small appliances.

628
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,840
I'll ask the waste collectors to get rid of all of them.

629
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,590
No need. Just leave it here.

630
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,290
When the tenant leaves,

631
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,670
he or she should restore the house back to what it was.

632
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,600
That's the rule.

633
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:07,020
You'll damage the walls and the floor if you do it yourself.

634
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,080
I'll ask the housekeeper to clean up.

635
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,120
Besides,

636
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,860
the new tenant will move in next week.

637
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,850
I don't want any mistakes.

638
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,260
OK.

639
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,550
I was the one who canceled the rent in advance.

640
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,400
No need to return the deposit to me.

641
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,260
Consider it a breach of contract.

642
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,850
Give me your account.

643
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,540
You haven't been promoted to captain yet.

644
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,870
Your income is limited.

645
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,230
No, thanks.

646
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,140
Here you are.

647
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:53,880
Brother Zhan.

648
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,590
I ordered a one-stop moving service for you.

649
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,050
Come in first.

650
00:41:58,830 --> 00:41:59,630
Here. Come in.

651
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:02,410
Nanting, you're here too.

652
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,380
I'm here to take over.

653
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,140
One-stop service? Is there such a moving company?

654
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,500
Yes, one-stop.

655
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,260
You don't need to do anything. Just sit down.

656
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,770
They will complete all the work for you.

657
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:13,900
It's so convenient.

658
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,720
I'm very experienced in moving.

659
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,970
When I rented houses a few years ago,

660
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,010
I was always kicked out by the landlord.

661
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,890
Now I have become a nomadic person with my moving experience.

662
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:21,860
Fine.

663
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,780
But I have to pay for it myself.

664
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,330
I won't compete it from you.

665
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,760
But their boss is from my hometown.

666
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,840
He can give you a discount.

667
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:28,570
Great.

668
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,750
Well, thank you so much.

669
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,330
Come in.

670
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,890
Start from the living room.

671
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,260
Okay.

672
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,800
I still have some books to pack.

673
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:40,710
Well,

674
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:42,860
I've checked the house. It's fine.

675
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,090
I'm leaving.

676
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,040
Bye.

677
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,660
Well,

678
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:49,500
where should I keep the key?

679
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:51,620
No need.

680
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,920
I'll change the lock.
