I'll clean the cockpit.

can I take leave tonight?

37
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,720
Every regular meeting

38
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,230
is a key part of the process

39
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,040
for pilots to improve their safety awareness.

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
We must prepare for it conscientiously,

41
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,640

[Yue]

45
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,860
Two weeks ago,

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,200
there was a case of animal intrusion onto the runway

47
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,829
at another airline.

48
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,410
The details are as follows.

49
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,280
Next, we'll analyze the case.

50
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,860
A golden retriever that escaped

51
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,990
from the luggage section

52
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,520
ran onto the runway where a plane was landing.

53
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,420
The determined height was at 200 feet.

54
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,940
The go-around height was 100 feet.

55
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,800
If the plane landed on the runway,

56
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,520
the pilots

57
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:46,050
would only have two to three seconds to react.

58
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,610
What risks would be incurred

59
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,120
had the problem been realized only after landing?

60
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,840
The captain swerved subconsciously,

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,370
causing the plane to deviate from the runway.

62
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,390
If it had crashed,

63
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,790
the plane

64
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,770
would have deviated from the runway as well.

65
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,640
Although dogs are light,

66
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,760
and are not enough to lead to deviation,

67
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,620
due to the limited response time,

68
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,490
it affected the captain’s subconscious action.

69
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,020
This cannot be overlooked.

70
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,830
What's wrong with you today?

71
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:26,370

We have to fly tonight.

74
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Tell me the truth.

75
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,600
What's wrong?

76
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:45,280
My girlfriend broke up with me.

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,970
It was her birthday yesterday.

78
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,610
For three consecutive years,

79
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,750
I haven't managed to celebrate her birthday with her.

80
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,190
Didn't you

81
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,180
land at 6 o'clock yesterday?

82
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,600
Why didn't you meet her?

83
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,060
Brother Nanting made me do the case studies

84
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,990
until midnight.

85
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:04,870
When I got home,

86
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,470
she didn't even let me in the door.

87
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,950
Gu Nanting has gone too far.

88
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,250
It's not his fault.

89
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,510
It's me.

90
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,340
It's all my fault.

91
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:17,900
No.

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,690
You can't fly today.

93
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,150
You're in a bad condition.

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:21,750
I'm fine.

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,680
Go and sign in.

96
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,390
No.

97
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,060
You can't fly.

99
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:36,820

00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,090
Come—

101
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,909
Because of you,

102
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,110
Song's girlfriend dumped him. Did you know that?

103
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,920
Because of me?

104
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,430
Yesterday was his girlfriend's birthday,

105
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,720
but you made him work overtime until midnight.

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,490
He and his girlfriend always quarreled

107
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,520
because they don't get to see each other much.

108
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,840
It was an important day yesterday,

109
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,240
but you didn't let him go.

110
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,480
I didn't know.

111
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,760
I just wanted to finish the safety training as soon as possible.

112
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,390
I know

113
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,070
you've devoted a lot

114
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
to flight safety.

115
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,540
But do you know how many people are

116
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,800
complaining about you behind your back?

117
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:21,960
OK.

118
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,190
You can be

119
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,720
a working machine without feelings.

120
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,960
But you can't expect everyone

121
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,760
to be like you.

122
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,970
Song is in a bad mood today.

123
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,290
For safety reasons,

124
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,290
I suggest someone else fly instead.

125
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:44,820
OK.

126
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,250
I'll take his shift.

127
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:55,720
Let's go.

128
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,220
That's all

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,360
for the development of an information-based system

130
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,010
for the Maintenance department.

131
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:12,550
I'll further refine

132
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,710
the materials

133
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,590
in conjunction with the Information department.

134
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,800
Ever since Mr. Fang resigned,

135
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,100
the Maintenance department has achieved impressive results

136
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,690
under your leadership.

137
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,190
Keep it up.

138
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,760
Mr. Jiang,

139
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,760
how's it going with your Flight department?

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,790
The Flight department is operating smoothly.

141
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,940
There have been no major incidents

142
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,270
with respect to safety.

143
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,260
And we have fulfilled

144
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,610
the flight mission KPI set by the company.

145
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
I heard that

146
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,320
Gu Nanting discusses flight case studies

147
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,000
to improve safety awareness

148
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:47,980
during the Flight department's monthly meetings, right?

149
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,330
Yes.

150
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,260
He's doing well in this respect.

151
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,200
The internal investigation results

152
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,800
into the video are out.

153
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,860
There's nothing wrong with Nanting's actions.

154
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,090
I'm thinking about

155
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,280
reinstating him.

156
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,460
I think...

157
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,400
Personally,

158
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:14,540
I think he is

159
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,360
too young.

160
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,580
Apparently...

161
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,620
What is it? Say it.

162
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,110
Apparently, many trainees

163
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,080
are dissatisfied with

164
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:30,890
his style of management.

165
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,910
Sometimes,

166
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,270
he's hard on his subordinates,

167
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,669
and not flexible enough.

168
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,429
I've heard about it.

169
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,450
Let's think about it again.

170
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:45,770
By the way,

171
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,400
I heard that the female pilot, Cheng Xiao,

172
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,680
in your Flight department

173
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,340
has been doing well recently.

174
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,770
Many captains have praised her.

175
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,290
Mr. Jiang,

176
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,730
you need to focus on training her.

177
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,120
Alright.

178
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll go there tomorrow.

179
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,280
Your return flight was quite smooth.

180
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:22,610
Yeah.

181
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,740
I shouldn't have thrown a tantrum at you.

182
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,340
I'm sorry.

183
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,660
Why are you still here?

184
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,500
Didn't you go back to rest?

185
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,790
Nanting asked me to wait for him here.

186
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,390
Nanting.

187
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,200
This is

188
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,450
for you.

189
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,040
It's not my birthday today.

190
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
You don't want it?

191
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,070
It's just that...

192
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,910
Why are you suddenly

193
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,320
giving me this?

194
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,200
Our Chengdu J-7 planes

195
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,350
can only handle short flights.

196
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,840
They're getting outdated now.

197
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,240
Now, the F-20 is the best.

198
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,540
Use this to encourage yourself.

199
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,100
Also,

200
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,390
in the future, if there is anything the matter,

201
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,320
just let me know.

202
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,040
I'll approve your leave.

203
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,670
Your words are so confusing.

204
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,600
Can't you just say something nice?

205
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,730
I'm leaving.

206
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,250
What does the short flight capacity of the F-7

207
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,130
have to do with giving me the F-20?

208
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,270
He wants to say that

209
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,440
since your girlfriend

210
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,520
couldn't go far with you,

211
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,170
let her leave.

212
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,950
Out with the old, in with the new.

213
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,550
Your sassy girlfriend

214
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,890
is a thing of the past now.

215
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,400
There will be a better girl in the future.

216
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:33,470
Nanting's words are philosophical.

217
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,750
My taxi will arrive soon.

218
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,890
I'll take you home.

219
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:44,790
No need.

220
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,320
Did you forget

221
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,310
I was kicked out by my ex-girlfriend?

222
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,840
I'm looking for a new place.

223
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,940
I'll be staying at the hostel nearby.

224
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,080
You're a first officer after all.

225
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,210
You earn so much a month.

226
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,610
Why do you live in a hostel?

227
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,210
I've sent all my salary home.

228
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,040
My grandma is in poor health,

229
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,170
I have to pay for her medical expenses.

230
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,100
Why don't you move to my place?

231
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,080
I have a spare small room.

232
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,160
You can find a place later.

233
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:09,790
No need.

234
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,540
This will interfere with you

235
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,820
getting a boyfriend.

236
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,640
It hasn't happened for years,

237
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,340
and it it won't happen in the next few days.

238
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,170
Let's go.

239
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,460
There's really no need.

240
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,860
The hostel is really near, I'm leaving now.

241
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,220
Don't worry about me.

242
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:32,790
Come in.

243
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,350
Ms. Ai, you wanted to see me?

244
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,330
Wait a moment.

245
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,570
Here's the thing.

246
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,780
Currently, we have a shortage in cabin crew members

247
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,120
for the Business Class and First Class cabins of our 787 jets.

248
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,180
I think you are a suitable candidate.

249
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,760
Business Class and First Class?

250
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,770
But I've just completed my internship.

251
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:56,600
I haven't had enough flight time.

252
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,800
Ms Liang made an exception

253
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,650
to promote some new recruits.

254
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,010
And this is the model that your batch of recruits

255
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,270
have flown on the most.

256
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,220
Of course,

257
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,290
you'll still have to go through strict tests.

258
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,420
So I wanted to ask you

259
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,620
if you're willing to take this job.

260
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,240
I am!

261
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,160
Go back and get ready.

262
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,570
Ok.

263
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,000
Ms. Ai,

264
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,640
is Xiazhi taking this assessment?

265
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,300
Xiazhi?

266
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,810
There should be a chance for her in the future.

267
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Thank you, Ms. Ai.

268
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,950
Welcome.

269
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,170
Cheng.

270
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,030
Mr. Xie.

271
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,280
You're here?

272
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,580
Why are you here?

273
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,680
From the perspective of administrative work,

274
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,880
I'm off this weekend.

275
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,400
From a pilot's point of view,

276
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,570
I am not flying today.

277
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,850
Why can't I be here?

278
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,880
I mean you—

279
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,610
It's a hobby.

280
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,650
I just learned something new.

281
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,080
Will you entertain me?

282
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,700
Of course.

283
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,240
OK.

284
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,140
So this is your shop?

285
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
It's my friend's.

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,930
Come and have fun in your free time.

287
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,770
[Our store does not serve alcohol]

288
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,890
It's so beautiful.

289
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:28,600
I can't bear to drink it.

290
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,030
What's its name?

291
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,200
I haven't named it yet.

292
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,730
Why don't you give it a name?

293
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,500
Me?

294
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,320
Deep Blue symbolizes Luzhou Airlines.

295
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,180
Blue and white symbolize the sky.

296
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,440
How about

297
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,570
we name it "Flight to You"?

298
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,310
Good name.

299
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,440
Try it.

300
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,510
Li Yuheng.

301
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:16,210
Captain Song.

302
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,460
Just call me Song.

303
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,760
Do you have a house for rent?

304
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,330
It's my neighbor's. I am just helping her.

305
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,480
This house is perfect for me.

306
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,070
You really saved me.

307
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,150
Here.

308
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,960
Thank you.

309
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,330
I'll get going then.

310
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,460
Ok. Get back to work.

311
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,700
It's great. It feels like alchohol.

312
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,270
What brings you here today?

313
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,230
I came here once before.

314
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,760
I happened to pass by today,

315
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,940
so I came in again.

316
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,950
You should come more often.

317
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,000
You can have a discount if you mention my name.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,410
OK.

319
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:09,770
Captain Gu.

320
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,300
Master.

321
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:15,869
Look,

322
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,910
Cheng Xiao ordered my drink.

323
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,040
Unlike you,

324
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:22,050
you only ever order room temperature water.

325
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,579
You guys continue to chat. I'll wait for a while.

326
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:27,050
No need.

327
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,339
I am leaving.

328
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,360
Mr. Xie, bill, please.

329
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:30,720
Ok.

330
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:36,760
Okay.

331
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,240
I'll get going then, Mr. Xie.

332
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,800
Come again.

333
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,930
Bye, Instructor Gu.

334
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,800
Look,

335
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,350
you've scared

336
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,430
a potential regular customer away.

337
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,380
Here is all the information you want.

338
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,070
These are all cases from a long time ago.

339
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,060
I am preparing a new operational manual.

340
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,670
The cases here

341
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,840
are worth a look.

342
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,980
The information online is incomplete.

343
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,910
I can only come here to collect information from you.

344
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:20,890
Instructor Gu,

345
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,130
did you drive here?

346
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:23,490
Yes.

347
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,050
Where are you going?

348
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:25,940
Home.

349
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:29,220
I couldn't get a taxi here.

350
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,320
Well...

351
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,760
I am not lying!

352
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,200
Where are you going?

353
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,580
Home.

354

Where do you live?

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,400
Wait,

356
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,640
I need to go to the flowers market.

357
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,840
Can you give me a ride?

358
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,760
Thank you.

359
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:47,280
Let's go.

360
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,880
The air conditioner is at 23 degrees Celsius.

361
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,890
It's the same temperature

362
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:12,880
as the temperature you like in the cockpit.

363
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,740
Instructor Gu,

364
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,370
do you want me

365
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,970
to read the checklist to you?

366
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,660
I set it at the same temperature

367
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,060
so I can maintain my condition at all times.

368
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,880
Instructor Gu,

369
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,360
you forgot to reply to my WeChat message yesterday.

370
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,020
I didn't.

371
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,640
You didn't need to send the messages.

372
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,650
Why?

373
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,630
It was my fault.

374
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,060
Why are you apologizing?

375
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:45,650
I recently found that

376
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,080
you're a little cute.

377
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:54,370
You're stubborn but cute.

378
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,090
You can even drive cars with cruise control.

379
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,160
Instructor Gu is so funny. Why have I just–

380
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,300
Can you be quiet?

381
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:10,550
Okay.

382
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,680

Turn the passenger seat temperature up by two degrees.

385
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,210
The passenger seat temperature has been raised by two degrees.

386
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,570
The windows can't open on the planes,

387
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,170
but they can open in the cars.

388
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,430

Aren't you off today?

Why didn't I see you this morning?

I wanted to go shopping with you.

396

Well, I had something to do today.

What's the matter with you?

Who are you trying to scare in broad daylight?

Why didn't I scare you to death?

Yes.

I am up to something.

416

I'm timid.

00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:48,670
I'm going to live close to you to ward off evil spirits.

418

Say that again?

419
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:53,820
Don't take it off.

420
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,350
It's even worse with it off.

421
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,330
You deserve to be dumped.

422
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,220
I'm happy to be dumped!

423
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:03,610
You...

424
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,600
Why do you always sit alone?

425
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,290
Here, try it.

426
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,230
This goes well with rice.

427
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,150
Before flying,

428
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,940
you shouldn't eat food that might irritate you.

429
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,260
We just landed.

430
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:11,830
That's enough.

431
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,360
Try it. It tastes good.

432
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:21,990
Right?

433
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,570
I promise I won't eat it before flying.

434
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,750
I've accumulated 170 flight hours

435
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,800
as an observer.

436

After doing this job for so long,

437
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,520
can I make some

Really?

441
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,730
If I fly for another 30 hours,

442
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,860
I can apply for the first officer test.

443

You remember me better than me.

447

Although you didn't fly with me every time,

448

as your instructor,

449

00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:16,290
is my greatest comfort to you.

No.

527
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,820
a few days ago,

528
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,520
Ms. Ai asked me to attend an evaluation

529
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,280
for Business Class cabin crew.

530
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,720
Promotion to Business Class?

531
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,070
Really? Did you pass?

532
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:01,710
Yes.

533
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
My goddess.

534
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,440
Keep your voice down.

535
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,840
But you really can hold it back.

536
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,480
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

537
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:08,850
I...

538
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,810
Did you think I won't feel good

539
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,320
if I knew?

540
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,180
Ms. Ai said

541
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
you will have a chance in the future.

542
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:24,090
Don't worry about me.

543
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,950
I know my own capacities.

544

Even if I fly long enough,

545
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,940
I may not get a promotion.

546
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,340
You can absolutely do it.

547
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,390
I won't worry about the future.

548
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:34,810
I'm thinking that

549

now that I've completed my internship safely.

It's your treat.

555
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:44,750
Of course.

It's a big deal for you to return to the first officer seat.

I changed shifts specially to fly with you.

Here,

570
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,450

Cool.

I've persuaded Yuheng to switch her shift.

Why are you always imposing on her?

I don't need to impose on her.

580
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,740
When I mentioned Captain Gu,

581
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,120
she wanted to change her shift immediately.

582
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,340
She said this is the first flight after her promotion.

583

With Captain Gu here,

584

585
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:27,870
Shouldn't Gu Nanting

586
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,960
change his shift for Yuheng instead?

587

You don't know about this?

588
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,110
I made a mistake before.

589
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,250
Actually, it's just Yuheng's one-sided love.

590
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:39,490
Both of them are still single.

591
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,150
It's completely true.

592
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,290
I once said Gu Nanting was pretending,

593
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,030

It's only a matter of time before Gu Nanting falls for her.

598
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,980
I think so too.

00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:04,960
Madam, don't worry.

695
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,240
We are very safe.

696
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,900
The plane is flying normally.

697
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:09,880
It's just that thereare no clouds outside the window

698
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,210
as a frame of reference.

699
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:13,560
Mom!

700
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,200
It's okay.

701
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,610
Kid, please fasten your seat belt.

702
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:16,090
Mom.

703
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:16,760
It's okay.

704
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,720
Ladies and gentlemen.

705
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,060
This is your captain speaking.

706
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,760
The plane has encountered some turbulence.

707
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,450
Please return to your seat

708
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,800
and fasten your seat belt.

709
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,120
-Crew, please return to your seats. -Don't worry, ma'am.

710
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,640
This turbulence is normal.

711
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,800
As long as we fasten our seatbelts,

712
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,060
it will be stable soon.

713
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:34,460
You can take a deep breath with me.

714
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,200
Inhale.

715
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:39,540
Exhale.

716
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,440
Mom, are you feeling better?

717
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm fine.

718
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:47,990
Mom, you'll be fine soon.

719
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,690
Madam, let me help you sit up straight.
