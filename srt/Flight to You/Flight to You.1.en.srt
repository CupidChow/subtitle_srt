you shouldn't have landed just now.

262
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,200
The crosswind was 15m/s.

263

It was already the crosswind limit

And it just rained.

266
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,860
If there is a slide,

267
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,400
the plane would easily get out of the runway.

The crosswind

269

didn't exceed the company's rules.

270

And under the extreme crosswind,

271

I could control the posture and slope of the plane.

273

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,310
and straightened the direction.

275

00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,420
Make sure they can make a diversion.

344
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:28,970
Mr. Gu.

345
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,920
the boarding of 8367 which flies from Shenyang

346
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
to Shantou via Luzhou

347
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,990
has been completed for two hours.

348
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,380
But the captain kept urging the company

349
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,580
to cancel the flight.

350
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,200
Why don't we cancel it as soon as possible?

351
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:40,600
No.

352
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,570
But our airport is closed.

353
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,000
We have a better plan.

354
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,620
Apply for direct flight to Shantou for 8367

355
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,900
as soon as possible.

356
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,920
Make coordination immediately.

357
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,520
Change the passengers flying to Luzhou

358
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,240
to the earliest flight tomorrow.

359
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,670
Okay.

360
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,780
Then everyone should be fine with it.

361
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,290
Flight 8834 won't be back today.

362
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,890
I remember there is a plane in the hangar

363
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,050
which just completed the maintenance.

364
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:04,660
Use it.

365
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:05,790
Okay.

366
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,460
You just came back from a business trip abroad?

367
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,390
Yes, from America. What about you?

368
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Switzerland.

369
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,610
I flew the plane myself.

370
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,890
You're a pilot of Luzhou Airlines?

371
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,910
I'll be a captain soon.

372
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,870
Awesome.

373
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,200
As far as I know,

374
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,960
Luzhou Airlines hasn't had a female captain yet.

375
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,970
You know a lot.

376
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,810
Are you a flight fan?

377
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,680
Let me introduce myself.

378
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,740
We're colleagues.

379
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:08,240
Ni Zhan from Mechanical Department.

380
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,330
Mr. Ni!

381
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,280
I've heard a lot about you.

382
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,410
Nice to meet you.

383
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,470
Cheng Xiao from Freight Department.

384
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,080
Hello.

385
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,080
What a coincidence.

386
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,100
Where are you going, Captain Cheng?

387
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,610
Crow Bar on Zhongyuan Road.

388
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,360
You still go to a bar during the typhoon?

389
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,530
We often fly the long flights.

390
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,530
I need to relax

391
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,560
from time to time.

392
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,320
Otherwise,

393
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,920
my lumbar and cervical spine will be scrapped.

394
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,770
I'm over the moon suddenly.

395
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,190
It's so comfy here.

396
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,190
Thank you.

397
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,550
[Crow Culture and Art Center]

398
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,800
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

399
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,350
Go in.

400
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,260
Bye.

401
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:22,980
Bye. Bye.

402
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,100
Get ready!

403
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,250
Cuba Libre, please.

404
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,430
Okay. Coke with ice again today.

405
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,960
Don't expose me.

406
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,920
Just let me pretend to drink and have fun.

407
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,280
What do you do indeed?

408
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,230
Every time I saw you appear alone in the middle of the night,

409
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,360
and you never drink.

410
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,490
A mysterious occupation.

411
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,080
Thank you.

412
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,410
The alcohol-free Cuba Libre.

413
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:15,240
Please enjoy the cake you ordered, mysterious lady.

414
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,100
It was delivered this afternoon.

415
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,030
Before I turn 30,

416
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,040
I'll be promoted to captain,

417
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,100
fly 4 million kilometers,

418
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,830
travel across 60 countries,

419
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,670
have my own apartment

420
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,360
and meet someone...

421
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,580
Forget it.

422
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,000
I can't be too greedy.

423
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,510
Happy birthday to myself.

424
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,570
Xiao,

425
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,750
I've calmed your mom down.

426
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:59,060
Don't worry.

427
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,810
Happy birthday.

428
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,780
Take good care of yourself.

429
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,380
I need to remind you

430
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,880
that you shouldn't have landed just now.

431
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,520
The crosswind was 15 meters per second.

432
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,800
According to the company rules,

433
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,080
it's already the extreme crosswind.

434
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,140
And it just rained.

435
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
If there were a slide,

436
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,900
the plane would easily run out of the runway.

437
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,430
Cai,

438
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
don't sleep.

439
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,520
I want to discuss a technical problem with you.

440
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,320
What's wrong?

441
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,350
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

442
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,610
Come on.

443
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,360
If you don't talk to me,

444
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,960
I can't fall asleep tonight.

445
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,910
What do you think about my landing today?

446
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,190
It was pretty good.

447
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,680
I praised you already.

448
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,610
Your landing skill was very high.

449
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,160
I was on the left seat.

450
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,400
I didn't even help you fix it when I was monitoring.

451
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
It's all your own efforts.

452
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,320
So my judgment was fine,

453
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:28,860
right?

454
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,910
What's wrong? Who said something negative?

455
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:33,970
Nothing.

456
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,290
Go to sleep.

457
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,440
Rest early. Sorry to bother you.

458
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,450
Bye.

459
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,660
I'm back.

460
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:26,810
I landed!

461
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,740
I landed!

462
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,030
Where should I stick it?

463
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,500
You've had a long flying day, Captain Cheng.

464
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Happy birthday.

465
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,530
A high-tech footbath bucket for you.

466
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,520
It can promote your blood circulation

467
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,380
to ensure a good sleep and beauty.

468
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,100
Am I very considerate?

469
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,960
Praise me.

470
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,090
Thank you for the gift.

471
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:25,520
This is a perfect match for my health care.

472
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,990
Polly.

473
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,810
You haven't seen me these days. Do you miss me?

474
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,470
Come here.

475
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,690
Take off! Take off!

476
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,810
No more take-offs! I'm exhausted.

477
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,170
I'm back.

478
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,980
Welcome home.

479
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,920
The dust cleansing has been activated.

480
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,190
The lights are on.

481
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,960
The indoor temperature is 23 degrees.

482
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,890
Humidity is 50%.

483
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,310
It's quite comfy.

484
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,890
Please open the door.

485
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,240
Set an alarm in six hours.

486
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,200
Okay.

487
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,680
I will remind you

488
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,060
at 7:08 this morning.

489
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:16,580
Good night. Sleep tight.

490
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:39,290
Thank you.

491
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,330
Bye. Another busy day.

492
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,560
Good morning, Mr. Gu.

493
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,320
Hello, Mr. Gu.

494
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,280
Morning.

495
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,900
Why is your hair like this?

496
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,020
I forgot to have a haircut.

497
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,640
Have your hair cut now.

498
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,560
But it's almost time to fly.

499
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,920
I'll deal with it when I'm back.

500
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,310
You can't carry out the mission like this.

501
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,440
You're late this time.

502
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,970
Today's flight mission is cancelled.

503
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,010
You're grounded for one week.

504
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:12,740
Go back for a self-reflection.

505
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:14,790
Yes.

506
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,460
I'm going to get a haircut now.

507
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:20,630
Wait.

508
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,030
Where are you flying?

509
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,300
To Chongqing.

510
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:26,850
Go ahead.

511
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,700
Aircraft Management Department, I'm Gu Nanting.

512
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,260
Zhang Ming from Luzhou 8461

513
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,200
is not in line with the flight requirements.

514
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,940

loosened his seat belt as soon as he landed.

523

Keep your voice down.

689
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,840
Don't yell.

690
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,200
They can't just abolish our department and let us transfer!.

691
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,480
Why didn't they ask if we want to be transferred?

692
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,860
Don't show off.

693
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,400
Just take the win.

694
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,520
I've been flying the Freight Transport since I started this business.

695
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,500
Maybe people dislike us for transporting pigs and cows,

696
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,700
but I like being here.

697
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,000
What's so good about the Passenger Transport Department?

698
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,200
You didn't know it?

699
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,240
There are many single men in the Passenger Transport Department.

700
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,240
There are fewer female pilots.

701
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,770
If you go there, you'll be extremely popular.

702
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:13,760
Cai, be serious.

703
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,260
What about you?

704
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,120
Will you come with us?

705
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:25,680
I want to retire.

706
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:27,960
No.

707
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,790
You are very healthy.

708
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,740
You can work for another ten years.

709
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:35,000
I've been flying around for so many years.

710
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,070
I'd like to take this opportunity to retire

711
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,000
and spend more time with my family.

712
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,300
I've been with you since I started working.

713
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,970
It's been seven years.

714
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,420
I was too shy to say it before.

715
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,650
What?

716
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,140
You've always been my target.

717
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,100
I'm your target? I...

718
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,440
I'm just a driver

719
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,640
praised by others.

720
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,380
You're a five-star captain.

721
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:10,070
You've been flying safely all your life.

722
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
How many of them can be like you?

723
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,020
Cheng.

724
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,320
All good things must come to an end.

725
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,380
All these years,

726
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:25,480
you've been working

727
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,500
with us,

728
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,840
and you've been working so hard.

729
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,110
The flight doctor told me in private

730
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,440
that you always have a bad tummy ache

731
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,900
when you have your period.

732
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,720
You've been taking painkillers from them.

733
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,580
As a girl,

734
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:44,930
it' tough for you during these seven years.

735
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,040
Not at all.

736
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:47,740
I like doing this.

737
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,360
It's my pleasure.

738
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,510
You still have a long way to go.

739
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,600
Work hard at the Passenger Transport Department.

740
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,980
Don't be like this.

741
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,560
Flying at the Passenger Transport Department

742
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,920
It's much better than flying for freight.

743
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,440
Okay, that's it. Wait here.

744
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:12,960
I'll get some food in the canteen. It's my treat today.

745
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,360
I can't let you run errands. I'll go.

746
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,830
No.

747
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,150
The last time I go to the canteen,

748
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,420
I need to go by myself.

749
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,120
Wait for me.

750
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,310
Mr. Cai,

751
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,120
Hello.

752
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:29,100
Cai.

753
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,360
What's wrong?

754
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,640
I'll work hard in the Passenger Transport Department.

755
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,900
I won't embarrass you.

756
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,870
Okay.

757
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,690
It's a deal.

758
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,390
When you become a captain,

759
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,530
treat me to dinner.

760
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:43,680
Of course I will.
