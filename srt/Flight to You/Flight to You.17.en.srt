Family.

5
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,759
It's time to recommend the food.

6
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,630
The first bowl is this river snail rice noodle.

7
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,810
It has a lot of ingredients.

8
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,060
I've already made one here.

9
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,660
This soup

10
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,560
Oily?

11
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,230
Don't be afraid of its oiliness.

12
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,250
We still have Besunyen.

13
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,670
This can help to remove the oil, good for your health.

14
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:19,050
These two are a pair.

Do you want to see her?

18
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,990
If you want to see her, press one.

19
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,600
Come on.

20
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,600
My roommate is tired.

21
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,460
I'll show you guys another day.

22
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,590
I need some rest too.

23
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,780
Why is it on the floor? Look at this.

24
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,980
It's dirty.

25
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,400
Are you giving up?

26
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,310
No.

27
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,620
As you know,

28
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,380
my flight attendant career is bleak.

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,940
I want to find a way out for myself.

30
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,210
Is this your way out?

31
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,000
If I become famous,

32
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:13,350
I'll earn more

33
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,940
than a flight attendant.

34
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,790
What about the flight attendant position?

35
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:17,790
Are you quitting?

36
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,560
It's destiny.

37
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,960
I'm not cut out to be a flight attendant.

38
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:41,850
Xia Xia,

39
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,760
no one is born

40
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,110
to be a flight attendant.

41
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,850
No.

42
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,540
You are born to be.

43
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,280
You and I

44
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:56,590
are 100 Qiyu different.

45
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,710
Don't praise me like that.

46
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,040
Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,250
I know how many weaknesses I have.

48
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,380
But do you know how many strengths you have?

49
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,890
This time, you left the plane quickly and didn't panic.

50
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,750
You reacted faster than all of us.

51
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,070
But how many crisis

52
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,100
can a flight attendant encounter in a lifetime?

53
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,220
What I usually do

54
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,190
is just my weakness.

55
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,610
Even during the evacuation this time,

56
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,360
I didn't do it well.

57
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,470
Are you going to leave me?

58
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,530
Didn't we agree

59
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,170
to be the best flight attendants together?

60
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,000
I promise you.

61
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,920
I will continue to work hard in the cabin.

62
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,800

71

said it was the first officer who made the steering.

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,730
Yes, it was Cheng Xiao.

73

Now it has created pandemonium.

74

The keyboard warriors have doxed Xiao.

75
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,610
They were talking nonsense online.

76
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,430
They said Xiao hurt Duan Chao.

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,360
What?

78
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,490

Brother Chao will wear it when he wakes up.

85
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,540

No, take it.

98
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,580

Don't care about what happened online

106

and don't respond blindly.

107

Protect yourself.

108
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,650

these people have gone too far.

You must be careful these days.

111

Cheng Xiao.

112
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,880
Why didn't you tell me you came?

Brother Zhan.

114
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,080
I went to the aviation doctor.

115
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,390
The examination still failed.

116
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,050
You're just too anxious.

117
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:38,250
It's good to rest for a few more days.

118
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,380
The higher-ups also

119
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
asked you to rest for a few more days.

Let me take you somewhere.

122
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,380
Mr. Ni is here. Cheng.

123
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:37,810
Have you been here?

124
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,140
I came here twice.

125
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,510
Do you know their boss

126
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,780
is a former captain at Luzhou Airlines?

127
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
I don't know.

128
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,710
It's Hu.

129
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,580
He retired early due to physical reasons,

130
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,750
but he couldn't bear to fly,

131
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,150
so he opened this bar that doesn't sell alcohol.

132
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,440
Coming.

133
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,890
Mr. Ni.

134
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,710
Uncle Hu.

135
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,080
Freshly baked.

136
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,300
Soufflé, two portions.

137
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,160
It's so beautiful.

138
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,360
This is different from

139
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
what I saw in other places.

140
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,050
I made this myself.

141
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,940
Only Mr. Ni can order this.

142
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,140
Uncle Hu.

143
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,320
If you keep calling me that,

144
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,580
it means you don't want me to come here again.

145
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,490
All right.

146
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,280
I'll leave you alone.

147
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,080
Enjoy.

148
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:21,510
Thank you.

149
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,440
Not bad.

150
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,410
This

151
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,460
is specially prepared

152
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,680
for the girls in the Maintenance Department.

153
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,400
You see, women in other industries

154
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,670
have afternoon tea.

155
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:36,750
In our industry,

156
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,380
they really don't have time.

157
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,000
Our female maintenance staff

158
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,130
always hold

159
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:43,700
a spanner, a cylinder, or a screw knife in their hands.

160
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,240
But they are girls after all.

161
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,700
We should treat them well.

162
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,540
It's so lucky to be Mr. Ni's subordinate.

163
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,820
Gu Nanting should learn from you.

164
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,010
How is it? Is it good?

165
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:58,850
Yes.

166
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,890
It feels good to eat sweets.

167
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,510
Good.

168
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,780
All of you knew

169
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:16,410
what happened this time.

170
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,740
Cheng Xiao's operation

171
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,310
has caused injuries and aircraft damage.

172
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:22,750
The network media caused by this

173
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,310
has also affected our corporate image.

174
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,180
There's still a crowd

175
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,780
in front of our company.

176
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,660
The final findings haven't come out yet.

177
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,750
Let's get to the point.

178
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,090
Today, I invite Mr. Xie

179
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,800
and the senior instructors

180
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,700
of the Flight Department

181
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,440
here to unify our opinions.

182
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,630
I suggest

183
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,780
not recruiting a female pilot

184
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,440
in the recruitment next year.

185
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,220
Sorry, Mr. Jiang.

186
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,700
I don't agree.

187
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,760
Generally speaking,

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,260
there are more or less

189
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,350
emotional issues for female pilots.

190
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,950
Look at Cheng Xiao.

191
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,150
A live example.

192
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,050
Cheng Xiao is just an individual case.

193
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:10,580
And it's not finalized yet.

194
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,940
Female pilots

195
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:16,880
are not inferior to male pilots.

196
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,340
This is supported by data.

197
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:19,460
In fact,

198
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,830
in recruiting female pilots,

199
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,840
Luzhou Airlines is

200
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,580
far behind other airlines.

201
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,150
Nanting,

202
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,250
the proportion of male to female pilots

203
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,200
in other airlines is also very different.

204
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,320
There's a consideration of the actual conditions.

205
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,950
President Xu

206
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:37,410
doesn't want me to talk about female pilots.

207
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:40,250
But now we are going to prepare for

208
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,200
next year's recruitment.

209
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,820
We can't dodge this question anymore.

210
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,510
Now we close the door,

211
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,360
I might as well tell you my innermost thoughts and feelings.

212
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,760
Let's just talk about one simple question.

213
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:54,930
To avoid high-altitude radiation,

214
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,520
once a female pilot decides to give birth,

215
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,950
in order to prepare for her pregnancy,

216
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,850
she needs to stop flying for at least six months in advance

217
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,420
or

218
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,820
get transferred to another position.

219
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,220
Next is maternity leave.

220
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,590
She has to take care of her family

221
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,530
and children.

222
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,100
This significantly creates a loss in pilot utilization.

223
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:13,980
Our company

224
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,880
is in a rapid development stage.

225
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,590
We need a team

226
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,470
with high efficiency.

227
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,330
For female pilots,

228
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,190
maybe we can recruit later.

229
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,180
But not now.

230
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,210
Mr. Jiang is right.

231
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,760
Yes.

232
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,980
I think

233
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,730
let's raise our hands to vote.

234
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,290
Raise your hand if you agree.

235
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,920
Every year, the flight universities

236
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,520
will train a batch of excellent female pilots,

237
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,510
including some from aeronautics majors.

238
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,310
If we miss them,

239
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,740
it will be our loss.

240
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,810
Mr. Jiang emphasized the usage rate.

241
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,950
I think it should be considered in a dialectical way.

242
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,720
Luzhou Airlines, as the head enterprise in Luzhou,

243
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,619
can't only pursue interests.

244
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,150
Sometimes, you have to make decisions

245
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,810
with social responsibility.

246
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,590
How about

247
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,780
talk to President Xu?

248
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,600
In the Flight Department,

249
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,380
I'm just a senior instructor.

250
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,080
You're not the Deputy Director now.

251
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,080
You need to abide by the workplace reports procedure.

252
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:46,410
By the way,

253
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:49,130
the second fact-finding investigation will be scheduled for the day after tomorrow.

254
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,010
The result may not be optimistic.

255
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,030
Didn't the data analysis prove

256
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,580
Cheng Xiao didn't mean to

257
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,780
the captain's order?

258
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,080
I'm afraid someone has to take responsibility

259
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
when the incident of a celebrity getting hurt went viral to this.

260
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:43,310
[The data analysis report is out. You have no problem. But the public opinion is against you now.]

261
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:43,310
[You have to prepare for the worst for the fact-finding investigation the day after tomorrow.]

262
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,240
Instructor Gu,

263
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:51,120
I will be an excellent captain.

264
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,040
I won't let you down.

265
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,240
Mom.

266
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,040
Are there guests at home today?

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Are you lucky

268
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,970
or have you come to a agreement?

269
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,440
Us?

270
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,760
Brother Nanting, you're back.

271
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,570
Yuheng.

272
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:31,810
You...

273
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:33,580
I flew to Wuxi today

274
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,040
and bought some specialties at the airport,

275
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,640
so I made some dishes for her.

276
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,090
You haven't eaten, have you?

277
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,090
Go wash your hands.

278
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,020
Fortunately, I cooked a lot today.

279
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,130
Go wash your hands.

280
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,680
Auntie, have some juice to warm your stomach.

281
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,500
I'll do it myself.

282
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,120
It's okay.

283
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,520
Here.

284
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:50,610
I can do it myself.

285
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,070
It's okay, let me help you, Brother Nanting.

286
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,520
-Okay. That's enough. Thank you.
-It's yours.

287
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,180
Here you go.

288
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:01,490
Auntie, try it.

289
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,620
It's my first time cooking for you.

290
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,220
I wonder if you like it.

291
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,190
Xiao Yu's cooking is really good.

292
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,680
I need to learn more from Brother Nanting.

293
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,140
Brother Nanting is busy at work.

294
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,260
I can't help him.

295
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,530
So I can only take care of you for him.

296
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,390
You're too kind.

297
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:17,680
Brother Nanting.

298
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,600
Try this.

299
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,950
I'll do it myself.

300
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,930
Do you not like it?

301
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,000
No.

302
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,630
It's fine. It's good.

303
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,470
I like it.

304
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,690
He can eat even if it's only white rice.

305
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,180
What do you like to eat?

306
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,850
I'll cook for you next time.

307
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,950
No, it's good.

308
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,590
Thank you, mom.

309
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Brother Nanting.

310
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,300
Are you tired today?

311
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,300
I've been busy lately.

312
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,800
There will be a second fact-finding investigation soon.

313
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,720
I heard about it too.

314
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,550
Actually,

315
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:42,080
regarding the celebrity getting injured, I...

316
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,390
What's wrong?

317
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,150
I...

318
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,030
What's the matter?

319
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,900
Actually, that celebrity

320
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
didn't get hurt during evacuation.

321
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,730
What happened?

322
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,310
At that time,

323
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,850
I was doing a safety check before landing.

324
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,270
I found that he didn't wear his seat belt.

325
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,510
I reminded him many times,

326
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,230
but he still refused to cooperate.

327
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,150
I had no choice.

328
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,390
When the plane turned,

329
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,930
he sprained his neck.

330
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,000
I've read the investigation statement of the Cabin Service Department.

331
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,460
Why didn't you mention it?

332
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,460
That manager

333
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,500
kept saying want to complain against me.

334
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,230
The celebrity is dominant too.

335
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,240
I dare not offend him.

336
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,050
In the cabin,

337
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:57,870
everyone should have only one identity,

338
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,070
which is a passenger.

339
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,770
As a professional flight attendant,

340
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:04,930
you must be responsible for the safety of the passengers.

341
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,660
The netizens are causing trouble online.

342
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,240
This matter

343
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,840
not only ruined the company's reputation

344
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,760
but also let Cheng Xiao take the blame

345
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,960
and get scolded and attacked, you know?

346
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,700
I'm sorry.

347
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,600
Sorry, Brother Nanting, I...

348
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,550
I dare not say this.

349
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,740
I'm afraid...

350
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:20,840
I...

351
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:23,360
I'm afraid of being suspended.

352
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
I'm also afraid of getting revenge.

353
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,030
I was wrong.

354
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,050
What else can I do?

355
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:35,890
First,

356
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,090
report to the company immediately.

357
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:38,550
Second,

try to recall

359
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,720
if any passengers

360
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,230
saw him not fastening the seat belt

361
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:44,350
when he landed.

362
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,670
That manager must have seen it.

363
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:49,520
But...

364
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,890
I'm sorry to bother you.

365
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,490
But...

366
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,860
please fasten your seat belt.

367

That time, a passenger with a platinum card

368

sat in his row.

369
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,630
He should have seen it.

370
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:20,560
I can try to contact him to testify.

371
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,880
You only have one day.

372
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,150
He may be the only one

373
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:26,870
who can clarify the truth.

374
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,730
Okay, I know.

375
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,850
Brother Nanting,

376
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,670
can you forgive me?

377
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:44,680
What matters is whether the Cabin Service Department can forgive you.

379

I hope you can understand that.

What?

390

Can a man eat it?

391
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,000
Of course.

392
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:31,960
This kind of thing

I would call you when I had time.

402
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,280
I didn't expect you to call me first.

403

00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:40,900
So...

520
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,830
You know everything?

521
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:45,970
Evil boss?

522
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:48,670
Scumbag?

523
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:54,090
You're silent.

524
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,260
Are you shy?

525
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,590
I didn't know it was you until later.

526
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,460
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

527
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,700
I wouldn't have

528
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,090
identified you

529
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,310
with the owner's son.

530
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,910
I gave you that as a nickname.

531
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,200
You didn't tell me your name.

532
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,020
The online version of you

533
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,150
is much cuter than you are in real life.

534
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,840
Your wiring...

535
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,530
Gu Nanting.

536
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,600
Now that you know,

537
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,680
what do you think

538
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,720
about me?

539
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:15,930
All right.

540
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,960
The lighting is suitable now.

541
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,250
I'm asking you.

542
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,310
What do you think

543
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,070
about me?

544
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:05,090
You

545
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,810
are nice.

546
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,430
As a tenant,

547
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:12,850
you're nice too.

548
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,570
I was just kidding.

549
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,340
Why are you so nervous?

550
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,360
You...

551
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,980
Don't take what I said in my emails

552
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,680
too seriously.

553
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:25,800
You know me.

554
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,620
I'm fearless

555
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,840
when I talk.

556
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,080
All right. Look at my wiring.

557
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:32,070
Is it correct?

558
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:49,690
What are you doing?

559
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,500
You've already friend-zoned me.

560
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,160
Why are you still afraid of me?

561
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,130
Are you going to fix it or not, Instructor Gu?

562
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:00,460
It's really hot in here.

563
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
I really don't know

564
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,780
who would cut other people's wiring.

565
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,900
Your information was published online.

566
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,230
Your address was on it.

567
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,790
These netizens only know how to

568
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,520
do this kind of shameful thing.

569
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
It's possible

570
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,920
they will do worse in the future.

571
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,870
Are you concerned about me?

572
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,340
You are my trainee.

573
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,540
Of course I'm concerned.

574
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,260
All right, go inside and flip the switch.

575
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,280
There it is!

576
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,300
The power is back on.

577
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,320
Well...

578
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,750
Instructor and trainee, landlord and tenant.

579
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,520
What a coincidence.

580
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,410
Is it?

581
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,570
This neighborhood

582
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,160
is near the airport.

583
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,930
Many employees in our company live here.

584
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,770
So the Auntie Qin I pay rent to is...

585
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,370
My mother.

586
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,850
I bought this house for her.

587
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:26,850
By the way,

588
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,630
about the second fact-finding investigation

589
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,960
the day after tomorrow.

590
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,240
Originally, public opinion online was against you.

591
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,800
But

592
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,990
I've gotten some new information.

593
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:38,790
What is it?

594
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,190
Li Yuheng said

595
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,340
the passenger who got injured

596
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,800
wasn't wearing his seat belt when he landed.

597
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,600
We're communicating with the witness right now.

598
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,200
So the day after tomorrow...

599
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,700
Don't worry too much.

600
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,440
I'll try my best to clarify it for you.

601
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,390
I'll accept whatever the results are.

602
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:06,800
Thank you.

603
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,420
I live in Block 16, on the fifth floor.

604
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,090
Call me if you need any help.

605
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,480
I'll be off now.

606
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:20,950
Your phone.

607
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,400
Thank you.
