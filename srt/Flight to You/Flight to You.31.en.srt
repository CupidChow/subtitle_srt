no flight landed at the airport.

128
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,210
The first landing afterwards

129

don't have to take responsibility.

did their best to save the passengers.

145

The death of the traveler

146
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,790
was due to their personal physical reasons.

147
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,930
It has nothing to do with the flight.

148

at the investigation meeting.

153
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:46,420
Since we couldn't have made an emergency landing,

154
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,380
why did you want me to hide it?

155
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:56,730
Yes.

156
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:58,990

163
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,590
she won't be affected

164

by these rumors.

165
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,470
As a professional pilot,

166
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,790
what you should think about is

how to fly every flight well,

168
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
instead of thinking about

169
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,150
every rumor out there.

What are you questioning?

174
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,620
The authenticity of this recording?

00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,680
didn't put up a notice

177
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,410
regarding them closing their runway?

178
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,150
Or are you doubting

179
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,160
an experienced pilot

180
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,270
with over 20,000 flights?

181
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,490
If you have any issues with me,

182
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,160
we can go back to the flight department to talk.

183
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,240
Let's not waste everyone's time here.

184
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,310
Director Xie,

185
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,020
have the legal department

186
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,830
deliver copies of these information

187
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,280
to the victim's lawyer.

188
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,250
I think

189
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,460
he won't pester me anymore.

190
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,120
Sir,

191
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,080
I think this situation is quite complicated.

192
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,960
What should we...

193
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,480
Give it to President Xu.

194
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,060
Okay.

195
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,290
Cheng.

196
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,420
Thank you, sir.

197
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,100
I know this

198
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,600
makes you feel guilty.

199
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,570
But at that time,

200
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,330
there was no possibility of diversion.

201
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,660
So,

202
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,380
you really did your best.

203
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,020
When I contacted the control,

204
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,050
they told me

205
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:08,280
to wait.

206
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,540
What a coincidence.

207
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:11,980
The airport

208
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,180
just had to be close at this time.

209
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,940
Changes occur in airports anytime.

210
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,550
Besides,

211
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,120
the recording is there.

212
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,040
Alright.

213
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:25,920
Don't think too much.

214
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
Just fly every subsequent flight well

215
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,070
to make up for your regrets.

216
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,710
Director Xie, please go ahead.

217
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,860
I will take my leave first.

218
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,360
Bye.

219
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,420
Cheng Xiao?

220
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,740
What’s wrong?

221
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,870
Is the investigation result out?

222
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,910
I said I don't want to trouble you.

223
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,130
But I really don't know who to tell.

Come in.

226
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,540
You mean

227
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,370
you suspect there's something wrong with the recording?

228
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,880
I can’t think of other possibilities.

229
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,740
Mr. Jiang and I,

230
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:03,980
though we don't share some values,

231
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:05,930
I think

232
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,480
he is still a qualified captain.

233
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,450
To fabricate a recording...

234
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
This is too serious.

235
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,010
Are you sure you heard him say that?

236
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,820
You don't trust me either?

237
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,430
That's not what I meant.

238
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,510
But

239
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,790
we still need evidence.

240
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,300
I'll find the evidence.

241
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,120
I'll take my leave.

tell you?

This...

252

I've already said it on the investigation meeting.

253

Can you tell me again?

254

Mr. Gu,

255
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,580
there's a recording of the conversation between the air and ground.

256
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,290
If you want to hear the details,

257

ask the Security Department to get it for you.

258

Please repeat it.

I...

260
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,500
Even if I repeat it again,

261
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:12,940
it'd be the same as

262
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,830
what I said at the investigation meeting.

263

It's late.

You're an old employee of the company.

I remember

270
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,200
you would attend the charity event

you are not only a good father,

but also a kind and honest person.

why you are being

277
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:51,780
so unusual today?

278
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,410
What were you going to say

00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,869
the passengers on the plane

284
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,579
didn't ask us for an emergency landing.

285
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:24,430
It’s also reasonable

286
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,849
that you decided to speed up the flight instead.

287

issue regarding responsibility.

I didn't try my best to save my life.

294

This will become something people would attack me for.

295

00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:26,660
Can I have a copy of the recording?

350
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:30,220
I gave one to Luzhou Airlines,

351
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,440
but I can email you

352
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,910
another copy if you need.

353
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:34,810
Thank you very much.

354
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:35,720
Sure.

355
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:43,990
May I ask you a question?

356
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,550
Why do you doubt this recording?

357
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,560
Did something bad happen at that time?

358
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:57,050
I'm not at liberty to say.

359
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:58,360
okay?

360
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,820
Thank you, Mr. Nguyen.

361
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:00,760
Sure.

362
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,000
Bye.

363
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,670
Gu listened to the recordings.

364
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,620
Also there is no problem

365
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,410
but he still has very much doubt

366
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,720
about the authenticity of the document.

367
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,310
And he asked for the contact info

368
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,780
of the other two captains

369
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:27,890
in the same airspace.

370
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,100
I don't know them.

371
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,060
Okay.

372
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,210
I see.

373
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:35,590
Jiang...

374
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:38,170
Don't create me a problem.

375
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,040
This neighborhood

376
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,560
is where Mr. Guo's son lived in.

377
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,550
The PR department said

378
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,910
Mr. Guo should live here.

379
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,600
But they're still asking about his unit number.

380
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,390
Let's sit here and wait for a while.

381
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:08,790
Let's go.

382
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:24,380
But Xiao,

383
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,340
no matter how I think

384
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,840
about this. What Mr. Jiang did

385
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,580
sounds so implausible.

386
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,100
I think so too.

387
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,210
But I did hear it.

388
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:40,670
Would I lie?

389
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,100
It's not that I don't trust you.

390
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,120
We just have no evidence.

391
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,430
What about the recorder in the cockpit?

392
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,630
The capabilities of the recorder in the cockpit are limited.

393
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,900
It can only be kept for two hours at most.

394
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,040
If we didn't retrieve it back then,

395
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,850
it would have been overridden by subsequent recordings.

396
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,960
So,

397
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,030
we have nothing.

398
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,380
Got it.

399
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:15,710
Let's go.

400
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:16,620
Let's go.

401
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,590
Building 10.

402
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,040
Here.

403
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,600
101.

404
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,460
Hello,

405
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,810
the subscriber you dialed is not available.

406
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,280
Please try again later.

407
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,720
I still can't get through.

408
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,540
Mr. Zhuang told me yesterday that

409
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,960
we can't win this case.

410
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,320
Luzhou Airlines has evidence.

411
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,530
He advised us to drop the charges.

412
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,090
Drop the charges?

413
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,280
What do you mean?

414
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,140
To not sue them.

415
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:11,610
If we don't sue them,

416
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,990
our son would've died in vain.

417
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,560
They didn't even say anything.

418
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,100
But I can't get in touch with the lawyer.

419
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,170
I've called him many times.

420
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,880
You gave him the money?

421
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,120
I gave him cash.

422
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,080
As for the remaining payment,

423
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,780
I did a bank transfer to him this morning.

424
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,030
You gave all our money

425
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,240
and the money left by Xiaoliang

426
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,810
to him?

427
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:43,940
He said he needed to do various investigations to get evidence.

428
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,330
Besides, he won't do it even if you don't pay him.

429
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,900
Guo,

430
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,250
did you get cheated?

431
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,530
Calm down.

432
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,990
No, no.

433
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,840
He signed a contract with me.

434
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:58,160
I'll show you the contract.

435
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,240
He said

436
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,650
it's written clearly in the contract.

437
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,440
Can you understand the contract?

438
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,100
Where did you find this lawyer?

439
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,160
Xiao,

440
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,390
what are you going to do now?

441
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,430
I want to help Mr. Guo find a lawyer.

442
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,380
You're helping a passenger to sue Luzhou Airlines?

443
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,070
If others find out, you...

444
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,280
Didn't you say

445
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,270
Mr. Jiang and the company are not to be held responsible?

446
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,250
He wouldn't win even if he got a lawyer.

447
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,900
Legally speaking,

448
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,330
Mr. Jiang is innocent.

449
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,080
But the truth is,

450
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,970
as the captain,

451
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,570
he didn’t consider the passenger's safety

452
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:27,660
as his main concern.

453
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,480
Instead, interests had clouded his mind.

454
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:33,230
Interests?

455
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,440
Are you trying to expose Mr. Jiang?

456
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:45,960
Be it the passenger's family, or the company,

457
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,270
they all have the right to know the truth.

458
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,290
Mr. Jiang should tell the company the truth

459
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:53,550
and apologize to the passenger's family.

460
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:55,580
But where can you find evidence?

461
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,190
I’m thinking about

462
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,900
those two captains.

463
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,230
What captain?

464
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,990
The captains who spoke in the ground to air communication.

465
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,930
They must know

466
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:07,800
whether the airport

467
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:09,440
has been shut.

468
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:12,190
But where will you find them?

469
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,490
Information like this is not disclosed, right?

470
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,420
The airline company will also keep it a secret.

471
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:42,750
Mr. Jiang.

472
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:43,750
Mr. Jiang.

473
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,720
What are you doing?

474
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,800
I'm sorry.

475
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,170
You scared me.

476
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:49,970
Sorry.

477
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,500
The receptionist said you just came down.

478
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,610
I have something urgent to tell you.

479
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,450
Did you go on a business trip?

480
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,330
What's the matter?

481
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,860
I would like to

482
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:04,970
send a letter to Gaosha and Mile

483
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,860
in the name of Luzhou Airlines' Flight Department

484
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,390
to ask them to to provide the contact information

485
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,960
of the two captains who were in the same air space as 805

486
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,430
and give a statement.

487
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,570
Are you questioning the authenticity

488
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:20,930
of the recording?

489
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,810
Now the passenger and the general public

490
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,800
are all suspicious of Luzhou Airlines.

491
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,350
I was thinking,

492
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,920
besides just a recording, if the two captains

493
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,460
who were also in the same airspace, could give a statement,

494
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,040
it would also prove Luzhou Airlines' innocence.

495
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,580
You're right.

496
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:35,250
But have you thought about it?

497
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,450
Once this letter is sent out,

498
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,040
what will other companies

499
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,460
think of us?

500
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,550
Just for the so-called further proof,

501
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,490
we are by default

502
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,650
acknowledging that there is an issue at that point of time.

503
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,080
Isn't this a bit inappropriate?

504
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,560
Alright.

505
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:52,630
The company

506
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,110
will take care of it.

507
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:55,620
Don't worry anymore.

508
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,040
Go back and rest.

509
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,030
You...

510
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,710
you're looking for me?

511
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:52,490
I have something to tell you in person.

512
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:55,190
All stations,

513
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,530
our runway is closed temporarily

514
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,530
due to FOD.

515
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:03,010
Gaosha 263,  please make an orbit at present position.

516
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,990
Break break. Mille 221, please make an orbit at present position.

517
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,500
The time of delay is indeterminant.

518
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,150
Maintaining flight level 240.

519
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,650
Right hand orbit, Gaosha 263.

520
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,820
Maintaining flight level 220.

521
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,970
Right hand orbit,

522
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,200
Mile 221.

523
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,240
Where did you get this recording from?

524
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,960
Saigon Airport's archival room.

525
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,920
You went down to Saigon?

526
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,250
The other two pilots

527
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,360
who were in the same airspace

528
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,140
are also key.

529
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,490
I requested to Mr. Jiang

530
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,600
to look for them in their company,

531
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,790
but he rejected it.

532
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:44,490
However,

533
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,560
I've got the list of current pilots

534
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,930
of these two companies.

535
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,200
There are 6,577 of them.

536
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,410
I'm trying to figure out a way to filter them out.

537
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,280
Thank you.

538
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,430
So far,

539
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,520
it still can't prove anything.

540
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,290
I want to tell Mr. Guo

541
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,420
what's suspicious.

542
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,970
What Mr. Jiang did

543
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,750
concerns the company's internal

544
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,250
and industrial investigation.

545
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,580
This has nothing to do with the fact that

546
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,480
he made a sensible judgement on flight 805.

547
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:24,800
Yes, I know.

548
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,550
But he fabricated evidence.

549
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:27,920
He lied to everyone.

550
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:33,110
Even if the victim's family

551
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,530
found out that the recording was fabricated,

552
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,230
the fact that Luzhou Airlines is not held accountable will not change.

553
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,490
And the uproar on the Internet will get worse.

554
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:40,770
The pros and cons

555
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,130
can't be explained in a few words.

556
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,480
Thank you for helping me.

557
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,520
Please send me a copy

558
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:53,730
of the pilots and the recording.

559
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,150
I'll make my leave first.

560
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,710
By the way,

561
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,890
don't get involved in this anymore.

562
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,450
Cheng Xiao,

563
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,239
no matter what,

564
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,730
don't get yourself involved.

565
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,230
Don't worry. I know what to do.

566
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,790
Xiao.

567
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,400
You've got time to call me today?

568
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,150
You're not flying?

569
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:01,510
Dad.

570
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,500
Well,

571
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:05,340
you have so many classmates in Luzhou.

572
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,870
Do you know any lawyer?

573
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,380
What? Did you get into a lawsuit?

574
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:11,810
It's not me.

575
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,130
I'm helping someone.

576
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
It'd be best if it's someone

577
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:18,130
whose fees aren't too high

578
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,460
and is experienced.

579
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,130
You should

580
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,240
ask your mom regarding this.

581
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,910
She has a trial today.

582
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,330
How about this?

583
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,590
Call her

584
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,780
when she gets back.

585
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,050
Forget it. It's fine.

586
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,010
Dad,

587
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,920
how is mom doing recently?

588
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,640
She's fine.

589
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,420
Every now and then,

590
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,870
I talk to her about Ni and your progress.

591
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,810
Two days ago,

592
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,130
she asked me for Ni's photo.

593
00:35:51,250 --> 00:35:51,940
Do you have any?

594
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,190
Send me one if you have one.

595
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,680
Of course not. I don't have one.

596
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:56,770
Dad,

597
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:59,230
don't go too far with this.

598
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,450
Keep it low.

599
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:01,780
What are you talking about?

600
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,590
You need to put on a full show.

601
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,110
Let's talk later.

602
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,480
I've got something to do.

603
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:18,750
Yun.

604
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:19,950
You're back so early.

605
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,700
The trail went well?

606
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:22,910
You lied to me, right?

607
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:24,020
No.

608
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,350
How could I lie to you?

609
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,370
I just want you to be at ease.

610
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,370
Ni...

611
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,660
Ni Zhan and Xiao are going well...

612
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,410
I'm just

613
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,170
showing you what it could be

614
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:41,950
in the future.

615
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,900
People should have dreams, right?

616
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:47,670
With dreams, we have motivation.

617
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,850
-With motivation, your dream will come true.
-Cheng.

618
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,550
listen.

619
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,280
Cheng Xiao must come back to Qingdao.

620
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,420
If you can't make that happen.

621
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,160
I will.

622
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,020
[Luzhou University No. 2 Affiliated Hospital]

623
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:34,330
How is the investigation result?

624
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,030
Looks like my flight career

625
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,720
is coming to an end.

626
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,640
What's wrong?

627
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,110
Your lumbar spine problem?

628
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,630
I've been receiving treatment

629
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,610
for the past two years.

630
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,940
I thought it could recover...

631
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,710
But now it seems

632
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,540
I overestimated himself.

633
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,270
What did the aviation doctor say?

634
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,840
He didn't say you can't fly, did he?

635
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,840
I know my body best.

636
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,460
I'm afraid that one day

637
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,980
it would act up during my flight,

638
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,270
affecting the flight safety.

639
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:14,430
I thought

640
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,540
I could fly to retire.

641
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,800
Now it seems I have to land early.

642
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,490
No matter how strong you are,

643
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,450
in the end,

644
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,900
aging is still something very real.

645
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,610
Whether you're an ordinary person

646
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,160
or a former aviation hero,

647
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,530
Xie, I will never forget that day.

648
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,810
That day before we boarded the plane,

649
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,410
you told me

650
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:45,950
we should treat every flight

651
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:48,320
as our first flight.

652
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
Who would have thought

653
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,900
that plane suddenly broke in the air.

654
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:55,930
The wind was so strong that

655
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,480
the checklist blew up and hit the face,

656
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,120
I can't even see the panel clearly.

657
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:04,020
But you didn't panic at all.

658
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,830
You operated everything stably and accurately.

659
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,910
Many veteran pilots

660
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,600
are no match for you.

661
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,940
That's not true.

662
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:16,980
To be honest,

663
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,670
I was so nervous at that time.

664
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,320
I was so scared.

665
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,100
I can't imagine

666
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,780
if you were not there,

667
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:27,540
what would have happened?

668
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,050
In the blink of an eye,

669
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,900
17 years have passed.

670
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,230
So fast.

671
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,800
Yeah.

672
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,030
It's not easy that we've managed to continue flying till today,

673
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,710
right?

674
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,640
Yes.

675
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,700
It's not easy.

676
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,260
The patient is getting better. Thank you.

677
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,840
The human voice can be fully simulated

678
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,870
after the processing.

679
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,190
And the ambience sound

680
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:46,620
matches the noise of the flight.

681
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,400
All stations,

682
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,720
our runway is closed temporarily

683
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,800
due to FOD.

684
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,430
Gaosha 263,

685
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,160
please make an orbit at present position. Break break.

686
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,640
Mile 221,

687
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,110
please make an orbit at present position.

688
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,690
The time of delay is indefinite.

689
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,330
Finished.

690
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,720
Good job.

691

Thank you.

692
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,970
Maintaining flight level 240,

693
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:43,590
Right hand orbit, Gaosha 263.

694
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Maintaining flight level 22,000.

695
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,230

696
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,000
Mile 221.

697
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,010
Come in.

698
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:20,360
Brother Nanting.

699
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,850
The draft

700
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,030
for the safety manual have been arranged.

701
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,270
I've sent you the pdf version.

702
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,200
Thank you.

703
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,460
Did you stay up all night again?

704
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,150
I stayed up a little.

705
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,340
I'm not flying today.

706
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,320
I wanted to get Xiao to do it with me

707
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,200
so I can be more efficient,

708
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,060
but things

709
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,760
hasn't been going well for her.

710
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:44,350
What's wrong with her?

711
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,300
She has been

712
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,040
trying to look for

713
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,520
a lawyer who's good at civil law.
