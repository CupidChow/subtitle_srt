Cheng,

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,960
you look very happy today.

10
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,870
Did something good happen?

00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,680
Did I?

12

Hello.

16
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Are you Ms. Cheng?

17
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,180
Yes, who are you?

18
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,170
I'm from Jia's Real Estate.

19
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,680
You bought that house here.

20
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,610
Do you remember?

21
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,070
Yes.

22
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,080
What's wrong?

23
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,560
A buyer is interested in your house.

24
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,690
He wants to discuss the price with you.

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,570
What?

26
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,410
Didn't you sell your house?

27
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,200
Today, a client

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,540
went to check out the house.

29
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,340
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,490
When did I sell it?

31
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,290
Your mother came to our company and sold it.

32
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
She's been on the phone.

33
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,829
We couldn't reach her,

34
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,960
so we decided to contact you directly.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,829
The three of us

36
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,760
haven't eaten together for a long time.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,440
Apply this to make you look younger.

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
What's wrong?

39
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,230
I look old if I don't apply it, right?

40
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,120
Don't say that. I'm praising you.

41
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,000
Look at your daughter.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,829
What's wrong with her today,

43
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,510
buying me dinner?

44
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:58,730
It's nice for our daughter to treat us.

45
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,370
But you say it differently.

46
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,320
Don't listen if you don't like it.

47
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,980
I do.

48
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,870
I've heard it for half of my life. I'm used to it.

49
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,930
Hurry up. Xiaoxiao will be back soon.

50
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,580
Who asked you to sell my house?

51
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,470
What house?

52
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,079
My house

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,480
was earned by myself.

54
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,500
You don't have a penny in it.

55
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,710
Why did you put my house on the platform?

56
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,329
Why?

57
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,320
Because I'm your mother.

58
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,410
You're a lawyer.

59
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,680
You should know

60
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,690
even if you're a mother,

61
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,720
you can't touch your children's property at will

62
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:34,760
I can sue you.

63

Fine, go ahead.

You don't live in such a big house in Qingdao.

65
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,840

66
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,640
buy this shabby and small house here?

67
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
I'm telling you, sell it now.

Come back with me.

69
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,240

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,650

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,430
I’ve been transferred back to the Flight Department.

177
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:33,910
Really?

178
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,940
That's great. Congratulations, daughter.

179
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,520
Thanks, dad.

180
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,630
This is from your mum.

181
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:07,760
Thank you.

182
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,080
Why are you smiling?

183
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,950
Nothing.

184
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,980
I'm watching a funny video.

185
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:21,670
Don't look at your phone. It's bad for your eyes.

186
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,470

[Cheng Xiao’s flight schedule]

188
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,230
Am I going to fly 20 days in a month,

189
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,210
on 60 flights?

190
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,690
Are you challenging my limits?

191
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,920
I've evaluated this schedule.

192
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,450
I can guarantee that

193
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,120
you can sleep for ten hours every day.

194
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,390
The remaining two rest days

195
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,980
are for you to do a safety report

196
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,910
and make a record of each flight.

197
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,620
Don’t miss a single detail.

198
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,300
No problem.

199
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,010
As long as I can fly,

200
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,310
I can take anything.

201
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
I must make up for

202
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,600
all the time I've missed

203
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,200
while I was at the Ground Handling Department.

204
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,360
This time,

205
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,950
I’ve arranged different captains for you.

206
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,150
Learn to adapt and cooperate with them.

207
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,100
They are all your spies.

208
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,310
If you make any mistake,

209
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
you will be suspended immediately.

210
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,540
Cheng Xiao,

211
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,400
I hope you can become a mature captain

212
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,460
as soon as possible

213
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,060
to prove to everyone that

214
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:46,550
a female pilot can also be outstanding.

215
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,830
You were disapproving of me before,

216
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,960
so I had to do my best.

217
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,240
Now that you think highly of me,

218
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,010
I want to do even better.

219
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,370
President Xu.

220
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:15,760
I know.

221
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,740
I'll be right there.

222

Let go!

224
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,650
What's going on?

225
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,670
Hello, passenger.

226
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,530
The PR department put in a lot of effort

227
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,490
to clarify the facts of the matter.

228
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,580
The video was finally deleted.

229
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,250
But the bad impact it made

230
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,900
cannot be retracted.

231
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,710
I'm sorry, President Xu.

232
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,790
I have caused trouble for the company.

233
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,540
I mishandled

234
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:19,850
this matter.

235
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,070
Your position as Deputy Director of the Flight Department

236
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,200
will be suspended.

237
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,780
Your position as a pilot instructor remains

238
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,180
and your flight schedule

239
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,770
will continue as usual.

240
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,010
Before the official internal investigation results come out,

241
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:51,770
Mr. Jiang,

242
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,500
you’ll take over all the work for now.

243
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,119
Brother-in-law.

244
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,420
Are you done with the meeting?

245
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,349
Why are you here?

246
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,450
Mum made canned food for you.

247
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:23,490
She knows you like it,

248
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,319
so she asked me to bring them here for you

249
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,050
at the earliest possible time.

250
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,400
I'm so lucky.

251
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,790
Brother-in-law,

252
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:32,220
I heard

253
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,560
Mr. Gu's incident at the departure gate

254
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,130
has gone viral online.

255
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:39,240
Everyone in the Flight Department

256
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,960
supports Mr. Gu unanimously.

257
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,760
Get down.

258
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,760
Hold yourself properly.

259
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,250
It's okay for you to listen to these things,

260
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,380
but don't make statements about them.

261
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,970
President Xu just announced that

262
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,930
Gu Nanting will no longer be the Deputy Director of the Flight Department.

263
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,570
Just...

264
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,190
Just like that?

265
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,870
Don't be a busybody in the future.

266
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,800
And my mother-in-law's cooking skills

267
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,040
are really amazing.

268
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:22,030

00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,140
Please open the door.

273
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,520
There's no flight tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

274
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,600
I've checked.

275
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:54,890
How is it?

276
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,250
Do you feel more relaxed?

277
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,580
Deputy Director isn't a big deal.

278
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,570
You...

279
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,400
are not suitable to be an official.

280
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,010
Why did you want to learn to fly?

281
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,730
I don't think we've talked about this.

282
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,560
One time, I broached the topic

283
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,840
but you didn't want to talk about it.

284
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,970
I never asked again.

285
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,680
Afterwards,

286
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,730
I found out about your family.

287
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,390
I had my guesses.

288
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,780
I'm more vulgar than you.

289
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,090
When I was young,

290
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,680
I thought it was cool.

291
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,220
A pilot is a decent man.

292
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,050
But then I became one of the maintenance personnel,

293
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:57,180
I found that I felt very accomplished.

294
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,050
But now I think more.

295
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,020
I want to train my team,

296
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,920
and improve the system as well as the concept.

297
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,050
Aren't you the same?

298
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,510
At first,

299
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,280
I just wanted to be the best observer,

300
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,640
the best first officer,

301
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,860
and the best captain.

302
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,320
I achieved all that.

303
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,080
One person is far from enough.

304
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
This industry

305
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,350
needs many excellent captains,

306
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,720
and it needs batch after batch of them,

307
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,890
so that the legacy can be passed down.

308
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,330
A person's ability is limited after all.

309
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,460
But systems are different.

310
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,840
An excellent system

311
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,540
can help develop more pilots,

312
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,050
and quicker.

313
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,510
So in the past two years,

314
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,030
you've been working hard on the manual.

315
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,370
Now that I'm suspended,

316
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,590
I can't do anything anymore.

317
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,780
I find

318
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,630
I'm getting farther away from my goal.

319
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,100
Do you know

320
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,120
why I laughed?

321
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,300
You don't care about your position,

322
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,030
but you neglect the importance of your position.

323
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,600
It can help you realize your ambition.

324
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,470
You can only advance

325
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,490
on this path.

326
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:42,560
Being suspended may not be a bad thing.

327
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,300
You

328
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,130
push yourself too hard.

329
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,520
Sometimes you need to feel relieved.

330
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,610
I can't relax.

331
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,010
Don't drink so much.

332
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,680
Do you still think you're a college student?

333
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,310
Defend him.

334
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,020
Defence!

335
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,050
Let's go.

336
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,600
This way.

337
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,130
This way.

338
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,010
Catch the ball.

339
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:31,910
Thank you.

340
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,700
Are you Gu Nanting?

341
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:40,060
I've heard a lot about you from my brother.

342
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,470
This is my cousin, Luo Yi.

343

-Cheers. Cheers.

348
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,050
I didn’t make it to being a pilot,

349
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,870
but you helped me realize this wish.

350
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,650
I didn't learn to fly for you.

351
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,610
I did it for Nanting.

352
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,030
Are you already

353
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,390
siding with others now?

354
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:35,790
What do you mean?

355
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,630
So you've always treated me as an outsider.

356
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,450
Of course.

357
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,370
No, you...

358
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,790
Hello.

359
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,140
Did you receive the gift?

360
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,270
Yes, I did.

361
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,710
It's sunbathing on the balcony.

362
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,880
How is it? Isn't it beautiful?

363
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
From now on,

364
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:21,180
our house must be full of green plants.

365
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,120
Are you in our bedroom now?

366
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,400
Is it done renovating? Show me.

367
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,080
The bedroom is almost done.

368
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,080
But the living room is not ready yet.

369
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:31,840
See it for yourself when you come back.

370
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,280
I want to go back soon.

371
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,650
We'll be done in a month.

372
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,260
But I need to go on a solo flight

373
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,230
before I can come back.

374
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,480
It will be recorded in our graduation results.

375
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
I'm a little nervous.

376
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,000
I'll apply for annual leave to accompany you.

377
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,490
Really?

378
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Let me give you a kiss.

379
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,590
Got it!

380
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,150
You are now the youngest first officer

381
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,820
at Luzhou Airlines.

382
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,680
I don't know how long it'll take for me

383
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,880
to catch up with you.

384
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,170
Don't worry.

385
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,770
I've filled up  Luzhou Airlines' traineeship application

386
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,800
for you.

387
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,010
I asked my master to guide you.

388
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,870
You'll make great progress.

389
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,340
Are you nervous about the solo flight tomorrow?

390
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:29,220
As long as I know you're down here for me,

391
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,660
I'm not nervous at all.

392
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,340
I made the flight path for you.

393
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:36,170
We must take a picture together.

394
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,080
Yes, madam.

395
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,010
It's too low.

396
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:59,350
The results of the investigation into the cause of the accident have been announced.

397
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:01,550
It was the pilot who violated the rules.

398
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,730
The plane flew too low

399
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,150
and encountered sudden air turbulence over the sea.

400
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,590
She operated improperly

401
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,300
and pulled the rod quickly, causing the plane to stall.

402
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,600
Although she made a dive to try to recover from the stall,

403
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,000
it was too late.

404
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,790
Gu, I'm very sorry.

405
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:32,210
I'm sorry for your loss.

406
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,280
Where is my sister?

407
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,090
Where is my sister?

408
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,210
Where is my sister?

409
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,410
Where is my sister?

410
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,510
Calm down.

411
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:54,790
Where is my sister?

412
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,900
It's not his fault.

413
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,960
Where is my sister?

414
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:14,850
Yi had always been meticulous and reliable.

415
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:16,220
I don't understand

416
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,720
why she did that.

417
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,430
I asked all the teachers and students in the aviation school.

418
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,440
She had never had any safety problems.

419
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,350
Never.

420
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,350
I finally figured it out in the end.

421
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,440
It was because of me.

422
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,180
Yi wanted to prove to me

423
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,870
that she was flying very well,

424
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,790
and that she would catch up with me soon.

425
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,690
If I hadn’t been there,

426
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,060
if I hadn't agreed to her changing the flight path,

427
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,230
she wouldn’t have died.

428
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
It's all my fault.

429
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,640
Yi has been gone for so many years,

430
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,740
you should let it go.

431
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,280
I swore

432
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:15,930
that from then on,

433
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,570
every pilot in every flight

434
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:19,240
must follow the rules strictly.

435
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,280
And that our rules and regulations

436
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,610
must be flawless.

437
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,260
I spent all my efforts

438
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,390
on establishing this system of rules.

439
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,640
I planned to bring it up this year.

440
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:27,900
But-

441
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,640
But now...

442
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,360
Your efforts

443
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,380
will not be wasted.

444
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,090
Thank you, master.

445
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,389
I'm better now.

446
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
Brother Nanting.

447
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,480
Are you... okay?

448
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,770
What is this?

449
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:12,700
I made this especially for you.

450
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,700
It's a motivation-boosting bento.

451
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,170
If you have the time to cook,

452
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,460
why don't you organize one more page of the security records?

453
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,990
I'll do that when I get back.

454
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,170
Although I’m no longer

455
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,680
the Deputy Director of the Flight Department,

456
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,960
I will not give up

457
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,610
my plans for the safety program.

458
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,070
I'll still need your help.

459
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,190
I'll pay you monthly.

460
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,290
No.

461
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,210
How can I take your money?

462
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,350
I've been learning from you all along,

463
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,950
but I didn't pay you tuition.

464
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,150
Brother Nanting,

465
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,830
just let me know.

466
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,580
I'm at your command.

467
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,110
Thank you.

468
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,200
Captain Cheng has come back to life!

469
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,900
It’s been a long time, cappuccino.

470
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,600
What?

471
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,120
Has your financial crisis been resolved?

472
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,070
Not yet.

473
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,400
I have to wait until I get promoted to the first officer.

474
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,700
But I'm happy today,

475
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,510
so I'll splurge a little.

476
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,240
I'm going to explode with happiness.

477
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:36,880
Explode?

478
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,740
Look at you.

479
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,490
You're almost like my old self.

480
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,680
How have you been recently?

481
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,000
Let's not even talk about it.

482
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,160
The high-altitude environment is so bad for me.

483
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,230
I'm still poor,

484
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,720
and I'm losing my hair.

485
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,240
You fly so much,

486
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,750
you must have earned quite a bit in bonuses.

487
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,970
No.

488
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,880
The bonus during my traineeship was measly.

489
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,290
Who would have thought that my cosmetics

490
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,090
would cost me a thousand a month?

491
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,060
People like me,

492
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,690
I'm afraid the passengers will be scared if I don't put on makeup.

493
00:37:06,690 --> 00:37:07,460
Nonsense.

494
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,630
Where did you get so many samples?

495
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,070
Fortunately, I'm close with the salespeople,

496
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,450
so I get lots of freebies.

497
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:16,140
I

498
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,050
live on these.

499
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,520
Okay, that's about it.

500
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:25,600
I'm flying to Tianjin today.

501
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,410
Let's go.

502
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,940
I'm flying to Seoul today.

503
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,470
Let's go.

504
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,590
Let's go.

505
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,860
How is this color?

506
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,630
[Seoul Incheon Airport]

507
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:41,850
Captain.

508
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,110
The 42 tons of fuel has been added.

509
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,560
I just found out there was a mistake

510
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,560
in the unit of measurement in Seoul.

511
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,040
But it has been fixed.

512
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,330
Cheng did a good job.

513
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,240
All data

514
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,300
have to be cross-checked and confirmed again.

515
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,480
I'll send this safety information

516
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:04,860
to Brother Nanting.

517
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:06,340
Although he was suspended,

518
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,900
he still

519
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:08,760
cares a lot about our operational safety.

520
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,760
He was suspended?

521
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Don't you know that?

522
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,620
Brother Nanting is no longer

523
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,220
the Deputy Director of the Flight Department.

524
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,190
Why?

525
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:18,590
The video of the confrontation

526
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,210
between Nanting and the passenger who splashed water on you

527
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:22,410
was uploaded online.

528
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,830
President Xu saw it.

529
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,730
But that wasn't Mr. Gu's fault,

530
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,480
the passenger was in the wrong.

531
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,340
Wasn’t he in custody?

532
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,940
Why does Mr. Gu have to take the blame for him?

533
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:36,740
The company will conduct an internal investigation.

534
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,030
Did he go home after work?

535
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,840
Have you seen him get off work before 8 p.m.?

536
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,760
He's still not answering the phone.

537
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,380
He is usually

538
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,040
so sensitive to everything.

539
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,660
How could he not hear the phone?

540
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,610
Where did he go?

541
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,920
Brother Nanting

542
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,600
doesn't usually socialize.

543
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,930
He's always so tense.

544
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,960
This is such a heavy blow,

545
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,840
will it break him?

546
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,120
No way.

547
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,380
I checked in on him this morning. Everything is normal.

548
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,810
He must be pretending.

549
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,630
The calmer he looks, the more frustrated he is.

550
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,780
Is he in trouble?

551
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,330
I know where he is. Let's go.

552
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:48,950
Xiao,

553
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,310
you go find Brother Nanting.

554
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,120
I'll die if I don't go home now.

555
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,270
[Yue]

556
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,250
Fine, I'll go.

557
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,720
Yue.

558
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,290
I just landed.

559
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,540
I'm going home now.

560
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:05,650
I’m already in the elevator.

561
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,700
Instructor Gu!

562
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,650
Stop!

563
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,330
Don't run, Gu Nanting!

564
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,680
Don't you know wasting is shameful?

565
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,120
I didn't waste it.

566
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,590
I just watered the soil.

567
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,870
20 kilometers?

568
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,310
Are you okay?

569
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,170
Why are you looking for me?

570
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,590
I know

571
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,000
you were suspended

572
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,220
because of me.

573
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,600
It's not because of you.

574
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:48,010
I would have done the same for the others.

575
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,460
Fine.

576
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:52,800
But

577
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,420
you did help me.

578
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,590
I just want to tell you

579
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:00,170
to stop torturing yourself.

580
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:05,280
I'm joining a half marathon next month.

581
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,340
I'm just training.

582
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,960
You're always like this.

583
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,360
You keep everything to yourself.

584
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,090
You'll get an internal injury if you keep this up.

585
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,640
Have you been flying too little recently?

586
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,680
I'm here to check in on you

587
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,410
after getting off my flight.

588
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,260
The flight data for every flight,

589
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,490
from take off to landing,

590
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,020
must be recorded down to the last detail.

591
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,350
Send it to me for review after you're done.

592
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,080
I was kind enough to check in on you, but you're so ungrateful.

593
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:34,200
It's the biggest consolation to me

594
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:35,370
if you can fly well.
