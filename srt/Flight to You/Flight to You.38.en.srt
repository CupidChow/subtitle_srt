00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:59,410
Do you remember Mr. Zhao, the Platinum Card Passenger?

177
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,690
Mr. Zhao's wife

178
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,820
came to our company directly

179
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,080
to complain about you.

180
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:03,730
No.

181
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,740
He told me he's not married.

182
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,670
Is it your concern

183
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,930
whether our passenger is married or not?

184
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,640
What do you take our In-flight Service Department for?

185
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,340
What do you take our job for?

186
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,690
Sorry, Mr. Ai.

187
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,800
I was too impulsive.

188
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,770
I will reflect on myself.

189
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,700
Not only that.

190
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,190
I've checked the phone number

191
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,420
you left for Mr. Zhao.

192
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,420
There was a false rumor that was spread

193
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,530
on the company forum

194
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,410
regarding Captain Cheng,

195
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:43,330
and this phone number matches the number that account was registered with.

196
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,160
It matches investigation report

197
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,760
from the IT department.

198
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,830
The number is the same.

199
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,770
Everyone

200
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,120
should be responsible for their actions.

201
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,390
No matter how professional she is,

202
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:09,830
but if their professional cultivation and values have issues,

203
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:12,630
us Luzhou Airlines don't welcome such employees.

204
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,230
The In-flight Service Department has made a decision

205
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,560
to terminate the labor contract with you.

206
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,920
Please submit your boarding certificate

207
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,720
and do up the paper work for leaving the company at the HR department.

208
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,270
Eat this.

209
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
The calories are low.

210
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,680
Thank you.

211
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,810
You are...

212
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,790
I'm Qiao Zhengyu from the Ground Handling Deparment.

213
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,320
You probably seldom see me.

214
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,490
I'm Li Yuheng from the In-flight Service Department.

215
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,730
Nice to meet you.

216
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,440
Why isn't the star of today's event here yet?

217
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,750
I think he's here.

218
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,680
You haven't told me yet,

219
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,810
whose party is this?

220
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,690
So mysterious?

221
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,670
A colleague. You know him well.

222
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,560
Let's see who's here.

223
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,500
Cheng Xiao is here.

224
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,710
Cheng Xiao. Xiao.

225
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,750
You are the star today.

226
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,100
Why?

227
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,620
What happened?

228
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,670
Since your solo flight till now,

229
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:29,870
you have accumulated

230
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,470
4,350 hours of flight hours,

231
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,630
and accumulated 3,200 hours of experience.

232
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,910
The total flight distance

233
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,710
is over 3.5 million kilometers.

234
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,490
Brother Nanting.

235
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,300
Open it.

[Promotion Notice]

238
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,450
Cheng Xiao,

239
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,520
with the company's approval,

240
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,830
from tomorrow onwards,

241
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,060
you will officially

242
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,300
be a captain of Luzhou Airlines.

243
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,140
Captain Cheng.

244
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,700
From now on,

245
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,520
you have to shoulder the biggest responsibility

246
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,230
and become the brain of the whole team

247
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,310
and lead every member

248
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,930
to act and think as a whole

249
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,610
and complete every safe flight.

250
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,690
Got it, Instructor Gu.

251
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,050
Here.

252
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,150
To Captain Cheng.

253
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,000
To Captain Cheng.

254
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,490
Thank you, everyone.

255
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:51,880
Thank you.

256
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,380
Captain Gu.

257
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,270
By the way,

258
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,810
I have something for you.

259
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,790
A gift?

260
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,870
My goodness.

261
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,230
Put it on.

262
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,330
What are you waiting for? Put it on.

263
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,050
Yes.

264
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,800
Put it on.

265
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,730
Put it on.

266
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,430
What does the fourth bar mean?

267
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
Responsibility.

268
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,040
Professionalism, knowledge, technology,

269
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
responsibility.

270
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,740
Without the support of the last responsibility,

271
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:48,520
no matter how professional, knowledgeable and technologically-savvy you are,

272
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,450
is meaningless.

273
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,940
Choosing to fly,

274
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:55,190
also means choosing a lifelong responsibility.

275
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,450
I will never forget it.

276
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,380
Captain Cheng.

277
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,050
The cabin gate is closed.

278
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,360
The cockpit is ready.

279
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
Request to slide out.

280
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:18,570
Captain Cheng.

281
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,570
Have a safe flight.

282
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,480
Have a safe flight.

283
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:45,040
Why is it taking so long to try on a wedding dress?

284
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,570
What's the rush?

285
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,460
From your relationship to marriage,

286
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
is even faster than a plane's speed.

287
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,220
Are you sure you didn't plan this beforehand.

288
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,640
You even bought a wedding car.

289
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,000
This is not premeditated.

290
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,680
I made an order

291
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,380
on ARCFOX's mobile app a few day back.

292
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,710
It's the same model as Brother Nanting's.

293
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:02,890
At this rate,

294
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,060
I might become a godmother next year.

295
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,990
No.

296
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,510
Xia said she wants to fly for a few more years.

297
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,970
She wants to fly with you for a few more years.

298
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,020
The bride has been changed.

299
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,310
What are you waiting for?

300
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,340
It's so beautiful.

301
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,520
So beautiful.

302
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:28,260
Of course.

303
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,400
My waist shaper is killing me.

304
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,360
I don't want to try on anything else.

305
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,620
Let's go with this one.

306
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,860
Looks like your diet is a success.

307
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,720
Right?

308
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,590
Look at my collarbone. Is it obvious?

309
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,850
I want to swim up there.

310
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,270
Yuheng's outfit looks nice too.

311
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:45,450
I regret not being a bridesmaid.

312
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,240
I shouldn't have taken your bridesmaid's position.

313
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,350
But Xia Xia said

314
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,350
you might be involved in

315
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,120
the Domestically-Produced Large Passenger Aircraft project.

316
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:53,800
That's right.

317
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,400
What if you have to

318
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,000
be involved in the modification training?

319
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,060
Are you kidding me?

320
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
I would escape

321
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,600
just to attend your wedding.

322
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,990
Xiao, has this thing been fixed?

323
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,380
Nanting has been involved in

324
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,950
the modification of D191.

325
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,470
The company is also having a meeting now.

326
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,410
It should be announced soon.

327
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,260
I also want to fly D191.

328
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,180
Is it too late to sign up now?

329
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,160
Song Xiaoni,

330
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,760
I'm not getting married.

331
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,320
I'm not going to fly, I'm not going to fly.

332
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,780
I'll focus on our wedding.

333
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,350
Look at the mirror.

334
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,350
Xiao, take a photo for us.

335
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,410
That's all

336
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,840
for the two domestic planes

337
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,990
the company have ordered,

338
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,600
D191's specifications.

339
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:46,940
I also made a special trip to Comac

340
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,000
to check the assembly and simulator.

341
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,640
It was spectacular,

342
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,420
and they are also very strict.

343
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,210
Regarding the safety of D191,

344
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,030
we have a detailed report from the Maintenance Department.

345
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,230
I can responsibly say

346
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,800
our domestic planes

347
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,140
definitely do not lose to

348
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,200
Airbus and Boeing in terms of safety.

349
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,110
What about the Flight Department's evaluation.

350
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,370
In the last two months,

351
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,580
the Flight Department, including me,

352
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,640
three instructors

353
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,030
have participated in

354
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,320
theory and simulator training for D191.

355
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:19,550
I also participated in the test flight last week.

356
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,870
D191's control and stability

357
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:23,840
are way higher than we expected.

358
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,400
I think

359
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,800
we can completely trust

360
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,000
the quality control standard of Comac.

361
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,780
Who would've thought.

362
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,170
In 19500,

363
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:33,390
China Civil Aviation has just started.

364
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:36,070
There are only 30 small passenger aircraft in the country.

365
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,990
Now,

366
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:38,960
although there are more than 5,000 planes,

367
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,820
were almost destroyed by air passengers and Boyin.

368
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,070
Now,

369
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,750
we can finally

370
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
fly our own plane.

371
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:47,170
Yes.

372
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,700
D191, as the first aircraft

373
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,600
independently developed by our country,

374
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,540
means a lot to our industry.

375
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,640
It represents the efforts and persistence

376
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,320
of several generations of our industry.

377
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,390
I hope Luzhou Airlines

378
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,120
can inherit this spirit.

379
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:04,900
I believe

380
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:06,560
there will be more Chinese pilots

381
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,220
and more domestic planes

382
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,630
to accompany our people on their journey.

383
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,560
Mr. Gu, Mr. Liang,

384
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,120
you must select

385
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,010
the best team members

386
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,040
to join in the modification training

387
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,840
for D191's first flight.

388
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,120
We must lead the major airline companies.

389
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,620
Okay?

390
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,270
Got it, President Xu.

391
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,250
Nanting.

392
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,930
You will be the captain

393
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,570
for the first flight.

394
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,020
I'll do my best.

395
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,550
Wish you success.

396
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,360
Why are you shopping alone?

397
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,620
Do you need my company?

398
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,880
It's okay.

399
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,780
My friend asked me out today.

400
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,020
Go spend your time with Song Song.

401
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,610
Li Yuheng?

402
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,010
Do you remember me? My name is...

403
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,940
Qiao Zhengyu, from the Ground Handling Department.

404
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,040
You like shampoo too?

405
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,690
Have you decided which movie to watch?

406
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,480
I'm just passing by. I haven't decided yet.

407
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,489
What about you?

408
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,420
I'm on leave today.

409
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,429
I'm out for a walk

410
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,230
and see if there's anything new.

411
00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:53,530
Should we... watch together?

412
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,210
I didn't even ask you

413
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,770
if you have any plans later on.

414
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:00,720
Maybe next time.

415
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,770
No problem.

416
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,570
I'm free today anyway.

417
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,470
Let's take a look.

418
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,670
Okay.

419
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,030
Let me take a call.

420
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,710
Okay.

421
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:18,940
Hello.

422
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,370
Seven o'clock?

423
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,520
No problem. I can do it.

424
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,310
Sorry.

425
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,620
I had a last minute shift change.

426
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,220
I understand.

427
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,380
The holiday is coming,

428
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,140
the company must be short-handed.

429
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,340
Get back to work then.

430
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,190
Okay.

431
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,520
I'll treat you next time.

432
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:57,670
Okay.

433
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,010
Bye.

434
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,660
Sorry to keep you waiting.

435
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,890
You don't have to wait for me in the company.

436
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:33,750
I saw the notice

437
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,440
regarding the domestic planes.

438
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,770
Has the captain for the first flight been decided? Is it you?

439
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,890
The company has decided

440
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,000
to select crew members of D191

441
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,960
for the transition training.

442
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,690
I'll sign up.

443
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:47,250
I want to be the co-pilot of the first flight.

444
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,520
You can register for the transition training.

445
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,360
As for the rest,

446
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,770
depends on your modified training results

447
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:54,430
before a decision can be made.

448
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:59,120
Do you know what I like the most about you?

449
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,600
You won't do anything

450
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,960
or change your principles,

451
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
for favors.

452
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:07,200
Don't worry.

453
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,620
Everything will depend on the training results.

454
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,690
I will become the

455
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,780
as the co-driver of the first flight.

456
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,590
Let's have dinner together tonight.

457
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:19,990
Sure. Where are we going?

458
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,310
How about my mom's place?

459
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,330
Meeting parents already?

460
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,090
So soon?

461
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,450
Next time, then?

462
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:37,790
I'm kidding.

463
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,970
I want to meet Aunt Qin so bad.

464
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,370
I know she wants to see me too.

465
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,410
How did you know?

466
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,560
It's a secret.

467
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,380
Let's go. Let's go to the supermarket first.

468
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,210
Let's go to the fruit shop first.

469
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,060
Kick it to me

470
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,130
Nanting.

471
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,360
You're playing Go so late at night.

472
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,290
You brought your girlfriend back?

473
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,410
Mom.

474
00:38:16,810 --> 00:38:17,510
This is...

475
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,580
Cheng Xiao.

476
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,650
Mrs. Qin.

477
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,210
Hello, welcome.

478
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,440
He said we are coming to meet you very suddenly

479
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,000
so I didn't prepare a gift for you.

480
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,320
But I heard you like mangosteens,

481
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,980
so I bought some mangosteens.

482
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,450
You're too polite.

483
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,700
There's no need to prepare a gift.

484
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,030
You just have to bring yourself.

485
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,690
Wash your hands and let's eat.

486
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,830
Okay, that way.

487
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,680
What's with you?

488
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,520
Some time ago,

489
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,840
I asked you to bring her home.

490
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,300
You were always hesitant.

491
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,060
You suddenly attacked me today.

492
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,350
and now I'm caught off guard.

493
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:46,790
Look how hasty this is.

494
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,300
Mom, you call this a hasty? There are so many dishes.

495
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,630
It's all food delivery.

496
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,200
It's the same.

497
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,360
-Come on.
-Have a seat.

498
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,960
Have a seat.

499
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,580
Auntie,

500
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,240
we've met before.

501
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,170
Do you remember?

502
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,120
Yes.

503
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,870
You were the only female pilot

504
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,760
when I went to Xi'an for D191's plane.

505
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,160
I have a deep impression.

506
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,290
But you look prettier in casual clothes.

507
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,980
By the way, I have good news.

508
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,030
Luzhou Airlines bought two D191.

509
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,940
Nanting is the captain of the first flight.

510
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:25,400
I signed up for the transition training too.

511
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,030
Why didn't you tell me

512
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,930
such a good thing first minute?

513
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,360
But it's good. I'm happy.

514
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,280
I'm waiting to see you two flying domestically-produced large passenger aircraft.

515
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:37,620
Mom,

516
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,740
I also participated in D191's test flight.

517
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,850
It's excellent in all aspects.

518
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,080
All right.

519
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,130
Now that I've seen a domestic large passenger aircraft in the market,

520
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,470
someone will persuade me to retire.

521
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,850
When new model comes out,

522
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:59,390
I'm sure some people can't stay idle anyway.

523
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,320
Alright. Cheng Xiao must be hungry.

524
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:03,450
I'm fine, I'm fine.

525
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,570
Auntie, your cooking is amazing.

526
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:06,820
Of course.

527
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,820
I've never had these dishes before.

528
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,190
You're here,

529
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,320
that's why she made it specially for you. Eat more.

530
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,280
Here, have some.

531
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,330
To be honest,

532
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,660
it was in too much of a rush today,

533
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,180
so I ordered takeout.

534
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:20,890
It's my first time.

535
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,120
It's fine, it's fine.

536
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,650
I'll cook for you next time.

537
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:35,040
[4 months later, D191's transition training]

538
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:48,530
[Luzhou Airlines]

539
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,850
How is it?

540
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,810
From the simulator to the actual thing,

541
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,700
this big plane

542
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,450
is as good as Boyin.

543
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,350
It might be new on the scene,

544
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,880
but it's quite formidable.

545
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,560
But many people are skeptical,

546
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,890
saying many of its parts were made abroad.

547
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,480
For a domestic plane

548
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,040
to be able to incorporate and assemble

549
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,320
all of these systems and parts

550
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,360
to form a perfect match

551
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,800
is already a huge step forward.

552
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,050
Besides, Ni Zhan told me that

553
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:38,960
within three years,

554
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,540
the next generation of the D191

555
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,980
will be equipped with a fully domestically-developed engine.

556
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,040
Moreover, the turbo blades

557
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,240
has passed the vibration fatigue test.

558
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:47,970
That's so cool.

559
00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:49,530
Our big plane

560
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,290
can finally have a domestically-made heart.

561
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,120
By the way,

562
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:56,270
according to the pilot transition training results,

563
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,560
you have qualified to act as the co-pilot for the maiden flight.

564
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,830
When did the results come out?

565
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,630
This morning.

566
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,610
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

567
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,030
Mr. Gu.

568
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,290
Tell me the truth.

569
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,980
Did you fudge the results?

570
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,720
You have to believe in yourself.

571
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:14,920
You have the ability,

572
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,820
you deserve it.

573
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,200
I know that.

574
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,320
The maiden flight will return to Beijing in seven days.

575
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,980
That day

576
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,290
is also the 17th anniversary of the establishment of Luzhou Airlines.

577
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:28,040
Did you know?

578
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,100
When you told me

579
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:32,070
the company wanted to buy a domestic big plane,

580
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:33,170
I was thinking that

581
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,840
during its first flight,

582
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,310
you will sit on the left,

583
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:37,690
and I'll sit on the right.

584
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,960
We will carry a plane full of eager passengers

585
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,710
from all walks of life,

586
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:43,610
and let them experience for themselves

587
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:44,650
that our plane

588
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,950
is the best plane.

589
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,380
That our pilots

590
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,830
are the best pilots.
