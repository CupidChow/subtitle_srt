[Letter of Resignation]

7
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,610
What a coincidence.

8
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,190
I was looking for you.

9
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,060
Brother Nanting, did you want to see me?

10
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:25,800
Have a seat.

11
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,570
Brother Nanting.

12
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,190
Is the company too strict with Xiao?

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,880
Her assessment is better than ours.

14
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,940
Why is she demoted?

15
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,210
I have a question.

16
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
Have you come up here before?

17
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,150
A pilot

18
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,410
must have a lot of pressure.

19
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,220
I used to

20
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,070
sneak here to smoke.

21
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,329
After that,

22
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,460
I was old and wanted to fly for a few more years.

23
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
I decided to quit smoking

24
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,760
at here too.

25
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,160
Mr. Xie.

26
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:33,960
Anything

27
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,350
I can help you with?

28
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,840
Do you want to resign?

29
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,100
Every airline company

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,130
costs a lot to train pilots.

31
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,390
It's not easy to resign.

32
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,720
You need to compensate the company.

33
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:53,980
I know.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,060
So I can only talk to Mr. Jiang

35
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,510
and beg the company to spare me.

36
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,970
Cai came to me when he retired.

37
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,510
He asked me to take care of you.

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,320
I've trained many students.

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,730
Gu Nanting is the best.

40
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,040
With such good disciple,

41
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,529
I always bragged to Cai

42
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,320
and pissed him off.

43
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,470
One day,

44
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,470
Cai also straightened himself

45
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,920
and bragged in front of me.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,450
He said he found a pilot with great potential.

47
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,140
It's you.

48
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,600
I've been following you for a long time.

49
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,260
I know many of your strengths.

50
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,750
Compared to you and Cai,

51
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,100
I've got a long way to go.

52
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,560
Don't be too modest first.

53
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,460
I haven't told you about your shortcomings yet. There's a lot too.

54
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,409
I'm trying to correct it.

55
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,570
So

56
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,040
you also agree to be punished when you have mistakes.

57
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,720
It's fine to be punished.

58
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,840
But Gu Nanting

59
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,320
is unreasonable.

60
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,240
He said one thing but did another.

61
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,300
I'm not convinced.

62
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,520
It may not be what you think.

63
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,680
Is it because of the video?

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,120
You got it wrong.

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,580
She didn't send the video.

66
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,550
Then who?

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,890
If I can ask the person who sent the video

68
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,810
to clarify,

69
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,530
does Xiao no longer need to be demoted?

70
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,270
Both of them need to be demoted.

71
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,940
It's my fault to start the competition.

72
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,650
But I didn't send the video.

73
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,340
Mr. Xie.

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,080
Will the person who sent the video

75
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,010
also be demoted?

76
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,350
What?

77
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,510
Do you want to take the blame for others?

78
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,640
I'll be punished anyway.

79
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,150
It's better to get one less involved.

80
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,409
You've implicated more than one person.

81
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,800
In order to protect you,

82
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,800
Nanting has initiated to bear the punishment

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,530
and take full responsibility.

84
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,940
He...

85
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,450
He was the one who made me demoted.

86
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,240
As far as I know,

87
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,030
this is the first punishment of Nanting in Luzhou Airlines.

88
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,230
It's unprecedented.

89
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,630
I'm telling you this

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,410
not to persuade you.

91
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,270
But I hope you can

92
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,770
understand the situation before making a decision.

93
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,720
Hello, Mr. Gu.

94
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,730
Brother Nanting.

95
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,750
Yuheng.

96
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,320
It's hot.

97
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,920
Thank you, Brother Nanting.

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,620
Have a seat.

99
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,260
You've changed a lot after a few months.

100
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,820
But

101
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,700
I'm still a little nervous to practice on the plane.

102
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,230
Also, I'm a little worried.

103
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,230
About what?

104
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,120
I heard from my colleagues

105
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:21,030
some passengers will make things difficult for the flight attendants.

106
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,120
I'm a beginner.

107
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,560
I'm inexperienced.

108
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,330
Which flight will you take next week?

109
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,250
The schedule hasn't come out yet.

110
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,560
I don't know which captain is flying.

111
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,420
I got on a plane last year.

112
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,450
I felt very bumpy.

113
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,170
I was nervous all that time.

114
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,760
Now I'm a flight attendant.

115
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,880
I can't pass these emotions

116
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,940
to the passengers.

117
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,850
The pilots of Luzhou Airlines

118
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,400
have been strictly trained.

119
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Don't worry about their flying skills.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,270
Okay.

121
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,670
Glad to hear that.

122
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,390
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

123
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:57,320
Trust yourself.

124
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,320
I've talked to Cheng Xiao.

125
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,960
As for the result,

126
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,080
it depends on her choice.

127
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,880
No.

128
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,030
I need to contact Shaohui.

129
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:41,909
Hang it up.

130
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:48,030
Why are you responsible for this alone?

131
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,010
I can't escape

132
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,200
from taking the blame for the competition.

133
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,350
It's not necessary

134
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,720
to drag down another person.

135
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,170
What should I do

136
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,140
if Brother Nanting asks me again?

137
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,160
Leave it to me. I'll handle it.

138
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,640
Good news, bad news, which one should we hear first?

139
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,320
Bad news.

140
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,350
Two days before the Spring Festival,

141
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,790
we will have flight missions.

142
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:24,590
We can't celebrate the Spring Festival this time.

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,320
Good news.

144
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,980
We'll take the same flight.

145
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,880
But

146
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,090
the captain is Brother Nanting.

147
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,070
I'm leaving.

148
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,000
I've seen the schedule.

149
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,700
Thank you for taking care of me.

150
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,810
I'll work hard.

151
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,860
Come in.

152
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,200
What's up?

153
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:29,210
Mr. Gu,

154
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,600
I'm responsible for the video.

155
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,700
It has nothing to do with others.

156
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Mr. Xie told me

157
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,490
you were also implicated.

158
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,680
You can put all the blame on me

159
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,160
and punish me.

160
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,860
This matter ends here.

161
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,900
Anything else?

162
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:55,760
No.

163
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,190
Have you received the schedule notice?

164
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:01,250
Yes.

165
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,100
Soon,

166
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,080
I will be promoted again.

167
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,380
Mr. Du.

168
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:54,360
You must leave a five-centimeter gap.

169
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:54,710
Okay.

170
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,800
Five centimeters.

171
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,320
Okay.

172
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,820
Captain Cheng.

173
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,040
You are finally back.

174
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,070
Mr. Sun.

175
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,310
Well,

176
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,800
I have a question.

177
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,940
I wonder if you can pause the work

178
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,750
after the first stage is completed.

179
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,180
What do you mean?

180
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,760
I have some financial problems.

181
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm afraid the payment will be...

182
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:44,980
Okay.

183
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,940
Chinese New Year is coming.

184
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,350
Let them go back and reunite first.

185
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,800
After the Spring Festival, when you're convenient,

186
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,110
I will regather them.

187
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,250
Thank you so much, Mr. Sun.

188
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,210
Mum,

189
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,000
I've prepared dumplings for you on New Year's Eve.

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,860
Did you make them yourself again?

191
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,350
Yes.

192
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,200
How many times have I told you?

193
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,880
I just need to buy the frozen ones in the supermarket.

194
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,210
You're not home. I can eat whatever I want.

195
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,470
It's not the same as mine.

196
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,920
Thank you.

197
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,670
When I land on the first day of the Chinese New Year,

198
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,920
I'll come back to accompany you.

199
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,450
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,800
We don't have holidays.

201
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,780
You know that.

202
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,550
Besides,

203
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm used to spending Chinese New Year alone at home.

204
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,100
Just do your work.

205
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,580
Don't force yourself if you don't have time.

206
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:00,240
Mum.

207
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,000
You

208
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:05,830
don't stress yourself out at work.

209
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:06,890
Just like your dad.

210
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,070
I know

211
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,510
you had many regrets

212
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:26,280
when you applied for civil aviation.

213
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,960
Your dad was an air force pilot.

214
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,220
Your dream was

215
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,610
to be like him.

216
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,580
But you are also a filial child.

217
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,980
You don't want to stay outside for a long time

218
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,690
and leave me alone at home.

219
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,710
I dragged you down.

220
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,030
Mum.

221
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,660
I used to

222
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,000
feel upset.

223
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,900
But I don't think so anymore.

224
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,420
In the era of peace,

225
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,430
being a commercial pilot

226
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,690
is as meaningful as being an air force pilot.

227
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,470
Are we besties?

228
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,080
Why didn't you tell me

229
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,420
you bought a house?

230
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,040
I wanted to give you a surprise.

231
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,220
I didn't expect

232
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,070
there's no surprise now.

233
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,490
Alright.

234
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:28,030
No matter how miserable you are,

235
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,090
you can move in one day with the house.

236
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,070
Besides,

237
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,170
I have a salary.

238
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:34,350
Don't worry.

239
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,240
I can cover our expenses.

240
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,960
No.

241
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,990
I'm moving out

242
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,690
after Chinese New Year.

243
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,030
Did you find a place?

244
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:48,350
What a coincidence.

245
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,780
Yuheng's roommate just moved out.

246
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,880
There was an empty room.

247
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,200
So I booked it.

248
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,510
After thinking about it,

249
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,800
living with our little fairy Yuheng

250
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,120
can get me some fairy aura.

251
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,520
How about you?

252
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:04,990
I'm fine.

253
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,910
Alright.

254
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,640
I wouldn't be so miserable to be tided over by you.

255
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,710
Since you decided not to quit,

256
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,380
you should be happy.

257
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,060
Think about it.

258
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:19,940
It's just three months.

259
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,420
After this period,

260
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,580
you'll be promoted to the first officer again.

261
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,710
That makes sense.

262
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:29,320
Let me tell you something happy.

263
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,650
I checked the schedule.

264
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,110
We will fly together on the first flight.

265
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:34,760
And we can

266
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,840
celebrate the Spring Festival together in the sky.

267
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,900
Isn't it romantic?

268
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,100
Are you happy?

269
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,860
Captain Cheng, welcome aboard.

270
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,070
Welcome aboard.

271
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,700
Welcome aboard.

272
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,630
[Dad]

273
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,090
Alright, Xia.

274
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,030
I'm going back to the flight deck.

275
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,530
OK.

276
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:01,050
Captain Cheng, take care.

277
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:08,940
Dad.

278
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,819
Xiao.

279
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,339
Are you okay?

280
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,240
When will you come back

281
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,500
this Chinese New Year?

282
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:16,849
I...

283
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,569
I can't go back.

284
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,099
After Chinese New Year,

285
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,069
I will make time to go back.

286
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:24,500
It's okay.

287
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,210
Chinese New Year is just a formality.

288
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,210
You can come back

289
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,720
whenever you are free.

290
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,780
Let us have a family gathering.

291
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,180
How are you now?

292
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,180
I'm fine.

293
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,710
Qingdao is very cold now.

294
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,960
How are things over there?

295
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,030
How about this?

296
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,490
You tell the client that

297
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,300
her husband's outshore company

298
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,180
doesn't belong to China.

299
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,820
So these assets

300
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,980
can't be shared by spouses.

301
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,920
Take care of yourself.

302
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,350
That's all. Bye.

303
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,580
Okay.

304
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm hanging up.

305
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,150
Goodbye.

306
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,130
Cheng Xiao, right?

307
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,200
Let me ask you.

308
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,400
When are you going back to Qingdao?

309
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,670
I'm busy recently.

310
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:23,400
I'll hang up if there's nothing else.

311
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,040
Why are you hanging up?

312
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,410
I haven't finished yet.

313
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,600
Listen.

314
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,200
You're asking for trouble.

315
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,210
If you had listened to me and gone to law school,

316
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,020
you would be a lawyer now.

317
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:32,960
But now,

318
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,190
we're always worried about you.

319
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,010
Alright.

320
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,130
Bye, Xiao.

321
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,560
Listen.

322
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,350
It's because you've been spoiling her.

323
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,170
Look at her attitude towards me.

324
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,950
Yes, it's my fault.

325
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,080
Calm down.

326
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,360
Time for your medicine.

327
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,460
Here.

328
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,580
The rent.

329
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,430
Oh my god.

330
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,310
Mr. Landlord.

331
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,120
I should have paid

332
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,740
this quarter's rent last week.

333
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,340
Thank you for your kindness.

334
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,530
I'm sorry.

335
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,540
Recently,

336
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,200
I was hit by a cosmic-level drawback

337
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,490
and met a devil leader.

338
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,310
I'm so broke now.

339
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,500
So, can I

340
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,090
delay my rent payment?

341
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,560
Young people always face difficulties

342
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,420
when they work for their careers.

343
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,120
The rent can be postponed.

344
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,950
Is it enough if we postpone it to three months later?

345
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,720
Good.

346
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,930
You're the best landlord in the world.

347
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,830
I'll treat you next time. What do you want to eat?

348
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,060

how many times have I told you?

373
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,270
It's not that I don't want to spend the Spring Festival with you.

We fly from Luzhou to Sanya.

there will be a weather effect over the Guangzhou area.

The plan shows that there will be mild turbulence.

The security situation is serious during the Spring Festival.

425

includes mixed dumplings and wine-brewed glutinous rice balls.

437

In this way,

438

both passengers from the north and the south

439
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,940
can choose freely.

Why is he still working at the front line?

00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,430
Here's Luzhou 8307.

522
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,790
Please send us maintenance personnel.

523
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,450
Roger that.

524
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,050
What's wrong, Brother Nanting?

525
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,710
The wiper on my side is broken.

526
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,220
It's like a high-speed function failure.

527
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,500
This is a small malfunction.

528
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,360
I suggest you repair it after the return.

529
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,560
A small malfunction?

530
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:54,500
Remind the captain

531
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,870
the aircraft is in accordance with the standards.

532
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:58,630
If we miss the flight time,

533
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,100
we don't know how long the flow control will be delayed.

534
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,230
We have to fix it now.

535
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:03,550
Yes

536
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,980
Brother Nanting is right. We must fix it.

537
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,440
Madam, here's your hot water.

538
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,280
Thank you.

539
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,070
Hello, sir.

540
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,690
This is a cup of hot water you ordered.

541
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:27,330
OK. When can we take off?

542
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,300
I'm really sorry.

543
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,060
We are waiting for the notice.

544
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,280
Ladies and gentlemen,

545
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,130
due to the mechanical failure,

546
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,960
we have no idea about the precise take-off time.

547
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:39,130
Please take a rest and wait patiently on your seat.

548
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,340
If there is any further news,

549
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,230
we will inform you in time.

550
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,320
Regarding the flight can't take off on time,

551
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,680
all crew members...

552
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,810
The plane is broken.

553
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,200
There are always many excuses.

554
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,120
It's Chinese New Year.

555
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,000
My family is waiting for me to join the New Year's Eve dinner.

556
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,720
I'm really sorry.

557
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,840
I'm really sorry, sir.

558
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,400
When can we take off?

559
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:53,980
Sorry.

560
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,510
Ma'am, please take a seat.

561
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,040
I know. I'm really sorry.

562
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,690
I have an emergency.

563
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,040
It's related to life.

564
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,580
How long are you going to delay it?

565
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,370
Please wait patiently, okay?

566
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,030
The flight will be delayed for a while.

567
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,630
Get ready for food delivery.

568
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,410
Watch your step.

569
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,150
Food truck is passing. Watch your step.

570
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,360
Food truck is passing. Watch your step.

571
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,440
Watch your step.

572
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:33,210
Food truck is passing. Watch your step.

573
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,450
Sorry.

574
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,900
Give me a cup of coffee.

575
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:49,720
Okay.

576
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,320
Thank you.

577
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,120
Your name is Li Yuxing,

578
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:01,190
right?

579
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:02,720
It's Yuheng.

580
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,320
Hello, sir.

581
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,650
Do you have an opinion book?

582
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,380
I want to write you a letter of appreciation.

583
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,520
Thank you, sir.

584
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,760
This is what we should do.

585
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,670
My leg cramped when I came here today.

586
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,470
Thanks to you.

587
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:15,990
I should praise you.

588
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
Madam, what would you like to drink?

589
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,240
It's hot.

590
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,570
Here, beauty. Add some for me.

591
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,570
OK. Is it coke?

592
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,190
Yes.

593
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,320
Okay.

594
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,100
Yuheng.

595
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,600
Yuheng.

596
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:14,730
Yuheng.

597
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:17,889
Let's go.

598
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:30,760
What would you like, madam?

599
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,139
Orange juice. Thanks.

600
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,100
Captain, I need to go to the bathroom.

601
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:05,770
Captain,

602
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,730
The wiper is fixed. Please try it.

603
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,130
Okay, no problem. Thank you.

604
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,200
Okay, Captain. Have a safe trip.

605
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,350
Approval for departure. Luzhou 8307.

606
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,070
It's ready.

607
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:24,220
Here's Luzhou 8307.

608
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,640
Line up on the ground.

609
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,990
The departure will be approved in 20 minutes.

610
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:29,320
Copy that. Luzhou 8307.

611
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,080
Yuheng.

612
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,030
What's wrong, Yuheng?

613
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,470
What's wrong, Yuheng?

614
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,400
Why are you crying?

615
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,740
What happened?

616
00:35:58,990 --> 00:35:59,620
Tell me.

617
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:00,930
What happened?

618
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,390
Say something.

619
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,870
48C.

620
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,980
He touched me just now.

621
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,320
He touched you?

622
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,260
Where did he touch?

623
00:36:17,710 --> 00:36:18,360
Where?

624
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,460
He touched my butt.

625
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,850
Let me ask you.

626
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,750
What did you do to my colleague?

627
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,540
What did I do?

628
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,480
This person

629
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,250
sexually harassed our flight attendant

630
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:41,060
in broad daylight.

631
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,850
Sexual harassment?

632
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,130
What nonsense are you talking about?

633
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,050
What nonsense?

634
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
Apologize to her now.

635
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Which eye did you see?

636
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,760
Apologize to whom?

637
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,160
What do I apologize for?

638
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Please calm down.

639
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,790
Xiazhi. What's going on?

640
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,990
He touched Li Yuheng.

641
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,330
Who did I touch? Nonsense!

642
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:56,760
Ms. Ai.

643
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Xiazhi is arguing with a passenger.

644
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,330
You should check it out.

645
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,430
Are you going to apologize or not?

646
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,670
Oh, my God.

647
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:08,500
Apologize or not?

648
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,340
-Who are you pointing at?
-Xiazhi.

649
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:10,330
Put your hands down.

650
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,080
What's wrong?

651
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:11,860
He's a pervert.

652
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,680
Who are you calling a pervert?

653
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,200
Say it again.

654
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,800
You're the pervert.

655
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,730
Sir, I'm the security officer of this flight.

656
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,990
What did you do to our flight attendant?

657
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:18,640
Please answer honestly and cooperate with my investigation.

658
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,200
Otherwise,

659
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,990
you will bear corresponding legal consequences.

660
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:21,540
Ms. Ai.

661
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,930
He just touched Li Yuheng's butt.

662
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,290
Nonsense!

663
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,060
Ask the passengers if any of them saw it.

664
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:30,940
Who saw it?

665
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,360
Do you not dare to admit it?

666
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,120
Please tell us the truth.

667
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,240
What happened just now?

668
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,760
You flight attendant scolded me while pointing at my nose.

669
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,920
You tell me what happened.

670
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,120
You deserve it.

671
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,680
Yes, I'm scolding you, dirtbag!

672
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,320
Say it again.

673
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:40,890
Xiazhi.

674
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:43,990
Sir, please wait a moment.

675
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,720
We'll find out what's going on.

676
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,770
Where is Yuheng?

677
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,140
She is in the back cabin.

678
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,870
Investigate carefully.

679
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,090
It's okay.

680
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,490
Let me ask you.

681
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,780
Did any other witness see it?

682
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,320
Yuheng.

683
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:07,550
He...

684
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,030
Where did he touch?

685
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,260
My butt

686
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,390
and legs.

687
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,590
Go get her coat.

688
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,010
Okay.

689
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,760
Tell him later that

690
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,420
we have kept his fingerprint.

691
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,360
We'll call the police and sue him for sexual harassment.

692
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,620
Unless he apologizes.

693
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,020
But we might not be able to find his fingerprint.

694
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:37,170
We're not really investigating.

695
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:39,730
We just want to scare him and let him confess.

696
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,110
Forget it. I'm afraid he…

697
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,670
How about I report to the captain

698
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,810
and see what he will do.

699
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:48,070
Don't. Ms. Ai, don't tell him.

700
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,790
It's really not good.

701
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,500
Dear, it's okay.

702
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,890
It's inevitable to encounter these

703
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,290
being a flight attendant.

704
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,350
Sometimes you just have to endure it.

705
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,970
If you are harassed,

706
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,630
you can just endure it, right?

707
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:04,770
We're all girls. How could you...

708
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,030
Don't flight attendants have

709
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,360
personal rights?

710
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,230
Look at her, crying terribly.

711
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,290
How can she be fine?

712
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:14,310
Your clothes.

713
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,420
Here, put it on.

714
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:18,880
You just stand there.

715
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,560
Say nothing and do nothing.

716
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,950
Just cooperate with me.

717
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:22,610
Let me do it.

718
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,060
Just now,

719
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,920
I was thinking about

720
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,660
writing a letter of appraisal to flight attendants.

721
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,120
You're truly ungrateful.

722
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,160
Isn't this a scam?

723
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,820
The flight is delayed during the Chinese New Year period.

724
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,110
We don't know when we'll fly.

725
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,070
Isn't this...

726
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,290
We know the situation.

727
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:49,160
What's going on?

728
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,890
Let me tell you what happened.

729
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,380
When your flight attendant

730
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,360
passed by,

731
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,520
she hit my arm.

732
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,660
I haven't come to you yet.

733
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,720
Now you're blaming me.

734
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,840
I want to make a complaint.

735
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,900
Sorry, sir.

736
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:06,930
Our flight attendant

737
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,730
accidentally bumped into you during the service.

738
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,330
This is not within your scope of the complaint.

739
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:12,990
I'll file a complaint against her.

740
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,040
She has a bad service attitude.

741
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,730
What kind of attitude do you need?

742
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,830
Hurry up and call the police.

743
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,550
When the police come,

744
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,090
we'll submit the evidence.

745
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,680
Then we'll know who's right and who's wrong.

746
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,290
Amazing.

747
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,800
Evidence? What evidence?

748
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,730
Show me.

749
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:30,840
I don't believe

750
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,200
you can make things up.

751
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,040
Our flight attendant's skirt is evidence.

752
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:36,670
Your fingerprint is on it.

753
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,870
We've kept it.

754
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,120
Once we get off the plane,

755
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,920
we'll do a judicial evaluation.

756
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:43,710
You'll be arrested then.

757
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:50,240
Frame me?

758
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,720
Frame me?

759
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,890
Since you are so innocent,

760
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,640
let's wait for the police.

761
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,820
Let's go.

762
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,410
Call the police.

763
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,800
You'll be detained.

764
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,240
You're wasting our time.

765
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,200
Well...

766
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,150
My family is waiting for me to celebrate the Spring Festival.

767
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,570
He ran away.

768
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,000
What's going on?

769
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:25,910
Sir.

770
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,040
I need to talk.

771
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,970
Don't call. It's Chinese New Year.

772
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,280
It's already delayed.

773
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,440
If the police come again,

774
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,680
more time is wasted.

775
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,110
Don't call.

776
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,700
Watch your distance, sir.

777
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,230
Can you turn this off?

778
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:42,960
Put down your phone.

779
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,490
Let's have a chat, okay?

780
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,630
Go back to work.

781
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,040
Thank you.

782
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,800
I'll give you a chance

783
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,920
to apologize to my colleague.

784
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,960
Can you put the phone down?

785
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,590
Miss Li.

786
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:12,890
Sorry.

787
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:13,780
Louder.

788
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,120
I can't hear you.

789
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,850
What did you do?

790
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,080
It's okay.

791
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,640
I was careless just now.

792
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,730
By accident?

793
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,070
That's right.

794
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:32,670
I...

795
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,650
I was impulsive just now. I...

796
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,080
I touched

797
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,640
this flight attendant.

798
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:39,800
I'm sorry.

799
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,890
Please tell me what happened.

800
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:45,980
I...

801
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:47,640
Just...

802
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:48,850
Just now,

803
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,080
when these two flight attendants

804
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,120
sent drinks to the passengers,

805
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:53,530
I...

806
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,970
I was impulsive.
