[Episode 36]

4
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,720
Just now...

5
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,259
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,050
My mom...

7
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:48,670
It's okay.

8
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,470
Do you know my dad?

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,509
I saw him last time

10
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,520
when he looked for you.

11
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,640
So,

12
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,130
did you know my mom's condition before?

13
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,000
Uncle told me about it.

14
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,610
He came that time

15
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,500
to ask me

16
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:21,970
to persuade you to leave the pilot position.

17
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,660
I guess

18
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,730
you disagreed.

19
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,240
I have no right to

20
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,770
deprive anyone of passion,

21
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,980
let alone you.

22
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,550
In court,

23
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,010
you said you had something to tell me.

24
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:56,980
Nothing.

25
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,210
I'll tell you later.

26
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:27,990
Mr. Jiang.

27
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,150
Are you free today?

28
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,440
I want to see you.

29
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:09,250
Mr. Jiang.

30
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,770
I didn't expect you to come to see me.

31
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,040
What's your plan for the future?

32
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,530
Maybe I've been flying for too long

33
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,630
and too far.

34
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,670
Sometimes I forget my starting point.

35
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:57,240
My starting point is here.

36
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,690
Twenty years ago,

37
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,470
this place

38
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,840
is just a small airport made by land reclamation.

39
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,300
From our current position

40
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,840
towards that direction,

41
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,980
it was

42
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,710
a very short runway.

43
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,340
This was where I flew solo

44
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,850
for the first time.

45
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,880
I joined the industry when I was 18.

46
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,970
I was also a person

47
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,850
who only loved flying.

48
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,030
Although we have different opinions

49
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,000
in many places,

50
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,560
you two have something I like.

51
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,590
On you,

52
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,159
I can see my old self.

53
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,080
He was a teenager

54
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,070
who only loved flying.

55
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,740
But later,

56
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,030
gradually

57
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,210
I got my air route wrong.

58
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,570
Xie's retirement speech made me ashamed.

59
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,240
We were both from the Hero Team.

60
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,970
Look at him.

61
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,000
He has always kept

62
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,500
the purest faith of a pilot

63
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,220
and never wasted by time.

64
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,810
Today,

65
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm not here

66
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:29,610
to say goodbye.

67
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,320
There are

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,170
about the future development plan

69
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,720
of our Flight Department.

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,390
I've organized and summarized it

71
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,800
for a long time.

72
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,460
It also includes some administrative management experiences.

73
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,820
Didn't you build

74
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,110
a new security system?

75
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,150
I gave some specific suggestions.

76
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,090
It was quite hasty.

77
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,730
If you want,

78
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,450
just take a look.

79
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,140
Nanting.

80
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,410
Actually, I admire you

81
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,860
more than Ni Zhan.

82
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,020
Because I can only see in you

83
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
what I don't have.

84
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,090
But to be honest,

85
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,720
I don't want you to be the vice president of Luzhou Airlines.

86
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,610
You are too kind

87
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,040
and too tough.

88
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,410
Only Ni Zhan

89
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
can make Luzhou Airlines

90
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:24,340
go further in a cruel business rivalry.

91
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,490
But I'm very relieved

92
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:34,800
you are the one who took over the Flight Department at Luzhou Airlines.

93
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,350
Good luck.

94
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,080
Mr. Jiang.

95
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,110
Mr. Jiang.

96
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,540
Captains,

97
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,300
safe flight.

98
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,520
Do you want to extend your leave

99
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,919
and deal with your mother first?

100
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,680
But I don't know

101
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,230
how to deal with it.

102
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,920
Do you remember I told you

103
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,920
that a pilot had a plane crash

104
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,050
on California's seaside?

105
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,010
She is very important to me.

106
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,500
After she left,

107
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,240
I was in a low mood for a long time.

108
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,270
I locked myself at home.

109
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,560
I couldn't even listen to the sound of the plane.

110
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,370
At that time,

111
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,540
I thought I would bid farewell to fly.

112
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,240
Later, my family, friends, and Mr. Xie

113
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,980
came to persuade me.

114
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,950
I also agreed

115
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,350
to receive professional psychological counseling.

116
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,070
About

117
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,140
half a year.

118
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,180
One day, I found

119
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,150
I could sit in the cockpit.

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,400
So regarding auntie's illness,

121
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,200
she should try

122
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,740
professional treatment.

123
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,040
I know

124
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,660
an excellent psychologist.

125
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
He specializes in

126
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,760
post-traumatic stress disorder.

127
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,750
Will it work?

128
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,820
For the sake of you and auntie,

129
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,610
it's worth a try.

130
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,750
Enough.

131
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:01,740
What?

132
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
It's almost done.

133
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,810
After getting old,

134
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,860
hair is less than before.

135
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,530
It'll dry after blowing it for a little while.

136
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,960
You are not old.

137
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,380
I remember when I was in primary school,

138
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,780
you sent me off to school.

139
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:20,090
I sat on the back of your bike,

140
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:22,180
and I saw your hair

141
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,380
waving long and tight.

142
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,230
It was fragrant.

143
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,660
One time, you started too fast

144
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,340
and pushed me out.

145
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
I ran two blocks to catch up with you.

146
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,690
Do you still remember?

147
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,220
After that,

148
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,410
I became a partner in a law firm.

149
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,890
I remember I cut my hair short

150
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,040
at that time.

151
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,900
After that, I never had a long hair

152
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
and never brought you along, right?

153
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,410
All these years,

154
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,060
I've been busy making money.

155
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,610
I didn't fulfill my duty as a mother.

156
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:13,620
Sometimes I always think about

157
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,310
how annoying

158
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,760
I am being a mother.

159
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,740
No.

160
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,670
It's my fault.

161
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,740
I always went against you and made you angry.

162
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,560
I didn't even talk to you properly.

163
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,620
In the past,

164
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,510
I thought you didn't like me

165
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,930
or approve of me.

166
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,650
You liked to control me in your way.

167
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,630
At that time, I chose to learn to fly

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
because I wanted to escape from you.

169
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,890
The more you hate me flying,

170
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,110
the more I want to fly.

171
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,600
And I want you to know

172
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,790
I can do well

173
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,960
and make you acknowledge me.

174
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:06,670
Later,

175
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,200
after flying for a long time,

176
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,070
flying integrated into my life.

177
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,590
I really love it.

178
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,380
I know you want me to live

179
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,630
an ordinary and stable life.

180
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,970
I know

181
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,200
why you want me to give up flying.

182
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,560
Mom,

183
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,830
I know a very good doctor.

184
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,310
Let me go with you.

185
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,620
If it is ineffective,

186
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,070
I promise

187
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,160
I'll give up flying.

188
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,620
I have no problem.

189
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,790
Why should I see a doctor?

190
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,210
[Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Case Analysis]

191
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,640
Xiao. Why are you still up?

192
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,720
Dad,

193
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,960
I'm looking at other cases.

194
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,090
I want to study them.

195
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:04,410
Why are you up?

196
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,190
I'll get some water.

197
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,840
Xiao,

198
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:22,900
I think

199
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,440
you can return to work in these two days.

200
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,750
I'll find a way to take your mother back to Qingdao.

201
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,950
No need to cancel my leave.

202
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,350
I'll take it as a long vacation.

203
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,540
I know you'll be promoted to captain soon.

204
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,730
It's OK.

205
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:39,980
Now,

206
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,170
nothing is more important than my mom's illness.

207
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,970
Xiao.

208
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:57,330
I'm so useless.

209
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,990
I couldn't help much

210
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,750
and made you suffer.

211
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,970
What are you talking about?

212
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,560
As long as you're by our side,

213
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,369
I feel so powerful.

214
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,859
Really.

215
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,810
Alright, go to bed. It's late.

216
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,130
You too.

217
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,970
You're back.

218
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,590
Morning.

219
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,480
Let's eat up.

220
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,340
What doctor

221
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,740
did you mention yesterday?

222
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,380
You want to borrow a plane.

223
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,900
I took my mom to see a psychologist.

224
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,210
Other than medicine,

225
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,780
he also suggested

226
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,740
a safer exposure therapy.

227
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,990
The doctor planned to hypnotize

228
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,680
and guide Auntie Fang

229
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,280
to take a flight in the dream.

230
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,400
The key is

231
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,700
she'd better be in the plane cabin.

232
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,580
The therapeutic effect will be better.

233
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,280
Of course.

234
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,600
There's no need to fly a plane.

235
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
I know what you're thinking.

236
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,250
But I'm sorry

237
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,020
I can't make the decision.

238
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,910
As the head of the Maintenance Department,

239
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:04,840
I can't take the lead to violate the company's rules.

240
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,560
Actually, before we came here,

241
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,760
we considered these issues carefully.

242
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:09,660
But

243
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,600
this is a crucial part of the therapy program.

244
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,520
We want to hear your opinion

245
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:16,520
to see

246
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,390
if there is a perfect way.

247
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,960
There is a 787 coming in tomorrow afternoon for maintenance.

248
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,440
I'll arrange for more men

249
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,560
to speed up the work.

250
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,380
In the afternoon,

251
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,910
I'll report to President Xu

252
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,520
and see if I can apply for special approval

253
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,950
for you to be on the plane for two hours.

254
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:49,690
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

255
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,270
Brother Zhan.

256
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,640
Hello, uncle and auntie.

257
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,630
I also borrowed the passenger stair.

258
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,880
Make it a formal one.

259
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,280
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

260
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,850
Please.

261
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:48,700
Hello, Auntie Fang.

262
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,630
Welcome aboard.

263
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,050
Auntie Fang, let me take you to your seat.

264
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,560
This way, please.

265
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,690
This way.

266
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,530
Please have a seat.

267
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:25,000
Auntie Fang,

268
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,160
Cheng Xiao asked me to prepare

269
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,760
your favorite lavender tea.

270
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,380
Try it.

271
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,610
Caution. It's hot.

272
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,230
Thank you.

273
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,510
Ms. Fang,

274
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,380
let's begin.

275
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,600
Lower your seat.

276
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,130
Auntie Fang, let me adjust it for you.

277
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,450
Yes, lie down.

278
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,440
Is this okay, auntie?

279
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,990
The air conditioning temperature is a bit low.

280
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,190
You'll feel better with the blanket on.

281
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:23,830
Now,

282
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,370
let's start.

283
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,910
Relax.

284
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,670
First,

285
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,760
relax your eyebrows.

286
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,080
Don't frown.

287
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,310
Yes.

288
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,490
Relax your shoulders.

289
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,400
You are

290
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:49,040
on this plane.

291
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,640
There are many passengers.

292
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,570
Flight attendants are at your service.

293
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,960
Ladies and gentlemen,

294
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,310
welcome to Luzhou Airlines' flight 8867

295
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,430
from Luzhou to Qingdao.

296
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,280
The plane will take off soon.

297
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,480
Please make sure your tray table is closed.

298
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,010
Xiaoyun.

299
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,780
The plane is about to take off.

300
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,890
Get your seat to the upright position.

301
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:39,870
Now,

302
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,660
don't think about anything.

303
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Just relax.

304
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,520
Speak slowly.

305
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,080
Be gentle.

306
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,120
Dr. Yu emphasized that

307
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,610
you'd better fly the plane

308
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:27,830
in auntie's fantasy.

309
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,150
I...

310
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,720
This will be very helpful

311
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,780
for her condition.

312
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,700
But will it backfire?

313
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,360
It's a bit risky.

314
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,100
That's why I need your opinion.

315
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,110
Xiaoyun.

316
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,940
Relax.

317
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,340
You'll be fine.

318
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,520
Relax. It's nothing.

319
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,780
Ms. Fang, this is the tea you ordered.

320
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:20,740
Thank you.

321
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,140
Caution. It's hot.

322
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,170
Xiaoyun.

323
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,050
Don't look outside.

324
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,050
Just like how you usually take the train.

325
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,030
Don't always think that this is an airplane.

326
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,560
There won't be any problem.

327
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,580
Ladies and gentlemen,

328
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:02,250
this is the captain speaking.

329
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:04,370
The plane is entering the turbulence area.

330
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,340
Please go back to your seat.

331
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,730
Fasten your seat belt.

332
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:09,440
Flight attendants, please go back to your seats.

333
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,060
Thank you.

334
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,120
Isn't that Cheng Xiao's voice?

335
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,410
Why is she...

336
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,820
Why is she on the plane?

337
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,170
She's flying today.

338
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,400
Why her?

339
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,090
No, it's too dangerous.

340
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
I have to stop her.

341
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,480
No.

342
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:23,300
Cheng Xiao.

343
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,830
Xiaoyun.

344
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:24,890
Cheng Xiao!

345
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,660
Cheng Xiao! Cheng Xiao!

346
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,400
Cheng Xiao, come out! Do you hear me?

347
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,290
Watch out!

348
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,640
Danger! Come out!

349
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,190
Cheng Xiao!

350
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,650
Cheng Xiao, open the door!

351
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:36,980
Cheng Xiao!

352
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,250
It's too dangerous.

353
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,020
Cheng Xiao!

354
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,770
The patient has left the guidance

355
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,700
and started to act independently.

356
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:47,910
What should we do?

357
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Should we wake her up?

358
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,180
Don't worry.

359
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,370
Keep an eye on her.

360
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,910
Cheng Xiao!

361
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,280
Come out! It's dangerous! Cheng Xiao!

362
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:59,080
Open the door!

363
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,660
Cheng Xiao, descend quickly.

364
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,590
It's too dangerous. Do you hear me?

365
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,360
Adjust the rough air speed.

366
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,960
Turn on the seat belt switch.

367
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:11,940
Checked.

368
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,780
Cheng Xiao, didn't you hear me?

369
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,040
Xiaoyun, let's go out.

370
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,170
Don't disturb them.

371
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,510
Come, sit down.

372
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,410
Cheng Xiao.

373
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,630
Be careful.

374
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,920
Pay attention to the changes in altitude and speed.

375
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Report it in time.

376
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,480
Roger.

377
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,870
Speed up.

378
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,680
Altitude drops by 100 feet.

379
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,210
Checked.

380
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,830
You take over the manipulation, and I do the broadcast.

381
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,360
My plane.

382
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Ladies and gentlemen,

383
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,900
this is the captain speaking.

384
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,640
The plane is crossing the turbulence area.

385
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,680
For your safety,

386
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,800
please sit properly

387
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,860
and fasten your seat belt. Thank you.

388
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,620
My plane.

389
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,580
Your plane.

390
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:47,020
Restore autocruise speed.

391
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,740
Safety belt switch back to automatic position.

392
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,450
Checked.

393
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,720
Look, how great Xiao is.

394
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,350
She can solve any difficulty.

395
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,240
Alright, Ms. Fang.

396
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:05,270
Our plane has landed.

397
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,430
You are very safe now.

398
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,070
Now.

399
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,740
Listen to my command.

400
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,890
When I count to three,

401
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,330
you will wake up.

402
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:16,610
One.

403
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,690
Two.

404
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,290
Three.

405
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,230
Mom.

406
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,040
How do you feel?

407
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,810
Xiaoyun.

408
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,360
How about

409
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,950
we go out first?

410
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,500
You can talk to Dr. Yu.

411
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,920
Yes, Ms. Fang.

412
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,690
You can tell me

413
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,350
if there's anything.

414
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,700
Just like when we talked

415
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,080
in my office.

416
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,590
Mom.

417
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:36,880
Xiao, it's okay.

418
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,670
I'll go home with your mom.

419
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,860
Let's talk later.

420
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,210
Xiaoyun.

421
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:43,650
Xiaoyun!

422
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,750
Doctor.

423
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,180
How is auntie?

424
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,420
Currently,

425
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,050
hypnosis went well.

426
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,460
But

427
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:55,110
after the patient is woken up,

428
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:56,970
we need a healing conversation.

429
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,960
Without this process,

430
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,450
we can't determine the effect yet.

431
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,179
Cheng Xiao,

432
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,170
you've done a good job.

433
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,480
You still have a big chance.

434
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,880
I won't give up.

435
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,000
I want to

436
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,750
extend my leave for a while longer.

437
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,350
I'll submit my application to the department.

438
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,610
I'll go with you.

439
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,120
Mom,

440
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,880
look at how nice the view from the rooftop of our company is.

441
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,760
In my dream,

442
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,330
I saw

443
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,130
you drove a plane.

444
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,270
Do you usually fly like this?

445
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,410
Mom,

446
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,370
if you're still worried,

447
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,760
then I'll...

448
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,420
Cheng Xiao,

449
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,590
just

450
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,480
fly

451
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,190
as you wish.

452
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,260
Xiao.

453
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,930
I'm sorry

454
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,650
for all these years.

455
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,300
I was wrong.

456
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,200
Since you were young,

457
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,360
I thought,

458
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,160
what I give you is the best.

459
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,600
In fact,

460
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,510
you've been doing very well.

461
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,240
I didn't acknowledge that

462
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,920
because

463
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,730
I'm afraid to admit that I'm wrong.

464
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,350
Xiao,

465
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,420
you're my pride.

466
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,480
Mom.

467
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,970
I didn't care about your feelings before.

468
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,440
I'm sorry.

469
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,980
Xiao.

470
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,870
You and Gu...

471
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,510
He is my instructor.

472
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,220
Auntie.

473
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,230
Gu, thank you.

474
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,690
You're welcome.

475
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,210
I know you've been

476
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,700
helping Xiao and encouraging Cheng Xiao.

477
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,200
I...

478
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,030
It's my duty.

479
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,120
Auntie,

480
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,040
Cheng Xiao looks tough and brave.

481
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,690
It looks like she doesn't care what others think.

482
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,170
But actually, she really cares about you.

483
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,370
She really wants your acknowledgment.

484
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,500
Now I know.

485
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:53,980
Cheng Xiao,

486
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,880
I will continue to see Dr. Yu

487
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:58,840
and continue my treatment.

488
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,190
Don't worry about me.

489
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,250
Just fly.

490
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,750
I love you.

491
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,270
This is not like

492
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,290
something Captain Cheng would say.

493
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,510
Ms. Fang,

494
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,800
you love to hear that,

495
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:19,930
why are you lying?

496
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,620
I'm hungry.

497
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,120
Let's go eat.

498
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:25,450
Okay.

499
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:25,960
Let's go.

500
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Mr. Gu, let's have dinner together.

501
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,490
What's going on?

502
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,630
Don't you know it's their couple time?

503
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,620
Gu.

504
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,760
All right, don't worry. Let's go.

505
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
Don't mind us. Go back to work.

506
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,470
Bye.

507
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,030
Thank you.

508
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,050
Mr. Gu,

509
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,470
I want to cancel my leave.

510
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,370
I want to fly.

511
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,420
Okay.

512
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,940
Cheng Xiao,

513
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,030
I want to take you to a place.

514
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:13,480
Are you bringing me

515
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,050
to meet your new tenant?

516
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,570
You went past!
