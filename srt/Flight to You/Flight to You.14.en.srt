It's published on our company's magazine.

There are many passengers on the plane.

00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:46,680
Next.

178
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,800
Show me your ID and equipment.

179
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,760
Tablet, reflection vest,

180
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,100
flashlight, and earphones.

181
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,960
This is my boarding certificate.

182
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:03,960
No problem

183
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,730
Brother Nanting,

184
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,180
we've been checking for an hour.

185
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,910
The team that was picked today

186
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,850
did a good job.

187
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,590
How about

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,490
we called it a day?

189
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,590
Thank you for your cooperation.

190
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,320
It's my duty.

191
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:20,660
OK.

192
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:23,770
Let's go back too.

193
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:26,490
Let's go to the parking apron and check.

194
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
Brother Nanting,

195
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,020
no one dares to talk to me recently

196
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,990
because they are afraid to be checked and punished.

197
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,030
They hid far away.

198
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,060
Wait.

199
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,590
What's wrong with your uniform?

200
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,850
I didn't notice.

201
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,560
Thank you for reminding me.

202
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,390
I've recorded your problem.

203
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,260
Record?

204
00:11:59,080 --> 00:11:59,410
This…

205
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:00,770
Captain Gu,

206
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,640
this should be

207
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,130
a reminder or a suggestion.

208
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,310
This is indeed a suggestion now.

209
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,340
How to deal with this problem

210
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,070
will be decided by the leaders.

211
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,850
What do you mean?

212
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,390
You will snitch on me?

213
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,480
Come back.

214
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,600
Stop pretending like a boss.

215
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,730
Please understand.

216
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,210
Do you think you're a boss?

217
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,760
Brother Nanting.

218
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Brother Nanting.

219
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,190
Brother Nanting.

220
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,410
Ignore him.

221
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,540
I'm not the deputy head anymore.

222
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:35,440
But you...

223
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,220
But as long as it's related to flight safety,

224
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,020
I will still tell the leaders even if it's a snitch.

225
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,230
Brother Nanting,

226
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
I support you.

227
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,610
I said I was afraid that people would avoid me.

228
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,530
I was joking.

229
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,840
I don't care about that at all.

230
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,560
I was just kidding.

231
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,630
Enjoy.

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,400
Here's your juice. Enjoy.

233
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Thank you.

234
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,880
Do you need anything to drink?

235
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,340
No need.

236
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,720
Hello, sir.

237
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,880
Would you like something to drink?

238
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,490
Sir, don't you like beef?

239
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes, please wait a moment.

240
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,490
Sir.

241
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:18,950
Sir.

242
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,740
Would you like some fish?

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,530
Do you have wine?

244
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,510
How about beer, sir?

245
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,240
Ok.

246
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,400
Drink slowly, sir.

247
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,940
Hello, sir.

248
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:53,940
Here you are.

249
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,660
Can I have another can?

250
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,440
Hello, sir. What would you like to drink?

251
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,130
Two.

252
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:02,570
Two.

253
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,480
Sir,

254
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,220
the air pressure is low in high-attitude environment.

255
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,340
People tend to lack oxygen.

256
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,370
Alcohol is more effective.

257
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:11,520
You might feel uncomfortable if you drink too much.

258
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,800
Uncomfortable?

259
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,610
Am I going to die?

260
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,340
Sorry, sir.

261
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,920
The alcohol in our cabin is limited.

262
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,840
We need to serve other passengers.

263
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,670
How about this?

264
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,990
We give you another cup.

265
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,850
Call us if you need anything else.

266
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,400
OK.

267
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,750
Thank you for understanding.

268
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,800
Please enjoy, sir.

269
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,140
Madam, what would you like to drink?

270
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,200
Thank you. No need.

271
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,410
Xiazhi,

272
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,260
keep an eye on this passenger.

273
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,080
Go ahead.

274
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,820
Your phone.

275
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,520
Thank you.

276
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,450
You're welcome.

277
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,410
Cheng,

278
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,170
you didn't talk much along the way.

279
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,540
I heard that

280
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,280
you are quite outgoing.

281
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,200
Mr. Jiang,

282
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:43,810
I want to know

283
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:47,620
why you asked me to go to the Ground Handling department.

284
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,800
This is the new exchange plan

285
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,700
for our department.

286
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,480
Only excellent pilots

287
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,850
can get this chance.

288
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,930
You're in the magazine now.

289
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
This shows the result of your study.

290
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,540
Then I shall thank you for your guidance.

291
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,440
I hope you've learned something.

292
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,070
Ladies and gentlemen,

293
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,040
our plane has started to descend.

294
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,000
Please bring your seat back

295
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,400
and table to the upright position.

296
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,290
Open the shading panels.

297
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:36,780
Sir,

298
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,080
please bring your seat back. Thank you.

299
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,140
Lavatory is not allowed to use.

300
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,960
Please turn off your laptop

301
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,890
and other electronic equipments.

302
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,080
And confirmed that the phone and other electronic devices

303
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,720
are still in flight mode or power off.

304
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,350
Thank you.

305
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,079
Sir, please fasten your seat belt.

306
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,520
Sir,

307
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,850
our plane is about to land.

308
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,830
Please adjust your seat.

309
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,970
Thank you for your cooperation.

310
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,690
Sir.

311
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,780
Please fasten your seat belt.

312
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:28,840
Sir.

313
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,620
Please, stop talking.

314
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,150
Chao will fasten it when he wakes up.

315
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,570
But we have rules.

316
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,900
Do you want a complaint?

317
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,300
I'm sorry to bother you.

318
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,960
But...

319
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,320
Please fasten your seat belt soon.

320
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,430
Landing check list.

321
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,430
Landing check list completed.

322
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,220
Keep going.

323
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,140
Luzhou 8252.

324
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,900
Left track 18 can land.

325
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,880
Left track 18 can land.

326
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,140
Luzhou 8252.

327
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,520
Our crew's qualified rate of

328
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,180
random inspection is so high.

329
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,400
You can be satisfied now, right?

330
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,600
We need to keep a regular check.

331
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,760
Don't slack off.

332
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,300
It's the aircraft 787.

333
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
It should be Xiao and the others.

334
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,780
Xiao is

335
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,820
finally getting better.

336
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,600
Youji 3604, wait outside the runway.

337
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,760
Why is it not working?

338
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,500
[Emergency Control Tower]

339
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,230
[Luzhou Airport Tower]

340
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,330
Tower. Tower.

341
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,020
The brake 3604 is out of order

342
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,500
and the plane is heading towards the runway.

343
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:26,890
Luzhou 4252,

344
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,260
the plane ahead is out of order

345
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,000
and accidentally entered the runway.

346
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,630
Conflict!

347
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,290
Maintain in the middle line and brake.

348
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,380
Please stay in your seats.

349
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,910
Don't untie your seatbelt.

350
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:11,730

523
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,480
Anyone there?

524
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Anyone there? Answer me.

525
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,120
Slow down.

526
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,120
Hold it tight.

527
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,360
How is it going over there?

528
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,520
No one is here, Madam.

529
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,720
Check it one last time

530
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,890
and leave from the rear cabin.

531
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,400
Okay.

532
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,870
-Slow down.
-Anyone? Answer me.

533
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,390
Is anyone there?

534
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,430
Is anyone there? Answer me!

535
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:36,090
Hello? Answer me!

536
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,890
Sir, what are you doing?

537
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:41,020
Hurry up! Sir!

538
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,220
Sir.

539
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,370
It's dangerous here. Please get off.

540
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,610
Anyone there? Answer me!

541
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,480
Hello? Answer me!

542
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,460
It scared me.

543
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,810
Sir, have you left?

544
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,220
Have I checked?

545
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,600
Sir, get in the car.

546
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
Stop taking photos.

547
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,480
Don't take photos. Get in.

548
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,560
Sir, get in.

549
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,320
Stop filming. Get in.

550
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,200
Get in.

551
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,890
Get away from the plane! Hurry!

552
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:33,370
Sir, get in.

553
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,280
Get in.

554
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,790
Get in. Stop filming.

555
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,520
Sir, get in. Don’t take photos.

556
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,080
Su Miao,

557
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:39,840
count the number.

558
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
I'll go to the ambulance and check,

559
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,880
A passenger is injured.

560
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,320
Ok.

561
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,320
Count the number.

562
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Count the number.

563
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,940
Yuheng, your head is hurt.

564
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:50,940
I'm fine.

565
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,640
Go to ambulance and bandage the wound.

566
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,160
It's ok. There are passengers here.

567
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,040
Go.

568
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,400
Go. We're here.

569
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,450
Hurry up. Go.

570
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,170
Hurry up.

571
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,060
Don't be nervous.

572
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,640
Relax. Take a deep breath.

573
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,300
We're almost at the hospital.

574
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,570
Sir, are you okay?

575
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,760
146.

576
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,710
131.

577
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,750
Why is one person missing?

578
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,210
I have counted many times.

579
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,520
The bus can't wait any longer.

580
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,600
There's a patient with a heart issue in the car.

581
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,660
He's been panting.

582
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,440
You guys go first.

583
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,450
You too.

584
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,160
Get in.

585
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,360
Ok, the ferry car can leave now.

586
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,940
Let's go.

587
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,580
Madam!

588
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,350
Excuse me.

589
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,510
It's okay. Relax.

590
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,900
There are 277 passengers.

591
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,960
One is missing now.

592
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,590
How can one person be missing?

593
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,050
We've counted many times.

594
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,060
Why did the ferry car leave?

595
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,460
We can't stay any longer.

596
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:50,740
Some passengers have symptoms

597
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,910
due to shock.

598
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,400
Ambulance leaves first.

599
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,750
I'll report to the ground commander.

600
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,160
Ok.

601
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,160
I'll go to the commander.

602
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,160
Don't go too far.

603
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,500
Ok.

604
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,520
Commander,

605
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,810
one passenger is missing.

606
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,760
Are you sure?

607
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,160
I've counted many times.

608
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,600
This passenger is probably on the plane.

609
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,250
Xiazhi,

610
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:17,750
how are you?

611
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,460
I'm fine.

612
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,860
Captain Jiang and Xiao

613
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,120
haven't come down yet.

614
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:27,630
The fire alarm is still on.

615
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,840
It seems serious.

616
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,850
Make the last clearance.

617
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,510
Leave the plane immediately.

618
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,820
Use the infrared thermal imager

619
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,810
to check the temperature of the cargo from outside.

620
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,080
If there is a fire source alarm,

621
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,120
execute plan 1.

622
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,160
Spraying outside

623
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,920
to cool down.

624
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,440
Then you police go up.

625
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,670
Prepare the thermometer gun.

626
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,720
Go over there.

627
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,440
Anyone there?

628
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,700
Get off the plane. Is anyone there?

629
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,890
Anyone?

630
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:12,910
Sir.

631
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,880
It's emergency evacuation. Get up.

632
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,650
-Let’s go.
-There’s still someone here?

633
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,600
Sir. Sir.

634
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:19,690
You...

635
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:20,670
Sir.

636
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,340
I'm the captain.

637
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:23,440
This plane

638
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:24,960
might be in danger.

639
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,790
The plane is about to catch fire.

640
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,640
You should go. Get up.

641
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,930
Let's go.

642
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,290
Fire!

643
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,320
Where is the fire?

644
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:33,800
Sir.

645
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Where is the fire?

646
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:38,940
Sir.

647
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,030
It's not on fire yet.

648
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,000
But it could be on fire.

649
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,210
Please leave now.

650
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,610
Don't touch me! Piss off!

651
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,360
What are you doing?

652
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,040
Calm down.

653
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Stay away from me.

654
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,500
Don't play a joke with your life.

655
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,720
Let's go down first and talk.

656
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,850
You know nothing!

657
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:55,280
The company I worked so hard to establish has gone bankrupt.

658
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,930
I…

659
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,680
How am I

660
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,990
supposed to live?

661
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,280
There are dozens of people waiting for me to give them salary.

662
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,930
Who can I rely on?

663
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,880
Every morning when I open my eyes,

664
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,980
I want to jump off

665
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,000
from the 11th floor.

666
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:12,650
Come on.

667
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,260
Where is the fire?

668
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:15,010
Come.

669
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:15,929
Put it down.

670
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,460
Put it down.

671
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,150
You have to be responsible for your actions.

672
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,080
Don't come over!

673
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,710
I'll kill myself if you come any closer.

674
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:22,670
Alright, I won't come over.

675
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,429
Calm down.

676
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,190
Yes, just calm down.

677
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,480
I apologize to you, okay?

678
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,600
What should I do?

679
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:31,929
Get someone.

680
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:33,699
Call the police.

681
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:35,980
Go.

682
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,620
I can't go. You should go.

683
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,440
You'll irritate him if you stay here.

684
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,770
I'll stay and watch him.

685
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,080
Go get help.

686
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,960
Be careful.

687
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,920
I know.

688
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,330
Sir,

689
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,000
can you put the bottle down first?

690
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:56,750
Yours...

691
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:57,590
Don't come over.

692
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,550
Ok. I won't.

693
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,130
The captain is coming down.

694
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,730
I'm the captain.

695
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,920
Someone is on the plane.

696
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,340
A passenger was drunk,

697
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
trying to kill himself. He was very agitated.

698
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,370
My co-pilot

699
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,880
is comforting him.

700
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:27,200
Cheng Xiao is still on the plane?

701
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,590
Yes.

702
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,000
We haven't confirmed the cargo yet.

703
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,560
No one can get on the plane rashly.

704
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,020
We have to confirm the fire in the rear cargo.

705
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:42,630
Zhan.

706
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:43,850
What's going on?

707
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:15,780
Sir.

708
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,660
Sir.

709
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,470
You must be thirsty after drinking so much.

710
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,490
Here, have some water.

711
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,860
Nothing can't be solved.

712
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,510
Let me tell you.

713
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,020
I've been flying for so many years.

714
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,490
But,

715
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,720
some people said

716
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,450
I'm not qualified to be a pilot.

717
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:58,390
I was transferred to the Ground Handling department.

718
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:00,310
I almost broke down back then.

719
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:02,930
I hesitated,

720
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,540
but I didn't give up.

721
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,470
Look.

722
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,920
I'm still

723
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,790
flying a plane right now.

724
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,440
Everything will be fine.

725
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,410
What if

726
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,240
anything happens to you,

727
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,370
what about your family?

728
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,290
There are so many staff

729
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,640
waiting for you.

730
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,100
What about them

731
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,590
and their family?

732
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,280
Everyone has failed

733
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,730
during the journey of life.

734
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,280
These obstacles will be solved.

735
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:02,140
Why not have some water?

736
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Drink some water.

737
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,370
I'll hold it for you.

738
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:23,920
I'll take it.

739
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:45,430
Can we get off the plane first?

740
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,700
Or it'll be too late.

741
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,270
Let me help you.

742
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,240
Sir, let's go.

743
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
Give me some time.

744
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,740
I'll get the money soon.

745
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,880
I'll pay you back.

746
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,310
It's okay.

747
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,230
Sir.

748
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,920
Why are you chasing after me to the plane?

749
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,430
Sir.

750
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:21,010
I told you to give me some time.

751
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,730
-Sir.
-Are you trying to kill me?

752
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,680
Sir, calm down.

753
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,680
This is the drunk one.

754
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:51,590
Control him.

755
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,700
Let go of me!

756
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,460
Where is the pilot?

757
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,450
I don't know.

758
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,880
Brother Nanting?

759
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,250
Brother Nanting!

760
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:40,680
Cheng Xiao.

761
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,160
Cheng Xiao!

762
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,140
Cheng Xiao!

763
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:51,970
What happened?

764
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:58,780
Gu Nanting.

765
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:01,420
Come.

766
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,040
Go.

767
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:09,560
Go.

768
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,360
Hang in there.

769
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,880
That's Xiao.

770
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:54,670
What happened to her?

771
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,380
Hurry up.

772
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,780
Be careful.

773
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,860
Slowly. Be gentle.

774
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,460
Don't be afraid. I'll accompany you.

775
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,930
Don't be afraid.

776
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,070
Get in.

777
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,660
Slow down.

778
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,640
Yuheng, you accompany Cheng Xiao to the hospital.

779
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:38,760
OK.

780
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,800
Madam, can I go with them?

781
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,160
The rest of you,

782
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,000
come with me to the Security Department to make a statement.

783
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:42,440
Yuheng,

784
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,680
call me if anything happens.

785
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,050
Ok.
