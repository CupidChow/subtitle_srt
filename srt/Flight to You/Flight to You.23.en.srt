[Episode 23]

4
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,300
I've recorded the time required and fuel consumption

00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,520
of each way-point.

6
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,400
Why didn't you record

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,690
the wind speed and direction at each altitude level?

8
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,080
It doesn't matter.

9
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,940
Let me show you.

10
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,920
This time, Luzhou Airlines

11
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,840
prepared food, clothes, masks,

12
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,110
cotton blankets, tents, boots,

13
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,579
medicine, medical equipment, and so on.

14
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,320
There are 857 pieces in total.

15
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,840
It weighs 52 tons altogether.

and part of the cabin have been filled up.

18
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
These used to be the seats of the cabin.

19
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
They were all removed

20
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
to store our supplies.

21

Let me show you the map.

This is our destination.

32
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,500
We'll pass through a mountain trail.

Let me do it.

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,650
But it's hard to go this way.

35
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,610

Okay.

41

The supplies have arrived in Guizhou.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
We are now busy

43
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,440
with the last preparation.

44
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,220
The most troublesome thing is

45

the stock counts.

46

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,010
Where is the progress now?

48

It'll be loaded soon.

We will split into two teams and deliver the supplies

51

to the designated location in these two days.

52
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,340
OK.

This is Captain Gu.

54
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,210
Hello.

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,920

Thank you very much.

By the way,

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,730
the disaster situation at Wangjiaping and Shidong Village

59
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,970
are still very serious.

60
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,000
Some of the power and communication has been cut off.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,180
The Cangshui Elementary School that you supported

62
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,370
is in Wangjiaping.

63
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,839
If we go there now,

64
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,470
it'll be very difficult.

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,400
The more difficult it is, the more helpful it is.

66
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,120
Don't worry.

67
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,440
We will make a plan in advance

68
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,700
and deliver the supplies.

69
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,550
That's great. Thank you, captain.

70
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,660
Also, we have arranged for

71
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,800
accommodation at the countryside for you.

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,680
But the condition

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
is definitely not as good as in the city.

I just discussed this with Ms. Ai.

I knew something was wrong with you when in the car.

88

When I came here,

90
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,560
I suddenly remembered

91
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:13,210
the night in my hometown.

92
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,130
It was the same as here.

93
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,890
There are no lights

there was a flood.

Our family crawled to the roof

104
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,220
waiting for help.

105
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,540
Sometimes,

106
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,700
we saw animals' carcasses drift away.

107
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,280
Some were people

108
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,980
we didn't know if they were dead or alive.

109

You never talked

110

At that time,

112
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,620
my parents borrowed money to open a store.

113
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,960
They wanted to save more money

114

for my brother and me to go to college.

115
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,260
But

116
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,059
the store was washed away.

117
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,320
Back then, I couldn't even afford the school expenses.

118

My textbooks

119
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,590
were donated by others.

120

The donors

121
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,510
were kids from big cities

122
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,040
like you.

123
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,980
At that time, I thought

124
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,100
I must get into a good university.

125
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,070
I must leave there.

You two are in the mood

128
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:29,820
to spend time here.

Song has become bolder.

131
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,820
I found something good.

132
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,550
It's a local specialty, romantic baked tofu.

133
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,070
Try it.

134
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,260
It has an auspicious implied meaning. We should try it.

135
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,460
I wonder

136
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,740
if my Nanting loves it.

137
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,350
Don't joke around.

138
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,670
What is this called?

139
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,080
Romantic baked tofu.

140
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,170
What do you think?

141
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,280
Not bad.

142
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,690
It does taste like romance.

143
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,830
Does it taste sweet?

144
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,820
I heard the road to Wangjiaping is hard to pass.

145
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,840
I left two pickup trucks.

146
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,170
The gas tanks are ready.

147
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,550
I'm sure it'll go back and forth smoothly.

drive this car.

150
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,650
The car's condition is better.

151
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,070
How can you let a girl drive?

152
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,800
Let me drive.

153
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:30,970
Let me.

154
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,280
I'm good at transporting goods.

155
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,410
Besides, Brother Zhan,

156
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,690
you stayed up all night

157
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,920
and didn't rest well.

158
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,550
You can take a rest in the car.

159
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,880
You're so considerate.

160
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:40,820
Okay.

161
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,480
I'll take your car.

162
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
We can take turns if you're tired halfway.

163
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,140
No problem.

164
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,190
The signal here is bad in most places.

165
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,440
Call me with the radio in the car if anything happens.

166
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,510
I studied the route last night.

167
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,720
Remember to follow tight my car.

168
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,310
Okay.

169
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:53,790
Okay, let's go.

170
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,020
Brother Nanting, let me help you with the GPS.

171
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:57,980
I'll go with you.

172
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,290
You can take Xiao's car.

173
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,350
None of your business.

174
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,200
The car is full. Take this.

175
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,590
Okay.

176
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,570
Brother Nanting, we're going into the mountain area.

177
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,840
We are about to wind up the mountain.

178
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,800
It's a rough road.

179
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,530
Be careful. Follow me closely.

180
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,880
Don't worry. I won't hold you back.

181
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,120
Why is this tune so familiar?

182
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,980
Isn't this the one you listened

183
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,910
when you took my car the first time?

184
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,710
Yes, that's it.

185
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,860
The front is going to be bumpy.

186
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,380
I play a piece of music for you

187
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,440
to get the feeling.

188
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:53,260
[Cangshui Elementary School]

189
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,430
I guess no one is here.

190
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,610
This is Cangshui Elementary School, sponsored by Luzhou Airlines.

191
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,950
Fortunately, the terrain here is high.

192
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:23,900
It's not completely corroded by the flood.

193
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,020
But I can still see

194
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,510
the mark left by the flood.

195
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:32,680
Someone's here.

196
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,280
Hello.

197
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,210
Hello.

198
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,980
We're volunteers from Luzhou Airlines.

199
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,780
We're here to deliver supplies.

200
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,510
Thank you. Thank you.

201
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,400
Come and sit inside.

202
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,600
Come in.

203
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,470
Take care.

204
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,080
Thank you.

205
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,200
Ms. Guo,

206
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,880
hasn't the class been suspended?

207
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,660
Why are they still at school?

208
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,490
Their parents work in other places.

209
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,220
They haven't come back for years.

210
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,150
Due to the flood,

211
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,480
the electricity is off and there's no signal.

212
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,470
Their houses were soaked in water.

213
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,430
So I brought them to stay at school.

214
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,100
What about

215
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,500
your family?

216
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,680
He works in Shenzhen.

217
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,510
But recently,

218
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,940
I haven't been able to contact him for days.

219
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,660
How are the kids?

220
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,110
They're fine,

221
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,420
just hungry.

222
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,660
The food prepared by the village

223
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,850
is almost finished.

224
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,440
I planned to go back to the village for supplies tomorrow,

225
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,610
but you came.

226
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,950
You wanted to walk back and get it.

227
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,680
It takes half an hour to drive

228
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,080
from here to the village.

229
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,680
How long does it take to walk?

230
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,520
Besides, you're still in this health condition.

231
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,090
I have no choice.

232
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,470
The children are growing.

233
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,870
We can't let them starve.

234
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,870
How long has your pregnancy been?

235
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,580
Six months.

236
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,590
Is the kid sick?

237
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,830
The temperature here varies greatly between day and night. It's also humid.

238
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,160
Maybe she caught a cold.

239
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,320
Listen to me.

240
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,200
Drink this cold medicine.

241
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,740
Then,

242
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,260
I'll reward you a candy.

243
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,390
So that you won't feel bitter eating medicine.

244
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:45,920
Okay?

245
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,970
Besides leaving enough supplies,

246
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,570
how about

247
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,220
we stay here tonight?

248
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,609
Ms. Guo is alone.

249
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,900
She is not convenient.

250
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,700
What if something happens?

251
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,069
Okay.

252
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:13,880
How about this?

253
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,770
You can contact the county rescue command centre

254
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,460
through the car radio

255
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,869
and tell them about our schedule.

256
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,390
Then ask them

257
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,680
to send two volunteers

258
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,430
to take over.

259
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,010
Okay, that's it.

260
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,849
Let's send the supplies to Wangjiaping first.

261
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:26,440
Hurry back.

262
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,770
Okay.

263
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,800
Do we have enough groundsheets?

264
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,310

[Year 1 Class 1]

365
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,070
I gave half of the groundsheets to the teacher and the children.

366
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,270
So it's not enough now.

367
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,000
We can only squeeze in at night.

368
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,940
How about this?

369
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,960
Yicheng, give me a hand.

370
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,770
In this way,

371
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,230
you girls sleep inside,

372
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,750
while we sleep outside.

373
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,750
Mr. Ni is so sweet.

374
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,100
Come on, let's take the blankets.

375
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,470
Okay.

376
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,850
Is the bed ready? Here come the blankets.

What?

379
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,790
I know who Mr. Gu likes.

380
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,030
Are you trying to trick me?

381
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,970
Isn't she downstairs?

382
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,260
I was right.

383
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,930
You...

384
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,310
I'm warning you.

385
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,930
Don't tell Yuheng yet.

386
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,350
They're making bed upstairs.

387
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,410
Do you want to take a rest upstairs?

388
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,400
I'm fine.

389
00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:24,890
You can take a nap if you're tired.

390
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:25,690
I'm not tired.

while the sun is still shining.

393
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,190
So that children

394
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:01,750
can do activities more conveniently.

395
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,590
Be gentle.

396
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,140
The kids are sleeping.

397
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,860
What's that sound?

398
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,630
Is it an earthquake?

399
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,170
I think it's a landslide.

400
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:47,960
The teacher seems to have a stomach ache.

401
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,040
Uncle, auntie, go and have a look.

402
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:50,600
Let's go.

403
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:56,640

404
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,550
How are you? Are you okay?

405
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,490
I'm fine.

406
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,570
It's Xiao Le.

407
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,140
Xuan Xuan, tell me.

408
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,700
Xiao Le said

409
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,550
uncle and auntie

410
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:08,570
would make us delicious food tonight.

411
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:10,400
The firewood in the kitchen was not enough

412
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,060
so he went to pick up firewood.

413
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,690
The sound I heard just now

414
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,020
seems to be a landslide.

415
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,080
Xiao Le.

416
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,520
Xiao Le is still on the mountain.

417
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,670
Ms. Guo, calm down.

418
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,640
Xia Zhi, Song.

419
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,480
You stay here to take care of the teacher and children.

420
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,040
You, get the first-aid kit. Let's go.

421
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,470
Okay.

422
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,590
Teacher.

423
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:29,840
How are you?

424
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:31,890
Xiao Le! Le Le!

425
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:33,730

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,600
Xiao Le!

428
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,450
Xiao Le!

429
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,880
-Xiao Le!
-Le Le.

430
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,270
-How is it?
-How is it?

431
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,430
I asked Ms. Guo before.

432
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,880
She said this was the only route to pick up firewood.

433
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,910
I just took a look.

434
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,150
The hill up is too steep.

435
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,480
It's impossible for children to climb up.

436
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,210
The firewood here is still wet.

437
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:02,010
Xiao Le should have gone somewhere else to look for the firewood.

438
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,220
Let's go over there.

439
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,590

00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,860

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,100
Xiao Le!

443
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,760
-Xiao Le!
-Le Le.

444
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,500
Xiao Le!

445
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,690
Xiao Le!

446
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,990
Xiao Le!

447
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,800
Xiao Le! Xiao Le!

448
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:33,730
Le Le!

449
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,990
Look over there.

450
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,030
Xiao Le!

451
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,030
Xiao Le!

452
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,760
Xiao Le, are you in there?

453
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:50,380
Uncle.

454
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,520
Xiao Le.

455
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,510
Auntie.

456
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,620
Uncle.

457
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,670
He's inside.

458
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,760
Xiao Le, are you hurt?

459
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,120
No.

460
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,020
I...

461
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,000
I can't get out.

462
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,070
Don't worry.

463
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,510
Uncle and auntie will find a way.

464
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:07,030
Xiao Le, don't move.

465
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,630
Why is there a house here?

466
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,480
It should be the wooden house of the forest keeper.

467
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,920
It collapsed because of the landslide.

468
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,740
Let's move it first.

469
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,750
Hold on. Don't do it brutally.

470
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,320
If it collapses again, the child will be in danger.

471
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,860
Nanting.

472
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
We have to move this main beam away

473
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,780
and get down from here.

474
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,400
Can you hold it down there?

475
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,200
I've checked. It should be fine.

476
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,110
But be careful.

477
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,700
Song, the rope.

478
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:34,850
Here.

479
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,330
I'll hook the beam.

480
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,000
Be careful.

481
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,640
You're too heavy.

482
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,570
Come down first.

483
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,520
Come down first.

484
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,310
Let me do it.

485
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,260
-No!
-No!

486
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,800
It's too dangerous. Don't act tough.

487
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,240
Now just let the suitable one do it.

488
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,950
Don't waste time.

489
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:53,460
Wait.

490
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,920
Do you have any other rope? Song.

491
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,360
Yes.

492
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,090
Do you remember how to bolt the buckle?

493
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,760
Slow down. Come back if you can't.

494
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,460
Xiao Le.

495
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,620
Hang in there.

496
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,650
We'll be out soon.

497
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,320
Auntie, be careful.

498
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,350
Slow down.

499
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,770
I'm fine.

500
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,820
Step on it.

501
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:26,510
Be careful.

502
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,370
Are you okay?

503
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,550
Yes.

504
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,400
Hold it tight.

505
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,500
Cheng Xiao, hang in there.

506
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,880
Here. Hold me.

507
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:35,690
Pull harder.

508
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,460
One, two, pull.

509
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
One, two, pull.

510
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,680
One, two, pull.

511
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,200
One, two, pull.

512
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,250
You go down first.

513
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,800
Slowly.

514
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:08,770
Be careful.

515
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:09,820
Okay.

516
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,830
Xiao Le.

517
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,200
Hold on.

518
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,180
Don't move.

519
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,230
Are you okay?

520
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,580
Xiao Le!

521
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,820
Lin Yicheng, it's dangerous!

522
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,740
Yicheng!

523
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,820
Yicheng!

524
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:34,970
Yicheng!

525
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,680
Lin Yicheng! Yicheng!

526
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,360
Watch out!

527
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,530
Lin Yicheng.

528
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,630
Yicheng!

529
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,300
Be careful.

530
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,410
Are you okay, Yicheng? Are you okay?

531
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:16,940
I'm fine.

532
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,720
Xiao Le, how are you?

533
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,800
Xiao Le, are you hurt?

534
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,760
I'm fine.

535
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,710
It's okay.

536
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,250
It's okay.

537
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,410
Thank you, uncle.

538
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,830
It's good that you're fine, Xiao Le.

539
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,570
Teacher, I'm done washing.

540
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,220
Okay.

541
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,030
Be careful not to get wet.

542
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:02,960
It's okay. I can do it myself.

543
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,620
Don't move.

544
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:14,770
Yicheng.

545
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,270
Just now I made a major mistake in my command.

546
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,070
Thanks to you.

547
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,090
Don't say that, Mr. Gu.

548
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,620
Who knows what would happen

549
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,720
at that moment?

550
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,500
Brother Yicheng.

551
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,580
How did you know

552
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,340
the ruins would collapse soon?

553
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,390
I'm not immortal. How would I know?

554
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,760
My daughter, Dou,

555
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,270
is similar to Xiao Le's age.

556
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,840
You won't understand.

557
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,440
the feeling of

558
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,950
worried about children

559
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,280
Are you done?

560
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:49,760
Yes.

561
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,400
Thank you.

562
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
Brother Yicheng.

563
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,140
I had a prejudice against you.

564
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,260
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:59,200
It's not your fault.

566
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,110
I'm really

567
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,420
not very advanced in work,

568
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,500
I didn't work hard.

569
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,590
Actually, I put my time and effort

570
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:13,570
on my child.

571
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,160
When Dou was one year old,

572
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,300
her mother

573
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,490
divorced me.

574
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,040
Her reason was

575
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:27,820
I didn't have time to spend with her

576
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,440
and give her enough sense of security.

577
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:31,230
So,

578
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,950
she left Dou to me and never came back.

579
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:36,700
Later,

580
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,200
my mom could take care of my child.

581
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,570
But she

582
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,340
is sick and in poor health.

583
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:47,440
So,

584
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,560
I can only take care of my daughter alone.

585
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,750
If you

586
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,210
need any help in the future,

587
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,180
just let me know.

588
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,490
Me too.

589
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,900
Count me in.

590
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,340
OK.

591
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,159
Thank you, everyone. Thank you.

592
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,360
Okay.

593
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:30,880
Are you done?

594
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,670
Let it go and try it.

595
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,320
I'm going to let it go.

596
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,159
Let it go.

597
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,190
OK?

598
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:37,960
Okay.

599
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,080
Alright.

600
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:39,940
When the kids come back,

601
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,670
they can have classes as usual.

602
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,330
How is it?

603
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,320
Try the basketball hoop.

604
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,790
Try it.

605
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,730
My hand is injured.

606
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,960
I'm with Mr. Gu.

607
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:50,880
My legs aren't working either.

608
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,610
I'm also with Brother Nanting.

609
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:53,880
What do you mean?

610
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,560
You underestimate me.

611
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,530
Okay, one on three.

612
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:59,350
Come on.

613
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,130
Xia Zhi.

614
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,920
Can you give me a few minutes?

615
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:22,980
Today,

616
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
it's too dangerous.

617
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,110
Don't do this again.

618
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,450
I knew you were still worried about me.

619
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,850
Regarding what happened before,

620
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,940
no matter what,

621
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,850
I have to apologize to you.

622
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,580
I was too angry.

623
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,480
I thought about it later.

624
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,290
I force you like that

625
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,730
is no different from my mom.

626
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,060
Do you remember the day we first met?

627
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,000
On a mountain road in Shangri-La,

628
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,540
It's very similar to here.

629
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,320
You were hitching a ride on the side of the road,

630
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,980
but none of them answered you.

631
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,970
To be honest,

632
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,920
I dared not let you get in my car.

633
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,140
Because you were

634
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,270
with dishevelled hair and a dirty face,

635
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,560
wearing a black down jacket

636
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
like a bear.

637
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,790
People might think

638
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,850
you came out to rob.

639
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,650
Was it easy for me?

640
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,510
I went on a poor trip after the college entrance exam.

641
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:26,020
I spent a month in the west.

642
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,090
I only have ten yuan left.

643
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:30,350
I hadn't taken a shower for a week.

644
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,600
But fate is so magical.

645
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,790
My car got stuck in the ditch.

646
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,950
You came and towed the car for me.

647
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,490
In that situation,

648
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,760
I had no choice

649
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,020
to let you get in my car.

650
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,320
Then I saw you.

651
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,320
Oh my god, it was a girl.

652
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,130
Then we became friends.

653
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,400
Then I found

654
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,080
this girl is so loyal.

655
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:00,110
She's more loyal than many boys.

656
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,760
Once I came back from Rio de Janeiro,

657
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,760
I had a high fever.

658
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,630
You spent a month's living expenses

659
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,430
coming from school to be with me.

660
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,720
At that time, I knew

661
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,640
I, Cheng Xiao,

662
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,500
will be your best friend forever.

663
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:23,400
Xia Zhi.

664
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:25,930
Can we not

665
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,600
fight over

666
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:30,070
with such a trivial matter anymore?

667
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,890
I apologized to you.

668
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:34,110
Can you forgive me?

669
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,290
Actually, last time,

670
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:44,940
I was wrong.

671
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,980
I didn't do my job well.

672
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:50,350
Yet I'm still complaining about you.

673
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:52,390
I'm afraid you'll look down on me.

674
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,520
How is that possible?

675
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,080
Ms. Ai told me

676
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,180
you had improved a lot at work.

677
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,450
In the publicity part,

678
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,050
you got the star of the month.

679
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,230
I'm more and more proud of you.

680
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,950
It turns out that you've been paying attention to me.

681
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,520
You're such a talent with great potential,

682
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,120
I have to pay attention to it.

683
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,510
Xia Zhi.

684
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,220
I sincerely hope

685
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,180
you can find a job

686
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,360
that suits you.

687
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,470
Let's pretend

688
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,570
nothing happened before, okay?

689
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:29,640
No.

690
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,510
Don't be like this.

691
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,200
They say that

692
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,760
if we reconcile after a conflict,

693
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,160
it means we are really close.

694
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,080
That's good.

695
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,740
Fine, I won't forget.

696
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,980
Come with me to get something.

697
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,840
OK. Be gentle. Don't strangle me.

698
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,090
Go to sleep.

699
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,480
Are you asleep?

700
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,560
I know you're not asleep.
