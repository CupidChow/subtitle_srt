Brother Nanting, we're leaving.

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,250
I have something on you.

7
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,340
Are you here to drink too?

8
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,540
Why did you drink so much?

9
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,450
I've been suspended again.

Why can't I drink?

11

12

I'll take you home. Let's go.

14
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,329
I have nothing now.

15
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:46,320
I asked for it.

Let's talk in the car.

OK.

58

I found the names of

59
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,810
the two pilots from Gansa and Merians.

60
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,000
Gansa and Merians

61
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,490
have tens of thousands of pilots.

62
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,790
How do you know it’s them?

63
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,830
Listen to their voices

64
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,600

Maintain flight level at 24,000 feet.

66
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,570
Right hand orbit. Gansa 263.

67
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,200
The spoken English of Gansa's captain

68
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,840
has a subtle Japanese accent.

69
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,240
He should be an old captain of Japanese descent.

70
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,110
I've checked the information

71
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,510
of all of Gansa's pilots.

72
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,760
There are two pilots of Japanese descent.

73
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,920
One was born in 1984

74
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,610
and the other was born in 1967.

75
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,170
The captain born in 1967

76
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,380
is called Fred.

77
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Maintain flight level at 22,000 feet.

78
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,090
Right hand orbit.

79
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,810
Merians 221.

80
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,400
I also investigated Merians' female pilot.

81
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,110
There are over 200 people in total.

82
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,240
How did you find her?

83
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,090
That day, Merians 221

84
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,560
was carried by an A350.

85
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,410
I've investigated it.

86
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,810
A350 planes are rare in Merians Airlines.

87
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,300
So there are not many pilots that fit the bill.

88
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,160
But there is only one female pilot

89
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,250
who can fly an A350.

90
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,720
I'll go find Fred

91
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,040
before going to Camille.

92
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,610
I want them to testify in court

93
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:07,140
and explain the real reason for the rotation.

94
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,890
But will they be willing

95
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,830
to come to China to testify?

96
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,650
That's what I need to do.

97
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,950

98
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:17,980
please

99
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,160
don't tell Cheng Xiao about this.

100

101
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,270

175
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,040
will you believe me?

176
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,010
I've read the minutes of the mediation meeting.

177
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,470
There's no solid evidence

178
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,870
on that point yet.

179
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,780
Not yet!

180
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,460
Cheng Xiao,

181
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,880
if you have any doubts,

182
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,710
you can investigate it slowly.

183
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,910
I support you on that.

184
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,720
But

185
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,210
without any actual evidence,

186
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,540
if you help passengers sue the company,

187
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:01,190
it will seem like

188
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,750
you are only venting your emotions from work.

189
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,740
All your efforts over the years,

190
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,660
and your dreams of flying

191
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,410
will all be for nothing.

192
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,470
Stop it.

193
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:30,570
I just want you

194
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,840
to see the situation for what it is.

195
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,670
Maybe now,

196
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,470
it's not too late to make amends.

Mr. Liu.

204
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,870
Captain Cheng, are you busy?

205
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:58,760
No.

206
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,000
I've been talking to

207
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,100
Mr. Guo and his family,

208
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
but they still cannot accept

209
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,290
the conditions proposed by Luzhou Airlines.

210
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,220
They insist that

211
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:09,530
Captain Jiang must apologize publicly.

212
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,380
Don’t worry, Captain Cheng.

213
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,240
We...

214
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,250
I am still looking for witnesses.

215
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,800
We still have a chance.

216
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,790
I will formally submit a complaint

217

to the court tomorrow.

218
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,130
The chain of custody of this case is simple.

219
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,740
We can go through expedited processing.

220
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,170
In that case,

221
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,300
the trial will begin in a week.

you will attend as a witness.

We're going to court?

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,120
After all, the mediation failed.

Okay.

I'll wait for your reply.

Mr. Gu,

244
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,480
I’ve spoken clearly on the phone.

245
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,280
Why are you so insistent about meeting in person?

246
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,660
Captain Fred,

247
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,500
I hope you will think carefully about this.

248
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,640
This is a very, very important matter.

249
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,390
I'm sorry.

250
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,490
I'm really not able to tell you

251
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,750
any of the details about what happened at the time.

252
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,660
We need the written permission of the company

253
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:39,230
to release that information.

254
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,530
But

255
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,880
this would mean one company has to send a letter to the other.

256
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,660
I can’t make that happen right now.

257
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,570
Captain Fred.

258
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:57,520
This involves the truth

259
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,910
that the deceased's family wishes to receive,

260
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,250
as well as the career

261

of an outstanding pilot.

00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,220
I can't go against the company's rules.

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:14,040

the court has officially accepted this case.

268
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,630
Because it is following a summary procedure,

269
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,360
the trial will be held in a week.

270
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:39,800
Okay.

Thank you.

272
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,120
When will Mr. Gu report back after his leave?

273

You don’t know either?

care about your leader?

now that you're withdrawing,

298
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,220

Is it

talk to him properly next time.

Even though I shouldn't interfere,

344

I still feel that

345
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,530
it's a pity

346
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,330
if we punish her

347
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,450
too severely.

348
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,140

00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,940
♫ I want to ask you ♫

523
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,970
♫ Are you ♫

524
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,690
♫ Waiting for your return in the wind ♫

525
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,580
Ladies and gentlemen,

526
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,240
I’m the captain of this flight, Xie Zetian.

527
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,110
Welcome onboard Luzhou Airlines.

528
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,580
I am glad to be able to

529
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,860
spend these two hours in the air with you.

530
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
These two hours

531
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,020
may be

532
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,680
just another passing moment in your life.

533
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,420
♫ Fly across the blue sky ♫

534
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,980
But this is the last flight of my career.

535
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,330
After this flight,

536
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,290
I will bid farewell to the cockpit,

537
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,430
♫ Thorns and rainbow will always be there ♫

538
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,960
and to the blue sky.

539
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,980
I'll remember today's sunlight,

540
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,840
♫ Fly across time ♫

541
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:24,620
the blue sky and clouds.

542
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,330
I will remember every traveler today.

543
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,470
♫ Travelling through mountains and seas ♫

544
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,600
It's you all who accompanied me

545
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,690
at the end of my flight career.

546
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,590
♫ I want to see you ♫

547
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,800
I started to fly when I was 20.

548
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,420
Until today,

549
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,890
it has been 37 years in total.

550
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,090
♫ I miss you ♫

551
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:43,440
♫ The wind accompanies my every night ♫

552
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,760
I've flown over 20 million kilometers.

553
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,030
To be able to

554
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,870
send every passenger

555
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:50,490
♫ I want to ask you ♫

556
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,950
safely to their destination every time

557
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,670
is my greatest achievement.

558
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,520
♫ Are you ♫

559
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,280
On this journey,

560
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:57,240
♫ Waiting in the wind for your return ♫

561
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,810
it's been my greatest honor

562
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,620
to travel with you.

563
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:04,450
♫ I want to see you ♫

564
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,580
I hope you can travel safe

565
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,880
in all of your future journeys.

566
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,690
♫ I'll miss you ♫

567
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,640
And I wish you a happy life.

568
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,670
♫ It's meaningful as long as you are by my side ♫

569
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:18,200
♫ I want to ask you ♫

570
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,000
♫ Is it that ♫

571
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:25,270
♫ Your original dream is within reach ♫

572
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:34,660
♫ I hope you will ♫

573
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:41,280
♫ Fly into the expanse of the bright sky ♫

574
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,770
I’m going to bid farewell to the passengers.

575
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,240
Captain Xie, I want to go too.

576
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,480
Captain, I want to go too.

577
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,590
Sure.

578
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,160
What do you think?

579
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,260
My outfit and attire

580
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,190
should be passable. Right, Mr. Gu?

581
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,940
Sorry, Master.

582
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,080
I couldn't make it to your farewell ceremony.

583
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,000
You shouldn't

584
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,590
focus on me now.

585
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,260
Where are you now?

586
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,370
I'm in Frankfurt.

587
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:33,890
I'm about to fly to Tokyo.

588
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,130
How's it going?

589
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,570
I don't know.

590
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,900
But I'll do my best.

591
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,380
Actually,

592
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,030
I have another favor to ask you.

593
00:40:47,370 --> 00:40:48,900
Is it regarding Cheng Xiao?

594
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,340
She is still

595
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:55,720
conflicted.

596
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,390
Press on.

597
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:04,940
Don't give up.

598
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:10,250
See you in the auditorium.

599
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,450
Thank you, Captain.

600
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,060
There will be

601
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,920
more flowers and applause later.

602
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,500
This is mine.

603
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:46,660
Thank you.

604
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:05,610
Why isn’t Mr. Gu here?

605
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:06,920
I heard he's sick.

606
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,450
He's been on leave for days.

607
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,130
So serious?

608
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,580
He's not here even for Mr. Xie's farewell ceremony?

609
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,830
Xiao.

610
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,900
Here.

611
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,490
Here.
