4
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,240
There are no passengers on the plane today.

5
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,970
I'll make a heavy landing later

6
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,080
to check the condition of the landing gear and tires.

7
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,240
Instructor Shang Fei said

8
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,170
as long as it doesn’t exceed the limit, it’ll be fine.

9
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,440
There's something wrong with the monitor.

10
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:54,890
What?

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,580
What's the problem?

12
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,970
The attitude indicator is not clear.

13
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,030
It's fine on my end.

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,130
I'll operate it.

15
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,310
It's okay. I can see the runway.

16
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,970
I'll switch to visual flight.

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,280
Luckily, we found the problem during the test flight.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,280
It would be troublesome if this were the first flight.

19
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,730
What's wrong with the monitor?

20
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:57,410
If there is really something wrong,

21
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,170
ask the Maintenance department to inform Shang Fei.

22
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,530
Check all the monitors

23
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,940
from the same batch.

24
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,820
Captain Gu.

25
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,730
What’s wrong with the monitor?

26
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,430
There's no problem.

27
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,310
The monitor is fine.

28
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,900
The plane is great.

29
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,690
What's wrong?

30
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,200
Get off the plane first.

31
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,860
I'll write the flight record.

32
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,329
I'll be right there.

33
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,170
Mr. Gu. Mr. Gu.

34
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,320
The macular degeneration

35
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,040
in your left eye has worsened.

36
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,160
That's why

37
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,560
your vision is blurry

38
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,980
in the center of your field of vision.

39
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,540
Then...

40
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
Do I need surgery?

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,490
Yes.

42
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:20,100
Injection surgery.

43
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,700
This disease

44
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,630
will affect

45
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:25,750
your work and life to a certain extent.

46
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,890
What do you do?

47
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,740
I’m a pilot.

48
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,480
What are you doing?

49
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,530
I've decided to do something very meaningful.

50
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,530
This has something to do with you.

51
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,340
You ignored me.

52
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,470
Gu Nanting.

53
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,460
You haven't replied my messages all afternoon.

54
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,900
I'll tell you anyway.

55
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,720
I wrote a unique

56
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,780
captain's announcement for the maiden flight for you.

57
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,380
Take a look when you're done.

58
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,460
By the way, President Xu wants to see me.

59
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm at the company.

60
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,080
What is it?

61
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,590
What do you think?

62
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,610
Why did President Xu tell me

63
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,140
I am now the captain for D191's maiden flight?

64
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,740
President Xu has talked to me.

65
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,540
As a leader of the Flight department,

66
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,080
my duties in management are more important.

67
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:29,880
So from now on,

68
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,780
I'll focus on management.

69
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,200
No.

70
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:35,580
Even so,

71
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,220
can't we wait until after the maiden flight?

72
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,920
On the day of the maiden flight,

73
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,840
I have to attend an important meeting

74
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,040
as a representative of the company.

75
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,440
What meeting could be more important than the maiden flight?

76
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,030
Is it because President Xu found out about our relationship

77
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,040
and wants you to remove yourself from your position?

78
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,040
Fine, I can quit.

79
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,300
Cheng Xiao, calm down.

80
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,360
This has nothing to do with our relationship.

81
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,140
This is work,

82
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,870
and more importantly, my responsibility.

83
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,870
You know it's your responsibility?

84
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:10,050
President Xu said

85
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,860
if you're the captain in charge,

86
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,130
it’ll be more helpful for the publicity of domestic planes.

87
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:16,730
Of course,

88
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,770
I’ll assign

89
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,190
an experienced secondary captain to you.

90
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,920
Don’t worry.

91
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm not worried about that.

92
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,630
It's you.

93
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,600
What happened?

94
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,270
We agreed

95
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,580
we will take the maiden flight together.

96
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,780
I have something more important to do.

97
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,250
Why didn't you talk to me

98
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,740
before you made such an important decision?

99
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,610
Do you consider me the person who is closest to you?

100
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,480
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,990
I didn't think it through.

102
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,570
But since the maiden flight's details have been decided,

103
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,830
I hope you can go on without distraction.

104
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,850
I don't know what

105
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,460
made you change so suddenly.

106
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,170
Mr. Gu,

107
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,160
have you decided to focus on career progression?

108
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,720
But you once said

109
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,350
you were first and foremost a pilot.

110
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,410
No matter how I think about it, I don’t think it’s possible.

111
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,960
Mr. Gu gave up flying

112
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,850
to focus on career progression.

113
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,190
This is so weird.

114
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:40,110
Do you have any better explanations?

115
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,740
If I did,

116
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,620
I wouldn't have

117
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,170
spent an hour here with you.

118
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:47,200
Come on.

119
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,980
You're just waiting for Song to land

120
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,740
so you can go to see the wedding planner together.

121
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,130
Don’t be angry with Mr. Gu.

122
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,290
At least both of you qualified

123
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,690
to fly the maiden flight.

124
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,460
Look at me.

125
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,860
I postponed the wedding

126
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,270
for this maiden flight.

127
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,810
I dragged Song with me

128
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,160
to sign up.

129
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,360
In the end,

130
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,270
the bride wasn't lucky enough to be picked,

131
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,600
but the bridesmaid was.

132
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,720
Yuheng is also flying on the maiden flight.

133
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,700
I'm so jealous.

134
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,900
The fates are so cruel to me.

135
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,070
You've already passed the transition training.

136
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:30,070
Sooner or later,

137
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,650
you will make it onto a domestic plane.

138
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,920
Luckily, Song Xiaoni didn't make it either.

139
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,640
Otherwise,

140
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,830
my status at home in the future

141
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,340
will be doomed.

142
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,100
Here.

143
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:47,940
Coming.

144
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,730
Xiao is here too?

145
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,220
She has something to ask you.

146
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,020
What's wrong?

147
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,910
These past two days, you've been working with Gu Nanting

148
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,720
the whole time you haven't been flying, right?

149
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,090
Yes.

150
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,940
We're amending the safety manual for domestic planes.

151
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,740
Has there been anything strange

152
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,850
about him recently?

153
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:04,270
Strange?

154
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,810
Did you two fight?

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,380
No.

156
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,010
You didn't know Mr. Gu

157
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,290
suddenly quit the maiden flight of D191?

158
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:17,670
Now I know.

159
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,290
Who is flying it then?

160
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,320
Xiao?

161
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,410
Congratulations!

162
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:26,310
Why did Brother Nanting quit?

163
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,600
Song,

164
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,180
please keep an eye on Gu Nanting for me

165
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,720
in the coming days.

166
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,100
Don't miss

167
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,990
any details.

168
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,590
If you notice anything strange about him,

169
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,990
let me know immediately.

170
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:39,390
Okay.

171
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,050
I know this job best.

172
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,760
I'll get a glass of water.

173
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,160
Okay.

I've sent your medical records

to Director Yang of the Central Hospital.

180
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,730
He said the probability of a complete recovery is very high.

He's the best ophthalmic surgeon in Luzhou.

He said the surgery is not difficult.

184

He only has to

185
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,400
inject some medicine into your eyes.

186
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,960
When he comes back from Shanghai next week,

I could keep flying until I retired.
