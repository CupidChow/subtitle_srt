[Episode 8]

4
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,340
Dad, Happy New Year.

5
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,750
Happy New Year, Xiaoxiao.

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,890
Where are you today?

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,009
You must wear more clothes.

8
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:55,070
Don't catch a cold.

9
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm in Sanya.

10
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,630
It's very warm here.

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,570
Next year...

12
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll bring you guys...

13
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,900
You can come on New Year's Eve for a vacation.

14
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:07,740
Okay.

15
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,880
Where is my mom?

16
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,220
She's in the study.

17
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,690
Should I ask her to answer the phone?

18
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,550
I'll go get her.

19
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,920
No, no, no.

20
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,600
I was just asking.

21
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,290
Hello.

22
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,270
Mom.

23
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,570
Happy New Year.

24
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,800
Happy New Year.

25
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,820
You'll be back tomorrow, right?

26
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,570
My schedule was delayed by a day.

27
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,880
I can only go back on the 2nd day of the new year.

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,520
Good.

29
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,510
Take this chance to get some sleep

30
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,570
and stop working on other things.

31
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,130
Okay, don't worry.

32
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660
Sanya is warm.

33
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,610
Remember to wear more clothes when you come back.

34
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,570
I'm going to bed.

35
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,060
Were you talking to Madam Qin on the phone?

36
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,840
Happy New Year, Madam.

37
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,170
How many times have I told you?

38
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,900
Just call me Sister in private.

39
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,090
I'm only a few years older than you.

40
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,370
I'm not on the same level of seniority as your Master.

41
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,030
We can't mess up formalities.

42
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,190
I'll call Master to pay my New Year's greetings.

43
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,250
Call him tomorrow.

44
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,570
We just talked on the phone.

45
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,500
He's asleep now.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,260
I've conveyed your well wishes to him.

47
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,370
After so many years,

48
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,510
our Captain Gu has made it.

49
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,110
Now,

50
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,800
Madam Qin and your Master

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,880
must be relieved.

52
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,470
Ms. Ai, Captain Gu,

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,110
come and take a photo with the fireworks!

54
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,620
Coming.

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,800
Go ahead. I'm going back to my room.

56
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,360
I have work to do.

57
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,160
What gesture?

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,130
It must be this gesture.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,770
Isn't Captain Gu going?

60
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:08,920
He said he has work to do.

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,450
Let's go.

62
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,550
Move out of the center position.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,920
Come on.

64
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,440
Come on.

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,070
Okay.

66
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,360
One, two, three.

67
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,680
Happy New Year!

68
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
Brother Nanting.

69
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:50,930
Morning.

70
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,740
Lemonade, to relieve your headache.

71
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,890
I drank too much last night.

72
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,650
I'm glad you're fine.

73
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:06,530
Don't drink so much in the future.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,860
Okay.

75
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,420
I think everyone went to the beach.

76
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,120
I heard you didn't want the seaview room.

77
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:25,950
Do you

78
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,920
not like the sea?

79
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,870
Let's take photos here.

80
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,170
This is nice.

81
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,570
Let's go over there.

82
00:05:59,260 --> 00:05:59,830
Isn't it beautiful?

83
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,260
Yue,

84
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:02,500
I'm not playing with the cabin crew.

85
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,920
Did anyone flirt with you?

86
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,120
How is that possible?

87
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,280
With my looks,

88
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,490
no one other than the airport police dog will like me.

89
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:10,750
Let me show you the sea.

90
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,280
Song, come and take photos.

91
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,250
T- The signal suddenly cut off.

92
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,420
Ignore him. Let's take photos by ourselves.

93
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,030
Let me show you our flight attendant.

94
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,150
How is she?

95
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,010
Are you relieved now?

96
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,380
Let me show you around.

97
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,100
I'm going back to my room.

98
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Go play with them.

99
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,220
I’ll go back to my room too.

100
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,720
Cheng Xiao is awesome.

101
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,350
Brother Nanting!

102
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,540
Cheng Xiao!

103
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,680
Cheng Xiao!

104
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,340
Cheng Xiao!

105
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:16,930
Come back!

106
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Brother Nanting!

107
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,600
What are you doing?

108
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,230
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

109
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,010
Let's go.

110
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,010
Are you crazy?

111
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,190
What are you doing?

112
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,160
Let go!

113
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:56,920
Let go of me!

114
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,970
What are you doing?

115
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,030
What are you doing?

116
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,560
Are you crazy?

117
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,380
Who asked you to swim?

118
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,660
Why can't I swim?

119
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,210
Don't you know the sea is dangerous?

120
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,350
What if something happens?

121
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,620
What could happen?

122
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,310
I grew up by the sea.

123
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,090
From now on,

124
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,180
you're not allowed to swim in the sea,

125
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,360
ride a jetski,

126
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,050
or play any other adventure sport!

127
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:25,850
Who are you to control me?

128
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,800
I'm your instructor!

129
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,080
You are just my instructor!

130
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,010
It doesn't mean you can control me!

131
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,550
What if something happens,

132
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,810
and you hurt yourself?

133
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,410
Do you still want to fly?

134
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:42,920
In your eyes,

135
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,690
am I no different

136
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,350
from an engine, or a wing?

137
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,620
Aren't you just afraid that I'll spoil and become unusable,

138
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,730
and bring you trouble?

139
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,840
You are my student.

140
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,360
I'm responsible for you.

141
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,920
I don't need you to be responsible for me.

142
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,320
Please stay away from me.

143
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,210
At least be responsible for yourself.

144
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,240
Wash your ears so they don't get infected

145
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,920
and affect your piloting.

146
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,350
Brother Nanting,

147
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,870
the showers are over there.

148
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:03,210
[Two days later]

149
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,100
Have you reflected

150
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,280
on your first flight?

151
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,840
With respect to calling the police,

152
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,970
I admit I mishandled

153
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,220
it on my end.

154
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,640
That's all?

155
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,580
That's all.

156
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,730
You involved yourself in the cabin

157
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,220
without permission from your captain.

158
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,710
While you were away, you engaged in high-risk watersports.

159
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,920
You lack a serious attitude towards your work.

160
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,520
This time,

161
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,800
you will be suspended for a week,

162
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,540
and your bonus for this month will be deducted.

163
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,280
Which one of your points

164
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,980
is explicitly stated in the operational manual?

165
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,140
My expectations of you

166
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,070
go beyond the operational manual.

167
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,960
The operational manual is only the bottom line.

168
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,350
You mustn't hold yourself to the standards of the bottom line.

169
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,880
Besides,

170
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,420
I'll apply for more terms to be added

171
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,100
to the relevant sections of the operational manual.

172
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,760
Gu Nanting,

173
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,650
You're changing the manual?

174
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,190
Are you targeting me?

175
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:05,870
You simply

176
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,640
provided me with negative examples.

177
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,000
I have a meeting.

178
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,680
Go back and reflect on-

179
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,420
[Excellent Air Team]

180
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,320
Come in.

181
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,170
Nanting.

182
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,260
Director Jiang, you wanted to see me?

183
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,830
We received a complaint.

184
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:41,970
Sit.

185
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,210
It's

186
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:48,530
someone named Ms. Zhang.

187
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,970
She complained that

188
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,120
the flight she took on New Year's Eve

189
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,640
was cancelled.

190
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,030
The flight was cancelled because of the weather.

191
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,360
The airport was closed.

192
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,780
Ms. Zhang named Cheng Xiao specifically

193
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,270
in her complaint.

194
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,240
It was due to Cheng Xiao's mismanagement

195
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,210
that the flight was cancelled.

196
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,810
Cheng Xiao did indeed make a mistake.

197
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,140
There is an even more serious complaint

198
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,350
from

199
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,060
a First Class passenger with a Platinum card.

200
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,530
It also

201
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,150
accuses Cheng Xiao of negligence.

202
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,920
You know how serious

203
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,610
a Platinum card complaint is.

204
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,630
I have already punished Cheng Xiao

205
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,720
for her mistake

206
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:35,580
with a week of suspension, and deduction of this month's bonus.

207
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,990
Just one week?

208
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,520
Have you forgotten

209
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,650
about Kain's complaint in Australia?

210
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:41,940
Added to these two cases,

211
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,200
she's broken a record.

212
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,460
A one week suspension?

213
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,570
In my opinion,

214
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,320
it would be lenient if you demoted her to an observer.

215
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,880
The way she handles things

216
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:52,100
and her attitude

217
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,350
are too immature.

218
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,310
She's a ticking time bomb.

219
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,380
Now, it seems

220
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,130
we made a wrong decision

221
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,130
when we accepted her.

222
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,070
Director Jiang,

223
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,320
I agree with you.

224
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,310
The way she handled things,

225
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,860
and her attitude this time, were immature.

226
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,790
But I cannot dismiss her entirely.

227
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,720
She didn't act willfully in this whole situation,

228
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,150
she acted with her own reasons.

229
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,200
Afterwards, she proactively made up for it.

230
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,780
I don't care what her reasons were.

231
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,910
The complaint letters are right here.

232
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,390
I suggest

233
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,140
we transfer her to the Ground Handling Department.

234
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,870
Let her train there for a while.

235
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:36,800
Piloting and Ground Handling are completely different.

236
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,790
No pilot has ever been

237
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,030
transferred to Ground Handling.

238
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,230
And I've never seen

239
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,230
such a pilot.

240
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,520
We must use special methods

241
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,390
for special people like her.

242
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,840
I don't think it's appropriate.

243
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,070
Nanting.

244
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,100
You said it yourself.

245
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,110
Among these pilots,

246
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,530
Cheng Xiao's technique is excellent.

247
00:16:58,530 --> 00:16:59,400
I admit that.

248
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,090
But her problem is with her temperament.

249
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,109
Tranferring her to Ground Handling

250
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:06,240
is precisely to hone her temperament.

251
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:08,599
If she is excellent enough,

252
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,180
she will definitely persist

253
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,040
and make better progress, right?

254
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,500
We will be announcing the cross-departmental training

255
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,180
at next week's meeting.

256
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,200
You've only been here for a few days.

257
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,160
Why are there so many things?

258
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,180
Do you miss me?

259
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,540
Just tell me if you don't want me to go.

260
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:49,680
Go, now.

261
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,150
Alright.

262
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,000
In a few months,

263
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,240
my baby will be able to live in a new house.

264
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,020
By the way,

265
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,290
the membership cards of several restaurants nearby,

266
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,160
and the username and password for the streaming platform

267
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,890
are all here.

268
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,720
They're for you.

269
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,340
Take it.

270
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:18,890
And this.

271
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,930
I just bought it. It's not used yet.

272
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:22,970
It smells so good.

273
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,300
I'll leave them all to you.

274
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,210
I'll put them here.

275
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:25,630
Wait.

276
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,030
If you give them to me, what will you use?

277
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,670
You're facing a financial crisis,

278
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,980
I can't help you much.

279
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:35,600
When I get my salary,

280
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,420
just tell me if you need anything, okay?

281
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,470
Do you really want to pay my bills?

282
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:43,870
Of course.

283
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,320
Who else will, if I don't?

[Gu Nanting]

285
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,090
Hello.

286
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,440
The Customer Service Department

287
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,470
received two complaints about you

288
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,800
regarding this flight.

289
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,320
At the meeting next week,

290
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,120
I want you to admit your mistake.

291
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:11,970
I will only admit the mistake I did make.

292
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,980
Anyway, during the meeting,

293
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,730
you must be sincere in your self-reflection.

294
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:17,790
Do you understand?

295
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,710
Is it that to you,

296
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,110
everything I do is wrong?

297
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,160
What's wrong?

298
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:58,880
Cheng Xiao,

299
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:00,480
go ahead.

300
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,820
Sir,

301
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,680
I mishandled the situation

302
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,400
in calling the police.

303
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,620
I did not consider

304
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,040
the flight procedure after takeoff

305
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,570
before calling the police.

306
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,920
The flight was delayed

307
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,800
and didn't take off on time as a result.

308
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,300
I need to

309
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,700
reflect deeply on myself regarding this matter.

310
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,830
I will not make the same mistake again.

311
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,740
But on the plane,

312
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,680
there were disorderly passengers.

313
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,190
Our standard protocol is to call the police

314
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:32,760
to mitigate any hidden risks.

315
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,220
Moreover, it does not violate any official rules

316
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,220
for pilots to settle cabin matters.

317
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:44,580
Nanting.

318
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:47,090
This is your student.

319
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:49,540
What should we do?

320
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,230
Director Jiang.

321
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,430
I was the Captain on that flight.

322
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,830
It’s my responsibility.

323
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,500
I will take full responsibility.

324
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,610
Why?

325
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,420
You did nothing wrong.

326
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,080
I told you.

327
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,150
Your mistake is my mistake.

328
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,700
Now that a passenger has complained,

329
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,490
I'll bear

330
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:10,350
the consequences myself.

331
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,890
It's none of your business.

332
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,640
No matter what,

333
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,950
I will still have to take responsibility.

334
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,940
I'll write a self-criticism and go on a one week suspension,

335
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,140
as well as forfeit my bonus for this month.

336
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,010
You don't have to pretend to be nice.

337
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,270
Didn't you already suspend me for a week?

338
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:30,850
Calm down.

339
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,900
As a Captain,

340
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,660
Nanting is indeed responsible.

341
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:39,920
We'll discuss

342
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,410
what to do later.

343
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,450
Now,

344
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:48,090
we are talking about Cheng Xiao.

345
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,410
You're not just suspended.

346
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,770
Considering the complaints this time,

347
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,230
the company has decided

348
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:17,960
to transfer you to the Ground Handling Department for training.

349
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,800
What did you say?

350
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:29,330
We're transferring you to Ground Handling.

351
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,590
Why didn't you tell me

352
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:55,050
you were in trouble?

353
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,340
Right.

354
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,530
As the Chief of Security

355
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,370
I shouldn't interfere

356
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,310
in Flight Department business.

357
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,780
Let's just stick to the facts.

358
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:10,880
The punishment for Cheng Xiao

359
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,610
is too harsh.

360
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,490
As a member of management,

361
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,470
Jiang Tao values stability the most.

362
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,910
Cheng Xiao was unlucky,

363
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,930
complaints against pilots

364
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,290
look bad on him.

365
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,310
Cheng Xiao

366
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,390
is a bit bad for you.

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,860
Since you became her instructor,

368
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,940
the second punishment of your career

369
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,790
is coming.

370
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,310
This is my duty as an instructor.

371
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,010
The punishments you have received because of your students

372
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:46,810
outnumber mine by a wide margin.

373
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,810
You did a background check on me?

374
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,240
That's right.

375
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,330
Being responsible is more important than avoiding punishment.

376
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,270
Don't look at me.

377
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,340
I've talked to Cheng Xiao once.

378
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,360
It won't work this time.

379
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,260
It's up to her.

you were doing the job you have always dreamed of.

428

I don't want to influence your decision.

But you are obviously having doubts.

I suggest you think carefully about this.

431

to be able to realize my dream little by little.

433
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,010
But now,

434
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,660
my dream is about to shatter.

435
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,080

Don't worry.

475
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,230
I've been learning for so long,

476
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,180
and flying for so long.

477
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,140
I won't give up so easily.

478
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,440
One day,

479
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,220
I'll make Gu Nanting admit that

480
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,210
I, Cheng Xiao,

481
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,790
am qualified to be a pilot,

482
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,480
and a captain.

483
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,880
When I was playing with Wang Fan,

484
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
I scored more than ten goals.

485
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:51,440
Now that you've come,

486
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,640
I've only gotten two.

487
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,620
Defense is similar to flying.

488
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,580
It depends on calm judgment

489
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,140
to secure the bottom line.

490
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,530
I remember when I first met you,

491
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,830
you had just joined the school team in your freshman year.

492
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:06,230
You loved attacking.

493
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:09,270
You didn't respect the upperclassmen at all.

494
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,360
I think that kind of brash attitude

495
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,760
doesn't suit me anymore.

496
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:13,840
Enough.

497
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,190
Don't act innocent.

498
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,010
You became the star player three months after joining the school team.

499
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,230
I could only be a substitute.

500
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,750
Do you know why?

501
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,720
For four years in college,

502
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,120
I only had one pair of knockoff sneakers.

503
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,510
My family was poor back then.

504
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,920
I didn't want to run too much

505
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,410
in those pair of shoes.

506
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,700
The coach could only bench me.

507
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:49,680
People thought it was because you had no stamina.

508
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,280
I was young

509
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:55,290
and easily embarrassed.

510
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,390
You know what?

511
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,760
My first pair of authentic sneakers

512
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,620
was the birthday gift you gave me.

513
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,580
That pair of shoes...

514
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,840
Every time I finished playing,

515
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,440
I would wipe them clean

516
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,520
before ever so carefully

517
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,520
putting them back into the shoe box.

518
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,040
At that time, I thought to myself,

519
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,030
one day,

520
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I will achieve the financial freedom to buy sneakers.

521
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,880
Now, the sneakers freedom of the entire Maintenance Department

522
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,050
is yours.

523
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:28,160
Let's go. I'll buy you a meal to celebrate.

524
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,090
Celebrate what?

525
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,560
Didn't your Maintenance Department just receive

526
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,690
the outstanding contribution award?

527
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,080
You really care about me, young man.

528
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:57,690
I'm exhausted.

529
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,570
The last two boxes.

530
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,150
I'm new here.

531
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,330
Nice to meet you.

532
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,600
Stop it.

533
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,750
I just want

534
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:17,690
to learn more from you.

535
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:18,960
Don't stand on ceremony.

536
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,560
Let's learn from each other.

537
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,010
By the way, Xiazhi,

538
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,380
I want to discuss something with you.

539
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,350
It's just...

540
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,110
can we sleep in the same room?

541
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,740
What do you mean?

542
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:36,500
I have my own room...

543
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,510
I just...

544
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,850
I often have nightmares when I sleep.

545
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,110
I'm scared.

546
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,810
So you're a scaredy-cat...

547
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,930
It's no big deal.

548
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:53,400
I'll protect you.

549
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,110
I was born to ward off evil.

550
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,760
Ghosts and spirits dare not come near me.

551
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,850
Thank you.

552
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,600
I've cleaned the room.

553
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,720
Do you want to go take a look?

554
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,790
Lead the way!

555
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,880
This is the bathroom in the master bedroom.

556
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:17,400
There's even room service?

557
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,030
Your bed is so clean.

558
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,590
My mom always says my bed is like a pigsty.

559
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,800
It's okay. I'll teach you how to make your bed.

560
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,800
When we upgrade to the first class

561
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,330
and go on long haul flights,

562
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,170
we'll need to learn how to fold blankets anyway.

563
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,200
Yuheng, you're too sweet.

564
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,660
Your boyfriend is so lucky.

565
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,230
I don't have a boyfriend yet.

566
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,790
Stop acting.

567
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,600
Everyone knows your boyfriend.

568
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,450
is Captain Gu.

569
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,730
He's not.

570
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,370
No, you misunderstood.

571
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,920
We were close when we were kids.

572
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,920
We haven't seen each other in years.

573
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,720
That's why we reconnected

574
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,650
after we entered Luzhou Airlines.

575
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,860
There's nothing between us yet.

576
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,950
Yet?

577
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:11,070
That means something is coming?

578
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,750
I understand.

579
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,670
Just do your best.

580
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,630
I'll support you from the back!

581
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,540
All right, I'll help you pack up.

582
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,750
Are you shy?

583
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:46,740
[Domestic Flight Information]

584
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,190
[Dai Wei, Head of Ground Handling Department]

585
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,240
Here.

586
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,550
Cheng,

587
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,800
Just follow Yu

588
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,800
from our department.

589
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,600
He'll show you the ropes.
