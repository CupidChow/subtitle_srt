[Episode 21]

4
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,170
Do you want the chilies?

5
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,390
No, thanks.

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,940
Here we are.

7
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,440
Wait.

8
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,070
Is this

9
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,400
the best and the most expensive?

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:44,789
Yes.

11
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,490
Here.

12
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,610
I'm so lucky today.

13
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,030
There's still a vacancy.

14
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,720
This shop

15
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,120
was the best and the most expensive

16
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,240
for me, who just started my career.

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,860
When I first joined the Freight Department,

18
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,850
every time I flew back,

19
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,510
it was the middle of the night.

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,240
I ate a lot of junk food abroad.

21
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,440
So my first meal back

22
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,520
had to be porridge.

23
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,190
It was the only way my stomach would feel better.

24
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,079
Although the environment here is ordinary,

25
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,770
their ingredients are very fresh.

26
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,090
And their sauce

27
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,990
is very particular.

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,140
This is the full feast in my heart.

29
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,500
Good evening, handsome boy and beautiful girl.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,930
-Welcome.
-Boss.

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,640
Aren't you Cheng?

32
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,320
It's me.

33
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:37,270
Long time no see.

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,910
Is this your...

35
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,010
boyfriend?

36
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,090
I'm her instructor.

37
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,930
Do you teach flying?

38
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:48,900
Yes.

39
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,560
You're amazing.

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,400
You

41
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,730
are handsome and capable.

42
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,520
Of course.

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,320
Our leader is very popular with the girls.

44
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,240
Really? Well...

45
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,850
How about we order first?

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,070
We've been consistent for ten years.

47
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,840
You haven't changed. I won't look at it then.

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
I want two portions of seafood porridge

49
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
and boiled Chinese kale.

50
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,090
Can I order another spicy crab?

51
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,740
Sure.

52
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,380
Okay.

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,240
What would you like to drink?

54
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,970
We brought it, boss. Thank you.

55
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:18,980
Help yourself.

56
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,050
Go ahead.

57
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,400
Okay.

58
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,700
The boss is very enthusiastic.

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,770
When will Song come?

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,880
He's not coming.

61
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:35,750
He said you need to treat us separately to show your sincerity.

62
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,150
Then you can only treat him alone next time.

63
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,040
Come on, open it.

64
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,350
Shake it first.

65
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,290
The cork will pop out after shaking.

66
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,420
It'll be dangerous.

67
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,540
How is it dangerous?

68
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,700
You have to shake it hard.

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,360
It'll be more fun if it pops out.

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,210
Shake it.

71
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,990
Shake it harder.

72
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,519
Harder.

73
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,950
I can do it myself.

74
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:55,590
Come on.

75
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,120
Let's celebrate your great ambition

76
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,920
has come true.

77
00:04:59,330 --> 00:04:59,860
A little.

78
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,850
I have to drive later.

79
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,960
You may drink it.

80
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,310
You can find a designated driver.

81
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,320
Call a designated driver later.

82
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,490
Just this once.

83
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,630
Don't do it again.

84
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,110
What's wrong with you? Yuheng.

85
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,170
Did Captain Gu reply to your message?

86
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,110
Yes, he did.

87
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,840
When are you going to eat?

88
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,070
He said...

89
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,060
He said he wanted to eat, but he didn't say when.

90
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,240
Don't worry.

91
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,960
Captain Gu

92
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,850
just hasn't decided where to eat.

93
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,330
He's so cautious.

94
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,250
Shouldn't he choose carefully?

95
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
I admire her talent.

96
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,110
I admire her courage, passion,

97
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,960
and persistence in this job more.

98
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,540
Thank you.

99
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,570
Your hair.

100
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,890
Take this off for me.

101
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,340
Here comes the boiled Chinese kale.

102
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:40,670
Here.

103
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,700
Okay.

104
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,360
Let me tell you.

105
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,080
Pour some soy sauce over top.

106
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,650
This sauce is with less salt.

107
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,890
Boss, do you have wet tissues?

108
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:49,670
Yes.

109
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,909
I just ran out of it. Sorry.

110
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,020
About this...

111
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,590
Then I...

112
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,710
Handsome leader.

113
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,590
Help her braid.

114
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,940
It's okay. I'll be careful.

115
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,400
Is it okay?

116
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,520
Thank you.

117
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,560
Hello.

118
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
I lost to my friends

119
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,950
in Truth or Dare.

120
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,500
May I have your WeChat?

121
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,330
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,440
I don't want my boyfriend to add others on WeChat.

123
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,250
Why don't you add me?

124
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,630
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:33,510
What did he say?

126
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,640
Did he give it to you?

127
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,950
Don't move.

128
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,490
They are looking at us.

129
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,090
Look at that woman.

130
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,340
He has a girlfriend.

131
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,700
That's his girlfriend.

132
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,040
Let's eat.

133
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,530
You lied just now.

134
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,480
What?

135
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,980
I misunderstood you.

136
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,240
You actually want to give WeChat to them.

137
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,430
That's not what I meant. I...

138
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,450
Let's play

139
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,530
Truth or Dare.

140
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,000
How about rock-paper-scissors?

141
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,280
No.

142
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:02,950
Scissors.

143
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,550
You lost, Dare.

144
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,880
How about this? Have a spicy crab.

145
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,710
Come on.

146
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,440
Have one.

147
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,910
I'll eat it myself.

148
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,670
You can't use chopsticks. Use your hands.

149
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,170
You can chew it with your hands.

150
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,480
Why is it so...

151
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,120
No.

152
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,760
That's because you don't eat much normally.

153
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,720
Eat more.

154
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,490
I'm not eating anymore.

155
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,220
One more.

156
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,400
I don't want it. It's too spicy. I don't want it.

157
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:53,920
No.

158
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,790
You have to eat if you lose.

159
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,540
[Li Yuheng: Brother Nanting, are you free this weekend? Let's go visit Auntie Qin.]

160
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,150
Eat three.

161
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,190
Alright.

162
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,680
No more.

163
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:01,900
That's all.

164
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:05,920
I want some water.

165
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,720
No.

166
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,220
Sir, stop.

167
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:33,920
OK.

168
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,290
Yuheng.

169
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,850
Brother Nanting.

170

Xiao.

171
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,260
What's wrong? Are you okay?

172
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,400
You didn't reply to my Wechat message.

173
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,740
I was worried about you.

174
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,960
So I came to see you.

175
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,210
-I just…
-What could happen to him?

176
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,630
Ms. Cheng, did you come back together?

177
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,370
What a coincidence.

178
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,230
Yes. What a coincidence.

179
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,120
Did you wait long?

180
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,940
Not really.

181
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,210
I waited for an hour.

182
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,150
But it's okay.

183
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,200
Yuheng. You come here once in a while.

184
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,440
Let's go to my house.

185
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,350
Have some tea.

186
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,720
Why don't you two drink? I'll go home first.

187
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,910
Together.

188
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,380
Get in the car.

189
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,640
Brother Nanting.

190
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:48,070
Did you drink?

191
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,110
Yes.

192
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:51,810
We drank a little.

193
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,470
Get in.

194
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,430
Here, have some tea.

195
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,610
Yuheng, have some tea.

196
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:16,210
Thank you.

197
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,650
Is this our company's air route?

198
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,290
-Yes.
-Yeah.

199
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:26,870
Not only that,

200
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,670
but this is also all the air routes Instructor Gu has flown

201
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,310
and my future goal.

202
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,270
Make it up.

203
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,260
The one you flew last week is across China.

204
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,370
Ms. Cheng, you work so hard.

205
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,900
I need to learn from you.

206
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,910
Don't say that. You're too modest.

207
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,410
You're the fastest to upgrade among your peers.

208
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,270
Sit down first.

209
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,740
Have some tea.

210
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,110
I met Ms. Ai two days ago.

211
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,140
She told me

212
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,220
you had improved a lot recently.

213
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,980
You know how to reject

214
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,680
when passengers make unreasonable demands.

215
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,180
Ms. Ai has been helping me.

216
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,380
She made me realize

217
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,860
many of my problems.

218
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,360
Next week, you guys will have a refresher training.

219
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,620
Take this opportunity

220
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,040
to improve your professional quality.

221
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,810
Are you the devil instructor again?

222
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,780
I'm just one of the refresher training instructors.

223
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,670
Nor a devil.

224
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,600
Well,

225
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,570
it's getting late. I'm leaving.

226
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,080
Sit for a while longer.

227
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,140
I'll go back first.

228
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,190
Xiazhi has filmed a few short videos.

229
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,250
She's waiting for my opinion at home.

230
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,050
Yuheng.

231
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,290
How's Xiazhi recently?

232
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,090
Is she okay?

233
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,230
She's fine.

234
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,690
She seems to like the work of PR.

235
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,410
Xiao, haven't you made up?

236
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,370
She doesn't even want to talk to me.

237
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:09,370
It's okay. We'll talk about it after the refresher training.

238
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,600
I'll call a taxi for you.

239
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,110
No need.

240
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,740
It's okay. I'll see her off.

241
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:14,690
Let's go.

242
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,280
Safe journey.

243
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,190
The car will arrive in five minutes.

244
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,360
Thank you, Brother Nanting

245
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,220
You're welcome

246
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Brother Nanting,

247
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,840
I think

248
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,560
you get along well with Ms. Cheng.

249
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,740
She has improved a lot.

250
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
As an instructor,

251
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,660
I'm very satisfied.

252
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,569
Yuheng.

253
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,079
Actually,

254
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,990
I've always wanted to ask you.

255
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,610
Why do you suddenly want to be a flight attendant

256
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:31,920
after graduation?

257
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:34,870
Actually,

258
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,420
it's because...

259
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,590
Curious?

260
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,280
I was curious at first,

261
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,260
but I liked it more and more after that.

262
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,520
I hope

263
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,940
you can not only find a job

264
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:57,800
but also

265
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,110
find a career that you are willing to sacrifice for it.

266
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:02,320
Ms. Ai and Ms. Liang

267
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,590
have taught me a lot.

268
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,220
Brother Nanting,

269
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,480
pilots are a career.

270
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,950
Flight attendants are also a career.

271
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,350
All these years,

272
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:23,130
I've always treated you as my best sister.

273
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,150
I hope everything will go well with you.

274
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,870
I see.

275
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,670
Thank you, Brother Nanting.

276
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Brother Nanting.

277
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,880
Do you also treat Cheng Xiao

278
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,090
as your sister?

279
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,930
The car is here.

280
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,070
Get in.

281
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,810
Tell me when you get home safely.

282
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:18,840
Goodbye, Brother Nanting.

283
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,340
Bye.

284
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,480
Gu Nanting.

285
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,200
Are you a central air conditioner?

286
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,310
Shut you down.

287
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,460
The refresher training will begin soon.

288
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,190
Why am I still a little nervous?

289
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,720
What are you nervous about the refresher training?

290
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm most afraid of jumping from the slide in there.

291
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,560
One by one.

292
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,690
Like penguins.

293
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,610
Hello, Mr. Ni. Hello, Mr. Gu.

294
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,530
Song, you go first.

295
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,000
Mr. Ni, Brother Nanting.

296
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,600
-I have to go.
-Brother Zhan.

297
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,030
Brother Zhan.

298
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,790
Mr. Gu.

299
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,100
Brother Zhan, do you have a pet?

300
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,840
How do you know?

301
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,770
I guessed it.

302
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
You're so casual and amicable.

303
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,120
You're obviously a loving person.

304
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,080
So I guess...

305
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,140
What you're up to?

306
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,520
Here's the thing.

307
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,200
I'm going to a refresher training for a week.

308
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
I have a little parrot at home.

309
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,730
Can you keep it for me for a few days?

310
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,650
Parrot? No problem.

311
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,320
When is the handover?

312
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,560
How about now?

313
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,990
I have a meeting later.

314
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,440
How about this afternoon?

315
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,170
Okay, I'll wait for you at home.

316
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,200
My house is in the building

317
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,940
opposite Mr. Gu's house.

318
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,810
You should know that place.

319
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,240
What a coincidence.

320
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,580
She's my tenant.

321
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,240
Why don't we visit the parrot together?

322
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,450
I have to work overtime. I won't join you.

323
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,310
Okay, go ahead.

324
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,620
Don't make the same mistake

325
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,680
in this refresher training anymore.

326
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Instructor Gu, are you so worried about me?

327
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,290
See you later.

328
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,440
Okay, thank you, Brother Zhan.

329
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,000
Coming.

330
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,070
Hello.

331
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,090
Brother Zhan, please come in.

332
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,890
I'll go in now.

333
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,290
These are your shoes.

334
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:23,220
Okay, thank you.

335
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,690
I'm packing up.

336
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,470
Oh, really?

337
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,600
I'll get you some water.

338
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,010
OK.

339
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:37,230
A female pilot's home is really different.

340
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,990
Here, Brother Zhan, have some water.

341
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:39,340
OK.

342
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,230
This is my first time here.

343
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,760
Here's a small gift for you.

344
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,940
What is this? It looks so cool.

345
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:49,950
I heard you like handmade coffee.

346
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,100
So I brought you a set of handmade equipment.

347
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,280
Gosh, I troubled you.

348
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,520
Why are you giving me a gift?

349
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,420
It's nothing.

350
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,180
I'm planning to keep a bird.

351
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,780
I'll take it as a rehearsal.

352
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,630
We landed!

353
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,390
Polly!

354
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,210
He landed.

355
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:04,760
Did you teach it?

356
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,550
It talks a lot.

357
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,310
Really?

358
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,980
It's called Polly, right?

359
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,200
Polly is a captain.

360
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,440
Polly! Captain!

361
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,080
Polly!

362
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,420
Polly!

363
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,460
Polly!

364
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:16,080
Why is it blushing?

365
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,190
Polly.

366
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,220
Brother Zhan, you may play with it for a while.

367
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,480
I'll make your coffee.

368
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,140
No need.

369
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,150
You can continue your packing.

370
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,940
If you don't mind, I'll make you a cup.

371
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,680
No. That's great.

372
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,240
My beans are in the kitchen.

373
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,080
Pick whatever you want.

374
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:29,440
Okay.

375
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,360
I'll go pack up.

376
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,940
Wait a moment.

377
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,480
So professional.

378
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:47,370
The brewing of coffee is extremely delicate.

379
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,920
Only the proper grinding ratio, flour-to-water ratio,

380
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:50,910
and water temperature

381
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,060
can bring out

382
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,610
the flavor of coffee beans.

383
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,580
You're the most unique engineer I've ever seen.

384
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,410
It smells so good.

385
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,720
Here, try it.

386
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,400
The sourness is just right.

387
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,370
This cup is interesting.

388
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,660
I made it at the pottery shop. It's for you.

389
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,780
It's handmade.

390
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,800
It's so beautiful. Thank you, Brother Zhan.

391
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,400
By the way,

392
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,820
I found the pot handle loosened in the kitchen.

393
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,730
I tightened it.

394
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,870
There's a noise in the fridge. The balance is bad.

395
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,670
I adjusted it.

396
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,570
Gosh, Brother Zhan, you are so nice.

397
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,080
I'm embarrassed.

398
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,700
It's an obsessive-compulsive disorder.

399
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,200
That's great.

400
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,550
I didn't teach it this.

401
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,370
Polly.

402
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,030
You'll be staying at Mr. Ni's house for the next few days.

403
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,460
Come on, say goodbye.

404
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
Bye-bye, Polly. Be sensible.

405
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Give it to me.

406
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,600
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

407
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,750
Nanting.

408
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:14,950
You're back.

409
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,620
I won't go upstairs.

410
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,950
I have to get Polly back.

411
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,630
Otherwise, it'll suffocate.

412
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm leaving.

413
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,000
-Okay.
-Rest assured.

414
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,400
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

415
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,530
Drive slowly. Thank you.

416
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,060
Okay.

417
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,730
Don't you have to work overtime?

418
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,570
Tomorrow is the refresher training. I don't need to work overtime.

According to the analysis,

423
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,280
more than half of the global fatal accidents

424
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,360
involve main factors

425
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,160
related to aviation companies.

426
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,340
Among them,

427
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:25,580
the most frequent factor of karma

428
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:28,080
is the operating skills of the pilot team.

429
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,450
It is 14 percent of the total.

430
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,550
An excellent flight attendant

431
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:32,050
should have

432
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:34,040
responsibility, love,

433
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,210
tolerance, sympathy, and patience.

434

The current flight altitude is 500 feet.

435
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,460
It shows the side wind of 6 meters.

436
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,580
When it's near the runway,

437
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,000
we need to press the wheel in the direction of facing the wind.

438
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,510
At the same time, your left foot should

439
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,620
push the left helm a little.

440
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,090
Make the plane a sideslip.

441
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,880
Okay, pull back your left hand.

442
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,880
Take the water with your right hand.

443
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,480
Three fingers back, three points into one line

444
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,240
and lift the bowls gently.

445
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:24,420
Come on, Song. You can do it.

Brother-in-law.

Brother-in-law.

448
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,320
Why are you so anxious?

449
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,550
Why didn't you knock?

450
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,990
Something happened, brother-in-law.

451
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:10,980
What's wrong?

452
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,280
I didn't pass the refresher training assessment.

453
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,030
How could you fail?

454
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,700
Are you in Nanting's class?

455
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,410
Did he give you a hard time?

456
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,620
No.

457
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,920
It is Instructor Ma.

458
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,310
One time, I was in a hurry to go back to pick Dou up,

459
00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:31,520
so I asked for a leave.

460
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,740
The training is a closed session.

461
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,870
You can't leave the base.

462
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,550
How did you apply for leave?

463
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,750
Did you use my name?

464
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,650
Brother-in-law,

465
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,960
I thought Instructor Ma was a pushover.

466
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,650
I didn't expect that he held a grudge against us.

467
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,540
Instructor Ma

468
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,290
is more senior than Gu Nanting.

469
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:57,560
He's famous for not being able to tolerate anything.

470
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,360
Your absence wouldn't

471
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,170
affect your test results.

472
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,570
Is there anything else?

473
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:07,800
Well,

474
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:09,950
during the emergency descent,

475
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,050
I wore the oxygen mask in a non-standard way.

476
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,670
Brother-in-law,

477
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,330
it's not a big deal.

478
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,500
The air pressure altitude in the cabin

479
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,780
is over 10,000 feet.

480
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,070
You must wear the oxygen mask correctly.

481
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,330
That's the law.

482
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:23,600
Yes.

483
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,580
If you really fly,

484
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,990
and you don't wear your oxygen mask properly,

485
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:28,590
you will faint immediately.

486
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,030
Yes, Instructor Ma also said so.

487
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,560
Brother-in-law.

488
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,000
Please save me.

489
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,520
Please help me, brother-in-law.

490
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,780
How can I open my mouth?

491
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,280
Brother-in-law.

492
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,240
If I become an observer,

493
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,520
I'll be the oldest observer

494
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,130
in our company.

495
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,320
From another perspective,

496
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,250
you'll also be humiliated, right?

497
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,860
What does it have to do with me?

498
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,790
If you want to embarrass yourself,

499
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,450
don't get me involved.

500
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,320
Brother-in-law.

501
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:52,950
As you know,

502
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:53,980
an observer

503
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,400
needs to fly 80 hours every month.

504
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,640
Dou is learning drawing, piano,

505
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,560
and English.

506
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,050
I don't have time to accompany my child anymore.

507
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,190
Just give him a call

508
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,530
and let me do the test again.

509
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,450
Pilots

510
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,990
should be responsible for thousands of families.

511
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:09,840
You say to do the test again.

512
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,160
If you really fly,

513
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,820
do you still have a second chance?

514
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,230
You deserve

515
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,550
the demotion.

516
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,830
I was so nervous about this assessment.

517
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,430
I didn't expect I could pass.

518
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,190
I knew you could do it.

519
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:32,390
Come here.

520
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,470
What are you doing?

521
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,640
Have you passed your evaluation?

522
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,240
All four of us got excellent.

523
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,060
We passed too.

524
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,150
And Yuheng got excellent too.

525
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:45,020
Congratulations. I'm sorry about last time.

526
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,280
It's okay. Let's eat.

527
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,530
But I heard

528
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:55,160
Lin Yicheng's assessment failed.

529
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,960
Really?

530
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,090
Do you know what?

531
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
Since I flew,

532
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:00,360
this is the first time

533
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,100
I get an excellent overall performance.

534
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,360
I was just good before.

535
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,760
Now you know Instructor Gu

536
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,690
didn't mean to give you a hard time.

537
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,660
From now on,

538
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,370
I've decided to kneel before his skirt

539
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,139
like you two.

540
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,370
No. I mean before his door. His door.

541
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,400
Count me in. Me too.

542
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,280
One for you.

543
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,739
Can't you pick it yourself?

544
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,139
Yours is more delicious.

545
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,620
Mom, happy birthday.

546
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,540
Wait for me to cook dinner.

547
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:51,030
[8787 Refresher Training Assessment Result]

548
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,820
Thank you, son.

549
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:02,950
By the way,

550
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,500
Yuheng and I

551
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,000
are going for a walk at Binhai Park.

552
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,930
If you're not busy this afternoon,

553
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,700
come over earlier and unwind.

554
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,230
What's up? Are you tired?

555
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,550
No, I'm fine.

556
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,390
Mom, let's take a break.

557
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,710
Let's take a break.

558
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,370
Auntie Qin is really awesome.

559
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,160
You must have exercised a lot.

560
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,010
You look strong.

561
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,740
I didn't do it intentionally.

562
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,600
I get some fresh air when I'm free.

563
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,810
I don't exercise much.

564
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,090
I have to wait till night to exercise.

565
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,940
I don't dare to go out alone.

566
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,410
Nanting likes sports and running.

567
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,990
Ask him to accompany you.

568
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,840
Sure.

569
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:03,960
I just don't want to trouble Brother Nanting.

570
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,720
I usually exercise at home.

571
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,520
If you are inconvenient to run outside,

572
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,960
I can order a treadmill for you.

573
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,220
The effect is good too.

574
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:14,630
It's okay.

575
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,990
I...

576
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:16,840
Don't bother.

577
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,090
I'll buy one myself.

578
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,300
By the way,

579
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,560
I booked a restaurant

580
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,140
to celebrate your birthday tonight.

581
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,840
Are you still thinking about this?

582
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,080
I told Nanting

583
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,860
we could eat at home.

584
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,260
Yes, let's eat at home. I'll cook.

585
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,340
My mom told me

586
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,450
to celebrate with auntie.

587
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,760
Thanks to her.

588
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,810
I bought you a scarf.

589
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,600
I planned to give it to you tonight.

590
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,320
Look, you're wasting money.

591
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,390
I'm embarrassed.

592
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,750
This is what I should do.

593
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,980
You and Brother Nanting have been so nice to me since childhood.

594
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,970
I don't have any relatives or friends in Luzhou either.

595
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:48,910
If you are willing,

596
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,420
I'll celebrate your birthday with you in the future.

597
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,100
Okay.

598
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,470
I still remember Brother Nanting

599
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,220
celebrating my ten-year-old birthday with me.

600
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,120
That year in the amusement arcade

601
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,450
you caught a doll for me.

602
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,790
I still keep it.

603
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,280
Really?

604
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,900
Look at you. You can't remember anything.

605
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,910
He has been studying and playing basketball

606
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,650
since childhood.

607
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:12,510
Now he only cares about work.

608
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,080
I'll reply to an email. You guys continue.

609
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,190
You see, it comes again.

610
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,870
He's just a workaholic.

611
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:28,790
Auntie.

612
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,320
It's rare to come out today.

613
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,680
Let me take a photo for you.

614
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,110
Sure.

615
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:33,970
-Come on.
-Come on.

616
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:34,960
Let's keep it as a memento.

617
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,290
Are you done? Let's take a photo together.

618
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:38,440
Okay.

619
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,740
I'll shoot for you.

620
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,080
Today is auntie's birthday.

621
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,910
You two should take a photo together.

622
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:45,910
We do it together.

623
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,690
Come on. Let's do it together.

624
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,040
I'll go for it.

625
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,050
Hello.

626
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,960
Can you take a photo for us?

627
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,520
Sure.

628
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,120
Thank you.

629
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,850
Thank you.

630
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:04,440
Here.

631
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,690
Three, two, one.

632
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:14,830
I found this shop online.

633
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:15,980
It's great.

634
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,220
Thank you.

635
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,170
You're welcome.

636
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,360
Thank you.

637
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,380
You're welcome.

638
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,120
Thank you for taking care of Polly for me.

639
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,570
Luckily, you chose Chinese food today.

640
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,110
I'm really not used to western food.

641
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,730
Me too.

642
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,510
Every time I fly abroad and eat western food,

643
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,350
I feel upset.

644
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,840
As soon as I come back,

645
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
I'll have a bowl of porridge first.

646
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,060
You can buy me porridge today.

647
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,120
No way.

648
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,210
I must show my sincerity

649
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,540
to treat Mr. Ni to a meal.

650
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,000
Then I'll study the menu

651
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,020
and order something expensive.

652
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,160
Don't be too expensive. It's enough.

653
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,280
Order whatever you want.

654
00:39:58,770 --> 00:39:59,280
Song,

655
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,250
do you want to play games or watch TV?

656
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,300
-I…
-No.

657
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,860
Did I disturb you?

658
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,650
No.

659
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,110
This is for you.

660
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,740
For me?

661
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,270
There was an event in the mall today.

662
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:20,530
I got the perfume when I bought the socks.

663
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,480
When I opened it, it was a lady's perfume.

664
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,180
I...

665
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,050
I don't have a girlfriend either.

666
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,250
So I'll give it to you.

667
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,600
Well...

668
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:43,220
thank you.

669
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:45,940
You're welcome.

670
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
Open it and see if you like it.

671
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,120
It's good.

672
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,060
Thank you.

673
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,250
I'm glad you like it.

674
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,400
I'll take another person's shift tomorrow morning.

675
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,330
I'm going to bed.

676
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,630
You should rest early too.

677
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,490
I'm sorry.

678
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,260
Something came up at the hangar.

679
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,280
I need to go back.

680
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,380
Cheng Xiao?

681
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,780
Cheng Xiao?

682
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:14,870
Brother Zhan.

683
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,020
What did you just say?

684
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,460
Wang Fan called me.

685
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,080
I need to go back to the hangar.

686
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,670
Okay.

687
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,550
I'm sorry.

688
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,550
I couldn't take you home every time.

689
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,550
It's okay. Work is more important.

690
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,800
