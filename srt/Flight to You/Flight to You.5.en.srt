[Australia]

5
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,759
Australia training is over.

6
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,210
Half a day off in the afternoon.

7
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:41,880
Tomorrow,

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,600
we're transferring to China

9
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,940
for the final step of the 787 pilot transition training.

10
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:46,910
A field training program.

11
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,830
After you go back,

12
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:49,930
pack your things.

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:50,920
Dismiss.

14
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,820
Thank you, Instructor Gu.

15
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:09,639
Xiao,

16
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,080
have you decided on the battle time this afternoon?

17
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:11,970
Yes.

18
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,280
The foreigners have been informed already.

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,200
Are you sure Gu Nanting doesn't know?

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,750
Don't worry.

21
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,720
We're keeping our mouths shut.

22
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,260
Yes.

23
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,520
Come on, Xiao.

24
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,890
Come on, Xiao.

25
00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:23,630
Come on.

26
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,780
Go, go, go.

27
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,330
Your theoretical results

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,720
and simulator results are excellent.

29
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,180
Since you want a fight to the finish so badly,

30
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,050
I applied for a simulator for half an hour.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
Of course, I set the same flight conditions

32
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,570
for both of you.

33
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,950
Best two out of three.

34
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,560
Who will be the judge?

35
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,360
I don't need a referee.

36
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,470
You can witness it.

37
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,310
The result will be very obvious.

38
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:25,860
Okay.

39
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,990
Come on. Come on.

40
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,350
Come on, Xiao!

41
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,840
Come on, Xiao!

42
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,550
Come on! Come on!

43
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,560
I see you got my message.

44
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,520
I wasn't sure you would come.

45
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,100
Aren't you afraid I'll cancel this match?

46
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:02,990
No.

47
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,560
You know what they need to be a good pilot,

48
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,960
both calm and passionate.

49
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,550
I don't think you would take that from them.

50
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,280
Let the game begin, bro.

51
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,780
Get ready to win. Just like before.

52
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,520
Okay, let's do it.

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,060
Round one, steep turn

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,280
will commence in 15 seconds.

55
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,540
Please get ready.

56
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,909
Eric first.

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
Autopilot's disengaged.

58
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,870
The flight director is off.

59
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,270
Turn off the autothrottle.

60
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,330
Checked.

61
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,800
Eric Dane.

62
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,050
The altitude deviation was 50 feet.

63
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,620
The speed deviation was five knots.

64
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,900
Well done!

65
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,950
Impressive.

66
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:37,750
Cheng Xiao,

67
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,470
now it's your turn.

68
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,080
It begins.

69
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,500
Come on.

70
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,750
Autopilot's disengaged.

71
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,780
Take off the autopilot control stick.

72
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,730
Control stick's disengaged.

73
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,650
The flight director is off.

74
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Set the recovery heading.

75
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,800
30-degree level off.

76
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,660
20 degrees.

77
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,710
10 degrees.

78
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,800
Not bad.

79
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,790
Not bad.

80
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,470
Xiao is the best.

81
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,320
Kain

82
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,640
can never fly out of this result.

83
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,530
Cheng Xiao.

84
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,900
The altitude deviation was 20 feet.

85
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,960
Speed, no deviation.

86
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,540
Well, seems like you're a genius pilot.

87
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,780
Cheng Xiao won this round.

88
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,690
Xiao is awesome.

89
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,530
Nice.

90
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,480
This is only the beginning.

91
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:07,620
Sure.

92
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,820
Round two, eyeless approach CAT II.

93
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,850
Manual control, no flight director.

94
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,380
They are going to compete for an eyeless approach.

95
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:17,390
But, the visibility is less than 400 meters.

96
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:36,590
The flight altitude is 3,000.

97
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,440
Prepare for landing.

98
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
Cut off autopilot.

99
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,310
Xiao,

100
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,159
Mark didn't say

101
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,600
when we should start the manual operation.

102
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,330
It must be after

103
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,680
the landing state formed.

104
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,520
If Eric disengages now,

105
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,130
he won't admit it even if he loses.

106
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,950
Are you okay?

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
Of course, I'm fine.

108
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:02,240
It's a piece of cake.

109
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,570
Gear down. Flap 20.

110
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,570
Flap 30.

111
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,430
1,000.

112
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,010
The glide slope is one-quarter higher.

113
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,600
Checked, the deviation is corrected.

114
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,480
Continue the approach.

115
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,020
The landing checklist is complete.

116
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,610
The landing checklist is complete.

117
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,860
Disengage the autopilot.

118
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,010
The flight director is off.

119
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,390
The flight director is off.

120
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:05,400
Approaching minimum.

121
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
100 feet to decisive.

122
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,360
Keep approaching.

123
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,140
Minimum.

124
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,400
Runway lights are in sight.

125
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,290
I've seen the runway lights.

126
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:12,350
Keep approaching.

127
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,120
Runway in sight.

128
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,080
Landing.

129
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,460
Runway in sight.

130
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,290
Landing.

131
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,470
Round two has ended.

132
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,440
Why do I feel it's a little risky?

133
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:10,720
Cheng Xiao, 1,500 feet.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,470
Glide slope, 0.25 dot higher.

135
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,550
Eric Dane.

136
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,180
1,500 feet.

137
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,880
Glide slope, 0.5 dot higher.

138
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
Cheng Xiao, 700 feet.

139
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,360
0.25 dot left of the course.

140
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,260
Eric Dane.

141
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,130
On course.

142
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,970
As for the actual ending point,

143
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,540
Eric was closer to the runway's ending point.

144
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,190
So, on the whole,

145
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,820
Eric is the winner of this round.

146
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,580
Xiao.

147
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,440
I've just been told that

148
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,090
you used a manual the whole flight.

149
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,200
Yes.

150
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,830
You disconnected the autopilot

151
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,010
before you were landing.

152
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,000
Don't you...

153
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,180
No, I don't believe it.

154
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,340
Is it true?

155
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,480
No wonder.

156
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,540
Xiao must have used a whole-period manual.

157
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,900
That's why she spent so much energy.

158
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,940
Now it's one-to-one.

159
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:19,350
It depends on the last round.

160
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,670
Are you ready for the last round?

161
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,620
Yes.

162
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,690
It's the next point.

163
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,160
Time out.

164
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,550
What's wrong?

165
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,220
What's going on?

166
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,910
I think they need to change the setting.

167
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,510
Get ready and start.

168
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,440
Round three.

169
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,660
Landing on a strong wind with turbulence.

170
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,420
Isn't the third round competing wind shear?

171
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,640
If it turns into maximum crosswind,

172
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,790
there will be more possibilities for complicated situations.

173
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,020
It's OK.

174
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,260
Cheng Xiao, come on!

175
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,300
Come on, Xiao!

176
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,450
Come on, Xiao!

177
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,090
3,000 feet.

178
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:36,410
It's windy and turbulent.

179
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,290
Looks like

180
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:38,630
we are competing for the landing.

181
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,800
Xiao, this is your strength.

182
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,700
We'll do our best.

183
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,630
Leave the rest

184
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,850
to the referee.

185
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,950
We can't afford to lose this one.

186
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,330
We gonna win.

187
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,640
Attention, crosswind is rising to 20 nodes.

188
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,180
Checked.

189
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,460
The runway is in the middle.

190
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:00,910
Check the go-around heading.

191
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:03,360
The glide slope is moved.

192
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,830
Fully established.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,430
Adjust the go-around altitude, to 4,000.

194
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,460
Half dot left of the course.

195
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,040
Checked.

196
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,170
1,000 feet.

197
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,130
Turn the wiper to the maximum.

198
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,230
It's too fast.

199
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,880
Checked. I'm fixing it.

200
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,370
Deviation to left.

201
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,000
Checked. I'm fixing it.

202
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,720
On course.

203
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,250
0.25 dot higher than the center of the glide slope.

204
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,030
Checked.

205
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,810
We need to fly more carefully, you know.

206
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,960
I know.

207
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,180
Xiao is flying more steadily.

208
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,550
We're going to win.

209
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,550
With Xiao's skills,

210
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,870
even the actual flying in such a weather

211
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,230
is just a piece of cake.

212
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,370
You haven't landed yet.

213
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,360
Focus.

214
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,910
Attention, crosswind is now 30 nodes.

215
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,020
Left on the runway.

216
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,000
Should we have a go-around?

217
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,920
Wind speed increases.

218
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,060
The plane is inclined to the left

219
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,260
of the runway.

220
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,760
Got it. I'm fixing it.

221
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,450
I need to remind you.

222
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,940
You shouldn't have landed just now.

223
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,610
You're lucky that you landed safely this time.

224
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
But luck won't always protect you.

225
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,390
As a pilot,

226
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,400
we have to demand ourselves

227
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,280
with the most strict standard.

228
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,300
You are excellent and diligent in flying.

229
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,850
But what you lack

230
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,880
can't be made up by hard work.

231
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,510
Go-around.

232
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,380
What?

233
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,630
I said, go-around.

234
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,260
Flap 20.

235
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,720
What's going on?

236
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,470
Is Xiao having a go-around?

237
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,040
Well...

238
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,530
Isn't she surrendering herself by doing this?

239
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,230
Why?

240
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:25,880
The referee said it was about landing.

241
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,840
Why do we have to do the go-around?

242
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,760
The altitude was below 300 feet.

243
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,800
The plane is not stable.

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,790
If we keep flying,

245
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:31,970
It's an unstable approach.

246
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,840
But we just...

247
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,870
Ensure the safety of the passengers to the great extent.

248
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,050
Right?

249
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,400
There's a rising airflow.

250
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,530
20 feet higher than the center.

251
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,490
Copy that.

252
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:44,980
Landing.

253
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,300
Eric landed successfully.

254
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,320
Cheng Xiao is having a go-around.

255
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,820
Eric Dane wins.

256
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,310
We just won! I knew it!

257
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,050
That was tough, bro.

258
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,090
But we just won.

259
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,100
As usual.

260
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,510
Alright.

261
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,700
What's up, bro?

262
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,440
Why didn't you continue to approach?

263
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,430
Don't tell me you couldn't.

264
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,880
This was my choice.

265
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,349
Great, bro.

266
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,730
See you outside.

267
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,250
Here we go.

268
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,430
Such a big bucket.

269
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,330
These foreigners are too much.

270
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,180
Not to mention girls, I can't even stand three buckets.

271
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:45,770
Xiao.

272
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,590
Hang in there.

273
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,450
Girl,

274
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,240
this is the double stake you've been asking for.

275
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,980
It's falling.

276
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,260
Are you ready?

277
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,410
Let's go.

278
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,240
Alright.

279
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,200
Let the ice bucket punishment

280
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,760
begin!

281
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,360
Take a photo for me.

282
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,810
Yeah, I want to shoot this.

283
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,050
Are you ready?

284
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
One, two, three.

285
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,120
Here we go. Surprise?

286
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,470
It's amazing.

287
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,340
How do you feel?

288
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,540
How does it feel?

289
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,330
Go on.

290
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,970
Here goes the second.

291
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,770
Okay.

292
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:27,680
One more.

293
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,480
Okay.

294
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,200
One, two, three.

295
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,100
Good.

296
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,520
How do you feel?

297
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,730
Go on.

298
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,920
Xiao, let me do it.

299
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,880
Xiao, let us help you.

300
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,980
We'll take your place, Xiao.

301
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:14,760
I admit defeat.

302
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,330
I'll do it myself.

303
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,390
Go on.

304
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,230
Do you guys want to switch with her?

305
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:25,320
She's a girl.

306
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:25,790
No.

307
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:26,880
Go on.

308
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,260
Let's finish it.

309
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:51,910
Go on.

310
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,450
Xiao! Xiao!

311
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,300
Are you okay?

312
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,440
Xiao.

313
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,860
Well done.

314
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,640
I am impressed.

315
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,460
She did quite well.

316
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,060
Next round.

317
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,720
Please set maximum crosswind. Thank you.

318
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:52,830
No.

319
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,130
She lost the game,

320
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,860
but she lost with honor.

321
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,240
Xiao, are you there?

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,480
The door is not locked. Come in.

323
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,520
Are you okay?

324
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,530
I'm fine.

325
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,830
Gu Nanting doesn't know, right?

326
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:56,160
Did he know it?

327
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:57,380
No.

328
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,590
No way.

329
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,600
Don't let him know. We have to hide it.

330
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,730
Otherwise, I'll be in big trouble.

331
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,310
Drink this

332
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:05,130
to prevent a cold.

333
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,820
What is this?

334
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:19,860
This...

335
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,370
It's a local secret recipe.

336
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,360
Drink it.

337
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,570
Is it that bad?

338
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,770
Try it.

339
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:38,460
It's for your own good. Finish it.

340
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:39,850
Just drink it.

341
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,460
If I can't recover after drinking this,

342
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,520
I'll block you.

343
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,980
Brother Nanting,

344
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,530
I've washed the cup.

345
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,650
You don't want me to tell Xiao.

346
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:02,450
Xiao also

347
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,840
doesn't want you to know about what happened this afternoon.

348
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,990
So I didn't tell you.

349
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,070
Has she finished it?

350
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:08,960

524
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,970
Even if she didn't send it,

525
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,460
you saw the video.

526
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,650
Cheng Xiao's emotional management is problematic.

527
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,410
Yes.

528
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,730
I remember during the interview,

529
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,680
she contradicted you defiantly.

530
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,370
But Mr. Jiang,

531
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,190
in Australia,

532
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,120
I saw her progress.

533
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,870
That's not enough.

534
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,220
At least not enough to join

535
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,430
the Passenger Transport Department of Luzhou Airlines.

536
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:34,080
She used Luzhou Airlines' resources without permission to compete with others.

537
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:35,600
She's a fighter and a battler.

538
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,330
She even caused international disputes.

539
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:38,880
Is this the pilot

540
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:39,980
we need?

541
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,560
I remember you insisted on

542
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,170
dealing her problem

543
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,120
after the pilot transition training.

544
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,690
Do you have a conclusion now?

545
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,600
How about

546
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,980
letting Cheng Xiao practice more?

547
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,440
Set her as a low-level first officer.

548
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,080
She can only fly when she cooperates with senior instructors.

549
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,120
Xie,

550
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,080
we can't be merciful.

551
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,710
There will be consequences.

552
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,700
Demote her to an observer.

553
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:15,890
Nanting.

554
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,720
You've gone too far.

555
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,070
Since she needs the training,

556
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:23,330
let her start over.

557
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,310
Being strict is good.

558
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,800
Teach her some lessons.

559
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,190
Mr. Jiang.

560
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,530
What do you think?

561
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,500
It's decided then.

562
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:42,410
Nanting,

563
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,510
you should be responsible for

564
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,920
Cheng Xiao in the future.

565
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,220
OK.

566
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,760
I'll keep an eye on her.

567
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,000
This is really amazing.

568
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
Look at this.

569
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,060
Mr. Sun, I've seen the design drawing.

570
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:22,870
It's very good.

571
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,739
I'm going back to Luzhou in two days.

572
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,760
Please keep an eye on it for me.

573
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,500
Thank you.

574
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,110
Well said.

575
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,880
Xiao, Xiao, come and take a look.

576
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,000
Show it to Xiao.

577
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,600
What are you looking at?

578
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,480
Xiao. Xiao.

579
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,280
Look at this.

580
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,190
Those two foreigners

581
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,199
were scolded online.

582
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,600
And this.

583
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,469
Look at this.

584
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,429
Who took this?

585
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,870
Shaohui coincidentally took it.

586
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,340
How is it? Do you feel better?

587
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,969
It's not good to upload internal affairs online.

588
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,850
You were wronged

589
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,290
in that competition.

590
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,120
They still kept watering you with ice water.

591
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:55,520
Shaohui is helping you to vent your anger.

592
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,429
Just delete it.

593
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,800
I've vented my anger.

594
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:00,430
Why still bother them?

595
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:02,720
Fine.

596
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,080
Mr. Gu is here.

597
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,800
I'll announce the recruitment result now.

598
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,320
Song.

599
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,600
After ten aviation,

600
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:23,210
you will be promoted to First Officer for Boeing 787 in Passenger Transport Department.

601
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:25,580
I...

602
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,630
Zhou Shaohui.

603
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,620
After 20 aviation,

604
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,510
you will be promoted to First Officer for Boeing 787 in Passenger Transport Department.

605
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,470
Cheng Xiao.

606
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,950
You must complete 100 hours of experience

607
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:49,960
of being an observer

608
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,250
under the supervision of a senior instructor.

609
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,120
Also, you need to accumulate 200 hours of experience

610
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:55,040
and 30 aviation,

611
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,970
not less than three months.

612
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:56,870
After that,

613
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,140
you may apply once again

614
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,360
for the assessment of becoming a first officer

615
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,650
according to your performance.

616
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,650
Why?

617
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,360
Why?

618
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,960
There are ten people here.

619
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,320
I ranked first in the theoretical exam.

620
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,380
I scored perfectly in the simulator training.

621
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,780
I didn't even lose my stamina.

622
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,810
Is it because I didn't fly well in the morning assessment?

623
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,190
One assessment and one up-and-down

624
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,650
can't determine your position.

625
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,420
So what am I missing?

626
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,690
Are you not going to

627
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,840
give me even an excuse this time?

628
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,960
What about your acknowledgment?

629
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,410
We can discuss your problem aside.

630
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,190
You don't have to take up other people's time.

631
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,190
I want to make a complaint to the company.

632
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,120
Xiao.

633
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,000
Xiao.

634
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,550
[Luzhou]

635
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:02,890
Come in.

636
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:05,800
Cheng is back.

637
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:06,600
Mr. Jiang.

638
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,510
I want to file a complaint.

639
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,510
Regarding who?

640
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,370
When we were flying during the field training program,

641
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,050
Mr. Gu demanded me

642
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:16,770
with the captain's standard.

643
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,480
I flew very well.

644
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:20,690
But in the end, I was demoted twice in a row.

645
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,760
He definitely has a prejudice against me.

646
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:25,230
So are you going to file a complaint against him?

647
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,670
Have you ever thought that

648
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:31,680
this is your own reason?

649
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:34,470
Who posted the video

650
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,250
online?

651
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,210
I really didn't send the video online.

652
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,650
But I can't tell you

653
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,220
who did it.

654
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,940
And it was the other party who started it.

655
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,400
My action should be considered a reasonable return.

656
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,690
You've watched that video, right?

657
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,800
-Don't you think...
-I know the process.

658
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,530
He did say something inappropriate.

659
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,500
But you started the private game, didn't you?

660
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,690
What a negative impact!

661
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,080
How can a passenger pilot behave like this?

662
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,040
You're competitive and can't afford to lose.

663
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:10,580
But that wasn't a real defeat.

664
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:11,900
It was because...

665
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,010
I was wrong about this.

666
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,030
The company can punish me,

667
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,340
deduct my salary and ask me to write a letter of self-criticism.

668
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,520
But you can't demote me twice in a row.

669
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,450
Mr. Gu

670
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,420
demoted you twice in a row.

671
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,160
The punishment is indeed strict.

672
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,760
But you have to respect

673
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,930
the leaders' decision.

674
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,000
Who will respect me if I respect him?

675
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,470
With him,

676
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:41,330
I won't have a good day at Luzhou Airlines.

677
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,700
He just doesn't like me.

678
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:43,630
Fine.

679
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:44,740
I quit.

680
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,340
I can quit now.

681
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,730
Calm down.

682
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,080
Go back and think about it.

683
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,750
Don't make a decision so hastily.

684
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:58,180
I believe with your talent and effort,

685
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,990
you will be promoted soon.

686
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,470
By the way,

687
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,890
your future day-to-day flying instructor

688
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:08,960
will still be Mr. Gu.

689
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,360
Here's your non-alcoholic Martini, please enjoy it.

690
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,290
Thank you.

691
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,580
A serving of non-alcoholic "Hello, Luzhou".

692
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,760
Thank you, Mr. Xie.

693
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,260
Sorry to keep you waiting.

694
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,020
Captain Gu.

695
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,450
Sir.

696
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
How did you know I was here?

697
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,380
I checked your schedule.

698
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:58,200
I learned something new. Try it.

699
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,320
This is the only hobby I have,

700
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,070
but you never support me.

701
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,460
I know you have to talk to me once you come back.

702
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,180
Are you going to talk about Cheng Xiao?

703
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,940
You saw Jiang Tao's attitude.

704
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:20,960
He didn't even give me a face.

705
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,350
Luckily, you were smart

706
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,880
and offered to demote her.

707
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,030
At least she's still staying in the company now.

708
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:29,790
It may not be a good thing.

709
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,780
This girl has a bad temper.

710
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:34,640
When she feels upset,

711
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,030
she might just give up.

712
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:39,800
It's probable.

713
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:52,890
How about

714
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,210
I talk to her?

715
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,080
What?

716
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,790
Do you want to resign?

717
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,000
With a superior like Gu Nanting,

718
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,080
I'll never achieve success at Luzhou Airlines.

719
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,740
It can't go so far, just because of Gu Nanting.

720
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,780
I was thinking that after you returned with victory,

721
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,800
we can work together in this industry.

722
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:22,940
Tell me.

723
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,960
How did you offend him?

724
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:29,290
I can't explain for a while.

725
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,730
But, the civil aviation industry

726
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:34,710
is not considered big.

727
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,600
If you change your workplace,

728
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:37,930
will Gu Nanting

729
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,370
ruin your plan?

730
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,530
He will definitely do it.

731
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:45,000
Then you won't be able to escape from his hands.

732
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,000
No.

733
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:49,170
I have to remind Yuheng.

734
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,360
Her boyfriend is so scary.

735
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,420
Don't get involved in his private life.

736
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,340
Why are you still defending him?

737
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,180
No, that's a different matter.

738
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,630
Forget it. Don't mention him.

739
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,870
Let me take a look at you.

740
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,780
Long time no see.

741
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,140
I almost can't recognize you.

742
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,090
Right? I dyed it myself.

743
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,630
To celebrate your employment,

744
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,080
I'll order you a big meal.

745
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,220
Here.

746
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,500
Take your pick.

747
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,320
No, no, no.

748
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,910
I almost failed to persist.

749
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,350
I'm going to take a shower.

750
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,590
Think about it.

751
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,940
After all, you've been there for seven years.

752
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,180
Can you bear it?

753
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,970
Think carefully.
