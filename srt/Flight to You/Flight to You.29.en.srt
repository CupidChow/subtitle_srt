4
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,950
Look at this.

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,100
I told you not to buy much

6
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,880
but you still bought so much.

7
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,479
I'm going to make up with her.

8
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:42,120
Since I bring some specialties back,

9
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,050
she should at least give me a smile.

10
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,789
As long as you go back,

11
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,470
your mother will be so happy

12
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,270
that she'll be discharged soon.

13
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,240
When you go back,

14
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,300
don't quarrel anymore. Talk nicely.

15
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,770
Got it.

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,870
Dad. There are not enough cars here.

17
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,930
We need to wait.

18
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,570
It's okay. Let's wait.

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,820
Cheng Xiao.

20
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,950
Brother Zhan.

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,579
Who is this?

22
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,920
This is my dad.

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,560
Hello, uncle.

24
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,140
Hello.

25
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,440
Dad, he's my close friend, Ni Zhan.

26
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,050
He's from the Maintenance Department.

27
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:29,720
Hello.

28
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:31,870
Brother Zhan, why are you here?

29
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:33,800
I walk here every day when I go home.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,060
Get in. I'll take you home.

31
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,450
OK.

32
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,160
Thank you, Brother Zhan.

33
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,760
Thank you.

34
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,480
Uncle, let me help you carry it.

35
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,300
No, I can do it myself.

36
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:42,970
Let me do it.

37
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,340
Thank you.

38
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
Dad, let's go.

39
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,160
Sit in the front.

40
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,960
It's spacious and comfortable.

41
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,930
I am held up for lack of materials.

42
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,430
What are you thinking about?

43
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,480
Nothing. It's about work.

44
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,690
Why did the tenant suddenly move out?

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,730
Of course she has to move after buying a house.

46
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,920
What was her name again?

47
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,230
I haven't seen her yet.

48
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,610
Why do you suddenly ask this?

49
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,030
Just asking.

50
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,160
By the way,

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
I remember you have a female student

52
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,090
called Cheng Xiao, right?

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,930
Have you been working well lately?

54
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,340
I saw her

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,820
on your official website.

56
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,200
She

57
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,350
may leave soon.

58
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,910
Maintenance Department.

59
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:28,110
Do you fix the planes?

60
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,620
Yes, I do.

61
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,940
I have to call you Mr. Ni.

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,210
Dad, he's an engineer.

63
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,430
I know.

64
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,790
Ni.

65
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,490
Will you go for a test drive

66
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,580
after repairing the plane?

67
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:43,960
No way.

68
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,630
Our engineers work on the ground.

69
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,540
This kind of work in the sky

70
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,480
should be done by capable people like your daughter.

71
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,590
Brother Zhan, don't be modest.

72
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,909
Dad.

73
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,000
Brother Zhan

74
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,860
is not only the head of the Maintenance Department,

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,070
but it's also very likely that

76
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,000
he will be our vice president soon.

77
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,090
You're young and promising.

78
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,640
Let's not flatter each other.

79
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,450
Ni.

80
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,340
If you take us home like this,

81
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,320
your wife will be worried.

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,920
Uncle, thanks for your kind words.

83
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,050
I'm not married yet.

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,390
Okay.

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,570
Come on.

86
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,260
Xiao.

87
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,900
is it too late to refund the ticket?

88
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,100
Why?

89
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,110
I've figured out

90
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,550
how to report it.

91
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,070
What is it?

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,730
Tell me honestly.

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,470
Are you and Ni

94
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,850
just friends?

95
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,659
Yes.

96
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,670
I want to tell your mother this.

97
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,930
You and Ni are boyfriend and girlfriend.

98
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,390
No, no. Impossible.

99
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,770
Listen to me.

100
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,290
If your mom knows

101
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,630
you have a boyfriend,

102
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,360
wouldn't she be more at ease?

103
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,870
Next, I'll persuade her.

104
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,200
Tell her that you'll work

105
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,150
as an engineer like Ni

106
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,990
on the ground. No more flying.

107
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,680
No.

108
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,480
Ni Zhan and I are just friends.

109
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,050
Besides,

110
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,140
this is not a long-term solution.

111
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,680
I know, not for long.

112
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,630
We're just coaxing your mother.

113
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,750
Xiao.

114
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,150
I know

115
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,920
how much you love this job.

116
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,520
If you go back

117
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,150
and have no results this time,

118
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,350
in the end, you still parted in discord.

119
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,440
I'll try to talk nicely.

120
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,710
There are things you don't understand.

121
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,610
This time,

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,340
listen to me.

123
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,590
Don't waste your time, okay?

124
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,970
Well,

125
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,300
when this matter is over,

126
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:58,320
you must find a chance to explain to her.

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,950
Don't let this misunderstanding continue.

128
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,480
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

129
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,330
I agree.

130
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,090
What about these things?

131
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:06,590
Pack and box them.

132
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,550
Consider them as a reward for me.

133
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,270
Refund your ticket quickly!

134
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:27,940
Mr. Gu.

135
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
Didn't you leave?

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,510
I was going to

137
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,000
ask you to cancel my leave.

138
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,360
Well,

139
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,740
your family...

140
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:40,580
I will ask for a family reunion leave when it's out of season.

141
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:42,850
Okay.

142
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,030
Have a good rest today.

143
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,490
Pay attention to the schedule.

144
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,020
Hello, Mr. Gu.

145
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,820
Hello, Mr. Gu.

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,520
Sorry, Mr. Gu.

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,590
I forgot to take the badge

148
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,050
when I changed my clothes.

149
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,200
I'll write a self-criticism when I get back.

150
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,930
I promise...

151
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,110
Be careful next time.

152
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,410
What's going on?

153
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,940
Let's go.

154
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,120
You're lucky.

[Voting for Vice President of Luzhou Airlines]

156
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,800
We've done the voting.

157
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,520
Who did you vote for?

158
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,290
Who did you vote for?

159
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,560
I'm not going to tell you.

160
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,120
In the vice president's election in January,

161
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,850
we will combine the decision from the higher-ups

162
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,430
and the voting results from the people.

163
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,540
We will try our best

164
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,190
to keep it fair and square.

165
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
One more thing.

166
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
I need to inform you guys.

167
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,240
Next Wednesday,

168
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,360
the flight from Luzhou to Singapore

169
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,950
will officially be opened up.

The subsequent strategic cooperation agreement

171
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,260
between Singapore Changi Airport and us

172
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:15,490
also needs to send someone to sign.

173
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,620
But unfortunately,

174
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:17,920
On the day of departure,

175
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,640
I will be in Seattle for the Aviation Companies Forum.

176
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,100
Mr. Feng from the group

177
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,880
will represent me in Singapore

178
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
to attend the signing ceremony.

179
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,980
Mr. Jiang, Ni Zhan and Nanting,

180
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,440
you attend also.

181
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:31,960
Mr. Jiang.

182
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,200
By then,

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,770
you will sign the contract together with Mr. Feng

184
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,430
on behalf of Luzhou Airlines.

185
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,180
No problem, President Xu.

186
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,010
Also,

187
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,370
I will deploy the most mature flight crew

188
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:45,070
to fly the first flight to Singapore.

189
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:46,330
Let Nanting fly.

190
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:47,890
I can rest assured.

191
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,010
Just find another excellent first officer.

192
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,330
That's not bad.

193
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,050
[Luzhou Airlines]

194
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,180
You came up here alone by lift.

195
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,190
Is something bothering you?

196
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,520
At the meeting today,

197
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,360
President Xu said

198
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,620
the three of us would represent the company at the signing.

199
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,440
But he gave the authorization to sign

200
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,260
to Jiang Tao.

201
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,250
It seems that the VP candidate has been decided.

202
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,750
Do you know about the depressurization accident of Fanhai Airlines

203
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,450
in the past?

204
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Of course I know it.

205
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:46,950
I remember

206
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:49,310
the hero captain was your master.

207
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,020
Why did you mention that?

208
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,090
The first officer at that time

209
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,160
was Mr. Jiang.

210
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:02,170
Later, Fanhai busted up.

211
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,950
When President Xu established Luzhou Airlines,

212
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:05,950
Mr. Jiang was in the earliest batch.

213
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,440
He dedicated himself and devoted his youth

214
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,370
to Luzhou Airlines.

215
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,700
If he wins,

216
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,430
I will be utterly convinced.

217
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,820
But that was many years ago.

218
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,060
What about now?

219
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:20,930
I know.

220
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,250
Ever since you became the deputy director,

221
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,480
the performance of the Flight Department has been increasing.

222
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,880
It has a lot to do with you.

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,080
Mr. Jiang promoted the plan for energy saving and carbon emission reduction

224
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,540
and led the development strategy of pilots.

225
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,480
He is

226
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
very thoughtful.

227
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,920
Have you ever thought about competing for yourself

228
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,580
on some important occasions?

229
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,950
Drawing up a perfect security system plan

230
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,240
is the only way I compete for the vice president position.

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,390
The promotion and execution of the security system

232
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,880
is also my only goal for the vice president position.

233
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,970
I'm not interested

234
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,530
in any disputes other than that.

235
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,190
I don't think it's necessary.

236
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,110
If Jiang Tao wins,

237
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,940
will he accept your safety system?

238
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,050
That's a challenge to his original system.

239
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,180
It's also a challenge to his position.

240
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,440
Aren't you afraid of leaving

241
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,840
all your dreams and plans

242
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,300
on your computer forever?

243
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,940
I'll try my best to get the position of vice president.

244
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,470
But

245
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,090
I'll do it in the right way.

246
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,510
You

247
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,920
are still the same.

248
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:08,810
Xiao.

249
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,870
Did you just land?

250
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,490
Where are you going later?

251
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,890
A round trip to Changsha.

252
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,100
You'll be promoted to captain soon, right?

253
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,560
You've been through a lot

254
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,680
in the Passenger Transport Department.

255
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,480
I thought I would be ahead of you.

256
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,480
I didn't expect that I would still chase you.

257
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,990
We are different.

258
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,530
I've been up and down.

259
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,110
You're steady, step by step.

260
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,620
So we don't know who will be promoted to captain first.

261
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,540
[Gu Nanting]

262
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,730
Next Wednesday,

263
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,220
please take a special flight with me.

264
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,410
The new air route from Luzhou to Singapore has been opened up.

265
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,340
The first flight

266
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,120
needs the best first officer.

267
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,600
This flight

268
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,860
will send the higher-ups

269
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,660
to attend the signing ceremony.

270
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,690
Okay, got it.

271
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:05,420
Get ready.

272
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,520
Got it. Don't worry.

273
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,390
Good news.

274
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,400
The flight to Singapore

275
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,330
Gu Nanting asked me to fly together.

276
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,460
That's great.

277
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,400
When can such a good luck

278
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,970
fall on me?

279
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,670
Song is a pearl of dust at Luzhou Airlines.

280
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,330
This is a secret only I know.

281
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,140
Don't tell anyone.

282
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:28,650
Okay.

283
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,620
Nice.

284
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,350
I'm afraid this shop would bust up.

285
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,690
How's your work?

286
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,550
I'm fine.

287
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,610
The company just opened

288
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,200
a new route in Southeast Asia.

289
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,000
When will your company order

290
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
a homemade plane?

291
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,330
Mom, it's not easy for us to have a meal together.

292
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,390
Why are you talking about work again?

293
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,730
This is strange.

294
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,770
Isn't it you

295
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,930
the one who enjoys talking about work?

296
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,100
Do you know what day it is today?

297
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,510
Got it.

298
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,840
It's your wedding anniversary.

299
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:25,730
You were young back then.

300
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,320
I just transferred here.

301
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,200
Your dad often went on business trips.

302
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,960
But

303
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,250
as long as he came back,

304
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,280
whenever we had time,

305
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,010
we came to this shop for dining.

306
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,420
Why didn't I know?

307
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,480
You were in school back then.

308
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,640
When I went to school,

309
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,720
you came here to have a meal, right?

310
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,230
Yes.

311
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,800
No wonder every time my dad came back,

312
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,200
there was always a takeaway rib with rice cakes at night.

313
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,030
It was cold, but it tasted delicious.

314
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,230
So it was bought here.

315
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:53,820
Yes.

316
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,960
No matter how delicious the food is,

317
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,490
it is not comparable to the hometown's taste.

318
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,590
Your dad liked the ribs here.

319
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,900
I only like the rice cakes here.

320
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,810
We cooperated well.

321
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,750
No waste at all.

322
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,650
Every time I finished eating with your dad,

323
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,310
we came to this park for a walk.

324
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,370
This park hasn't changed much.

325
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,510
You...

326
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:35,940
What?

327
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,530
Do you want to live alone forever?

328
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,230
Why?

329
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:45,000
Don't you want me to accompany you until you grow old?

330
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,520
I hope you can find your own happiness.

331
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,610
Do you like her?

332
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:53,520
Who?

333
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,500
Cheng Xiao.

334
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,570
Mom.

335
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,060
Alright.

336
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,840
I know you like her. She likes you too.

337
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,060
How did you know?

338
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,380
I've watched

339
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,260
your video many times.

340
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:12,910
I can tell.

341
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,480
Look at me.

342
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,390
Your eyes look different when you mention her.

343
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:26,859
Do I?

344
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,360
Stop pretending.

345
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,800
If you miss

346
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,800
a girl who can make you smile like this,

347
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,260
it would be a great regret.

348
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,820
Most of the time,

349
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,900
people feel hard to cross the hurdle on their own.

In life,

there's no one or anything

352
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,270
can stop you from grabbing your own happiness.

353
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
After saying so much,

354
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,170
I just hope you

355
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,540
can be brave and stop struggling.

356
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,330

Brother-in-law,

361
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,310
are you

362
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:32,760
flying in person today?

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,050
Gu Nanting's flight was delayed yesterday.

According to the rules,

By the way, brother-in-law.

Brother-in-law,

368
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,360
I heard that

369
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,120
President Xu

370
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,030
asked you to sign the contract on behalf of our company.

371
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,290
It means the vice president position is almost finalized.

Don't discuss it with others.

373
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,160
Keep a low profile.

374
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,910

You're on the first flight for the new air route today, right?

380
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,190
I envy you so much.

381
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,300
You're always chosen for the important flights.

382
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:23,920
Yes.

383
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,920
Maybe my schedule fits.

386
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,170
Yuheng has a bright future in the company.

387
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,140
Unlike us,

388

we have no hope.

389
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,500
I just want to live a normal life.

390
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,360
The company's promotion channel

391
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,840
is fair to everyone.

392
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,800
Qi Yu, didn't you say

393
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,060
you'd be promoted earlier than me?

394
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,090
Of course.

395
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,070
I've worked hard in the two cabins for three years.

396
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,870
The company should be fair to me.

397
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,730
Let's go, Yuheng.

398
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:53,260
It's almost time. Let's go.

399
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,260
Are you flying the first flight too?

00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,180
Yes, Qi Yu.

401
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,920
I wouldn't have been selected.

402
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,780
But thanks to Qi Yu,

let me be the envoy of the PR Department.

408

Bye.

409

Take a photo.

411

OK.

412
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,010
Dad.

413
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,740
This time, we are flying a Boeing 787 model.

414
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,430
Very big.

415
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,130
Why is this plane so beautiful?

416
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:34,120
They are all high-tech.

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,950
You stayed up all night again, right?

424
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,450
You can't do this.

425
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,280
Look.

426
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,100
You're only 30 years old.

427
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,240
Your hair is gray.

428
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,160
We, programmers,

429
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,140
will be embarrassed to greet colleagues

430
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,420
without any gray hair.

431
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,420
The company leader is taking a flight today.

00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,230
OK.

and show your boarding pass.

I'm here to greet you

452
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,410
with all the crew members.

453
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,020
Are you flying in person today?

454
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:50,920
The Luzhou-Singapore route

455
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,320
is the most crucial source of revenue growth

456
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320
for our future international line.

457
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,430
The company takes it very seriously.

458
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,490
Make sure the first flight goes well.

459
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,920
These are today's first officers, Cheng Xiao

460
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,850
and Lin Yicheng.

461
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,080
Thank you for your hard work.

462
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,530
Hello.

463
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:04,930
Captain,

464
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:06,710
the boarding is almost over.

465
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:07,810
Have a rest.

466
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,210
Okay.

467
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,230
Mr. Feng,

468
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,130
you may tell the flight attendants if you need anything.

469
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:14,250
We chose the best flight attendants

470
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,570
for this flight.

471
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:17,030
Go back to work.

472
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,920

473
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,410
We'll be leaving the Guangzhou area soon.

474
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:43,820
Cheng,

475
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:47,710
under Mr. Gu's leadership,

476
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,330
you've made great progress.

477
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,160
There are new female pilots in our Flight Department

478
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,690
and you will be their role model in the future.

479
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,020
Thank you, Captain Jiang.

480
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,240
An excellent pilot

481
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,620
not only has to polish flying skills,

482
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,060
but also

483
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,960
needs to take care of other aspects.

484
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,310
For example,

485
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,300
socializing,

486
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,350
interpersonal relationships...

487
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,430
You mean...

488
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,060
I...

489
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,370
I didn't perform well at the dinner party a few days ago.

490
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,190
I don't mean anything else.

491
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:23,270
I just hope

492
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,950
that you can become better.

493
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,970
Thank you for your concern, Captain Jiang.

494
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:29,830
I just hope

495
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,140
I can become

496
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:33,020
like Instructor Gu,

497
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:35,030
focused and persistent.

498
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,700
Fly every flight well,

499
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:40,000
while ensuring the safety and comfort of each passenger.

500
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,800
I'm not good at

501
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,100
other things,

502
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,110
and I don't strive to be good at them.

Satellite phone.

504
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,950
Is there an emergency?

505
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:55,980
Captain.

506
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:56,960
Changi Airport

507
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,040
is expected to have a thunderstorm during the time of landing.

508
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,480
The weather doesn't meet the landing standard.

509
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,130
Please have a backup plan in advance.

510
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,990
Thunderstorm?

511
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,300
The forecast looked fine when I took off.

512
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,240
How long will the thunderstorm last?

513
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,790
It's estimated that the storm will continue until nighttime.

514
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,240
Got it.

515
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,380
I'll think about the plan.

516
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,360
The weather is really bad.

517
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,460
It's not suitable for landing.

518
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,790
Let's apply for diversion in Guangzhou.

519
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,190
We'll fly tomorrow morning and sign the contract in the afternoon.

520
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,990
We'll make it.

521
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,930
Also, the weather looks good tomorrow.

522
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,930
It should be fine.

523
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,310
But Mr. Feng is on the flight.

524
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,510
If we divert to Guangzhou,

525
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,110
will he find it weird?

526
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,810
Let's just keep flying.

527
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,420
Let's fly near Singapore

528
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,300
and use our aircraft radar to scan.

529
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,430
If there's a chance the weather will get better,

530
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:43,610
then we'll land.

531
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,980
What if the weather doesn't get better?

532
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,680
Then we will land at the alternate airport as planned.

533
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:53,520
How's Kuala Lumpur?

534
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:00,550
Kuala Lumpur's weather is also affected.

535
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,680
It's getting worse.

536
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,520
How about this?

537
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,380
I'll discuss with Mr. Feng

538
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,700
about our situation.

539
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:09,350
We're doing this for the safety of the flight.

540
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:12,550
Isn't it unnecessary to ask for Mr. Feng's instructions?

541
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:21,220
Apply for diversion to Guangzhou.

542
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,460
Ladies and gentlemen,

543
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,150
this is the captain speaking.

544
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,480
I'm sorry to inform you

545
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,400
due to the weather at Singapore's Changi Airport,

546
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,120
we will prepare to divert to Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport.

547
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,510
The estimated landing time

548
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,940
is 19:15.

549
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,460
Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

550
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

551
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,720
this is the captain speaking.

552
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,280
Thank goodness we left one day earlier,

553
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,520
or else the signing ceremony tomorrow

554
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,520
will be affected.

555
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,950
We will prepare to divert to Guangzhou Baiyun Airport.

556
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,460
[Guangzhou Baiyun Airport]

557
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,560
Mr. Feng, I'm really sorry.

558
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,540
For safety reasons,

559
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,070
the flight can't continue.

560
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,740
We carefully ask you to spend the night in Guangzhou.

561
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,200
Don't feel too pressured.

562
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,310
Have a good rest.

563
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,280
Just arrive early tomorrow.

564
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,440
Everyone worked hard.

565
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,090
Let's head to the hotel.

566
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,440
Be careful, Mr. Feng.

567
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,440
This way, please.

568
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,880
Brother Nanting.

569
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,400
Today we prepared...

570
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:55,920
No need.

571
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,980
Just give me the economy class meal.

572
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,440
Okay.

573
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,180
Ladies and gentlemen,

574
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,840
this is the captain speaking.

575
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,440
Due to the weather yesterday,

576
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,370
we diverted to Guangzhou airport.

577
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,290
We sincerely apologize for

578
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,930
the inconvenience.

579
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Now is 9 a.m. in Singapore.

580
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,010
Sir.

581
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,700
Here's a pair of noise-reducing earphones.

582
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,320
When you wear it,

583
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,110
you can isolate

584
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,520
the mechanical noises on the plane.

585
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,120
Thank you.

586
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,430
You're welcome, sir.

587
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,220
Sir,

588
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,600
did you not rest well?

589
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,970
Here's a glass of water.

590
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,250
The humidity on the plane is low,

591
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,390
and it's easy to get dehydrated,

592
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,120
so you need to drink more water.

593
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:35,960
Thank you.

594
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,680
On our right is Sinan.

595
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,470
The available alternate airport is Saigon Airport.

596
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,270
The contract signing is at 3 p.m.

597
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,760
The timing is perfect.

598
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,680
Whose bag dropped?

599
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,910
No,

600
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,120
the sound is from the bathroom.

601
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,050
Bathroom?

602
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,580
Is someone inside?

603
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,500
Could you please answer me?

604
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,250
Hello, can you hear me?

605
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:08,150
Sir.

606
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,060
Sir, what happened to you?

607
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,920
Sir, what's wrong?

608
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,400
Report to the chief flight attendant immediately.

609
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:15,800
Okay.

610
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,060
Sir.

611
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,260
Sir.

612
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,240
Sir, can you hear me?

613
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,600
Chief flight attendant,

614
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,470
a passenger fainted in the bathroom 3.

615
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,500
There is vomit on the floor

616
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,830
but no smell of alcohol.

617
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:27,070
Okay.

618
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,650
Sir! Sir!

619
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,510
What's going on?

620
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,100
Sir.

621
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,380
There's a pulse and heartbeat,

622
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,710
consciousness is weak.

623
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,950
Carry him out.

624
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,400
Okay.

625
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,320
Here.

626
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,920
Let me assist you.

627
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,810
Ladies and gentlemen,

628
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,810
there is a patient on our flight.

629
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,820
If you are a doctor or a nurse,

630
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,510
please contact our flight attendants.

631
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,490
We need your help. Thank you.

632
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,000
Dear passengers,

633
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,530
are there any doctors or nurses?

634
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,490
We have a patient who needs your help.

635
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,650
Dear passengers, are there any doctors or nurses?

636
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,670
We have a patient who needs your help.

637
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,070
Are there any doctors or nurses?

638
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,130
Please contact me.

639
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,100
There are no doctors in the first class.

640
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,560
The economy class as well.

641
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:19,780
The blanket.

642
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,440
Take it.

643
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:22,690
Sir.

644
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,090
Captain,

645
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,300
a male passenger fainted in the bathroom.

646
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,390
He has a heartbeat and breathing, but his condition is unknown.

647
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:35,250
There are no doctors on the plane.

648
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,100
Captain,

649
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,500
now the nearest airport is Saigon Airport.

650
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
Should we divert?

651
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,730
Chief flight attendant,

652
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,420
we will prepare for diversion.

653
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:49,950
Please get ready to calm down the passengers,

654
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,160
especially Mr. Feng.

655
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,280
We are not sure

656
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,650
if we can make it to the signing ceremony in the afternoon.

657
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,200
But the safety of the passenger

658
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,080
is our priority.

659
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,700
Please ask him to understand that.

660
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,420
Yes, sir.

661
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,200
The weather condition in Saigon

662
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,190
and its runway length

663
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,390
all match the diversion requirements.

664
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,780
Inform the air control of Saigon Airport.

665
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,230
Report the flight situation to them

666
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,520
and explain the diversion needs.

667
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:15,850
Okay.

668
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,440
Saigon Control.

669
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,030
Luzhou 805. We have a passenger feeling sick.

670
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,840
Request divert to Saigon Airport.

671
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,400
We need medical assistance after landing.

672
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:30,370
Request received.

673
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,270
We will coordinate right away.

674
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,960
Sir.

675
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,420
Liang!

676
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:37,850
Liang!

677
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,740
Child, what's wrong?

678
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:41,000
What's wrong, Liang?

679
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,680
Sir,

680
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,500
does your son have any medical history?

681
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,290
I don't know.

682
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,210
Liang! Liang!

683
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,450
Wake up! Wake up!

684
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,630
He's awake, he's awake.

685
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,190
Dad.

686
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:52,590
Sir,

687
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,410
where do you feel sick?

688
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,250
I felt dizzy

689
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,700
and lost consciousness after vomiting.

690
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,420
My chest feels stuffy.

691
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:06,930
Do you have any medical history?

692
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:08,620
No.

693
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,750
Maybe it's because I've been working overtime

694
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,100
and staying up late.

695
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,770
How do you feel now?

696
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,340
Can you stand up and walk?

697
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,160
We'll take you to the first class.

698
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,290
The seats are more comfortable there.

699
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:23,520
Thank you.

700
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:25,280
You're welcome.

701
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,040
Slow down.

702
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,200
Be careful.

703
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,880
Xia Zhi, clean the bathroom.

704
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,040
Go back to your seats.

705
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,200
Okay.

706
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,610
Okay.

707
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,510
Thank you.

708
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,250
Be careful.

709
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,320
Here, grab this.

710
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,140
Mind your step.

711
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:41,840
Here, sir.

712
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,360
Is that here?

713
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,560
Slow down, slow down.

714
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,070
Please have a seat.

715
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,690
Okay, thank you.

716
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,320
Here.

717
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:49,040
Slow down and be careful.

718
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:49,820
Slow down.

719
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,460
Be careful.

720
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,250
Sir, please raise your head.

721
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,960
Thank you.

722
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,620
Slow down.

723
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:09,170
Sir,

724
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,030
your son has an exceptional health condition.

725
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,690
Do you think we should divert?

726
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:14,770
Di...

727
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,230
What does divert mean?

728
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,659
We'll land at the nearest airport

729
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,699
so that you can get medical treatment immediately.

730
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,760
This... this is my first time going abroad,

731
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,020
I don't know anything.

732
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,880
As long as my son will be okay,

733
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,420
just do what you need to do.

734
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,120
But we have to respect

735
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,120
the needs of the patient and family.

736
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,690
Son, what do you think?

737
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,360
I...

738
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:40,199
I just want to rest now.

739
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,280
Then how about this?

740
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,480
I'll ask the captain.

741
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,969
Please wait for a while.

742
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,100
Captain,

743
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,480
the passenger has regained consciousness,

744
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,030
and his condition is stable for now.

745
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,760
We've arranged for him to rest in the first class.

746
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,490
How is he now?

747
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,280
He suddenly suffered from chest distress, nausea, and vomiting.

748
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,800
No previous medical history.

749
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,100
Then what do he and his family

750
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,870
think?

751
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,040
They do not understand what diversion means

752
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,570
and said they would follow the arrangements of the flight crew.

753
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,010
This is really difficult.

754
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:16,830
Wait, they walked to the first class by themselves?

755
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,490
Yes, we helped him walk there.

756
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,020
Then since he can walk to the first class,

757
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,680
it means it's not that serious.

758
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,670
The dizziness must be

759
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,720
due to airsickness and vomiting.

760
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,200
Cheng,

761
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,410
go to the cabin

762
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:30,670
and confirm the passenger's condition.

763
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,350
Okay.

764
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:39,650
When I found this gentleman,

765
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,800
he had already vomited.

766
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,230
After about three minutes,

767
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,830
he regained consciousness.

768
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:45,420
Liang

769
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,040
didn't sleep at all last night.

770
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,270
He just kept working.

771
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,580
Maybe it's because he's too tired.

772
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,800
Hello, sir.

773
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,780
I'm a pilot on this flight.

774
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,020
How are you feeling now?

775
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,410
I feel very dizzy,

776
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,870
but I feel better than just now.

777
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,670
Okay, then have a rest.

778
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,830
He looks fine.

779
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,670
It doesn't look like anything's wrong.

780
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,290
Dizziness

781
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,280
shouldn't be the reason for the diversion.

782
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,940
We've already diverted once,

783
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,080
my old back can't stand it anymore.

784
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,000
There are two hours more to arrive in Singapore.

785
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:24,990
Captain Gu,

786
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,060
do you think

787
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,490
diversion is necessary?

788
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:34,210
Whether or not we divert

789
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,310
is up to the passenger's choice

790
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,910
and the captain's judgment.

791
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,770
If I were the captain,

792
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,900
I would choose to divert.

793
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Brother-in-law,

794
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:03,830
we

795
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,190
are expected to land in Singapore at 13:20.

796
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,610
If we divert to Saigon Airport,

797
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,170
we can arrive at 12:10.

798
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,550
We

799
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,290
will be able to send the patient to the hospital

800
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,420
an hour earlier.

801
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,770
But if we divert,

802
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,470
we will arrive in Singapore

803
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,960
at 4 or 5 p.m. the earliest.

804
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,440
I think Mr. Jiang is saying,

805
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,700
if the passenger has recovered,

806
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,360
he might not choose to divert.

807
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,530
But I think

808
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,820
the passenger is still weak,

809
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,340
and he fainted just now

810
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:45,440
so I still think we should prepare for diversion.

811
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:46,540
If we divert

812
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,930
and take off again,

813
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,230
how long will it take?

814
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,650
If the international flight diverts abnormally,

815
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:55,140
we need to re-apply for pre-departure clearance.

816
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,750
We will also need to remake the flight plan.

817
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:57,410
It will take

818
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,990
at least three to four hours.

819
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,780
If we fly directly to Singapore,

820
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,850
it's just one hour later than landing at Saigon.

821
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,040
The medical condition in Singapore

822
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,660
is far better than in Saigon.

823
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,900
Isn't this a better choice?

824
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,320
But...

825
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,210
Besides, this passenger's condition

826
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,460
is getting better.

827
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:24,180
-But, brother-in-law.
-It's such an important new route

828
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,640
and also the first flight.

829
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,750
If we divert again,

830
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:29,750
I'm afraid it will affect

831
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,480
not only the signing ceremony

832
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,270
but Luzhou Airline's reputation

833
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,030
in Southeast Asia as well.

834
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,500
Yes.

835
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:44,800
Mr. Jiang's consideration

836
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,300
makes sense.

837
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,270
One diversion

838
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,920
costs the company hundreds of thousands.

839
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,970
There's also the signing ceremony in the afternoon.

840
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:56,660
With the first flight to Singapore diverting twice,

841
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,060
plus the signing ceremony being canceled,

842
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,920
it definitely doesn't look good.

843
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,660
Maintain flight level, 240.

844
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,190
Right-hand orbit Gansa 263.

845
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,600
Maintain flight level 220.

846
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,850
Right-hand orbit Merians 221.

847
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,220
Luzhou 805.

848
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,670
Your request for diversion has been received.

849
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,800
Expect a landing when you are ready.

850
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,440
Another two aircraft

851
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,590
will make a holding

852
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,670
and give way to you.

853
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,560
Luzhou 805, do you copy?

854
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,130
Stand by. Luzhou 805.

855
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,150
I still think we should divert.

856
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,600
You should try to persuade Mr. Jiang.

857
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,460
There are no doctors on board,

858
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,370
so we can't judge

859
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,350
the passenger's physical condition.

860
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:05,950
After all,

861
00:40:06,190 --> 00:40:07,560
he fainted before,

862
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,110
we can't risk

863
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,430
the life of the passenger.

864
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,240
I think so too.

865
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:14,090
I'll discuss this with Mr. Jiang right away.

866
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,070
Saigon Control.

867
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,280
Luzhou 805.

868
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,230
Cancel request.

869
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,890
Continue to Singapore.

870
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,650
Luzhou 805.

871
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,970
Confirm cancel divert request.

872
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:00,660
Affirmative.

873
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,320
Luzhou 805.

874
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,000
The patient is getting better.

875
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:14,960
Thank you.

876
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:21,570
Captain,

877
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,280
the passenger is still very weak,

878
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,120
we cannot judge

879
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:28,390
whether or not he is still in danger.

880
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,640
If we keep flying, we'll be far from the land.

881
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,240
If anything happens later,

882
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,450
there's no other choice.

883
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:37,810
We are now 150 miles away from Saigon

884
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,280
and 550 miles away from Singapore.

885
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,910
It's only one hour apart.

886
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,210
But the medical condition in Saigon

887
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,870
is far inferior to Singapore.

888
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,710
But some illnesses cannot be delayed.

889
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:49,230
Yes.

890
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:51,530
If this passenger is still in a coma right now,

891
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,210
we'll definitely divert,

892
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,810
but he's awake.

893
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,210
But this passenger is very weak right now.

894
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,060
He is unable to make an accurate judgment.

895
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,520
His father also doesn't understand the flight situation.

896
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,850
But as a flight crew,

897
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,890
we have the responsibility

898
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,240
to consider his safety.

899
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,140
This is my decision after consideration.

900
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,600
What we need to do now is to speed up

901
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,580
and get to Singapore as soon as possible

902
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,600
so that the patient can be treated.

903
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,230
Captain,

904
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:17,780
it's a matter of life and death.

905
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,580
Let's divert.

906
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,040
What are you doing?

907
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,680
Are you going to make your own decision

908
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,480
and ignore the captain's order?

909
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:30,020
Continue to Singapore.

910
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,420
Adjust to maximum speed.

911
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,910
The maximum speed has been chosen.

912
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:41,080
Mach number 0.87.

913
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,960
To shorten the flight time,

914
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,600
apply for a direct flight.

915
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,410
Saigon Control.

916
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,250
Request the shortcut due to the sick passenger on board.

917
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,820
Luzhou 805.
