The rear cargo has been checked.

00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,120
There is no fire hazard.

00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,250
Cancel spray and stand by.

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,320
It's confirmed that the goods were leaked

15
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,830
and triggered the smoke detector alarm.

16

Please loosen your grip,

We need further examination.

There are no obvious injuries.

There's a bruise in the part.

26
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,260
We need to go to the hospital to take an X-ray.

27
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,340
Okay.

28
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,950
Need stitches?

29
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,880
The doctor said it's not necessary.

30
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,540

Are you feeling better?

34
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,090
I just feel a little dizzy.

35
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,040
I think

36
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,450
I hit on the armset.

37
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,589
Don't worry. We're almost at the hospital.

38
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,300
You saved me.

39

Mr. Jiang.

43

How is Cheng Xiao?

44
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
Her condition is stable.

How is the plane?

46
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,830
It's not on fire.

the rear cargo of the plane.

49
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:03,900
And the sudden turn caused

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,180
the goods to collide

51
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,360
and triggered a fake alarm.

52
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,190
This is the best news so far.

53
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,660
The Aviation regulatory authority

54
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,500
is getting evidence.

55
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,770
The recording of the tower has been sealed.

56
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,490
The responsibility

57
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,170
is on Youji Airline.

58

Got it.

59
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,910
The plane is fine. It was a fake alarm.

60
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,890
It was...

61
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,440
I was the one controlling the plane.

62
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:37,850
Another plane

63
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,340
is not in the waiting line.

64
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,340
I think only by turning

65
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,100
can we avoid being hit.

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,510
I didn't expect...

67
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,230

Since I hit my head,

70
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,100
can I still fly a plane in the future?

71
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,300
Don't think too much.

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,350
Everything will be fine.

borrow a casual suit to go out?

77
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,030
I want to keep a low profile

78
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,280

No.

136
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,230
It was caused by external shock.

do I have a concussion?

141
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,270
A mild soft tissue injury.

142
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,690
I know you pilots.

143
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,490
If it's really a concussion,

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,260
you can't fly  for a long time, right?

145

There's no problem.

146
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,810
But just in case,

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,550
you should stay in the hospital for observation tonight.

He has been transferred to the airport police.

He's not injured.

166

I'm afraid you can't hang on if you wait too long.

178
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,410
Let's go.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,780
Excuse me.

180
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,770
Excuse me.

181
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,790
Excuse me.

182
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,890
Ok, Mr. Jiang.

183
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,530
Keep in touch

184
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,570
if there's anything you need to know.

185
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,470
Thank you.

186
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:40,880
Okay, bye.

187
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
Let's get back to work.

188
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,340
Call a tow truck.

189
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,130
Drag the plane back to the hanger to inspect thoroughly.

190
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,090
Ok.

191
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,230
Get to work.

192
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,180
Cheng Xiao.

193
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,080
Are you ok?

194
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:46,520
Come.

195
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:45,580
[Luzhou Airlines]

196
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,550
Nanting.

197
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:46,990
How is it going over there?

198
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,030
Cheng Xiao is fine.

199
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,270
She'll be fine after a few days of rest.

200
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,790
That's good.

201
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,100
I was worried about you,

202
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:53,980
looking at the way you were acting.

203
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,070
Are you

204
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:57,440
free now?

205
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,960
The plane is doing a full check.

206
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:01,910
What's wrong?

207
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,480
My car is in the company.

208
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,340
Come pick me up when you're free.

209
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,010
Sure.

210
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,630
I'll go there after the preliminary examination.

211
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,590
I'll send you the room number.

212
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:15,580
Ok.

213
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,420
How are you?

214
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,660
Do you still feel dizzy?

215
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:36,950
What?

216
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,030
What's your relationship with Yuheng?

217
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,700
What?

218
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:46,990
Let me ask you in another way.

219
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,410
Do you like her?

220
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,290
What are you talking about?

221
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,530
All right, I got it.

222
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,860
You haven't answered my question.

223
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:01,400
If it were not me,

224
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,760
would you have rushed up?

225
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:05,960
Yes.

226
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,700
Really?

227
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,170
Why?

228
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,380
Because I am responsible

229
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,530
for the safety

230
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,510
of each trainee.

231
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,710
What if it's not your trainee?

232
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,980
What do you want to ask?

233
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,740
Instructor Gu,

234
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,960
I don't know if you've noticed something.

235
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,010
What?

236
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,790
You broke the rules.

237
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:37,210
According to the safety manual,

238
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:39,520
the situation in the cabin was unknown.

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,090
The first one to board the plane

240
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,860
can only be firefighters.

241
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,870
What I want to ask is

242
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:47,940
why you would rather break the rules

243
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,540
to get on the plane?

244
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,520
Are you ok, Xiao?

245
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,770
I'm fine.

246
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,730
Great.

247
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,950
You scared me to death.

248
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,630
Thank you, Captain Gu.

249
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,640
I didn't expect

250
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,270
you would rush into the plane to save Xiao.

251
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,420
You're so great.

252
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,680
Of course.

253
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,610
Instructor Gu

254
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,260
is excellent.

255
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,350
No matter who was on the plane,

256
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,270
he would risk his life to save the person.

257
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,230
Right?

258
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:01,540
You bought me so much delicious food.

259
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,090
Yes.

260
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,150
They are all your favorites.

261
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,210
Let me see what you bought.

262
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,440
Instructor Gu,

263
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,440
you ordered food for me?

264
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,080
Thank you.

265
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,330

President Xu, this incident is clear.

268
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,980
It must be Youji Airline's fault.

269
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,610
On our plane,

270
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,750
a passenger

271
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,710
and two members from the crew were injured.

272
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,700
As for the damage of the plane,

273
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,230
the Maintenance department is checking.

274
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,750
But it won't be a big loss.

276
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:54,460
after the investigation meeting,

277
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,980
I will send you a detailed report.

278
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,520
Captain Gu, have a yogurt.

279
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,260
No, thanks.

281
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,540
take care of Cheng Xiao. I'm leaving.

282
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:43,380
OK.

Nothing serious.

287
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,470
I just need some rest.

288
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,860
That's good.

289
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,090
The investigation team

290
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,870
will show the whole process of today's inccident.

291
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,310
I need to remind you

292
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,140
before the investigation.

293
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:07,730
We must tell the same words

294
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,540
in our company.

295
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,260
Got it.

296
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,000
Say what you should say.

297
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,950
Don't say anything you shouldn't say.

298
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,560
Especially,

299
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,960
if the media comes,

300
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
you must refuse the interview.

301
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,040
When the investigation is over,

302
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,360
the company will issue an official statement.

303
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,580
Ok.

304
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,490
I know what to do.

305
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,050
I won't bother you then.

306
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:29,820
Have a good rest.

307
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,020
Mr. Jiang

308
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,880
was rushing to make sure that I will say the same words.

309
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,800
At that time,

310
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,210
he ordered me to brake,

311
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,470
buit my turned.

312
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,580
It's almost the same time.

313
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,440
Don't think too much.

314
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,370
Have a good rest.

315
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,510
We'll talk about the details

316
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:53,240
at the accident investigation meeting.

317
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:54,970
Look.

318
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,760
Two planes almost crashed on the runway.

319
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,540
Fortunately, the plane of Luzhou Airlines

320
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,380
turned in time and avoided the crisis.

321
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,500
After the incident,

322
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,960
278 passengers

323
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,410
and 12 flight crew members

324
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,820
evacuated safely.

325
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,060
Two members of Youji Airline

326
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,040
have also left the plane safely.

327
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,170
Next is the video taken by some passengers

328
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,440
and staff at that time.

329
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,840
As we know,

330
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,720
a male passenger was injured.

331
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,880
A female pilot from Luzhou Airline

332
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,960
was injured in a coma

333
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,000
when saving the last passenger on the plane.

334
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:28,950
Currently,

335
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,880
two injured patients

336
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,720
were sent to the hospital for treatment.

337
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,920
The cause of the accident is still under further investigation.

338
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,530
Now, let's check out international information.

339
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,150

340

Why didn't you answer the phone?

341
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,030
Who is Lawyer Fang?

342
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,840
Why would a lawyer call you?

343
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,790

344
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,380

345
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:18,750
Cheng Xiao, what do you mean?

346
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,020
Are you not going to

347
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,440
answer my calls for the rest of your life?

348
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,070
Is that right?

349
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,040
Can you talk properly?

350
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,340

351
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,720
are you okay?

352
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:29,960
What's wrong?

353
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,760
I heard from the news that

354
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,630
a female pilot of your company got hurt.

355
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:34,730
Is it you?

356
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,540
You mean what happened this afternoon?

357
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,570
I just heard about it.

358
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,450
But

359
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,370
it should only

360
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,170
be reported by Luzhou's local news.

361
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,440
You all know?

362
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,240
The aviation incidents are big news.

363
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,410
My friends asked me

364
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,620
if you were on the plane.

365
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:55,910
Tell us honestly.

366
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:57,160
Was it you?

367
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,170
How could it be me?

368
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,980
I am talking to you right now.

369
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,420
That female pilot

370
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,170
is from our Flight department.

371
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,120
Her name is

372
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,090
Gu Tingting.

373
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,130
She just came to our department.

374
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,300
Really?

375
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,150
Yes, I'm telling the truth.

376
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,400
Dad, I have to go.

377
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,370
I'm busy now.

378
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:19,940
I gotta go.

379
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:21,990
Wait, Cheng Xiao.

380
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,600
Where are you now?

381
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:30,000
I just landed in Chengdu.

382
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,020
You just landed?

383
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,850
Why is it so quiet?

384
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,230
I'm in the lounge.

385
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,990
I have to fly to Kunming later.

386
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,620
How about this?

387
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,390
You make a video call with us.

388
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:42,970
Yes, Xiao.

389
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,310
We're worried about you.

390
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,710
Can you make a video call with us?

391
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,330
Video?

392
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,330
Okay, but I...

393
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,480
The person next to me is sleeping.

394
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,180
I'll find a place

395
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,750
and call you back.

396
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:58,880
Hurry up.

397
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,060
Okay, bye.

398
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:04,630
What's wrong?

399
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,630
Oh no. My parents insisted on video chat.

400
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,770
How can I make a video call like this?

401
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,240
Take care of your family affairs.

402
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,780
I'm leaving.

403
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:23,060
Wait, Instructor Gu.

404
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,550
You are such a great person.

405
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,620
Can you do me another favor?

406
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,220
Can I borrow your shirt?

407
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,880
If this happened to you,

408
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,280
would you let your parents know?

409
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,270
You got on the plane this afternoon.

410
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,780
It's not a big deal. Just help me.

411
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,670
Yeah, Captain Gu.

412
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:48,960
You should help her.

413
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:49,810
Please! I'm begging you.

414
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,710
Thank you. Thank you!

415
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,320
Let me help you.

416
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,660
I'll do it myself.

417
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,320
Xiazhi! Xiazhi! Hurry!

418
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,550
Move that chair under the TV.

419
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:15,720
Ok.

420
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Take away the medicine too.

421
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,170
Thank you.

422
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,770
Come on, help me button this shirt.

423
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,390
By the way, do me another favor.

424
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,880
Can I borrow your phone?

425
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,590
I want to open the app VariFlight.

426
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,440
Good idea.

427
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,380
Hurry up. Bring my shoulder badge on the sink.

428
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,770
Let's go.

429
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,000
Xiao.

430
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,750
I finally found this place.

431
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,320
Look, I'm fine.

432
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,590
Honey,

433
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,770
I'm still in the lounge.

434
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,430
The plane is delayed again.

435
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,310
Xiao.

436
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,860
I'm glad you're fine.

437
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,450
Of course I'm fine.

438
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,230
I'm so glad you're fine.

439
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:45,000
I went out at six today.

440
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,810
I want to take a nap.

441
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,280
It's too hard.

442
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,520
Not at all.

443
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,360
The flight to Beijing,

444
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,990
flight XD8139 is about to take off.

445
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,830
Please board at Gate 34. Thank you.

446
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:03,890
Xiao,

447
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,610
your mother is worried about you.

448
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:07,380
If there's anything about aviation

449
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,460
on the news,

450
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,010
she will be very sensitive.

451
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,970
Just now,

452
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,110
she almost bought a rail ticket to see you.

453
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,080
Don't do it for me. I'm fine.

454
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,860
But you look

455
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:21,770
a little tired.

456
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:24,950
I...

457
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,270
I went out in a hurry and didn't put on makeup.

458
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,600
But

459
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,490
I am still pretty without makeup, right?

460
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,690
Cheng Xiao, how's your injury?

461
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,110
Dad, the captain is calling me. I gotta go.

462
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,800
Bye. Bye.

463
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,600
Oscar-winning actress.

464
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,040
Best writer, director and costume.

465
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,200
You got them all.

466
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,960
You got the best sound-effect award.

467
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:54,950
Mr. Ni.

468
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:57,120
I almost got caught because of you.

469
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,300
You should be fine now.

470
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,620
Don't worry. I'm lucky.

471
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,300
Thank you for visiting me.

472
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,040
By the way,

473
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,440
have you checked the plane?

474
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,200
How is it?

475
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:07,780
We're still investigating.

476
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,150
The tires are torn a little bit.

477
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,000
The rest part should be fine.

478
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,700
As long as you're fine, it's ok.

479
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,110
Pilots

480
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,530
are more valuable than planes.

481
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:17,770
Xia,

482
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,530
how are your colleagues in the flight team?

483
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,320
Yuheng hit her forehead.

484
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,020
But it's nothing serious.

485
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,920
Thank you for your concern, Mr. Ni.

486
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:26,710
By the way, Captain Gu,

487
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,540
I just saw Yuheng off to the car.

488
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,280
She should be home by now.

489
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,900
Instructor Gu.

490
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,600
Thank you.

491
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,480
By the way, Mr. Ni,

492
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,250
I need to report something to you.

493
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,130
The lock of the restroom in the rear cabin

494
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,290
seems to be broken.

495
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,360
When we were evacuating,

496
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,030
somehow

497
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,340
a passenger went into the restroom.

498
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,160
But only the attendants

499
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,860
know how to unlock it.

500
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,910
Sir, have you left?

501
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,080
Have I checked it?

502
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,680
I'll ask someone to check it

503
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,750
and confirm the situation.

504
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:20,720
Let's go.

505
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,030
Let her rest well.

506
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,340
Cheng Xiao,

507
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,740
take care of yourself.

508
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:27,680
Xia,

509
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:29,180
you...

510
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,040
I...

511
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,830
I will accompany her.

512
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,110
Accompany her.

513
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,320
Thank you.

514
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,370
We'll leave then.

515
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,140
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

516
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,350
Instructor Gu.

517
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,870
Bye.

518
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,750
Thank you, Instructor Gu.

519
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,070
Oh my god.

520
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:57,890
What's wrong?

521
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,460
I'm hungry.

522
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:02,840
I want to eat something.

523
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:04,710
Help yourself.

524
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,810
Why are you eating in such a hurry? Have some vegetables.

525
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:23,250
Slow down.

526
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,160
Tell me what happened.

527
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,950
What do you mean?

528
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,090
You must know

529
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,040
I will be very busy

530
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,580
with such serious thing happened.

531
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,980
But you still called me out.

532
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,020
After all, men and women are different.

533
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,310
It's inconvenient for me to accompany her in the ward alone.

534
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,450
Is that all?

535
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,240
Yes.

536
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,710
There's one more thing I don't understand.

537
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,800
It was so dangerous.

538
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:20,840
You didn't know what happened on the plane.

539
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,100
You were not the captain of that flight,

540
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,350
but you went up there to save her.

541
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,050
Aren't you afraid that the plane will catch fire?

542
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,560
I don't have time to think too much.

543
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,210
This is not

544
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,250
the Gu Nanting I know.

545
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,550
If your trainee was on the plane,

546
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,920
wouldn't you go up?

547
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,810
Do you have feelings for her?

548
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,420
What are you talking about?

549
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,690
I just want you to get a girlfriend soon.

550
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,340
You sound like you're not single.

551
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,100
Okay.

552
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:22,700
Zhan,

553
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,980
there's no problem.

554
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,300
It's me who gave permission

555
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,230
when last time the plane flew to Xi'an.

556
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:27,740
I've checked the release permission list.

557
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:28,700
Okay.

558
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,000
It's almost time.

559
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,310
Let's wrap up and go back.

560
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,820
OK.

561
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,500
Cheng Xiao.

562
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,700
Cheng Xiao.

563
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,550
What happened?

564
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,720
Gu Nanting.

565
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,580
Instructor Gu.

566
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,870
I wonder if you noticed something.

567
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,650
What?

568
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,430
You broke the rules.

569
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,940
What I want to ask is

570
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,800
why you would rather break the rules

571
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:48,810
to get on the plane?

572
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,810
[Gu Nanting]

573
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,750
[Are you asleep?]

574
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,040
Mr. Landlord.

575
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,800
It's been a while. How have you been?

576
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,930
Have you heard of this?

577
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:38,710
People don't live for a lifetime

578
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,020
or how many years, months or days,

579
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,110
but they live for a few particular moments.

580
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,310
I felt that kind of moment today.

581
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,210
Have you?

582
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,590
What happened?

583
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:20,290
Do you remember the man

584
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:20,980
I told you last time?

585
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,740
That jerk?

586
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,740
It's him.

587
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,770
Actually, he is the devil leader

588
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,580
I told you before.

589
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,320
Did he torture you again?

590
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,840
No.

591
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:43,930
To be honest,

592
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,290
I think I've fallen in love with him.

593
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,710
Do you think I have no principles?

594
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,530
I complained about him crazily with you,

595
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:01,140
but now I say I like him.

596
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,390
Love has no principles.

597
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,020
Are you sure he worths your like?

598
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,260
Remember the thing I told you last time?

599
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,530
I misunderstood him.

600
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,190
He doesn't like that girl.

601
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,370
But...

602
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:27,120
It seems that he still doesn't like me.

603
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,220
Good luck.

604
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:34,270
Thank you.

605
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,380
Today,

606
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,750
I had a magical day.

607
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,800
I feel like spiting it out.

608
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,720
Sorry to bother you. Good night.

609
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,260
I had a magical day too.

610
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,530
It was tiring

611
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,040
but worth it.

612
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,140
Good night.

613
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,520
Welcome aboard.

614
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,350
Polly.

615
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,760
You haven't forgotten what I taught you.

616
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,740
So cute.

617
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,900
I've checked.

618
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,190
There's no problem with

619
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,050
the lock of the restroom in the rear carbin.

620
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,200
Okay, got it.

621
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:20,970
Thank you, Mr. Ni.

622
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,540
The Maintenance department said

623
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,330
the door of the rear restroom is fine.

624
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,880
Really?

625
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,750
Then how

626
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,230
did the passenger get inside?

627
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:39,270
Maybe he knows how to open the door from outside.

628
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,280
Didn't anyone notice him

629
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,750
when they checked the cabins?

630
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,300
Do you know

631
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,910
who was in charge of the rear cabin?

632
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,580
Was it you?

633
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,480
It's really you.

634
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,200
Xiao.

635
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,890
I know I made a mistake.

636
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,720
I didn't mean it.

637
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:21,110
I saw him at first.

638
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,080
I asked him to get off the plane.

639
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,580
Then,

640
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:24,810
I heard a phone ringing

641
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,140
on a seat.

642
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,920
I thought it was a kid looking for his mom.

643
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,650
So I went to find the kid.

644
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,080
Unexpectedly,

645
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,040
that passenger used the time

646
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,440
to went to another bathroom.

647
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,760
I didn't see it. I...

648
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,940
I know I was wrong.

649
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:37,880
I was careless.

650
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,270
Xia,

651
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,180
we can't hide this.

652
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,350
Go and report it now.

653
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,220
I dare not go.

654
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:46,810
I'm scared.

655
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,420
I'll accompany you.

656
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:49,820
Don't let me go.

657
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,360
I know I was wrong.

658
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,520
I really know it.

659
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,250
I won't do this again.

660
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:55,580
Take a seat.

661
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,110
Sit down. Listen to me.

662
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,240
Listen to me slowly.

663
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,760
Look.

664
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,700
We've been friends for so many years.

665
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,460
Can you let me go this time?

666
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,530
I'll treat you to a big meal later.

667
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,360
How about the barbecue at Binjiang?

668
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,690
I haven't eat it because of the price.

669
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,030
It's not like that.

670
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,430
We're used to playing around.

671
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,410
But now we are talking about work.

672
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:20,700
Have you ever thought

673
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,280
what would happen to that passenger

674
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,830
if the plane was on fire?

675
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:26,310
Isn't it...

676
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,070
It’s not on fire.

677
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,150
Flying safety can’t be taken by luck.

678
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,750
We must make sure nothing goes wrong.

679
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,820
Yes, I know. Safety comes first.

680
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,490
But

681
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,220
But if the company finds out about this,

682
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,700
I will die.

683
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:39,830
I...

684
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,080
You know how hard I got into this company.

685
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,730
You know it very well. I...

686
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:46,150
The truth will come to light one day.

687
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,540
Can you still be a flight attendant then?

688
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:51,570
If you still want to be a flight attendant,

689
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,640
I suggest you

690
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,090
to apologize

691
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,270
to the chef right now.

692
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,730
And try to get a lighter punishment.

693
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,680
Xiao.

694
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,040
Do you really want me to be fired?

695
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:07,320
Do you still treat me as your best friend?

696
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,170
I treat you as my best friend.

697
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,960
So I don't want you to hide it.

698
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:13,530
Who are you to lecture me?

699
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,640
How many mistakes have you made?

700
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,870
I did make many mistakes,

701
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:19,920
but I admit it.

702
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,500
Xiazhi, if you do it, you have to admit it.

703
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:27,850
I don't want you to regret it later.

704
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:32,720
Okay.

705
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:34,580
I'll apologize.

706
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,390
Are you satisfied now?
