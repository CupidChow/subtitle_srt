ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,305
- I'll never give my daughter to you, okay?
- That's what I want to say.

3
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,640
I can't give you my son. I won't!

4
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,683
I won't!

5
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,436
I won't! You little…

6
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,813
Let go of me!

7
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,566
- Stop!
- Stop!

8
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,954
Let go.

9
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,831
And keep your mouth shut.

10
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,341
- This is a residential area.
- And it's late at night.

11
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,682
I'll go inside now, sir. Let's go.

12
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:44,729
Cut it out.

13
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,232
- Let's get in the car.
- Okay.

14
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,986
Come on.

15
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:57,784
Just go.

16
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,829
EPISODE 12
OUR ROMANCE

17
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,514
Gosh, it's been a while
since someone grabbed me by the hair.

18
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,600
- Why did you come here?
- I was worried about you.

19
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,812
Why would you pick on Mr. Nam?
Why would you fight with him?

20
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,108
- I was angry.
- Are you trying to get me fired?

21
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,944
I'm sorry.

22
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,077
Did I ruin it again?

23
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,997
Must you ask?

24
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,251
Darn it.

25
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,423
But it felt good though.

26
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,846
To see you go off on him for me.

27
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:08,730
While you're here,
can you change the light bulb for me?

28
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,106
It's been flickering.

29
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,026
Okay, I'll change the light bulb.

30
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,321
Tell me if there are any other problems.
I'll fix everything.

31
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,655
Should I bring my tools?

32
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:21,409
Then please check out the pipes too.

33
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:23,411
The pipes. The ones under the sink?

34
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,039
Do you mean the pipes over here?

35
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,593
Look, I just wanted
to apologize to Ms. Byeon.

36
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,096
I was going to apologize and leave.

37
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,974
But that jerk annoyed me and…

38
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,230
Right.

39
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,150
Still, I shouldn't have done that.

40
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,529
But that jerk pointed a finger at you
and spoke ill of you.

41
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,865
How else was I supposed to take it?

42
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,540
- Good night.
- What?

43
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,510
FAMILY VILLA

44
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,263
You grabbed the CEO by the collar
and fought with him?

45
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:28,059
I'm telling you first
because you'll find out anyway.

46
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,270
But that jerk grabbed me
by the collar first.

47
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,521
Byeon Moo-jin.

48
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,360
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Well done.

49
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,614
I would've done it if you hadn't.

50
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,242
I don't know if it's a he or a she,

51
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:48,204
but I'll pull out the hair of the person
who uploaded that post.

52
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,415
Well done.

53
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,418
But

54
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,463
I'm worried the CEO might give her
a hard time because of me.

55
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:01,050
That jerk looked like a petty man.

56
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,887
Don't worry.
Mi-rae can take care of herself.

57
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,474
All we know how to do is
grab and pull people's hair out,

58
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,768
but you know how strong and smart she is.

59
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,730
The CEO even came to apologize her.
I'm sure he knows that.

60
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,357
I hope you're right.

61
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,694
How's Hyeon-jae doing?

62
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,612
Is he going to start taking the course?

63
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,823
Yes, he is.

64
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,616
Really?

65
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,494
I thought he was going to throw a tantrum.

66
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,996
I know.

67
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,374
I'm glad he listens to his dad.

68
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:39,672
By the way, what was
his business pitch about?

69
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,424
Oh, that?

70
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,011
It was a tour package business
where people could go with their pets.

71
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:45,928
Here.

72
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,184
Did Hyeon-jae make it himself?

73
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,230
He must've worked really hard.

74
00:05:56,731 --> 00:06:00,026
Anyway, I'll take care of Hyeon-jae,
so don't worry.

75
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,862
Okay.

76
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,332
COURSE REGISTRATION

77
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,543
Byeon Hyeon-jae. Just do as I say.

78
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,056
Did you argue with Mr. Nam last night?

79
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:32,266
No, I didn't.

80
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:36,521
Your father is very angry, right?

81
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,067
He has no right to be angry.
He started the fight.

82
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:45,488
Maybe he'll ask you to break up with me
because of what happened yesterday.

83
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:48,866
Who is he to tell me what to do
with my boyfriend?

84
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,996
We'll be late. Hurry up and eat.

85
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,375
Are you doing okay with work?

86
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,168
Isn't it hard?

87
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,588
I have no time to find it hard.
There's so much work.

88
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,052
I'm really okay now.

89
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,805
I have my team and you, my mentee.

90
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,643
Let's eat quickly and go to work.

91
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,061
Okay.

92
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,379
Gosh, she's something else.

93
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,715
I would've turned in my leave of absence.

94
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,050
That's what it takes
to seduce the CEO's son.

95
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,135
There's a lot to learn.

96
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,970
I won't learn anything from her.

97
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,763
I say it's a talent.

98
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,683
She's so shameless. I hate it.

99
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,851
How frustrating.

100
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:59,479
I have an upset stomach because of her.

101
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,731
Right. That's why you're stressed out.

102
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,775
Did you see the way
she held up her head high?

103
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:08,112
Seriously. She has no shame whatsoever.
For goodness' sake.

104
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:16,454
What is it?

105
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:21,626
You know the sandwich place
right out front at the intersection?

106
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,044
You seem to go there at times.

107
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,546
And?

108
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,007
I think you should take note
of their sandwiches.

109
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,925
Why?

110
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,054
I'd love to have the sandwiches
from our company,

111
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:37,141
but it's impossible to eat them
because they're too dry and tough.

112
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,602
There seems to be a lot of issues.

113
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,564
I mean, the bakery team's sales were

114
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,608
at the bottom again this month.

115
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,069
Last month and last quarter as well.

116
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:52,031
As a colleague, I'm really worried.

117
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,576
This month, didn't your Diver Tteokbokki

118
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,495
place first in sales?

119
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,955
That's right.

120
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:03,251
And last month, her Bravo Tteokbokki
placed first in sales.

121
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,629
It was that way in the last quarter
and the one before that.

122
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,757
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,634
Your team gets compared to ours, right?

124
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,302
I should've held myself back a little.

125
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,264
Ms. Choi, I'm sorry.

126
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,975
I just happen to have
an incredibly talented junior.

127
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,437
Right! My friend is the ace
at her company.

128
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:28,067
So the employees in other teams
and her superiors get so jealous of her.

129
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,529
Incompetent people tend to be busy
bad-mouthing and disparaging others

130
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,072
instead of working hard.

131
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,785
I'm so glad we don't have anyone like that
in our office.

132
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,036
Isn't that right?

133
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,290
All right, then. Good luck with work.

134
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,375
Good luck.

135
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,880
What was that?

136
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,591
What the… Goodness.

137
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:56,887
Gosh.

138
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,807
Was I too aggressive?

139
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,102
Of course not. I'm glad you did that.

140
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,770
You were really cool.

141
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,564
It was the best passive attack.

142
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,443
All right. Let's go
and have something sweet.

143
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,195
Let's go.

144
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:20,536
So what happens to Mi-rae's mom
and President Byeon now?

145
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,663
Will they live together?

146
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:25,750
I guess so.
Now that she knows what happened to him,

147
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm sure she'll take him back.

148
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,504
Think about why
President Byeon went through all that.

149
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,507
With the determination
to come back to his family,

150
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,384
he went on a long and winding journey.

151
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,888
So she should appreciate it,
feel bad for him, and take him back.

152
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,891
If you're family,
you've got to stay together! Am I right?

153
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,268
You have a lot of anger these days.

154
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,397
Well, I wasn't yelling at you, Se-ri.

155
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:53,235
All right.
Don't you feel good after washing up?

156
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,280
Feeling refreshed? Go play now.

157
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,126
Don't worry about what they said.

158
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,920
You know how our neighbors are.

159
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,301
What about you?

160
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,389
What do you think, Moo-jin?

161
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,692
It'd be a lie if I said I didn't
want to get back together with you.

162
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,446
That's just my wish.

163
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,489
But more than that,

164
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,953
I want to be there for you guys
when you are struggling and in need.

165
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,747
That's why I came back.

166
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,000
So don't worry about it.

167
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,836
And don't feel pressured, okay?

168
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,936
Call me.

169
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,730
Call me when you don't want to eat alone,

170
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,983
when you're bored,

171
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,901
or when you miss me.

172
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:25,536
AN JEONG-IN

173
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:37,590
This is Oh Jae-geol speaking.

174
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,426
It seemed like you never feel bored,

175
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,220
so I'm calling you first.

176
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,097
Things were hectic.

177
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,557
Are you busy today too?

178
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,225
Today…

179
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:53,272
I have more free time than usual.

180
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,445
That's good to hear.
Then can you drop by at my hair salon?

181
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,449
You missed a spot on my hair? Where?

182
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:04,533
Well…

183
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:09,330
Right here. It's a spot
that's 3 cm below the right ear.

184
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,582
I completely missed that spot.

185
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,250
I see.

186
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,920
You see, I'm a perfectionist.

187
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,423
Oh, I see.

188
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,886
By the way, do you have plans for tonight?

189
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,472
No, I don't.

190
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,432
What are you going to do after this then?

191
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,643
I'll go home.

192
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,353
What are you going to do at home?

193
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,479
I'll sleep.

194
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,526
Oh… I see.

195
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:52,957
What's wrong? Did I make a mistake?

196
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,999
No.

197
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,337
I wish you'd make a mistake,

198
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,256
but you won't. That's the problem.

199
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,426
Did I hurt your feelings?

200
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,179
No.

201
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:12,393
Who am I to have my feelings hurt?

202
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,769
There's nothing between us.

203
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,283
That's not true.

204
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,371
I don't usually rush over

205
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,457
at the request of someone
who isn't even a client.

206
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:39,962
What are you saying?

207
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,131
I'm also

208
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,050
interested in you, Ms. An Jeong-in.

209
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,305
However,

210
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,934
I'm not in a position
to make a move first.

211
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,647
As you know, I'm divorced.

212
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,359
And I have no money and no house.

213
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,403
I live in the office.

214
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,242
It's not like

215
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,371
we'll get married right away.

216
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,626
Besides, what can I do?

217
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:24,214
I'm so into you right now, Jae-geol.

218
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:27,134
So,

219
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,430
can we officially

220
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,266
start dating now?

221
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,773
Yes. I'd like that.

222
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,612
Would you like that? Do you like me?

223
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,330
Here.

224
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,290
Enjoy it.

225
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,835
Medal.

226
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,922
What do you want me to do?

227
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,646
Hey. Are you up?

228
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,606
You should get ready for work.

229
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,732
I took a day off.

230
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,068
You did?

231
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,238
Why? Did something happen?

232
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,323
I'll pick you up,
so wash up and get ready.

233
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,159
Okay.

234
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,749
Where are we going? To eat?

235
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,877
YOUR SKIN IS THE ANSWER

236
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,045
Why did you bring me here?

237
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,465
You're pretty, but I've booked a treatment
so you can look even better on TV,

238
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,384
and get those blemishes removed.

239
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:53,303
Don't waste money on useless things.
Let's go and eat.

240
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,140
I got a bonus.

241
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,308
I'm using that money, so just follow me.

242
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,189
She's going to be a very popular model.

243
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,066
Please take good care of her.

244
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,359
Okay.

245
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,319
Please wait outside.

246
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,863
Okay.

247
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,698
Please make her pretty.

248
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,658
Good luck.

249
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,665
I'm feeling nervous
because of your daughter's strong request.

250
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:24,501
Don't worry about what she said.

251
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,504
She's just a bit overprotective,
which runs in the family.

252
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:32,551
All right. I'll remove the freckles now.

253
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,888
- It won't hurt much.
- Okay.

254
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,368
Isn't it nice?
It's popular on social media.

255
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,703
Really?

256
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:05,167
I suppose that's why it's so crowded,
even on a weekday afternoon.

257
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,668
You're right.

258
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,338
Let's enjoy a relaxing day today.

259
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,506
Okay.

260
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,436
How does it feel to live alone?

261
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,481
I get lonely at times,

262
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,025
but there are many upsides.

263
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,569
And many things I want to do.

264
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,117
What?

265
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,580
It was my first time hearing you say
that you wanted to do something.

266
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,250
Really?

267
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,919
Is it?

268
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,508
What would you have done
if you hadn't moved out?

269
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,051
I'm glad I kicked you out.

270
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,433
Are you getting along
with the third floor these days?

271
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,154
Good. I feel comfortable.

272
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,866
Oh, look at these pastries.

273
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:21,201
Gosh, they're too beautiful to eat--

274
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,494
You know,

275
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,375
I won't oppose it
if you guys decide to live together.

276
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:34,173
When I saw you work as a model
for the home shopping channel,

277
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,550
it was really nice.

278
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,932
It made me think, "Mom will really live
Geum Ae-yeon's life in a cool way now."

279
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,396
I want you to stop worrying about me

280
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,440
and other people's words.

281
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,609
I want you to do as you want.

282
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:55,777
So,

283
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:59,448
just make a decision that makes you happy.

284
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,158
Okay?

285
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,709
Is Ms. Mi-rae okay?

286
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,920
Perhaps she lost weight due to stress.

287
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,715
Ask her to come right away. We'll give her
a full-course meal with meat.

288
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,637
Isn't it hard to work without me?

289
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,805
So far, we're okay.

290
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,391
Should we hire a replacement or not?

291
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,612
MASTER NAM TAE-PYEONG

292
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:43,784
Wow, no wonder your father is
so proud of you.

293
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,661
I'm sorry about the other night.

294
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,539
I apologize on his behalf.

295
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:56,421
Relay my apology to your father
for me too.

296
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,174
Actually, I should apologize to you.

297
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,512
Despite being an adult,
I behaved outrageously and got angry.

298
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,973
I'm really sorry, Tae-pyeong.

299
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,725
It's okay.

300
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,857
I'm not one to talk,
but your father really dotes on you.

301
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,237
Dads are like that, you know.

302
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,948
We try to act our age
and behave ourselves,

303
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,742
but it's hard to do that
when it comes to our kids.

304
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,414
That's probably why
your father acted that way,

305
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,748
just like me.

306
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,126
I see.

307
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:41,174
Do you run this place
with your two friends?

308
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,301
Yes.

309
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,059
Isn't it hard to teach kids?

310
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:52,686
It isn't hard.

311
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,523
They work really hard, and it's adorable.

312
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,775
I see.

313
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,778
Why did you quit this
and join the company?

314
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,114
To take over for your father
in the future?

315
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,741
No, it's not like that.

316
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,368
I'm just doing an internship.

317
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,498
Father wants me to settle down
and live a stable life.

318
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,916
So I decided to give it a try.

319
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,210
Is that so?

320
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,130
Given your family background,

321
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:23,925
I bet he was against you playing sports.

322
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,345
Your father has been
very patient with you.

323
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,418
Don't you have a date?

324
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,675
Today, I wanted to have a drink with you.

325
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,555
We rarely drink alone like this.

326
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,473
Let's do it today.

327
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,020
Thank you.

328
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,162
Right.

329
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:44,256
I didn't know there's a place like this
near the office.

330
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,718
You feel awkward, right?

331
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,178
You're a noble.

332
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:57,018
When you were little, I used to take you
to the factories in Sokcho and Cheongju.

333
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,311
Don't you remember?

334
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,733
I still remember how you used to
put on a show for the workers there.

335
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,530
Father.

336
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,160
Why did you decide to be my father?

337
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,292
Because you look exactly like me.

338
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,388
At first, it was
a sense of responsibility.

339
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,142
But as you grew up,

340
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,520
you'd run into my arms, calling me Dad,

341
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:45,358
and later, you'd smile at me so adorably
while calling me Father.

342
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,236
Before I knew it, I was your dad.

343
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,659
When you

344
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:59,581
told Mi-rae's father
about the medals I won

345
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,417
and bragged about me,

346
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,589
it felt really weird.

347
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:10,884
It made me realize

348
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:16,765
that you really are my dad.

349
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,643
I'm so lucky

350
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,562
to have

351
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,358
a dad like you.

352
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,950
Okay. I'm glad you feel that way.

353
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,497
When I'm done with my internship,

354
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,250
I'll go back to my old job.

355
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:49,631
To be honest, the work here
turned out to be more fun than I expected.

356
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,591
But

357
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,177
it isn't my place.

358
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,389
I know now that I've tried it.

359
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,100
So,

360
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,144
I think it's a relief.

361
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:07,107
Okay.

362
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,361
You kept your promise, so I'll keep mine.

363
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,031
Don't worry about me.

364
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,868
Because I take after you.

365
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:21,746
Fine.

366
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:27,294
By the way, when are you going to retire?

367
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:31,506
If you retire in your 70s,
we won't be able to go on that bike trip.

368
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,632
Why not?

369
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,135
You're athletic because I'm athletic.

370
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,680
I'm still in great shape, you punk.

371
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,974
It's a ten-minute walk
to the office from here.

372
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:44,144
You should walk this much from now on.

373
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,687
Cheers.

374
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,065
"You should walk this much"? My goodness.

375
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,780
Yes, sir. I'll walk.

376
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,365
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,378
Are you going to keep avoiding me
like this?

378
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,467
What? I told you
that I won't talk about business anymore.

379
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,554
How about the academy?
Will you start going next week?

380
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,016
I'll take care of my business,

381
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,518
so don't tell me what to do.

382
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,731
You obviously can't, so I'm living
with you to tell you what to do.

383
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,862
All right.

384
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,032
I'm being overbearing right now,

385
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,493
but it's for your own good.

386
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,745
I know it's hard
and you may not understand me now.

387
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,082
But in the future, you'll understand me.

388
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,291
You know,

389
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,504
it's true that it's your investment
I wanted the most.

390
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,965
But I also had this thought that

391
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,052
even though Mom and Mi-rae look down on me

392
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,306
you might still believe in me
and support me

393
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,809
unconditionally.

394
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:08,103
Because that's how
I've always been with you.

395
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,481
I thought that's what family does.

396
00:28:56,651 --> 00:29:00,405
Start makeup, 2 p.m., do my hair at…

397
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,361
- Hello.
- Hey.

398
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,238
- Hold on.
- What?

399
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,033
I have a question.

400
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:45,950
What?

401
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,578
Well…

402
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,999
How do you make up with your son
after a fight?

403
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,045
Between men, it's simple.

404
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,631
Go to the bathhouse together
and scrub each other's backs.

405
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,591
Then drink soju afterward.

406
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,888
Scrub each other's backs and drink soju.

407
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:18,566
Hyeon-jae.

408
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,071
Let's go to the bathhouse.

409
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,578
Hyeon-jae?

410
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,230
What is it? Did something happen?

411
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:01,401
It's about Hyeon-jae.

412
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,195
He packed up and left.

413
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,697
What? Why?

414
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,031
To tell the truth,

415
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,702
we were on bad terms because
I didn't support his business idea.

416
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,287
I spoke harshly yesterday.

417
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,581
Did you call him?

418
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,749
Mom.

419
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,169
Hey. Why are you…

420
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,964
Mi-rae, what brings you here?

421
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,591
You told me to drop by for kimchi.

422
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,968
What are you doing here?

423
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:31,681
Well, I wanted to share kimchi
with the third floor as well.

424
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,684
- Let it sit on the terrace for a day.
- Okay. Thank you.

425
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,272
So,

426
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,274
where's the kimchi?

427
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,694
What's going on?

428
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:49,949
I'm sure he's at his friend's place
or a sauna.

429
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,952
He'll return in a day or two.
Don't worry so much.

430
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,498
It'll be a problem even if he comes back.

431
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,918
He doesn't want to return to school
or get a license.

432
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,669
Will you let him run a business then?

433
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,922
We can never do that.

434
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:09,177
In any case, he must get
his bachelor's degree.

435
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,308
Why don't we get him to attend the academy
and get a license first

436
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:18,061
so that he can figure out
where his talent lies?

437
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,896
It'll take forever to figure it out.

438
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,611
Byeon Hyeon-jae.

439
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,528
Hyeon-jae.

440
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,614
Hyeon-jae, when did you come in?

441
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,950
I knew you wouldn't have gone far,
but here?

442
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,035
What an economical way of running away.

443
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,411
Why are you planning my life

444
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,830
without me?

445
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,918
Must you ask? It's because you're
hopeless and immature.

446
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,836
Hyeon-jae, let's go upstairs and talk--

447
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,921
I get it, but

448
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:50,343
did it ever occur to you
that I might be serious about this?

449
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,303
And in the first place,

450
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:55,264
have you ever taken me seriously?

451
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:56,975
Never!

452
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,478
- That's not true.
- It's true.

453
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,773
Even when Mom and Father got a divorce,
no one told me anything.

454
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,401
What's this for?

455
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,944
It's a family photo.

456
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:11,030
From now on, we'll take it every year.

457
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,325
How about Dad?

458
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,079
Why? Why are we moving without Dad?

459
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,873
It'll be that way from now on.

460
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:21,791
Why?

461
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,543
Why?

462
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:25,336
Just do as I say.

463
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,796
Come here.

464
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,089
Why?

465
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,426
Why? Let's bring Dad along.

466
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,763
Why? He should come with us!

467
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,889
You know,

468
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,602
kids said that my father ran away
and my family went bankrupt.

469
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,355
I was bullied until I graduated
elementary school.

470
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,358
- What?
- Hyeon-jae.

471
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,193
Why didn't you tell us?

472
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,154
You're flustered
to hear about it now, right?

473
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,866
One day, the house suddenly disappeared.

474
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,159
The snack bar disappeared.

475
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:57,452
And most importantly,

476
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,829
my dad disappeared.

477
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,708
But no one would tell me anything.

478
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,002
Because I was the youngest,

479
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,379
because I was young,

480
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:11,591
you thought
that I wouldn't understand it anyway.

481
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,633
But,

482
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,261
did you ever stop to think about

483
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,598
how I was feeling?

484
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,104
And look at this.

485
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,065
You split up as you wanted, and now

486
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,609
you're making decisions
about my life without asking me?

487
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,444
- It's ridiculous.
- Hyeon-jae.

488
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,071
I'm leaving for good this time.

489
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,363
- Hyeon-jae.
- Hyeon-jae.

490
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,740
- Hyeon-jae.
- Let go!

491
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:36,908
Byeon Hyeon-jae!

492
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,828
Let's talk.

493
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,303
Will it be okay?

494
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:04,060
Let's leave them to talk for now.

495
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,199
Come to think of it,

496
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,080
you stopped talking about your friends

497
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,125
at some point.

498
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,088
I'm your mom, but I had no idea.

499
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,592
Because I didn't show it.

500
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,680
Besides, you were busy providing for us.

501
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,519
I'm sorry.

502
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,566
I'm sorry, Hyeon-jae.

503
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:58,906
Back then, I only thought about
how I could protect you.

504
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,326
I didn't think about how you'd feel.

505
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,707
I couldn't take better care of you
back then.

506
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,917
I'm truly sorry, Hyeon-jae.

507
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,304
Oh, right. I saw the app you made.

508
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,639
Your dad showed it to me.

509
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,352
It made me want to go on a trip
with Medal right away.

510
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:33,941
I could really feel that you got excited
and put in a lot of work there.

511
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:39,113
I think that's what I wanted to see.

512
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,577
To see you act and not just talk.

513
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,832
It wasn't just your dad's past mistakes
that made me against it.

514
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,751
I just couldn't see

515
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:55,004
why you wanted to run a business

516
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,633
and what you wanted to do exactly.

517
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,968
I was worried.

518
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:05,056
Back in the day,

519
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,185
your dad made me explode in anger
because he was all talk.

520
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,312
You're much better than that.

521
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,439
Really?

522
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:15,107
Of course.

523
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:21,614
So if you want us to listen to you,

524
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,908
show us your actions.

525
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,202
Then, even though it's belated,

526
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,289
we'll try to understand your feelings,
believe in you,

527
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,833
and be supportive.

528
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:38,130
I understand what you mean.

529
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,014
Can you hear something?

530
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:48,766
No. I can't--

531
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:55,940
Gosh, I knew you'd be doing this.

532
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,901
Come on in.

533
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,015
Hyeon-jae, you told me

534
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:33,978
that you might be a better version of me.

535
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:39,400
Come to think of it, you're right.

536
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,652
Hyeon-jae.

537
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm sorry that I didn't believe in you.

538
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,911
Same here.

539
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:54,290
I never asked you about your thoughts.

540
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:57,418
I'm sorry that I only hounded you.

541
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,214
It's okay.

542
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:13,267
There's been a lack of communication
between us, don't you think?

543
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,020
From now on,

544
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:19,065
let's gather and eat together
at least once a month.

545
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:23,277
A family gathering, all right?

546
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,279
- I'm for it.
- Okay.

547
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,032
Okay.

548
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,499
You've been busy
drying and styling your hair

549
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,042
every morning, right?

550
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,796
Now, you can save time getting ready
in the morning

551
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:44,131
with this product.

552
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,842
Not only does it save you time,

553
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,136
but it also helps maintain healthy hair.

554
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,224
Just look at how elegant her hair looks.

555
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:56,352
You can have this look too.

556
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:59,397
Calls are coming in very quickly.

557
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,481
Please hurry.

558
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,775
I hope many of you will take this chance.

559
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,902
You did very well today.

560
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:08,364
Tomorrow, you'll model for a rice cooker

561
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,616
and the oven and air fryer set.

562
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,829
So, tomorrow's show is family-themed?

563
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,580
No.

564
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,376
These are package deals
for people who live alone.

565
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,920
There are many single-person households
these days.

566
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:27,383
With such households as our target,
we'll air this during the prime time.

567
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,301
I see.

568
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,640
You can live with him or live alone.

569
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,978
Many people live that way these days

570
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,688
because it's more convenient.

571
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:04,253
Mom, do you know
what the best thing about living alone is?

572
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:06,505
You can do everything your way.

573
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:12,011
Spend some time focusing on yourself,

574
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,972
Geum Ae-yeon, not your family.

575
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,985
Hey, that isn't your bowl.

576
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,654
Mi-rae bought it for my meditation.

577
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,333
THE MOST POPULAR PRODUCT
AIRSTRAIT

578
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,713
Geum Ae-yeon.

579
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:50,674
You need to smile more
during the after shot.

580
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,217
Yes, Ae-yeon.

581
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:36,929
Moo-jin, do you want
to go on a trip with me?

582
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,975
We just arrived.

583
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,518
Thank you for the car.

584
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,937
If I end up scratching the vehicle,

585
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,189
fix it on your own, okay?

586
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,650
Okay. Don't worry.

587
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,112
Hey. Wait.

588
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,114
- It's okay.
- It's okay. Leave it.

589
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,324
I'll do it. Don't worry. Just go.

590
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,368
- Go on in.
- You made a reservation, right?

591
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,995
- That's right.
- Okay.

592
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,455
This place's much better
than it looked in the photos.

593
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,790
Thank you.

594
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,293
It looks like
you guys left the kids behind.

595
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,505
Yes, we wanted to have some time
to ourselves.

596
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,091
Here's the key.

597
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,176
- Thank you.
- Sure.

598
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,388
- Let's go inside.
- Okay. Let's go.

599
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,941
Pork belly is the best.
I'll grill it good.

600
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:42,828
Why take a photo of this?

601
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,914
I'll send it to the kids.

602
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,169
I'll grill it nicely.

603
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,046
- Okay.
- All right.

604
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,802
So what is this again?

605
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,346
It's a welcome wine.

606
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:02,556
It's the anniversary
of this pension's open.

607
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,480
- We should've bought soju.
- I know.

608
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,899
But let's just drink it.

609
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:12,816
Okay.

610
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,652
Cheers.

611
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,785
It's good.

612
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,960
When Mi-rae and I wanted to cool down,

613
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:34,046
we'd take camping chairs to the rooftop

614
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,466
and drink beer
while watching a video of a fireplace.

615
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,718
It was nice.

616
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,305
But it's much better
to see it in real life.

617
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,267
You're right. Let's do this often.

618
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:49,937
Okay.

619
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,773
You know,

620
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,362
I've been thinking a lot about

621
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,074
what the two of us should do.

622
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:13,544
I've lived with Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae
for a long time,

623
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,423
and now that I'm suddenly alone

624
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,884
the house feels so big

625
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,304
and empty.

626
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:32,396
I also feel lonely.

627
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,110
But

628
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,489
at the same time, I like it.

629
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,620
So for now,

630
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,458
I want to keep things this way.

631
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,630
Okay, you made a good decision.

632
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:05,387
I like living with Hyeon-jae too.

633
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,641
And I can go see you whenever I miss you.
So I like it this way too.

634
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,563
We don't have to live together
and go through all the drama to be family.

635
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,231
You're right.

636
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,448
Like you, I sometimes felt

637
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:27,659
that my life was quite empty.

638
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,746
I thought I'd go to Major League

639
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,416
and lead a grand life.

640
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:40,797
But then I gave it some thought

641
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:46,178
and realized that a grand life
wasn't anything special.

642
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:50,224
We have Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae.

643
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,021
That's right.

644
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,696
That's enough.

645
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,159
That's enough.

646
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,673
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

647
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:26,510
Ms. Byeon, our assistant manager,
here's your water.

648
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,596
Thank you, Mr. Yoo, our assistant manager.

649
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,307
You guys are excited about the promotion.

650
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:35,102
It's awkward to say it myself,
but it's all thanks to me.

651
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:38,230
You're right.

652
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,401
Gosh, my alumnus' daughter
is getting married.

653
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,111
She's Ms. Byeon's age.

654
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,948
By the way, have your thoughts
on celibacy changed?

655
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,117
No, not at all.

656
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,243
No?

657
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:55,205
Aren't you still dating Mr. Tae-pyeong?

658
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,916
Yes, we're still dating,

659
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,169
but I enjoy being independent
and living by myself.

660
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,465
It's made me even more certain that
I never want to get married.

661
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,177
- What does Mr. Tae-pyeong say?
- He's okay with it.

662
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,973
Still, the birth rate is 0.78 percent.

663
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,768
For mankind… I'm being a boomer again.

664
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:20,480
- Is Mr. Tae-pyeong doing well?
- Yes, he is.

665
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:21,398
Get ready.

666
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,899
- Yes.
- Set, go.

667
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,820
Well done, Seul-a.

668
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,488
Eun-woo, get ready.

669
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:29,906
- Yes.
- Set, go.

670
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:35,454
While I'm glad that he came back,

671
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,497
I think our gym is too small for a man

672
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,542
who almost succeeded a major company.

673
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:42,711
All of my students moved
to Tae-pyeong's class.

674
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,922
Yours too? Hey, mine too.

675
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,634
Okay, today's lesson ends here.

676
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:49,885
Stand up.

677
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,096
Attention.

678
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,015
Bow.

679
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,185
- Taekwon! Thank you.
- Taekwon! Thank you.

680
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,481
Hold on.

681
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,735
Ta-da.

682
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,571
What's this?

683
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,490
I made plans for the holidays.

684
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,118
GOLDEN HOLIDAY DATE PLAN

685
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,038
Is this the schedule
for two nights and three days?

686
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,915
We couldn't go on dates
since we were busy.

687
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,418
Let's do everything we couldn't do.

688
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:28,882
I don't think we can do these things
in two months and three weeks.

689
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,177
That's why I created a timetable.

690
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:37,099
Is the schedule too tight?

691
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,062
So we'll drive to Paju in the morning,

692
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,773
go to the Wolmi Theme Park
in the afternoon,

693
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:48,735
and visit the night market
by the Han River late at night.

694
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,239
Mi-rae, you'll get a nosebleed
and collapse.

695
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:59,079
I got carried away
when I wrote down them one by one.

696
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,123
There are many things
I want to do with you.

697
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,875
Are we breaking up next year?

698
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,338
- No.
- I have many things to do with you too.

699
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:14,803
I plan to be with you
for a long time, Mi-rae.

700
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:21,935
So let's take it slowly
and do one thing at a time.

701
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:23,687
For a long time.

702
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,109
What is it?

703
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,236
Are you angry?

704
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,030
No.

705
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:36,241
You made my heart skip a beat.

706
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,623
Then for this holiday,

707
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,500
let's just do these only.

708
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,795
That's everything.

709
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,300
No, just these here.

710
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,594
But I want to go to the Han River.

711
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:57,095
That's everything then.

712
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,223
We'll get nosebleeds.

713
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:05,979
So? You want to do them all?

714
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,523
Will you put that away already?

715
00:51:09,941 --> 00:51:13,820
Do people read novels on smartphones
these days?

716
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,782
They're called web novels.

717
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,450
I became obsessed with them.

718
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,494
They're all the rage these days.

719
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,662
Which web novel do you read?

720
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,498
The title is

721
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:26,750
A Man in High Heels.

722
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:32,923
The main character wants to catch
the bad guys who conned him

723
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,966
while keeping his identity a secret.

724
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:37,928
So despite being a man,
he wears high heels

725
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:40,096
and destroys the bad guys.

726
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,807
It's a revenge story.

727
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,059
I bet the author made a lot of money.

728
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:47,521
Really? It must be a masterpiece.

729
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:52,275
That sounds a bit similar
to what happened to President Byeon.

730
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,318
Don't you agree?

731
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,612
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

732
00:51:56,571 --> 00:52:00,617
Mr. Lee, you should stop daydreaming
about silly things in your room

733
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:02,202
and write something like this.

734
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,996
You never know.
Your work might become a big hit.

735
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,170
For everyone who's sitting here with me,

736
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,589
- I'll pick up the tab.
- My goodness.

737
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,800
- What?
- That's so random.

738
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,427
Picking up the tab is
President Byeon's specialty.

739
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,679
Did something good happen?

740
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:22,556
- Yes, it did.
- Really?

741
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,476
It's that Se-ri is pregnant!

742
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:30,480
Really? Congratulations!

743
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,108
Congratulations. Seriously.

744
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:37,445
You must've gone through
a lot of distress.

745
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,281
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

746
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,867
Congratulations.

747
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,661
I've just entered the safe stage.

748
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,373
Sit down.

749
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,002
Congratulations. So, do you have
a nickname for the baby?

750
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,087
It's Geek.

751
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,172
Since the father is a geek.

752
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,052
Please eat up.

753
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,638
It's on Geek's dad.

754
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,473
Okay. Thank you for the treat.

755
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,434
Cheers.

756
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,811
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

757
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,734
That is some news.

758
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:21,990
Excuse me.

759
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,789
Eat more.

760
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,836
I heard that Ms. An got a boyfriend.

761
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,757
You can't control someone's feelings.

762
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,425
It wasn't just meant to be.

763
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:43,762
Drink a lot today and let it go.

764
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,520
Cry.

765
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,565
By the way, how long are you going to
hide the fact that you're

766
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,359
the legendary author, Lee Seol-rok?

767
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,403
Until the day I die.

768
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,533
I want to stay rich and unknown

769
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,410
all my life.

770
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,039
I agree.

771
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,005
SEOUL CHILDREN'S BASEBALL CLASS

772
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,632
COACHED BY A PROFESSIONAL

773
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,642
Well done. Bye.

774
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,478
Bye. High-five. You did well.

775
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,231
- Bye.
- Bye.

776
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,399
Well done.

777
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,276
Bye. Let's go.

778
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,821
Taekwon! Master, bye.

779
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,905
Have a safe trip home.

780
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,658
Father.

781
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:49,619
- Are things going well?
- Yes.

782
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:50,537
Excuse me.

783
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,834
How can I enroll in a class?

784
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,711
- Baseball?
- Taekwondo?

785
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,295
Well…

786
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:03,508
At that age, it's very important
to learn a sense of community.

787
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:06,720
Baseball is the best team sports for that.

788
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:09,139
At that age, taekwondo is
the most fitting.

789
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:12,392
It improves a child's athletic ability
as well as manners.

790
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,852
It's beautiful sports.

791
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,979
At that age,
a child shouldn't use his feet.

792
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:18,440
He should use his hands

793
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,941
for the brain development.

794
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,151
The brain development?

795
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,194
We don't only use our feet. Taekwon!

796
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,779
We use our hands a lot.

797
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:27,949
Taekwondo is an all-body sport
that improves the body type.

798
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,077
Baseball is a comprehensive sport
which involves

799
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,662
aerobic and anaerobic exercises.

800
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:37,709
Hyeon-seong, what do you want to learn?

801
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,087
I want to learn ballet.

802
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,342
That's what he wants.

803
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,886
Please excuse me.

804
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,345
Okay.

805
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,607
In any case, good luck.

806
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,859
- Good luck to you too.
- Okay.

807
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,497
- Go.
- One, two, three,

808
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,665
four, five, six.

809
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,759
Hey, what brings you here?

810
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,178
I was in the area,
and I thought I'd stop by

811
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,430
to check how you're doing.

812
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,941
So how's it been teaching the kids?

813
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,403
They don't really listen,

814
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,280
but it's fun.

815
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,034
How are things for you?

816
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:56,496
Oh, right.
Congratulations on your promotion.

817
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,458
Despite the promotion,
things are the same.

818
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,711
Still, I did get bigger raise
than I expected.

819
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,255
You should ask for more.

820
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,966
You're the most hardworking
and talented employee.

821
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,434
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

822
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,648
You got swindled

823
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:27,527
and caught the swindler in the end.

824
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,989
Why didn't you tell us?

825
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,163
Telling the story

826
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,167
wouldn't have changed
the fact that I ruined the family.

827
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:45,420
You're right.

828
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,630
But

829
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,216
still.

830
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:58,391
I was too ashamed.

831
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,771
While you guys were struggling,

832
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:08,985
while you were looking after the family
in my stead,

833
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:14,491
I was wandering for years
in order to catch the swindler.

834
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,703
I didn't want you guys to know.

835
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,998
Like the money I came into,

836
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:28,505
I wanted to seem like someone
who came out of nowhere.

837
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,299
That's just how I felt.

838
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,721
Father.

839
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:47,732
I resented you a lot.

840
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:51,027
And resenting you

841
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:56,074
made me struggle a lot for years.

842
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,245
Because…

843
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,499
- Strike!
- Yes!

844
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,919
- Ta-da!
- Dad, you're the best.

845
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,463
Because when I was little,

846
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,967
I liked you a lot.

847
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,601
Now,

848
00:59:25,436 --> 00:59:27,230
I won't struggle so much anymore.

849
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,233
And

850
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,070
I'm glad that you're back.

851
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,798
Shall we have a round?

852
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,177
Okay.

853
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,641
You've probably forgotten how to do it.

854
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,019
Talk after you see me do it.

855
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,354
All right.

856
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,065
After a long and winding journey,

857
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,401
- our story ended as such.
- There you go.

858
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:16,696
No, our story doesn't end.

859
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:19,365
Life goes on.

860
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,620
INTERVIEWEE WAITING AREA

861
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:40,803
Mr. Jung Eui-heon, Ms. Kim Min-ji,
and Mr. Byeon Hyeon-jae.

862
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,096
Please come in.

863
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:44,515
Although it isn't a grand life,

864
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:49,687
we'll wait for the special moments
that'll visit us like presents.

865
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,440
I'm here to apply for the driving lessons.

866
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:53,650
Okay.

867
01:00:55,026 --> 01:00:56,486
Please fill out the form.

868
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:59,238
We'll assign you to a slot
on the desired time and date.

869
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:00,448
Okay. Thank you.

870
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:05,328
Or we'll make the special moments
ourselves.

871
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,792
GEUM AE-YEON

872
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:13,378
Just this once, sir.

873
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,254
You're asking too much.

874
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:17,048
We aren't making much profit as it is.

875
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:19,384
How could we have
a buy one, get one free event?

876
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,135
I can't do this.

877
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,638
Sir!

878
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,237
We work hard

879
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,241
to make each ordinary day special
in our own ways.

880
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:15,398
MISS AE-YEON:

881
01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:18,025
You didn't forget, did you?
It's at noon this Saturday.

882
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:24,615
For a potluck,

883
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:28,119
each person brings one serving of food
and enjoys it

884
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,829
with other people.

885
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:32,790
- We might need more food.
- There.

886
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:33,750
More food?

887
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,001
Look at this.

888
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:39,046
We can take the leftovers home.
Take a seat. Let's eat.

889
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:40,923
All right.

890
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,884
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

891
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:44,177
Enjoy the food.

892
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,183
Hyeon-jae, did the job interview go well?

893
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,686
I totally nailed it.
I think I'll get the job.

894
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:54,687
Really?

895
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,106
Of course. If I fail this time as well,

896
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:58,983
I'll work on my own.

897
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:03,404
If I take a small group of people
on a package tour,

898
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:04,739
word will spread, I think.

899
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,950
Hyeon-jae, I'll spread the words.

900
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:11,162
A lot of students in my baseball class
have dogs.

901
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,163
- Really?
- Yes.

902
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,873
Nice.

903
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,043
Right. I saw an unfamiliar car out front.

904
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:20,129
- Did a new tenant move in?
- What? No.

905
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,882
Oh, that? It's my car.

906
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,134
What?

907
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,386
- You bought a car?
- Without telling me?

908
01:03:28,262 --> 01:03:31,933
- I bought a cheap used car.
- Congratulations.

909
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:34,644
Mom, you haven't driven in ages.

910
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:36,229
I signed up for the driving training.

911
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:39,273
Now that I have more work,

912
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,984
I need better mobility.

913
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,362
I can't take a taxi everywhere.

914
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,198
So I bought a car with my own money.

915
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:50,451
Wow, isn't your mom

916
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:53,621
really cool?

917
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,331
- I agree.
- I agree.

918
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,792
Now that I have a new car,

919
01:03:57,875 --> 01:04:00,253
shall we all go on a trip next month?

920
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,588
Sure. I'll book a lodging.

921
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,924
Make sure it has two rooms.
I'll sleep with Mom.

922
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:08,386
Nonsense.
Your mom and I will share a room.

923
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:09,971
Who are you to decide?

924
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,557
Gosh, why are you guys doing this again?

925
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,475
The room is where I draw the line.

926
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,018
I can't let you do that.

927
01:04:17,311 --> 01:04:19,689
Stop it. The two of you can share a room.

928
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:21,107
What?

929
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,942
I'll share a room with Hyeon-jae.

930
01:04:23,442 --> 01:04:26,445
What? Why?
I'll sleep alone in the living room.

931
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,239
Why? Share a room with me.

932
01:04:28,322 --> 01:04:31,075
- It's uncomfortable.
- Let him sleep alone. He's all grown up.

933
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:34,620
- No, I want to share a room with him.
- Come on.

934
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,081
In any case, we're enjoying our lives.

935
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,084
Sometimes apart, and sometimes together.

936
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:43,629
Thus, we're

937
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,923
pretty happy right now.

938
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:52,305
FAMILY VILLA

939
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:21,459
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE
