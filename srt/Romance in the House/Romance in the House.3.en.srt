ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,511
Louder than your friend.

3
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,681
-One, two!
-One, two!

4
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,558
Strong enough to break down the wall.

5
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,936
-One, two!
-One, two!

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,605
Good job.

7
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,316
Master, show us a flying kick.

8
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,401
-That's random.
-It'll look cool.

9
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,904
-Show us, Master.
-A flying kick!

10
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,781
-Show us!
-Show us!

11
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,824
-Show us!
-All right. Quiet down.

12
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,411
-I'll show you only once.
-Okay!

13
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:36,137
Master, you use a flying kick
to fight the villains, right?

14
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,222
What?

15
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,558
What on earth is it?
What's the reason, you bastard?

16
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,811
I told you to let go. Let go!

17
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,897
Get your hands off right this instant!

18
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,569
Honey!

19
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:53,780
Well…

20
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,491
Well…

21
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,665
JPLUS

22
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,338
Is there an event in the store today?

23
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,590
There's an event, indeed.

24
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,094
Look over there.

25
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:20,890
-You're so cool.
-Okay.

26
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,184
-Thank you.
-Sure.

27
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,270
Please use a cart next time.

28
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,483
Excuse me, would you please get me
that item down from the shelf?

29
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,944
He teaches children
at a taekwondo gym in the evening.

30
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,070
And he's 28 years old.

31
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,698
How do you know that?

32
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,994
He's well-known as Mr. Handsome Back
in the company.

33
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,620
It's all thanks to you.

34
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,165
Me? Why?

35
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,667
Remember when you passed out?

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,670
-Oh, no.
-Ms. Byeon.

37
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,088
What should we do?

38
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,257
Excuse me, please help us.

39
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,718
-Hurry up.
-Carry her.

40
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:59,012
Be careful.

41
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,432
Ms. Byeon.

42
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,183
Oh, no.

43
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,813
Where did Superman suddenly come from?

44
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,859
Thanks to him, everyone has forgotten
all about what happened

45
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,028
with your obnoxious ex-boyfriend.

46
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,088
Excuse me.

47
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,424
I have something to tell you.

48
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,846
That day, your parents…

49
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:50,688
JPLUS
SECURITY, NAM TAE-PYEONG

50
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,482
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong,
I have a favor to ask of you.

51
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:56,986
What is it?

52
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:01,532
Please don't talk about
what happened that day in the mart.

53
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,619
If anyone tells my mom

54
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,455
about what happened that day,

55
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,208
I'll think that you spread the story and…

56
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:18,424
And I'll get you fired
with the authority of the head office.

57
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,309
"The authority of the head office"?

58
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:40,905
Well…

59
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,575
I wasn't going to talk nonsense.

60
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,790
I wanted to apologize to you
for kicking your father.

61
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,751
I'm sorry.

62
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,255
No need to apologize for that.

63
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,216
It was satisfying.

64
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,307
"Satisfying"?

65
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,231
Monthly rent.

66
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,028
That'll be free for you.

67
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:27,452
Why isn't she… There she is.
Just a moment.

68
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,705
Hello, we're here to view Unit 102.

69
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,332
-Okay. Let's go inside.
-Okay.

70
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,876
-Hold on.
-Hello.

71
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,586
Hello.

72
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,465
We're sorry,
but we're no longer showing our place.

73
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,591
-What?
-Excuse me?

74
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,801
Gosh, what are you talking about?

75
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,929
We're not moving.

76
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,811
EPISODE 3
THE GREAT BYEON-SBY'S SECRET

77
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,606
You fell for his promise
to waive the rent?

78
00:05:57,273 --> 00:06:00,234
We pay 700,000 won a month.
That's almost 10 million a year.

79
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,613
There's no need to waste
your hard-earned money for rent.

80
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,198
It isn't a waste.

81
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,158
It is one of the reasons I work so hard.

82
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:10,328
Exactly. We can save up more for key money

83
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,163
and move to a better place.

84
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,457
We can take out another loan.

85
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,250
I promised to find a way.

86
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,212
We already got loans
to pay the key money for this place.

87
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,838
We can't take out another loan.

88
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,342
Realistically, it's impossible
to move right away.

89
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,761
Mom, are you in your right mind?

90
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,596
Yes, I am.

91
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,140
You'll live with Father?
In the same building?

92
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,477
He's the one who bought it and came back.

93
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,646
Why should we move out?

94
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,564
We can live with our eyes and ears shut.

95
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,317
I can do it.

96
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,985
So can you.

97
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,864
Do you know what our neighbors
are saying about us?

98
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:50,284
They've always gossiped about us, okay?

99
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:53,663
Those things don't scare me at all.
Money scares me.

100
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,374
-Are you getting swayed?
-By what?

101
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:59,085
By Father, who is suddenly rich,
and begging for you back.

102
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,590
Hey, Byeon Mi-rae.

103
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,097
Say that again.

104
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,975
What's swaying me?

105
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,898
The leaves are swaying.

106
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,775
Gosh, it must be windy.

107
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:23,860
In any case,

108
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,863
that's how it'll be.

109
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,614
Understood?

110
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,824
That's what I'm talking about.

111
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:13,993
All right.

112
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,836
Who is it?

113
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,468
Can I come in for a second?

114
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,275
I guess your mom accepted my offer.

115
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,783
If you want to be on a power trip
over rent,

116
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,409
just give us the money instead.

117
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,119
Right.

118
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,415
You didn't give a dime for alimony
when you got a divorce.

119
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,960
My mom was only left with a wedding ring.

120
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,963
-Give it to us now.
-I don't want to.

121
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,175
What on earth do you want?

122
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,929
I'm going to seduce your mom again.

123
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,519
Did you remarry several times
after the divorce?

124
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,437
Did those women refuse to live with you?

125
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,734
-Do you want my family register?
-Are you deathly ill?

126
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,194
My medical report too?

127
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,947
Or did you commit a terrible crime?

128
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,954
I just want to live with my wife,
that's all.

129
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,789
She's my mom. I'll live with her.

130
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,333
Byeon Mi-rae, are you anxious…

131
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,172
that I'll steal her from you?

132
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,094
Are you filming a drama?

133
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,263
-Want to make a bet?
-On what?

134
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,065
Want a drink?

135
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,151
What are you doing?

136
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,863
"Pledge."

137
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,450
"If I, Byeon Moo-jin,

138
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,952
fail to seduce…"

139
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,457
"Seduce" sounds a bit… Woo? Reconcile?

140
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,416
Okay.

141
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:31,213
"…fail to reconcile with Geum Ae-yeon,

142
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,841
I will pay the alimony owed."

143
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,510
How much do you think?

144
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,490
Considering the inflation rate
and overdue interest of 11 years…

145
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,163
You should give us the villa.

146
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:07,541
Okay.

147
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,880
"As alimony, I'll hand over ownership

148
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,217
of the villa to Geum Ae-yeon."

149
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,260
-And the time limit?
-Four weeks.

150
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,597
Like the consideration period
when getting a divorce.

151
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,601
BYEON MOO-JIN

152
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:27,603
Sign it.

153
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,565
BYEON MI-RAE

154
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,319
You know that it's legally binding, right?

155
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,531
Of course, I do.

156
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,451
One more thing.
If your mom and I get back together,

157
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,875
you know that you and Hyeon-jae will come
as a bundle, right?

158
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,713
Let's say we get the villa.

159
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,967
You know that you have to pack up
and leave, right?

160
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,315
You can do it!

161
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,277
You can do it, Geum Ae-yeon!

162
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,573
Just focus on the rent.

163
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,867
Money is what's scary.

164
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,495
Byeon Moo-jin is nothing.

165
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,338
My goodness. Hello, sir.

166
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,507
Have a seat. What brings you here?

167
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,343
I want to change the door lock.

168
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:42,636
Which lock do you want?

169
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,931
Well, a sturdy one that can't be picked.

170
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,478
Do you have trouble sleeping these days?
Your face is pale.

171
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,689
Can I get it changed today?

172
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,024
Of course.

173
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,696
What? It's President Byeon.

174
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,780
What?

175
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,742
Perfect. The landlord should pay
for the door lock.

176
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,119
I'll talk to him for you. Please wait.

177
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,041
President Byeon.

178
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:14,793
Mr. Jang, do you make signboards too?

179
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,921
Come on, I make everything.

180
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,006
Do you want a new signboard for the villa?

181
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,884
The broken sign proclaims
that there was a fire.

182
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,762
Good idea. That way,
the property value will go up

183
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,347
and you'll make more money.

184
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:31,227
So tell me.

185
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,563
Where did you invest your money?

186
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,524
Just tell me.

187
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,400
I thought…

188
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,321
that bet was over.

189
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,869
Right.

190
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,747
What kind of sign do you want?

191
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,042
Right. While you're at it,
get a new door lock

192
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,545
for the semi-basement unit.

193
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,671
Here.

194
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,006
Sir.

195
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,676
-What?
-The man from our semi-basement unit?

196
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,706
I had it notarized.

197
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,957
You can't pull out now.

198
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,257
It's our rent for this month.

199
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:45,926
Take it.

200
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,849
You took cash out for this?

201
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,143
I didn't know your account number.

202
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,355
Is there anything you want to add?

203
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,734
Anything else you want from me.

204
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,743
As for that, I already told you
a long time ago.

205
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,705
Get lost.

206
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,584
Stay away from my family…

207
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,461
until you die.

208
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,634
I guess you forgot.

209
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,803
Seeing that you came back like this.

210
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,813
The promise from 11 years ago
should've been the priority between us.

211
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,608
Since he broke our promise and came back,

212
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,861
he should pay the penalty

213
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:48,072
as well as all the interest.

214
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,201
Hello, I'll have one iced chocolate--

215
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,495
And an iced Americano
with five espresso shots.

216
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,747
And the biggest size for the Americano.

217
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,748
Okay.

218
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,006
It's on me.

219
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,134
-Because you feel bad?
-Yes.

220
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,179
And to silence me?

221
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,431
That's right.

222
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,476
To repay you for the hospital bill,

223
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,603
I'll buy you a drink
whenever our paths cross.

224
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,775
Here's your Americano.

225
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,154
Wouldn't that kill you?

226
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,199
I drink this to live.

227
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,575
I need caffeine in my blood.

228
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,205
How arrogant of him to buy up the building

229
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,749
just to get back together with Mom.

230
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,298
Let's have another great day.

231
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,511
I'll show him,

232
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,556
make him surrender, and win.

233
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,932
So we can get

234
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,726
our peace back.

235
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,195
Byeon Moo-jin, are you out of your mind?

236
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,615
I did get roped into it.

237
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,203
It's not too late to revoke this.

238
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,497
I'll find out what can be done legally.

239
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,541
I can't revoke it now.

240
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,418
I have my pride.

241
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:27,463
Byeon Moo-jin, can't you get a grip
of your situation?

242
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,508
Even the greatest love
can't withstand the test of money.

243
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:32,593
But the two of you…

244
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,889
God… You really think this will work?

245
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,810
Forget it. I'll take care of it,
so just sit still.

246
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:43,604
Give it back.

247
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,277
I said, give it back.

248
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,501
I have no other choice.

249
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,170
I've already come this far.

250
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,174
I can't back out now.

251
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,513
I have to take it to the end.

252
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,789
Sir, are you home?

253
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,290
Gosh.

254
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,715
-Mr. Jang, what brings you here?
-Hello.

255
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,717
To change your door lock.

256
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,928
Gosh, I'm so forgetful these days.

257
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,141
-How much is it?
-It has already been paid for.

258
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,268
-By whom?
-President Byeon.

259
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,811
President Byeon?

260
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,607
Sir.

261
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,111
My goodness, I forgot my toolbox.

262
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,571
Let me get it from my car.

263
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,198
What? Wait…

264
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,367
Gosh.

265
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,331
Sir.

266
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,749
Yes?

267
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,128
You told me that I looked familiar.

268
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,796
What?

269
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,468
I have something to say.

270
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,268
Sir.

271
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,604
Wait…

272
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,321
Yes, he's better now.

273
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,948
I don't know what got him so startled.

274
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,036
I think he's becoming senile. Yes.

275
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,413
Don't worry. Okay.

276
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:11,084
Sir, please tell me.

277
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,587
What's so dangerous?

278
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,675
I promise to protect you,

279
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,136
so don't worry, and tell me, okay?

280
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,598
You guys said…

281
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,310
that the new landlord was suspicious.

282
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,817
I think you guys were right about him.

283
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:36,735
Sorry?

284
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,945
Yes.

285
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,155
I saw

286
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,407
the new landlord.

287
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,794
I saw him the night before the fire.

288
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,257
GANGNAM HOF

289
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,760
I've known President Byeon for years.

290
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,304
He isn't like that. For goodness' sake.

291
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,390
Didn't you see Mr. Choi's reaction?

292
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,684
He's acting that way
because he saw something.

293
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,355
I mean, why would the old landlord
and the new landlord drink together?

294
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,524
If President Byeon knew the old landlord,

295
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:17,651
why hasn't he said anything?

296
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,946
See? Everyone brushed off my theory.

297
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,241
So…

298
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:28,787
Did anyone else see something that day?

299
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,790
Anything suspicious.

300
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,626
Perhaps Unit 301 did.
She's just across the hall.

301
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,169
I'll ask.

302
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,383
Hello, Jeong-in.

303
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,926
Yes.

304
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:44,928
Something suspicious?

305
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,264
Noise? I don't know.

306
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:52,436
Right. One time, I woke up at night
to the sound of the door slamming shut.

307
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,981
Did you hear anyone's voice?

308
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,193
I heard a young man's voice.

309
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,779
When… When was that?

310
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,365
Wasn't it the day before the fire?

311
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,992
What? Was it?

312
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:09,202
I think so.

313
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,829
-It was that day!
-See?

314
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,415
Okay. Have a good night.

315
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,418
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

316
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:20,797
To be honest,

317
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,885
I saw something recently.

318
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,269
-President Byeon?
-I've only seen such a tattoo

319
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,980
-in gangster movies.
-That's right.

320
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,398
Never in real life…

321
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,611
But still, since he was Ae-yeon's husband,

322
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,322
I told myself that I was being ridiculous.

323
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,949
In that case,

324
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,536
what I saw suddenly seems very suspicious.

325
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,037
Did you see something too?

326
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,127
Hey! It's Mr. Poop.

327
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,943
Mr. Byeon came out of a police station

328
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,863
and entered a soft tofu restaurant.

329
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,657
It's customary to eat tofu
after serving time in prison.

330
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:12,367
Hey, that restaurant has…

331
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,582
tasty food.

332
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,502
-It's a well-known restaurant.
-It's true.

333
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,256
But when we put together all the stories,
it's a bit suspicious. Don't you agree?

334
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,841
That's nothing.

335
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,092
To tell you the truth,

336
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:35,182
I witnessed a decisive scene
on the rooftop this morning.

337
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,459
Hey, Unit 202.

338
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,129
I'm here to hang my blanket.

339
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,174
What are you burning there?

340
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,056
Traces.

341
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,688
After moving to the crime scene,

342
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,233
he brazenly destroyed evidence there.

343
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:28,777
He's a bold man.

344
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,114
So you got soot
all over the blanket we just washed

345
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,450
and picked up these stupid matches?

346
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:36,660
No.

347
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,912
This isn't from today.

348
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,288
-What?
-What?

349
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,790
Then…

350
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,416
Right after the fire,

351
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,627
I found it on the villa's flower bed.

352
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,676
Does anyone in the villa use matches?

353
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:55,679
Have you seen anyone use them?

354
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,222
He's the only one!

355
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,976
-Goodness!
-You startled me!

356
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,143
The previous landlord said

357
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:06,439
that he'd never sell the villa
when he was alive.

358
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,942
-Gosh.
-It's true.

359
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,529
He said that he needed to keep it,
or else his children would abandon him.

360
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,531
Could that be the reason why…

361
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,824
That's why

362
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,951
he set the unit on fire…

363
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,912
and killed the landlord?

364
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,750
You guys must be having a drink.

365
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,838
-Alcohol is going in
-Alcohol is going in

366
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,756
-My goodness.
-Hey, Ae-yeon.

367
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,260
All right. Let's take a love shot.

368
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,720
Are you guys dating?

369
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,931
My goodness.

370
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,976
Eun-woo, your grandma
is really drunk today.

371
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,021
Everyone knows my grandma
can drink anyone under the table.

372
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,569
The grilled chicken must be all out.

373
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,862
Yes.

374
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,448
Well, then. Enjoy the food.

375
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,283
-Okay.
-Bye.

376
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,578
Bye.

377
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,873
-She left.
-She left.

378
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,793
Despite the divorce,
they're still family and have children.

379
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,462
They might be on the same side.

380
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,714
Oh, no. My goodness.

381
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:16,843
Such a criminal and my Eun-woo
are living in the same building?

382
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,971
I'm more disappointed in Ae-yeon.

383
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,391
We've been neighbors for so many years.

384
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,435
We only have circumstantial evidence.

385
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,645
Until we find hard evidence,

386
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:30,231
watch your mouth and stay safe.

387
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,192
You should be careful.

388
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,235
Stop asking him how he earned money.

389
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,404
It'll get you seriously hurt.

390
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,365
No way.

391
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,501
My father got you rice cakes
as the new member of the villa.

392
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,088
Okay. Please thank him for me.

393
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,216
It's my first time receiving
moving-in rice cakes in a box.

394
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:59,302
Grandma, won't we die if we eat this?

395
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,930
Thank you.

396
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,475
-Enjoy.
-Okay. Take care.

397
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:07,143
Eun-woo, close the door.

398
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,148
Heave-ho.

399
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,484
Carry this. It's yours.

400
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,115
YONGYONG RICE CAKE SHOP

401
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,617
It's the moving-in rice cake.

402
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,786
You liked their sirutteok.

403
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,292
Geum Ae-yeon.

404
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,171
You haven't aged much.

405
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:38,716
You're still pretty.

406
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,059
And you…

407
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,187
are ridiculously the same.

408
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,192
You'll be in your fifties soon,
but you haven't matured at all.

409
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,402
Thank you

410
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,654
for not moving away.

411
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,449
Mr. Byeon Moo-jin, don't be mistaken.

412
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,743
I'm not living there because of you.

413
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,119
It's because of money.

414
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,872
Don't forget that.

415
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,260
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

416
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,678
Thank you for your hard work.

417
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,055
The PR team's meeting is at 3 p.m.
Let's hurry.

418
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,183
I need to use the restroom.

419
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,268
-Please get the elevator for me.
-Okay.

420
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,609
Ms. Byeon.

421
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,405
-You lunatic!
-Father!

422
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,332
Isn't that Mr. Nam, our CEO?

423
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,548
Ms. Byeon!

424
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,999
-Look…
-Then take care, sir.

425
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,292
Wait…

426
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,795
-Hello.
-Hello.

427
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,311
FATHER

428
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:00,984
What did I tell you?

429
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,361
I told you not to take
that lousy security job!

430
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,571
Yes, all clear.

431
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,574
How will you
keep the tteokbokki girl quiet?

432
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,784
I'll look into it.

433
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,078
-Had you listened to me--
-Yes, sir.

434
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,087
Ta-da.

435
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:24,507
It'll take me forever to eat this
by myself.

436
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:27,302
I'd prefer a discount
on the management fees.

437
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,596
Hey, when will your dad come out?

438
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,639
I still haven't even seen his face.

439
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,224
Right now.

440
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,602
Father.

441
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,731
I'm done. Let's go.

442
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,151
Father, she's Aunt Jeong-in of Unit 301.

443
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,528
We're like family.

444
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:50,575
I bought some rice cakes.
Please enjoy them.

445
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,119
Okay, thank you.

446
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,873
We're going to eat out.

447
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,292
Let's go, Father.

448
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,209
Well, then.

449
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,170
Bye.

450
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,297
Let's go.

451
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:16,935
GANGNAM HOF

452
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:18,770
I guess it's a nice spot.

453
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,731
Any business that opens there
has been successful.

454
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,404
Hyeon-jae, you were
in elementary school back then, right?

455
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,615
Yes.

456
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,034
I was young, so I don't remember much.

457
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,831
Does your mom work
at Mi-rae's company now?

458
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,209
Yes, she works at the free sample booth.

459
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,504
Mi-rae wanted to keep Mom from working,

460
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,673
but Mom insisted on doing something.

461
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:48,591
So she just works part-time.

462
00:32:57,725 --> 00:33:01,479
Does Mi-rae like her job?

463
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:03,856
Does she have a boyfriend?

464
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,316
No.

465
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,945
She always says she'd rather use that time
to make more money.

466
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,280
I bet she's never had one.

467
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,661
By the way,

468
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:19,998
why did you guys stay
in this neighborhood?

469
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:22,542
Why didn't you start anew somewhere else?

470
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,211
They wanted to show
the people of Yongdong-dong

471
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,131
that we could get back up on our feet.

472
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,428
You know how unyielding
Mom and Mi-rae can be.

473
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:45,064
Hyeon-jae, take this
and go to the department store.

474
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:48,609
Buy the most expensive fruit baskets
and give them to all the neighbors.

475
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,987
What? Really?

476
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,155
You guys

477
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,449
have done enough.

478
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,410
From now on,

479
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,496
I'll show them.

480
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,706
Father.

481
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,374
You're like Gatsby.

482
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,001
No.

483
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,546
You're the Great Byeon-sby.

484
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,848
Father.

485
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:19,891
Hey, Hyeon-jae.

486
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:26,773
Hello.

487
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,233
It has been a while, Hyeon-jae.
You're all grown up now.

488
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,909
Come by for some barbecue sometime.

489
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,876
I didn't know that bastard still ran
a restaurant in this neighborhood.

490
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,087
Who is he?

491
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:53,674
After we moved out of a gukbap restaurant,
we rented a semi-basement room.

492
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,510
And that bastard was the landlord.

493
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,055
Did he treat you badly?

494
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,100
He hit on Mom.

495
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,852
What?

496
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,522
He always called Mom
behind his wife's back

497
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:10,191
and kept trying to barge into our house
when he was drunk.

498
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,695
I seriously wanted to kill that bastard.

499
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,749
Do you know how much you spent
in a single day?

500
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,377
You are neither a philanthropist
nor a billionaire.

501
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,003
I spent it for a good reason.

502
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,883
I know that you'll increase my fortune,
Jae-geol.

503
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,890
Bye, then.

504
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:50,231
I won't say anything.

505
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,024
Especially not to Ae-yeon.

506
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,114
We're…

507
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,992
complete strangers, okay?

508
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:06,998
How's your health?

509
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,542
Are you all better now?

510
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,688
Who is it? Is it someone in the company?

511
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,857
Or is it someone we know?

512
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:34,942
My ear is bleeding.

513
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,485
Come on.

514
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,446
You deserted your colleague and ran.

515
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,948
Sharing information
is the least you can do.

516
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,367
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

517
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,412
-Take care.
-Ms. Byeon, come on.

518
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,502
What are you pestering Ms. Byeon
all day long about?

519
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:58,966
I think

520
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,470
the CEO's son works at this company.

521
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,013
-Really?
-Are you serious?

522
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,140
But only Ms. Byeon saw the son.

523
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,808
And she won't tell me who he is.

524
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:10,102
I'm so disappointed in her.

525
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,869
Can we talk for a second?

526
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,541
Why don't you buy me dinner?

527
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,003
Your order is here.

528
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,131
Enjoy the food.

529
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,968
Thank you for the food.

530
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,976
-What you saw earlier--
-Kind indifference.

531
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,020
"Be kind to the customer.

532
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,440
But after receiving the money
and serving their coffee, be indifferent.

533
00:37:57,024 --> 00:38:00,069
That way, the customer
will relax and enjoy their coffee."

534
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,366
It's the secret behind the success
of coffee chains in the US.

535
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,035
It's my workplace motto too.

536
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,499
So please don't explain anything to me.

537
00:38:13,582 --> 00:38:18,212
I really don't want to know about
the company owner's family affairs.

538
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,673
I just want to work in peace.

539
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,887
It really is kind indifference.

540
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,349
Well, we now have the dirt on each other,

541
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,435
so I feel more relieved.

542
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,109
Were you really worried
that I might tell the mart employees?

543
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,694
No.

544
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:47,575
That's why I wanted to ease your mind too.

545
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:22,026
Let's continue to be indifferent
and pretend not to know about each other.

546
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,695
Can we, Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong?

547
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,824
Let's do that, Ms. Byeon Mi-rae.

548
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,498
To be honest, it'd be a lie
to say that I'm not curious at all, but…

549
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,850
"You're leading a more tiring life
than I expected."

550
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,311
I'll leave it at that.

551
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,271
And…

552
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:04,360
And I'll get you fired
with the authority of the head office.

553
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,781
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

554
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,414
AMILY VILLA

555
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,460
What's this?

556
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,504
A dining table. You said
it was time for a new one.

557
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,173
Really? How much was it?

558
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,342
It's cheap
since it's ready-to-assemble furniture.

559
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,427
Let's go.

560
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,097
Be careful.

561
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,188
What is all this?

562
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,442
Air purifier.

563
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,193
Massage machine.

564
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,778
Coffee machine.

565
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:48,737
Robot vacuum?

566
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,116
Don't worry about it.
We're returning everything.

567
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,618
Byeon Hyeon-jae!

568
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,663
I'll pull out all your hair
if you miss a single item.

569
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,706
Okay.

570
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,084
I'd like a refund for the fridge too.

571
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:03,794
Yes, the one with four doors.

572
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:10,176
I'll keep the tablet PC and smartwatch.

573
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,845
That crazy bastard.

574
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,264
Why did he give the kid his credit card?

575
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,449
-No, it doesn't fit.
-Why not?

576
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,327
Geum Medal, move out of the way.

577
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,804
We don't need four chairs.

578
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,974
Three chairs are enough for us.

579
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,854
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

580
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,358
It's nice and comfy.

581
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:17,701
By the way, tables always come
with a set of four chairs.

582
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,121
Is it what's considered normal?

583
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,709
Who cares?

584
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,137
Once I become an assistant manager,
I'll buy you a new fridge.

585
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,099
Deal.

586
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,851
Let's split the cost
and get one with four doors.

587
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,271
I withdrew my installment savings.

588
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,356
What? Has it already matured?

589
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,150
You don't need to know the details.

590
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,070
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

591
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:59,118
Gosh, my back hurts.

592
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,536
You worked hard.

593
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,454
I want to get a massage.

594
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,541
Mom, shall I give you a massage?

595
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:06,709
Sure!

596
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,714
Medal, Mi-rae's going to
give me a massage.

597
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,591
Isn't it great?

598
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,260
Cheers.

599
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,478
He gave gifts to everyone
in the neighborhood.

600
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,439
It's a ploy to clean up his image.

601
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:31,400
Just in case, make sure
you don't touch the rice cake and fruits.

602
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,695
I already threw them away.
He could've poisoned them.

603
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:37,656
I ate them.

604
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,621
They were perfectly okay. I'm fine.

605
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:49,043
Perhaps we're overreacting here.

606
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,712
He doesn't seem like someone
who'd do such a thing.

607
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,299
Don't you think he's just a nice landlord?

608
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,635
Haven't you seen photos of criminals?

609
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,346
No one had "criminal" written
on their faces.

610
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:01,889
Right.

611
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,476
How much longer do we have to
walk on eggshells around them?

612
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,978
I doubt we'll find additional evidence.

613
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:08,979
Really?

614
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,233
The landlord

615
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:16,153
got into a fight with someone
in the neighborhood yesterday.

616
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,322
He beat the man to a pulp.

617
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:19,657
What?

618
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,159
The landlord must really be a criminal.

619
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,579
Maybe that was why
Ae-yeon from Unit 102 divorced him.

620
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,915
Maybe he beat her up.

621
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:32,044
Gosh, I was really wrong about him.

622
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,255
I feel so bad for Ae-yeon, Mi-rae,
and Hyeon-jae

623
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,257
for having such a man in their family.

624
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,344
I pity ourselves more
for having such a man as a landlord.

625
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,137
Our lives are in danger.

626
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,848
What are we going to do?

627
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,809
Enjoy a free sample!

628
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,478
Enjoy a free sample!

629
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,563
Really? Okay.

630
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:01,573
Are you here to get groceries?

631
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,658
Ae-yeon.

632
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:06,495
Did Mr. Byeon really set
the old landlord's house on fire?

633
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,083
What?

634
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:13,377
Is Mr. Byeon really an arsonist?

635
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,505
You knew all along, didn't you?

636
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,967
What are you talking about?

637
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,554
Where's the tteokbokki?

638
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,141
Where's the tteokbokki?

639
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,811
What? You jerk.

640
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,396
Hello.

641
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,526
Do you also work here
with my wife and Mi-rae?

642
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,236
Yes.

643
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,864
I'm really sorry about that day.

644
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,073
I misunderstood.

645
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,076
Okay. At least you know now.

646
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,538
I know that
a simple apology isn't enough, but…

647
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,082
I'm truly sorry.

648
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,835
I accept your apology. You can stop now.

649
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,962
Why are you asking me that?

650
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,631
You said that you'd move,
but you're still living there.

651
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,508
-So many things are suspicious.
-Move aside.

652
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,843
I'm not being dramatic.

653
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:03,802
I can't stand

654
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:08,765
that such a dangerous man is living
in the same building as my grandson.

655
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,393
I live in fear because of you people!

656
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,604
Excuse me?

657
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:16,398
Come with me.

658
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,653
Let's talk outside. Come on.

659
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,364
Where will you take me?
What will you do to me?

660
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:28,535
-Excuse me, call the police.
-Come on. Let's go.

661
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,662
-Hurry up.
-Call the police.

662
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:32,289
The police.

663
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:36,084
Please let go of me.
Please call the police.

664
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,468
What are you doing?

665
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,638
Why are you asking Mom about a stranger?

666
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,390
A stranger? This is about your dad.

667
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,600
He's a stranger.

668
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,562
This is obstruction of business.

669
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,981
Do you want to embarrass yourself
by getting dragged out?

670
00:46:58,857 --> 00:46:59,983
Leave.

671
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:12,412
In the end, Mr. Byeon did it again.

672
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,623
He made the business go under.

673
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,958
What did Mi-rae's mom say?

674
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,710
She called me yesterday,
but I didn't pick up.

675
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,921
I thought she'd ask me to lend her money.

676
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:24,174
Don't get involved with Mr. Byeon
ever again, understood?

677
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,635
We'll never see him again anyway.

678
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:29,179
Isn't that right?

679
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:30,556
-That's right.
-That's right.

680
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,308
Apparently, her husband took out
private loans.

681
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:37,854
-I feel so bad for her.
-The snack bar was doing so well.

682
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:40,023
It can't be helped.

683
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,746
-What was that about?
-How scary.

684
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:18,353
Ms. Byeon, you can work with your mother,

685
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,731
but you can't bring family affairs
to workplace.

686
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:25,527
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

687
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,087
You didn't get into too much trouble,
did you?

688
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,715
He just gave me a warning.

689
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:49,051
Don't worry. Let's go inside.

690
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,894
Tell us the truth now.

691
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,356
-Stop--
-As tenants, we have the right to know.

692
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,273
Stop!

693
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,152
You're all too scared to ask the landlord,

694
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,821
so you pester me,
since I'm the easy target.

695
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,325
Moo-jin set the villa on fire
in order to purchase it?

696
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,579
If he were that daring,

697
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,206
I would've stayed with him.

698
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,834
Let's go.

699
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,177
Why did you talk to her?

700
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,696
Is this what you came back for?

701
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,658
I don't need a pledge
or anything else. Just…

702
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,703
get lost.

703
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,692
Why are you asking Mom about a stranger?

704
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,361
A stranger? This is about your dad.

705
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,904
He's a stranger.

706
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,948
I don't have a dad now.

707
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,325
From today onward, my dad is dead.

708
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,912
Stay away from my family until you die.

709
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:43,206
Get lost.

710
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,416
Get lost.

711
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:04,394
Who is it?

712
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,189
It's me, Hyeon-jae!

713
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,032
Why are you so drunk
this early in the evening?

714
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,911
Father.

715
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,791
Father, come here.

716
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:29,669
Come here.

717
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,552
I…

718
00:51:39,095 --> 00:51:41,348
brought something very important

719
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,726
that could prove your innocence.

720
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:55,487
Here.

721
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,367
Answer my questions truthfully.

722
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,749
Is it true that you went berserk
while drinking

723
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:11,044
and beat a man to a pulp yesterday?

724
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,137
Is it true that you have

725
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:25,183
a huge carp tattoo on your arm?

726
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,231
What?

727
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:35,527
Is it true that you use matches?

728
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,613
Is it true

729
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:42,492
that you were with the old landlord
the day before the fire?

730
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,288
Is it true that you were
at the police station due to the fire?

731
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:55,171
Is it broken?

732
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,843
Father.

733
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,387
Who are you?

734
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,354
FIANCÉ SALON

735
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,878
BYEON MOO-JIN

736
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:43,178
Ae-yeon.

737
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:45,764
I'm sorry.

738
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,350
I'm hanging up.

739
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:53,021
People won't pester you about me anymore.

740
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:17,087
I'm here regarding the fire that broke out

741
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:19,839
on the third floor at 83-1 Yongdong-dong.

742
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:22,092
Sorry? What did you just say?

743
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:25,011
Yongdong-dong's Family Villa Fire Case.

744
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,139
I came of my own volition.

745
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,193
Two hours have passed,
but it's still quiet.

746
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:43,738
-I don't see a police van yet either.
-Then go inside and check.

747
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,032
That'd be too dangerous!

748
00:54:47,993 --> 00:54:50,328
I'll wait a few more minutes and…
Oh! He's coming out.

749
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,871
We should sit down and talk.

750
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,290
-I don't have time for--
-The police serve the people!

751
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,918
He's yelling at a police officer.

752
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,378
I think he's resisting arrest.

753
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:00,005
Let's go to Yongdong-dong.

754
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:01,840
Just leave, okay?

755
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:04,634
What?

756
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:06,720
What was that?

757
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,888
Why did the police officer go in alone?

758
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:25,155
I'm… I mean…

759
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,117
I'm sorry.

760
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,619
Tell everyone to gather around.

761
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,039
Right now.

762
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,167
So I'm on my way to Gangnam Hof.

763
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,502
What does Father want to talk about?

764
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,629
No way.

765
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,049
He wouldn't, would he?

766
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,807
Father!

767
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:00,106
Where's Jeong-hyeok?

768
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,026
I don't know.
He hung up after saying that.

769
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,113
Perhaps that jerk lost his temper

770
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,282
and killed my husband!

771
00:56:09,365 --> 00:56:10,700
Come on.

772
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,243
I'll end him!

773
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,828
No way, that can't be it.

774
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,330
Father.

775
00:56:15,413 --> 00:56:16,998
-Honey!
-Honey!

776
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,546
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

777
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,091
I was going to get some help
from governmental authority.

778
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,302
But they're busy serving the public.

779
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:31,721
"Governmental authority"?
Wouldn't it be the opposite?

780
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,598
So let's use this opportunity…

781
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,393
to put an end to all.

782
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,871
President Byeon, let's calm down.

783
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:57,831
Because of this…

784
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,210
I've always been a fan of Chow Yun-fat.

785
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,254
I was being pretentious.

786
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:10,218
So you found this

787
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:15,223
right after the fire and before I moved in

788
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:17,392
in front of the villa, right?

789
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,476
Yes.

790
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:19,561
But

791
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,564
shouldn't you be more suspicious about

792
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:25,608
how I bought the villa
that was never on the market

793
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,277
as soon as the owner passed?

794
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,864
Father.

795
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,742
The man who was with the old landlord
before the day of the fire

796
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,580
-was me, indeed.
-What?

797
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,168
And I did visit the police station
because of that.

798
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,129
I got interviewed and gave them my alibi.

799
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,797
Why?

800
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,010
What did you do to him that night?

801
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:55,221
I mean, what did you say to him?

802
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,600
I tried

803
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:01,436
to persuade him to sell the villa to me.

804
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:08,026
There was a reason why

805
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:11,571
I had to purchase this villa
out of all the properties out there.

806
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,789
You know the reason already.

807
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,711
If you were so curious about
whether or not I was the arsonist,

808
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:29,506
you should've asked me directly.

809
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,509
Why pester someone
who had nothing to do with it?

810
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,141
Bring out some alcohol.

811
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,685
What? Well…

812
00:58:43,394 --> 00:58:44,896
Oh, okay.

813
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,650
For goodness' sake.

814
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,151
President Byeon.

815
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,154
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

816
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:56,616
I, of all people, should've trusted you.

817
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,204
Hurry up and apologize to him!

818
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,956
-My goodness.
-Okay.

819
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,041
Here you go.

820
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,503
What do you think you're doing?

821
00:59:08,586 --> 00:59:09,837
Are you kidding me?

822
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,515
You asked me to bring some alcohol.

823
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:23,601
Oh, you want soju? Soju and beer?

824
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,813
-Bring enough alcohol for everyone.
-What?

825
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:33,027
If you leave this pub sober
and walking on two legs,

826
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,445
I'll end you.

827
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,617
I…

828
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,370
will pick up the tab.

829
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,248
What?

830
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,503
-My goodness.
-You're the best.

831
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,922
Father!

832
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,966
-Honey.
-Gosh, President Byeon.

833
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,719
-Hurrah.
-You're ridiculous.

834
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:03,641
Hurrah.

835
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:06,644
-Please adjust the price.
-In that case…

836
01:00:08,479 --> 01:00:10,023
LANDLORD

837
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,067
Please excuse me.

838
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,573
A PRANK WITH THE CANDLE
THAT NEVER GOES OUT

839
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,703
What's this?

840
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,705
A PRANK WITH THE CANDLE
THAT NEVER GOES OUT

841
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:26,998
I'm sorry.

842
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,000
I refuse to get lost.

843
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:40,511
-President Byeon, we love you so much!
-President Byeon, we love you so much!

844
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,271
My goodness.

845
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:00,782
EPILOGUE

846
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,701
I didn't know that bastard still ran
a restaurant in this neighborhood.

847
01:01:03,785 --> 01:01:04,994
Did he treat you badly?

848
01:01:05,578 --> 01:01:06,871
He hit on Mom.

849
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:12,126
He always called Mom
behind his wife's back

850
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:14,796
and kept trying to barge into our house
when he was drunk.

851
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:20,802
You can take it easy.

852
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,553
I'm trying to remove the knots.

853
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:32,480
What the…

854
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,982
They say a leopard can't change his spots.

855
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:36,693
What do you think you're doing?

856
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:42,323
You know what? Bastards like you
are the most sickening.

857
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,034
Bastards like you only harass young women,

858
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,578
single mothers, and weak people!

859
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,004
But I'm strong and rich.

860
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:03,302
If I see you again
around this neighborhood,

861
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,346
I'll kill you.

862
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:50,683
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

863
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,810
She's the spitting image of her father.

864
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,813
I plan to change my last name.
I'll be Geum Mi-rae.

865
01:02:55,897 --> 01:02:57,273
Bring it on.

866
01:02:57,356 --> 01:02:59,525
When did they become so distant?

867
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,903
A rival you never wanted to lose to.

868
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,781
Who on earth is the CEO's son?

869
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,742
-Why do you ask?
-Must you ask?

870
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:10,036
I'll seduce him.

871
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,037
Byeon Moo-jin?

872
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,539
Still, I have to do it
if I want to score big.

873
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:17,084
You won't tell me, right?
I'll ask him then.

874
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,047
Your mom disappeared.

875
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,465
What did you say?

876
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:28,721
