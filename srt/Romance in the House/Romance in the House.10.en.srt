00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,683
Just in case,

3
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,812
don't expect me
to do a good job and surprise you.

4
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,231
Okay.

5
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,316
It's only for three months.

6
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,734
Don't give me any brainwork.

7
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,111
I won't be able to do it anyway.

8
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,404
Understood.

9
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,660
Don't tell anyone that I'm your son.

10
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,204
Also, don't pester Ms. Byeon Mi-rae
in any way.

11
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,789
Okay?

12
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,001
Let's go.

13
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:14,843
My son.

14
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,056
Your son?

15
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,976
He's at the very bottom of the ranks,
so work him hard.

16
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:25,478
And his mentor will be…

17
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,818
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae.

18
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,286
Mr. Nam, this might be
a sensitive question,

19
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,705
but why did you pick Ms. Byeon
of all people?

20
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,083
Because Ms. Byeon is the ace
of the frozen food team.

21
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,377
He should be taught by a talented one
to learn fast.

22
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,171
Isn't that right?

23
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,422
Of course.

24
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:57,302
Well, then. Please take good care of him.

25
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,350
Have a good day, sir.

26
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,023
- Welcome, sir.
- Hello.

27
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,993
Father.

28
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,620
Father.

29
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:25,163
CEO Nam Chi-yeol!

30
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:32,670
If he comes to my office,
don't let him in.

31
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,174
Tell him that I went somewhere far
on a business trip.

32
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:37,634
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,060
So that handsome security guard was
the CEO's son.

34
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,437
I know. He showed up as an heir.

35
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,656
So the CEO's son
you saw in the elevator was

36
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,074
that security guard…

37
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,201
No, I must be insane.

38
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:06,287
I mean, it was that gentleman, right?

39
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,540
- Ms. Byeon is his mentor?
- Yes.

40
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,709
The CEO picked her specifically.

41
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,461
Hey, she'll hear us. Hush.

42
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:19,008
Ms. Byeon, your life will get
quite exhausting from now on.

43
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,645
Hyeon-jae, come on out.
I have something to say.

44
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,290
I don't need any pocket money.

45
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:57,964
It's one million won.

46
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,091
What is it for?

47
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:03,052
If you can use this money
to make even 100,000 won,

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,306
I'll fund your business
instead of paying your tuition.

49
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,142
Father.

50
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,394
Isn't this method
too tacky and old-fashioned?

51
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,438
You can't do it? Feeling unsure?

52
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,028
Then forget it.

53
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,113
I'll do it. I'll show you that

54
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,490
I'm not someone
who just tries to look cool.

55
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:35,793
The show won't get ruined
because of me, right?

56
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,753
Of course not.

57
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,881
Don't be so nervous. I'm on my way.

58
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,841
Okay.

59
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,970
Please don't tell Ms. Byeon about this.

60
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,557
Okay. See you later.

61
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,242
Do I really look good enough for this?

62
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,458
Forget it.

63
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,419
The daily wage is the same
as the weekly wage at the mart.

64
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,171
Let's go make some cash quickly.

65
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,809
I had forgotten about you.

66
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,449
You didn't buy it, did you?

67
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,119
Well, I wanted to,

68
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,164
but you'd scold me, so I rented it.

69
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:58,417
All right, then. Enjoy the drive.

70
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,002
Where are you going? Get in.

71
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,879
No, thanks.

72
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,382
And what's this?

73
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:07,635
I'm here to escort you.
I'm your manager for the day. Get in.

74
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,304
Don't be ridiculous.

75
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,722
Get in.

76
00:07:14,433 --> 00:07:16,811
- Hey.
- Hello.

77
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,230
Why are you carrying an umbrella
on a clear day?

78
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,358
Isn't that a van for celebrities?
Is someone famous here?

79
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,778
You guys must've gone somewhere together.

80
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,989
It's the Family Villa Club.

81
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,949
We went hiking on a nearby mountain.

82
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,951
I called you guys in the morning,

83
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,327
but neither of you answered.

84
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,413
Well, then. Go get some rest.

85
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,498
You should watch J Home Shopping later.

86
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,375
The infomercial channel? Why?

87
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,543
Later on…

88
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,423
- Ae-yeon will--
- My goodness.

89
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,138
We have somewhere to be. Bye.

90
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,097
Come on.

91
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,477
I'll get in the van, so shut your mouth.

92
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,607
All right.

93
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,532
- Bye.
- Look at that.

94
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:16,871
EPISODE 10
TEARS ARE SALTIER THAN WATER

95
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,874
I told you to keep it a secret.

96
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,463
What on earth is this now?

97
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,509
I told you. I'll be escorting you today.

98
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,637
Please sit back and enjoy the ride,
Ms. Model.

99
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,598
Whatever.

100
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,143
I was an utter fool for telling you.

101
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,216
I'm heading out to a meeting.

102
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,539
I didn't think
he'd actually put me on this team.

103
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,959
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

104
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:49,964
Are you mad?

105
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,092
I'm not mad.

106
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,056
You must've put a lot of thought
into this decision.

107
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,070
But,

108
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,449
I'm very thorough at work.
Will you be able to handle it?

109
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,409
I'll not go easy on you.

110
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,786
Of course.

111
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,790
Then I look forward
to working with you, mentee.

112
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,126
You too, mentor.

113
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,381
This will make
the before-and-after look dramatic.

114
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,133
I see.

115
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,095
Like this.

116
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,766
- Ms. Lee.
- Are you nervous?

117
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:43,934
Yes.

118
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:48,522
I took the job right away
because the pay is good.

119
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,193
But I'm sure you could easily
find someone better. So why…

120
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,695
Is it because I'm Mi-rae's mom?

121
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,114
Yes.

122
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:01,410
She's great at her job,
and she said she got that from you.

123
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,914
She said that you always
see things through until the end.

124
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,922
Ms. Lee, I'll do exactly that
and see it through to the end today.

125
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,091
All right. Let's do this!

126
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,842
Let's do this!

127
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,303
Ms. Lee.

128
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:21,263
Ms. Byeon.

129
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,725
I came here for a meeting
and heard that you were here.

130
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,728
Mom?

131
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,190
What are you doing here?

132
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,276
What?

133
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,197
I'm here for a part-time job.

134
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,449
A part-time job?

135
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,035
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,453
Please, have a drink and…

137
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,082
What are you doing?

138
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,251
Hey.

139
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,840
I'm her manager.

140
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,470
What on earth…

141
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,193
Thank you for your hard work.

142
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,697
Here, please have a drink.
Director, please take good care of her.

143
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,740
Thank you. This drink's for you.

144
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:26,036
Please take good care of her.

145
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,538
You don't want one, right?

146
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,458
- Please make her look good!
- Okay. Thank you.

147
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,511
What's wrong? Are you nervous?

148
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,390
I shouldn't have taken this job.

149
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,738
You used to do this for me
when I was nervous before my game.

150
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,866
It really helped.

151
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,416
Don't worry.

152
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,462
You're the most beautiful woman
in this room.

153
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:21,592
And even if you mess it up,
you don't need to worry at all.

154
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,011
I'll buy all the products here.

155
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,814
The product that sold out
online and offline by word of mouth,

156
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,275
Plus Cushion Compact,
finally arrived at our channel.

157
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,944
So, we've prepared a deal for you!

158
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,654
Buy three and get three free.

159
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:45,991
Plus refills. You'll receive
a total of 12 cushion compacts.

160
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,703
Moisturizing on application,
with a smooth finish.

161
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,706
It's the perfect compact cushion
for women in their forties or higher.

162
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,875
Seeing is believing, right?

163
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,127
Shall we test the product right away?

164
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,686
She looks so tense.

165
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,438
No, I'm sure she'll do well.

166
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,400
She has to, and she will.

167
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,484
ART BEAUTY

168
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,278
My goodness!

169
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,904
He was right. She's really on TV.

170
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,239
Oh, my.

171
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,657
What is Ae-yeon doing there?

172
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,410
- Gosh.
- I can't believe it.

173
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,880
Our model here seems quite nervous.

174
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:44,049
What do you think of
the Plus Cushion Compact?

175
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,348
You used to do this for me
when I was nervous

176
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,559
before my game.

177
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:55,185
It really helped.

178
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,986
First of all,
it feels very smooth on the skin.

179
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,237
That's right.

180
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,031
It's because
it has hydrating essence in it.

181
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:10,034
Dabbing will add moisture and elasticity
to your skin.

182
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,370
Your skin tone changed
as soon as you applied our cushion.

183
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,455
Take a look.

184
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,299
When you reach middle age,

185
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,929
you find yourself doing makeup
with the lights off.

186
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:34,767
You know how it is
with the traces of time.

187
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,021
They're natural,

188
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,901
but they can make you a little sad.

189
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,362
You realize how much you've
put into your life,

190
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,740
but at the same time, seeing yourself age

191
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,118
can make you feel bad for yourself.

192
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,621
That's right.

193
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,875
A SERUM THAT LIGHTS UP YOUR SKIN!
GLUTATHIONE IN EVERY APPLICATION

194
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,294
But for the first time in a long time,

195
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,005
I'm happy to look in the mirror.

196
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,801
I feel like I've received a gift.

197
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,481
Has Ae-yeon always been so pretty?

198
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,693
Yes, she's just been
careless with her looks.

199
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,194
I'd like to order a set.

200
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,030
It's Yoo Se-ri. My number is…

201
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,992
Phone orders and automated orders
are pouring in.

202
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,703
At this rate, we might sell out soon.

203
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:39,873
It's incredibly popular today.
We'll run out of stock soon.

204
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:42,835
I guess people have been waiting.
I'm quite nervous too.

205
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:47,673
Plus Cushion Compact is now
completely sold out.

206
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:49,341
Thank you.

207
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,678
We'll try to process all the orders
from those currently waiting on the phone.

208
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:56,306
It's great to see that customers are
recognizing the quality of our product.

209
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,642
All the products are completely sold out.

210
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,310
We take our leave with your love.

211
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,229
- Customers, thank you.
- Thank you.

212
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,738
So that's what Geum Ae-yeon looks like

213
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,198
when she's not being a mother.

214
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:29,590
Ms. Geum, you looked
absolutely beautiful today.

215
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,801
You're too kind. I only caused trouble.

216
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,637
Still, I'm glad it sold out.

217
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,098
Ms. Byeon left early
due to her next meeting.

218
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,769
She probably left
so that I wouldn't be embarrassed.

219
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,565
By the way, would you hire me again?

220
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,568
I can be a substitute for other models.

221
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:50,736
Of course.

222
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,447
Soon, there'll be an infomercial
for our product.

223
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,075
Please be our model then too.

224
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,369
Okay.

225
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,222
I forgot to remove the makeup.

226
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,476
Stop staring.

227
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,019
I'm worried.

228
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,687
About what?

229
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,899
Men who saw you on TV and fell in love
might flock over.

230
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,447
You want to do this again?

231
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,367
Yes.

232
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,997
It really has been a while

233
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,085
since someone other than you told me
that I did well.

234
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,840
It feels nice.

235
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,262
Well, I think I should buy this van.

236
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,639
We'll use it often.

237
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,391
Don't you dare.

238
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,688
By the way, is there

239
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,065
something bothering you?

240
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,237
No.

241
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,322
You sure?

242
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,367
All right, buckle up. Let's go!

243
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,666
GANGMI BULGOGI

244
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,001
Enjoy your meal.

245
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,010
Mr. Park.

246
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:42,848
Why did you want to have
a welcome team dinner here of all places?

247
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:45,350
We could've gone someplace else.

248
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,477
I wanted to start anew here.

249
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,194
I apologize for what I did.

250
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,029
I humiliated you.

251
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,989
I was being a know-it-all boomer.

252
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,618
- It's okay.
- I won't make such a cliched apology.

253
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,121
I'll let my actions speak from now on.

254
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,957
I'll show you my and my team's sincerity.

255
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,669
Every team member,
especially the ace, Ms. Byeon,

256
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:16,340
will do her best as your mentor.
Isn't that right, Ms. Byeon?

257
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,384
- Yes, Mr. Park.
- I…

258
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,513
apologize for joining the team
rather abruptly.

259
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,936
I'll work hard not to be a burden.

260
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,730
I look forward to working with you.

261
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,540
Of course.

262
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:55,003
All of us welcome you passionately
with open arms.

263
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,090
When I propose a toast,
say, "Mr. Tae-pyeong."

264
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,633
Who do we have with us?

265
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,426
- Mr. Tae-pyeong.
- Mr. Tae-pyeong.

266
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,303
- Who inspires us?
- Mr. Tae-pyeong.

267
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,639
- May he be forever!
- Mr. Tae-pyeong.

268
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,891
- Welcome!
- Welcome!

269
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,025
My love for Tae-pyeong is

270
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,153
Unconditional

271
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,782
My love for Tae-pyeong is

272
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:28,662
as broad as the Pacific Ocean

273
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,331
Not any other oceans…

274
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,792
He seems like the type
who hates such things.

275
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:37,129
I know. I hope our team doesn't disappear.

276
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,423
I'll always run over

277
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,675
A round of applause!

278
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,970
- My love for Pacific Ocean is premium
- Okay.

279
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,346
Be careful.

280
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,015
I love you. Thank you.

281
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,642
My Pacific Ocean!

282
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,394
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

283
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,189
Mission accomplished!

284
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,899
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

285
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,735
Thank you for your hard work, sir.

286
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,986
Thank you.

287
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,905
Shall I call you a taxi?
If you tell me your address…

288
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,950
It's okay. I can walk home.

289
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,910
That's good! I'll walk home too.

290
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,329
Which way are you going?

291
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,497
It'll take you two hours
to walk from here.

292
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,791
I'll drop you off.
My taxi will be here in two minutes.

293
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,627
As for me, the bus is still running.

294
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:18,754
I'll get going.

295
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,964
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

296
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:21,882
Bye.

297
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,801
I'll get going too. See you tomorrow.

298
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,511
- Good work today.
- See you tomorrow.

299
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,808
See you tomorrow.

300
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,810
Okay. Thank you for your hard work.

301
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,105
Just two minutes left.

302
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,576
You did well today.

303
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,164
Do you often have these team dinners?

304
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,793
I couldn't stop them today
as it was your welcome dinner.

305
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,712
Sit next to me from now on.
I'll look out for you.

306
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,132
Let's go.

307
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,972
Cheer up, Mr. Nam.

308
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,307
This is just the beginning.

309
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,439
Let's go.

310
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:26,404
Well, is there any security camera here?

311
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,371
Is this real or fake?

312
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,291
It should cover this spot right here.

313
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,130
Then it's…

314
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,549
What are you doing?

315
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,352
I was passing by…

316
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,106
And decided to do a safety check.

317
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,110
I was just walking her home.

318
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,367
I should go now.

319
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,630
I never thought you'd date an athlete.

320
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,884
Not all athletes are the same.

321
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,599
Do you want to come in for a second
before you go?

322
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,786
Your mom did a lot of legwork
to find this place.

323
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,789
She wanted a safe and clean place

324
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,584
with cheap rent.

325
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,171
I heard you helped her.

326
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,424
Mom becomes extremely picky
when it comes to apartments.

327
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,470
Thank you for doing that.

328
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,437
Do you want a robot vacuum?

329
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:27,525
But I hear robot vacuums might leave
if they get too exhausted.

330
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:36,034
You bought the villa…

331
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,538
from the former landlord's daughter,
right?

332
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,459
Yes.

333
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:47,254
There weren't any issues or anything,
were there?

334
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,299
No, why?

335
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,260
I'm just asking.

336
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,554
Mom needs to live there for a long time,
so I wanted to check.

337
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:19,411
I can ride a bike pretty well now.

338
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,371
So…

339
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,040
Don't worry about me.

340
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,794
Okay.

341
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,088
I'll get going.

342
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,934
I just wanted to meet you.

343
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:47,105
To see what the daughter of the man
who made me cry looked like.

344
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,606
Who are you?

345
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,483
You'll find out soon.

346
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,822
It seemed like something was up.

347
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,926
PRESIDENT KIM'S DAUGHTER

348
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,226
This is Byeon Moo-jin.

349
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:43,244
It's morning! Wake up!

350
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,103
My own space.

351
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,606
Now I have my own place,

352
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,817
not just a room.

353
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,321
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

354
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,199
- How about you?
- I talk to Mom on the phone more often.

355
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,534
Are you keeping it clean?

356
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,577
Of course.

357
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,247
Hang on.

358
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:31,209
I think I talk to her more
than when we lived together.

359
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,836
Check out the photo I sent.

360
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,881
It's clean, right?

361
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,593
Hold on.

362
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,930
Medal, look over here.

363
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,435
How should I put it?

364
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,771
It feels a bit like
a long-distance relationship.

365
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:53,481
I got a new bed for this room.

366
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,943
You're all grown up now,
and I can't share a bed with you.

367
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,576
You know, I kept waking up
because of your snoring.

368
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,661
Hey, I don't snore.

369
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,039
Anyway, I'm going to
get ready for work now.

370
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,000
Okay. I'm going to have breakfast now.

371
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,126
Okay.

372
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:15,211
Right.

373
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,424
You looked good on TV.

374
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,676
You did well.

375
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,304
You looked cool, Ms. Geum Ae-yeon.

376
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,599
Looked cool, my foot.

377
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:30,059
You wanted to be a TV star
when you were young.

378
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,269
Who told you that?

379
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,772
Byeon Moo-jin, that punk.

380
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,106
Mom.

381
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,776
Now that you've kicked out
both Hyeon-jae and me,

382
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,196
you should do everything
you've wanted to do

383
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,197
but couldn't before.

384
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,575
Have a nice day at work.

385
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:46,659
Okay.

386
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,502
Let's go eat, Medal.

387
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,523
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

388
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:02,485
Good morning. Good coffee.

389
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,362
Oh, thank you.

390
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,072
- It's cold but hot.
- I see.

391
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,158
I have a lunch meeting
with a CEO of a client company later.

392
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:10,785
You should come with me.

393
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:12,954
Me?

394
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,707
You can meet him,
enjoy some fresh air, and a nice meal.

395
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,418
Here.

396
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:20,879
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong.

397
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,881
Yes?

398
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,924
Those are new office supplies,

399
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,927
and that's the supply room.
Please go and arrange them.

400
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,978
Listen, Ms. Byeon.

401
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,732
Ms. Na-ra is here too.

402
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,693
Mr. Nam is the newest member now.

403
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,570
Right.

404
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:48,781
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,702
- It looks heavy.
- No, I got it.

406
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,747
- Oh, Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong.
- Yes, Ms. Byeon?

407
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,790
You need to go help out
at the mart alone later.

408
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,626
- Can you handle it?
- Of course.

409
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,046
You know,

410
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,756
I can go help out at the mart.

411
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,049
Ms. Byeon?

412
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,135
I can do it. Ms. Byeon?

413
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,395
Should I go check on him at the office?

414
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,358
Will everyone feel uncomfortable?

415
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:34,994
Should I go sneak a peek?

416
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,915
I don't think that's possible, sir.

417
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,000
Right.

418
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,546
I wonder what Mr. Nam is doing right now.

419
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:55,515
What?

420
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:01,771
He's dancing.

421
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:09,696
Here you go. Take one each.

422
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,948
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

423
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,867
- Thank you. Enjoy it.
- It's tasty, right?

424
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,035
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong.

425
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,372
How could you distribute so many samples?

426
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:21,916
I'm sorry.

427
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,043
When the children's attention is on you,

428
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,587
you must appeal to the parents
to increase sales.

429
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,924
You should've sold at least 50 packets.

430
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:32,593
- Okay.
- Next time,

431
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,721
make sure you remember that.

432
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:36,889
Yes, ma'am.

433
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,064
Ms. Na-ra, the samples are out
for the new product evaluation.

434
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,233
Okay. I'll go get them.

435
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,985
I'm the newest one. I'll go.

436
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,945
Where do I need to go?

437
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:52,989
No, I…

438
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,831
You can get them at the sample room
on the seventh floor.

439
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,875
Okay.

440
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,257
Ms. Byeon.

441
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,844
Go easy on him.

442
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,471
I need to teach him diligently.

443
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,806
The CEO trusted him with me.

444
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,600
Right.

445
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,394
Then let's play good cop, bad cop.
You can be strict.

446
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,396
And I'll be gentle.

447
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,580
Have I been too strict with you?

448
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:45,541
Yes.

449
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,461
But you look cooler when you get mad.

450
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,923
I'll buy you a nice dinner after work.

451
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,718
What are we having?

452
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:00,515
Anything you want to eat.

453
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:42,390
My father had fire insurance on his house.

454
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,811
But they denied the claim

455
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,857
after finding out
the fire wasn't an accident.

456
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,402
He set the house on fire himself.

457
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:57,488
Did you know?

458
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,202
- No.
- Okay, but you must know this.

459
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:07,957
INVESTMENT AGREEMENT

460
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,710
Dragon Investment or something.

461
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,671
He invested his entire fortune
and got scammed there.

462
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,675
You're the one who introduced it to him.

463
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:26,017
I heard you suddenly showed up one day,
acting like you've struck it rich.

464
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,561
With what money are you living so well?

465
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,438
Whose money is that?

466
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,610
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

467
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,612
If he hadn't met me,

468
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,240
he wouldn't have died.

469
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:47,038
So you can resent me all you want

470
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,874
until you feel better.

471
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,593
That woman contacted me.

472
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,803
I think she knows everything.

473
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,234
Your face is full of loneliness.

474
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,778
I think we're similar in that sense.

475
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,621
FIANCÉ SALON

476
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,475
Are you here to get a haircut?

477
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,352
Oh, yes.

478
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:54,063
Oh, no. I'm closing the salon early today.

479
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,859
Then I'll come back next time.

480
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,572
But

481
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,993
you're already here,
and I can't turn away a customer.

482
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,327
Let's go inside.

483
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,583
I'm sorry to trouble you

484
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,211
when you're busy.

485
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,714
Don't worry. It's no trouble.

486
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,760
I've been waiting for you eagerly.

487
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,392
"Fiancé Salon."

488
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,938
Is that the name since your first name is
a homophone for "Fiancé"?

489
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,023
Yes.

490
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,775
Wait.

491
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,404
You didn't forget my name.

492
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,741
Well.

493
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,411
I'm good at remembering people's names.

494
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,955
I see.

495
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,958
Okay.

496
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,046
By the way,

497
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,715
how short do you want the front to be?

498
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,802
Just trim it, please.

499
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,935
The length…

500
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,257
Instead of paying for the haircut…

501
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:51,972
will you be my partner?

502
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,601
Your partner?

503
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,397
This is our monthly transaction statement.

504
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,857
We need to organize it every month
and send it.

505
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,484
It'll be your task from now on.

506
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,861
Firstly…

507
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:09,698
It was another passionate day.

508
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,908
Let's get off work.

509
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,119
- Okay.
- Thank you.

510
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,121
- Thank you.
- You need to get familiar,

511
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:17,832
so check out this statement first.

512
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:18,749
Okay.

513
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,586
Ms. Byeon?

514
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,798
- You should get off work.
- Oh, you should go first.

515
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,884
- Thank you for your hard work.
- See you tomorrow.

516
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,053
Mr. Tae-pyeong must be tired.

517
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,471
I'm okay.

518
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,848
Do you need my help?

519
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,182
No. It's okay.

520
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:39,145
Then I must take my leave
to meet up with a client, so…

521
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,982
- Good night.
- Bye.

522
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,233
Cheer up.

523
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:49,238
You can get off work after you finish it.

524
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,073
Okay. Thank you.

525
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,616
See you tomorrow.

526
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,421
Do you have a lot of work left?

527
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:09,383
I'll help you. Shall we finish it quickly
and get off work together?

528
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,384
The two newest ones.

529
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,555
It's okay. I'm nearly done.

530
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:17,766
Okay.

531
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,817
Come on out after 20 minutes.

532
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,988
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

533
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:17,910
You must've been surprised
because I suddenly made you his mentor.

534
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,746
Yes.

535
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,290
I was surprised, but it's okay.

536
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,295
Is Tae-pyeong adjusting well?

537
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,632
He's adjusting and learning quickly.

538
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,759
I see.

539
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,972
What is he learning exactly?

540
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:41,559
He's doing the tasks
that are meant for the newest recruit.

541
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,060
I see.

542
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,688
That's right. He's the newest recruit,

543
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,649
so he should do
what the newest ones do. Right.

544
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,733
Yes.

545
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,949
Now that I've gotten him
to join the company,

546
00:42:57,032 --> 00:43:00,953
please help him stick around
for the long haul.

547
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:04,206
Ms. Byeon.

548
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,084
Can you do that?

549
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,631
It's beyond my power,

550
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,217
so I can't make that promise.

551
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,887
That's true.

552
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,473
But since you've trusted me,

553
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,893
I'll take responsibility as his mentor
and teach him well.

554
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,898
Okay. Please take
good care of him, Ms. Byeon.

555
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,775
Yes, sir.

556
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:56,133
I thought she was dating Tae-pyeong.

557
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,304
I'm glad I put him under her care.

558
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,896
The fact that the CEO had a son
was a surprise.

559
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:12,816
And he even made a supervisor his mentor
instead of a team leader?

560
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,734
Who's she?

561
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,153
Byeon Mi-rae of the frozen food team.

562
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,363
Byeon Mi-rae?

563
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,240
Come on. Mr. Nam complimented her
for being smart.

564
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,451
- Oh, her?
- Yes.

565
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,244
Isn't she a bit of a show-off?

566
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,412
Yes, she is a bit…

567
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,998
What is it?

568
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,963
- That's her, right?
- Yes.

569
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,384
You're having the same thought
as me, right?

570
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,887
Yes. It sure looks like
they've been together awhile.

571
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,271
GANGNAM HOF'S FIRST ANNIVERSARY!

572
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,234
Hello.

573
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,195
- Jeong-in.
- Congratulations on the anniversary.

574
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,240
As a present, we'll drink a lot today.

575
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:03,575
- Let's go.
- Okay.

576
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,705
Come on.

577
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,376
- Hello.
- You're here.

578
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,677
Isn't that President Byeon's errand boy?

579
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,430
He's a tax accountant.

580
00:45:25,722 --> 00:45:27,433
She's seduced him after all.

581
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:48,287
It's the first anniversary present.

582
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,834
And this is for you, Jeong-in.

583
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:55,919
A reflection of my feelings.

584
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,756
Thanks.

585
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,804
Well, then. I'll take my leave now.

586
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,193
What's up with him?

587
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,864
All right. Shall we clink our glasses?

588
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:25,991
Cheers.

589
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:44,635
It's the first anniversary party.
You must come.

590
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:47,012
Everyone's waiting for you.

591
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:50,182
Go ahead and eat.

592
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,577
What are you doing?

593
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,412
I'm just chilling at home.

594
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,456
Are you drinking alone?

595
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,710
You're sharp.

596
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,593
Is everything really okay with you?

597
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,639
Ae-yeon.

598
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,559
I'm sorry.

599
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,354
For what?

600
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:40,732
That I'm stupid Moo-ron.

601
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,654
Don't worry.
You're not as bad as you used to be.

602
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:46,697
No.

603
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,992
It was such a long

604
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,995
and difficult journey for me

605
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:54,997
to make it back here.

606
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,249
What?

607
00:47:57,332 --> 00:48:00,168
And both in the past and now,

608
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,630
I ruin things…

609
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,217
whenever I try to do something.

610
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:08,594
Byeon Moo-jin.

611
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:09,886
If I ever feel like

612
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,932
I might mess things up
for our family again,

613
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,437
I'll leave you.

614
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,864
Is he just being drunk or what?

615
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,457
Here's your order.

616
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,791
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

617
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:40,876
Please enjoy the food.

618
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:46,673
All right.

619
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,425
Open wide.

620
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,303
- Hurry up. Open wide.
- But…

621
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,017
What are you doing?

622
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,020
I'm comforting my boyfriend
who got hounded by his mentor.

623
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,147
I see.

624
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,192
In that case, can I complain about
getting hounded by my mentor?

625
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,527
Of course.

626
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:10,280
Okay. Today, my mentor…

627
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,449
I cannot believe her!

628
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,661
Who is she to pick on my boyfriend?

629
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,371
Tell her to meet me on the roof.

630
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,251
On the roof?

631
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:34,930
What? Isn't that your father?

632
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,932
He must've been drinking.

633
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,353
You can tell?

634
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,410
- Nam, I'm here.
- Hey.

635
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,453
- Father is here too.
- Hello.

636
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,165
- You came before I began calling again.
- Hey!

637
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,710
- You're here!
- Hurry up and sit here.

638
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,753
Bring the chairs.

639
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,422
All right. Grab that chair.

640
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,299
I told you to come sooner.

641
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,428
- Pour him a glass.
- Here.

642
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,554
Thank you.

643
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,222
Let's get up after drinking this.

644
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,808
- Why?
- Come on.

645
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,561
- Did you drink a lot?
- Yes, we did.

646
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,564
Did the two of you have a fight?

647
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,649
You should've come sooner.

648
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,151
- Sit down.
- Yes, sit down.

649
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,862
Shall we clink our glasses to celebrate

650
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,697
- President Byeon's arrival?
- Yes.

651
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,366
- President Byeon!
- President Byeon!

652
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,035
- What?
- President Byeon.

653
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,414
We're going to move out.

654
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,292
Move out? Why would we do that?

655
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:49,212
I can't live here anymore.

656
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:51,882
I'm scared.

657
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,676
Did he drink a lot?

658
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,886
He drank so much.

659
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,846
Mr. Lee, stop drinking. Ms. Yoo.

660
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,223
Hold on.

661
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,351
What's this about?

662
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,771
Did something happen?

663
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,981
Did they have a fight?

664
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,941
No.

665
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:13,445
I'm anxious
that something bad will happen.

666
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:16,990
- What's up with you today?
- Seriously.

667
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,533
- I can't believe you.
- Tell me.

668
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,368
There must be a reason.

669
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:24,706
- I'm scared.
- Why are you crying? This is insane.

670
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,462
Ma'am, who are you?

671
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,049
I should've known when you asked me

672
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:37,302
to sell the villa for a cheap price
with the talk of an inheritance tax.

673
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,097
The former landlord, Mr. Kim's daughter.

674
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,643
You damn bastard.

675
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:45,852
What are you--

676
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,145
I'm sorry.

677
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:49,940
Father.

678
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:58,573
What's going on?

679
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,661
It's true, right?

680
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:06,164
You and that man teamed up

681
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:08,959
and scammed my father.

682
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,342
You scammed my father into investing
and stole his fortune.

683
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,344
With that money, you bought his villa.

684
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,680
With that money,
you're acting like nouveau riche.

685
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:23,932
Give them back.

686
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,143
Give back Father and his money.

687
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,563
Give them back, you swindler!

688
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,273
Oh, my.

689
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,066
- Let go of him.
- You swindler!

690
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,611
Let go!

691
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,030
- What are you doing?
- Mom.

692
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,200
- Let go.
- I won't.

693
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,458
Seeing as how you aren't saying a thing,

694
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:53,503
you must've done something wrong.

695
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:55,922
But…

696
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:00,552
he can't be a swindler.

697
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,721
What?

698
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:04,347
Had he done something like that,

699
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,393
he wouldn't have come back to us.

700
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,692
How can you be so certain?

701
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:18,820
How can you believe him?

702
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:21,907
He's my family.

703
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,127
Byeon Hyeon-jae.

704
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,838
What do you think?

705
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,509
Of course, I think the same.

706
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,721
He's my father.

707
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:03,657
I believe in him too.

708
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,247
Moo-jin.

709
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,252
- Wait.
- Let go of me.

710
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,796
Let go of me!

711
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:19,172
- Let's…
- Let go of me!

712
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,466
You should talk to me.

713
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,385
I will

714
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,513
explain everything.

715
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:42,862
A few months ago,
Moo-jin suddenly came to see me.

716
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,701
He said he came into a lot of money
and he wanted to buy Family Villa.

717
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:49,744
Family Villa?

718
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,579
I can't do that.

719
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,165
I'm waiting for redevelopment…

720
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,210
That was when

721
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,672
we began visiting Mr. Kim often.

722
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,966
There are many other buildings.

723
00:55:03,842 --> 00:55:04,884
You're right.

724
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,889
But for me, it has to be that villa, sir.

725
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,601
No. I'm going to pass it down
to my daughter.

726
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,813
At the time,

727
00:55:16,896 --> 00:55:21,151
many people asked Moo-jin
to invest in their companies.

728
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:25,447
Sir, could you please reconsider…

729
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,115
President Byeon?

730
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,036
- That punk was one of those people.
- It's you.

731
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:33,705
What a coincidence.

732
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:38,043
Moo-jin tried not to get involved
with them in the first place.

733
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,920
I'm Jung Jun-yong of Dragon Investment.

734
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:44,215
- Sir, here you go.
- Okay.

735
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,594
What a small world.

736
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,012
I'll invest.

737
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,476
Wait.

738
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,061
Please think about it

739
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:59,105
- one last time.
- Moo-jin tried to stop him.

740
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,276
President Byeon takes us for fools.

741
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:05,820
Don't worry. We won't blame you.

742
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,240
KIM MYEONG-KYU

743
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:10,283
OH JAE-GEOL

744
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,912
I asked you to meet up with me
before you went to Moo-jin

745
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,622
in order to tell you this.

746
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,585
Because Moo-jin would think
that this was an excuse,

747
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,755
not an explanation.

748
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,885
So?

749
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,929
What do you want me to do?

750
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:37,185
Perhaps you needed someone to blame.

751
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,562
Because I did.

752
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:45,360
Even though I knew
that it wasn't his fault,

753
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:49,489
even though I knew he'd feel guilty,
I just wanted to…

754
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,201
blame him for everything.

755
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,538
So that

756
00:56:58,206 --> 00:56:59,916
I could breathe.

757
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,592
You already know the truth, don't you?

758
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:11,761
Mr. Kim

759
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:16,141
didn't set his apartment on fire
to commit suicide.

760
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,728
He passed away

761
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,233
because he started the fire
to claim insurance money

762
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:26,985
and failed to get out in time.

763
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,946
The beneficiary of insurance

764
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:33,783
was his daughter, Kim Sang-hyeong.

765
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,498
You want me to pay off your debt?

766
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,708
DEMAND FOR PAYMENT

767
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,710
Please help me, Father.

768
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:47,589
My children and I are about
to end up on the street.

769
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:50,884
- You're asking me to sell the villa?
- You've got a lot of money.

770
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,720
You never spent a penny on your family.

771
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,472
You kept it in your clutch.

772
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,933
You're not going to help me
this time either?

773
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:02,479
Fine.

774
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,647
I'll pay off your debt.

775
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:07,358
Thank you.

776
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,254
You're right.

777
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,381
You're right.

778
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,678
I just needed

779
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,681
someone to blame.

780
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,435
I wanted to kill myself, you know.

781
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,564
The last time I saw my father's face
kept haunting me.

782
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,575
I'm sorry.

783
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,722
If

784
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,892
he hadn't come back to us,

785
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,145
would I have also

786
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,941
resented him and blamed myself?

787
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,505
What are you doing?

788
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:58,886
Is there money on the ground?

789
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:07,812
Let's go.

790
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,526
Will you spend the night here?

791
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,695
Do you remember

792
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:19,449
what you used to say to me the most?

793
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,121
"Hey, you Moo-ron."

794
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,873
"Don't do anything."

795
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,005
"Don't do anything."

796
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,967
I should've listened to you.

797
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,095
I ruined it again.

798
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,365
No, you didn't.

799
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,165
You didn't ruin it.

800
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,103
Remember?

801
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:34,357
A long time ago, a bat girl

802
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,486
sang a song to seduce a cleanup hitter.

803
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,172
I can feel it

804
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:04,095
I can feel that you like me

805
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:09,225
I've known it from the start

806
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,687
When I saw you

807
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:17,150
By my side

808
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:19,444
Oh

809
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:24,866
My heart I've fallen in love

810
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:28,077
Now I know

811
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:32,498
You're the one I want to be closer

812
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:37,712
I can't keep my heart in control

813
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:45,344
Oh, please, tonight, let this be…

814
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:57,273
Was my singing that touching?

815
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:00,193
Yes.

816
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,868
So singing didn't work.

817
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,818
Let's stop crying and go home.

818
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:05,693
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

819
01:05:05,776 --> 01:05:06,819
- Let me do it.
- Stop.

820
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,446
You two became quite close.

821
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:11,073
My friend sent me a post
from a workers' community.

822
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,826
- I think it's about you and Ms. Mi-rae.
- I'm sorry.

823
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,119
Why did you do that earlier?

824
01:05:15,202 --> 01:05:16,662
I was too inconsiderate.

825
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,082
I should've been more careful
not to cause Ms. Mi-rae any trouble.

826
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,500
You broke the seal.

827
01:05:21,584 --> 01:05:23,461
I'm going to do it
whenever I feel like it.

828
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,923
Can you please just tell me

829
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,132
how you made the money now?

830
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:31,510
I held out until that bastard
finally showed up before my eyes.

831
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,220
I only had one chance.

832
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:36,265
I wanted to find him no matter what
and give it back to you.

833
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:42,855
