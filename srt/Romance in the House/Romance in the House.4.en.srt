00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,517
Strike!

3
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,394
- Strike!
- Yes!

4
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,354
Here.

5
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:06,483
Mi-rae, do you want to become an athlete?

6
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:10,028
No, it's hard to make a living
unless you're extremely talented.

7
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,743
- Did your mom tell you that?
- Yes.

8
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,370
And she said she'd shave my head
if I dated an athlete

9
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,997
in the future.

10
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,834
She'll have to shave her own head first.

11
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,837
By the way, Dad, aren't you going to work?

12
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:30,757
Me?

13
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,718
I'm on a break starting today.
Isn't it nice?

14
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,929
Why do you get more breaks than me?

15
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,389
Well…

16
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,435
Mi-rae, it's your birthday tomorrow.

17
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,062
I bought you a birthday present.

18
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,230
A present?

19
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,943
Yay! You'll receive a present.

20
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,114
Two, three. Ta-da!

21
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,825
- Wow! Dad, you're the best!
- The best!

22
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,329
What? Where are the training wheels?

23
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:04,040
Oh, that? This is a bicycle.

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,291
I'll teach you.

25
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,877
Since you have my athletic abilities,

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,379
you'll ride it in no time.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,425
Okay. Then teach me right away.

28
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,262
I want to ride this to school
starting tomorrow.

29
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:19,305
Okay! Let's go!

30
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,431
Get on.

31
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,017
There you go.

32
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,688
EPISODE 4
THE WAR OF THE BYEONS

33
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,983
Let's go!

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,365
Is it for your mom?

35
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,578
I won't need to buy one then.

36
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,123
- How much is it?
- It's 7,000 won.

37
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,958
- Please pay with this.
- Thank you.

38
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,307
My goodness, Magistrate Byeon.

39
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,975
Mi-rae, it has been a while.

40
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,728
The father and daughter
must be going somewhere together.

41
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,147
- How nice.
- Bye.

42
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,691
All right. You must be busy.

43
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,572
- I'll get going.
- Okay. Bye.

44
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,200
Byeon Mi-rae, that nuisance.

45
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,369
Why is she acting like a little kid?

46
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,873
When did they become so distant?

47
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,542
After your family went bankrupt?

48
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,961
No. I think it happened long before that.

49
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,507
Come to think of it, I'm not sure.

50
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,345
I guess he wasn't such a good father.

51
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,188
Jin-hee.

52
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:52,774
Ae-yeon.

53
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,858
FIANCÉ SALON

54
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,530
I was way over the line the other day,
wasn't I?

55
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:04,118
I've been feeling really guilty,
so I'm here to blow off some steam.

56
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,538
That's what happens
when you have a grandchild.

57
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,874
When Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae have children,

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,085
you'll understand how I feel.

59
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,546
Don't be angry.

60
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:17,882
Please?

61
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,180
My goodness.

62
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,349
I'm not angry. It's not a big deal.

63
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:29,185
Right? That's what I'm saying.

64
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,230
It's not even a big deal, right?

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,901
This isn't the first time
you guys have treated me like a doormat.

66
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,904
The neighbors butt in on my business
and tell me what to do

67
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,072
all the time.

68
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:44,409
I can't get mad every single time now,
can I?

69
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,205
I have no choice but to ignore it.

70
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,251
Bye, then.

71
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,966
I can't believe her!

72
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,051
She could never talk back to me before.

73
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,721
Who does she think she is?

74
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,389
Well, she is something now.

75
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,099
She's the villa owner's wife.

76
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,659
Do you really have a carp tattoo?

77
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,787
Do you want to see it?

78
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,997
Weren't you

79
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,751
living at your sister's place last year?

80
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,589
Finally, you have some questions for me.

81
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,425
Why doesn't your sister know
that you struck it rich?

82
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:47,472
Did you meet my sister?

83
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:55,646
This is Master Byeon.

84
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,107
The deliveryman left.
He'll be there in five minutes.

85
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,650
Hello?

86
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,153
Are you Byeon Moo-jin's older sister?

87
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,030
Did he cause trouble again?

88
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,948
No.

89
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,159
It isn't like that.

90
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:12,121
Mr. Byeon Moo-jin recently bought
a building.

91
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,539
For three billion won.

92
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,626
He bought a building for three billion?
Byeon Moo-jin?

93
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,089
Oh, you didn't know?

94
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,300
Voice phishing scams are strange
these days.

95
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:26,177
I'm hanging up. I'm busy, okay?

96
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,680
Gosh, she's still as feisty as ever.

97
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,767
I just talked to her briefly on the phone
with an altered voice.

98
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,020
If she knew it was me,
she would've cussed me out.

99
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,355
What did you say?

100
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:40,233
She didn't know you bought the villa.
Why didn't you tell her?

101
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,113
Why did you not tell her?

102
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,449
Had she known,
she wouldn't have sat still.

103
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,993
She would've run over
to grab us both by the hair.

104
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,455
Is that all?

105
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,166
Why did you call her?

106
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,716
Do you suspect me too?

107
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,138
- No.
- Then what is it?

108
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,349
I just remembered what you said last time.

109
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:17,103
You don't know what I've done
to come this far.

110
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,731
What did you mean by that?

111
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,781
What have you been up to?

112
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,014
Geez.

113
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,558
- What are you doing here?
- What were you going to do?

114
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,435
- How did you know the password?
- I guessed!

115
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,531
Do you want some coffee?

116
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,617
I have an arrhythmia.

117
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,706
- Juice?
- Don't you know I have diabetes too?

118
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,168
I didn't know.

119
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,878
I'll give you some water.

120
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:29,383
Have a seat. The ceiling won't collapse.

121
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,637
I wouldn't be surprised if it did.

122
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,599
Why on earth do you live
in a place like this?

123
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,934
Because I'm on my own.

124
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,102
Why would you want to be on your own?

125
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,563
How many times are you going to say that?

126
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,357
When will you quit the security job?

127
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,150
When will you stop drifting through life?

128
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,489
It's a three-month contract.

129
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,325
And you're the one who gave me that job.

130
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,496
I've let you waste ten years of your life
messing around with taekwondo.

131
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,665
Do as I say and join the company.

132
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,917
What would I do there?

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,420
Thanks to running wild with sports,
my brain has turned into muscle ages ago.

134
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,049
Right, I guess I could be the gatekeeper,
since that job is purely physical.

135
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,885
You punk! Do you think this is a joke?

136
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,513
I didn't know that you'd actually make me
the gatekeeper.

137
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,976
I didn't know
that you'd actually take the job.

138
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,687
I took it because I missed you.

139
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,067
Then move back in

140
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,777
and learn the business by my side.

141
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,114
You'll get sick of me
if you see me everyday.

142
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,282
Why would I?

143
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,536
You're my son.

144
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,127
I need to get ready and head out.

145
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,256
For goodness' sake. That punk.

146
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,101
Mi-rae.

147
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,771
Why do you work on the weekend
when your father is rich?

148
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,690
You should get married soon.

149
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,985
Your mom is at the age
to have a grandchild. Right, Eun-woo?

150
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,570
I hope it's a boy.

151
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,995
- I'll get going.
- Okay, bye.

152
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,413
Let's go.

153
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,711
An arsonist, my foot!

154
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,797
His good character made him rich.
Isn't that right, Mi-rae?

155
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,967
A child should pay back
for a parent's kindness.

156
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:38,054
As you grow older,
you must take good care of your parents

157
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,347
to receive bigger blessings.

158
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,681
Understood?

159
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:42,975
Did President Byeon buy
a building in Banpo as well?

160
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,021
Bye.

161
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,278
Mi-rae.

162
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,032
You know, right?

163
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,949
GANGNAM HOF

164
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,493
I'm the manly Nam of the Jinju Kang Clan.

165
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:02,536
When my parents saw the signboard,

166
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,456
they were so proud.

167
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,460
That's what blood ties are all about.

168
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,838
I can't deny the fact
that my last name is Kang.

169
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,881
Just like that…

170
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,759
I plan to change my last name.
I'll be Geum Mi-rae.

171
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,512
I'll get going.

172
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,148
- Hey, Auntie.
- Mi-rae, are you done with work?

173
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,067
Your mom and I are going to order snacks.

174
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,694
Sorry, I'll pass.
I've got to blow off some steam.

175
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,033
POP POP COIN KARAOKE
TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR RENOVATION

176
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,178
Do you break boards too?

177
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,722
Do you want to try it?

178
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:08,227
SWEAT NEVER LIES

179
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,441
MASTER NAM TAE-PYEONG,
FORMER NATIONAL TEAM MEMBER

180
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,567
What?

181
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,780
Wow.

182
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,408
The head instructor put it up.

183
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,327
He said I needed to brag
to attract more students.

184
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,165
This is the thinnest one.

185
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,044
Make a fist

186
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,505
and break the board with this part.

187
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,257
Give it a go.

188
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,136
It hurts more if you fail,
so don't be scared--

189
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,610
Wow, you're good.

190
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,455
Do I have a talent?

191
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,681
Want to learn some kicks too?

192
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,309
Maybe next time.

193
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,272
Thank you. I feel much better now.

194
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,650
When we get hounded by parents,

195
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,861
we also relieve our stress this way.

196
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:44,240
It's a legal and ethical way
to blow off steam.

197
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,831
People in this neighborhood
are especially chatty.

198
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,510
A piece of wood.

199
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,614
This dish is on the house. Please enjoy.

200
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:26,574
Thanks.

201
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,534
Please enjoy.

202
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,622
The easiest way to change someone's mind

203
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,165
is with money.

204
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,710
Who is it?

205
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:41,171
I tend to make big batches of food.
I made yours while I was at it.

206
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,048
Eun-woo.

207
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,760
Kind-hearted landlord, I love you.

208
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,345
I love you.

209
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,597
Yes?

210
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,474
I brought in your laundry
from the rooftop.

211
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,059
I see. Thank you.

212
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,316
But why do I see creases on my boxers?

213
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,776
I ironed them too.

214
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:04,862
Yes?

215
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:08,157
When I got married,

216
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,660
my father-in-law made this himself.
It's infused liquor made of wild ginseng.

217
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,622
Why are you giving me
such a precious gift?

218
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,708
I got you terribly wrong.

219
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,376
I'm truly sorry.

220
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,631
Please forgive this old man
and his senile behavior.

221
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,091
Look.

222
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,303
After I treated them to some drinks,

223
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,347
they've started to treat me
completely differently.

224
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,808
Does that mean

225
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,729
no one suspects you now?

226
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,234
What have you been up to?

227
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,030
No one.

228
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,116
As for the old landlord,

229
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,203
I'll ask for his forgiveness
in the afterlife.

230
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:39,581
Byeon Moo-jin.

231
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:41,834
You cannot fool me.

232
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,215
For the time being,
I'll be working undercover.

233
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,643
Come to the gym
if you want to learn some kicks.

234
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,438
I'll think about it.

235
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,899
Isn't it too far to bike to work?

236
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,820
It's faster during the morning traffic.
You should try it once.

237
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,698
I don't know how to ride it.

238
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,617
Didn't you learn it as a kid?

239
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,828
Usually, dads…

240
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,374
I guess dads usually teach such things.

241
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,008
- Oh, no. Be careful.
- I'm fine.

242
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,302
Let go of me. All right.

243
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,970
What is it?

244
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,722
What?

245
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:39,725
What?

246
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,394
What are the two of you doing?

247
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,607
Are you two dating?

248
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,692
No.

249
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,278
Oh, is she your daughter?

250
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,698
She's the spitting image of her father.

251
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,908
Nonsense.

252
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,743
She is nothing like me.

253
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,706
Did the family get back together?

254
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,291
No, not yet.

255
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,589
But it'll probably happen soon.

256
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,633
Gosh, come on.

257
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,385
Please help. We need to catch a taxi.

258
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:17,596
- Let go of me.
- My goodness.

259
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,348
- I'm fine.
- Grab a taxi.

260
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,808
Hey, let go.

261
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,060
- Hurry up.
- All right. My goodness.

262
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:24,520
- Gosh.
- Here.

263
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,772
Come here. Hurry up.

264
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,024
- Hurry up.
- Watch your head.

265
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,193
All right.

266
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,820
- Get in here.
- Thank you.

267
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,116
Hey, you punk.

268
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,078
Remember this?
You need to make up for this.

269
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:42,830
Buy me a drink.

270
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,665
Okay, I will.

271
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,874
Get home safely.

272
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,752
Please drive him home safely.

273
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,215
When you were an athlete,
did you have a rival?

274
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,218
A rival you never wanted to lose to.

275
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,348
Yes, I did.

276
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,144
There was a guy
I competed against in every competition.

277
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,188
I always lost by one point.

278
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,357
Did you ever beat him?

279
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,484
I did.

280
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,238
During our last match,
I knocked him out and won.

281
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,913
How did you win against him?

282
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,921
Medal, see you later.

283
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,214
- Good morning.
- See you later.

284
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,381
Bye.

285
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,885
I've caused you distress,

286
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,888
so as a small gesture of apology,

287
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,934
I will waive your maintenance fees
for three months.

288
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,186
- My goodness.
- Oh, my, President Byeon!

289
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,105
- I can't believe it.
- Thank you.

290
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,316
President Byeon, my goodness.

291
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,819
- You're the best.
- You don't need to do that. My goodness.

292
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:38,737
You heard me.

293
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,826
Our maintenance fees.

294
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,706
If you try too hard to win, you'll lose.

295
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,458
What do you mean?

296
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:57,130
Just do as you always have,
at your own pace.

297
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,550
Don't be conscious of your opponent.

298
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,345
Then you'll find…

299
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,270
that you've won.

300
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,405
For goodness' sake.

301
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:24,950
Going somewhere?

302
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,456
Mom has the morning shift this week,
so we're leaving together.

303
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,874
I'm going to school.

304
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,295
I'm going to the shopping center
to buy some supplies.

305
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,212
Father.

306
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,756
I'll get going.

307
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,091
President Byeon.

308
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:42,968
We love you.

309
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,388
Women of that household are very stubborn.

310
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,431
It won't be easy.

311
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,563
Sandwiches.

312
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,316
- Sandwiches.
- My goodness.

313
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,608
- Gosh.
- Here you go.

314
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,986
- Thank you for the food.
- Take it.

315
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,158
Here.

316
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,328
I don't need to try too hard to win.

317
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:12,205
- Did you put cucumbers in this?
- I just need to live my life…

318
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,833
- Why did you add so much sauce?
- …as I always have.

319
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,543
I'm on a diet.

320
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:18,337
Is that so? Give it here.

321
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,843
Don't eat, then.

322
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,220
Come on.

323
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,806
Mom, make sandwiches
only for the two of us from now on.

324
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,684
I should do that.

325
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,228
- My daughter, open wide.
- Okay.

326
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,606
How could she take away
the food I was eating?

327
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:41,151
Gosh, there's no winning
if I defy the women in this household.

328
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:42,694
I forgot about that rule.

329
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,866
You shouldn't be a picky eater.

330
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,744
PLEDGE

331
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,164
All right.

332
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:57,667
Bring it on.

333
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,296
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Sure.

334
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:09,971
You're done with work, right?

335
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,140
I'll buy you Korean beef.

336
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,183
I have other plans.

337
00:23:14,684 --> 00:23:17,312
- With whom?
- Mi-rae.

338
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,522
It's our dining-out day.

339
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,815
What?

340
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,236
- What's today?
- It's hiking day.

341
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,321
Miss Ae-yeon, come on.

342
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:28,824
Okay.

343
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,459
We only got a few grilled chickens today.

344
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,420
And the last one is reserved?

345
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,463
By whom?

346
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,965
Mr. Kang.

347
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,551
Is today chicken day?

348
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,636
- Thank you.
- Sure. Bye.

349
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:58,728
You're sick.

350
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,773
You have a fever.
Let's go to the hospital. Now.

351
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,608
Where did you come from?

352
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,319
I booked a medical checkup.

353
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,363
What? Is that really necessary?

354
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,531
Let's go.

355
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,701
Wait. Hang up the blanket for me.

356
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,423
Do you have statice flowers?

357
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,101
Do you have roses?

358
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,062
I'll pay with this.

359
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,746
Darn it.

360
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,571
Darn it.

361
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:47,879
Are you okay?

362
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,506
Oh, hey. I'm sorry.

363
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,233
Hey, let me borrow your bike.
I'll bring it back later.

364
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,401
What?

365
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,873
I don't think she understood what I said.

366
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:27,877
All right.

367
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:35,719
Where do I return this?

368
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,744
I bought them for you, so just take them.

369
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,421
Hey.

370
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:17,802
Can't you have a meal with me at least?

371
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,684
Mi-rae, are you less busy
at work these days?

372
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,311
- I'm busy.
- Then why are you doing this?

373
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,146
What do you mean?

374
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm all for Father and Mom reconciling.

375
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,029
Even a stray cat knows that.

376
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,949
Father's putting in so much effort.
Can't you just forgive him?

377
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:42,577
You won't find another man
as devoted as he is.

378
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,164
He became successful and returned to Mom
like a salmon returns to spawn.

379
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,707
It's so heartwarming.

380
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,293
If it were so easy,
why did they get a divorce?

381
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,170
Exactly.

382
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:56,341
No one asked for my opinion
when they got a divorce.

383
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,054
I didn't want that.

384
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,267
I never agreed to it.

385
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,283
Then how sincere are you?

386
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,036
What do you mean?

387
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,415
Don't get any silly ideas

388
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,083
and get a job after graduation.

389
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,461
No one in our family
is suited for entrepreneurship.

390
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:36,047
- What?
- Especially not you.

391
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,632
So don't even think about it.

392
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:40,510
I'm getting off. Pull over.

393
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,929
I'm almost at the bus stop.

394
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,151
Has it ever occurred to you?

395
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,779
That you might be standing in their way.

396
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,494
That little…

397
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,549
Gosh, I can't believe Byeon Mi-rae.

398
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,927
How did she know?

399
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:29,851
Yes, Ju-yong.

400
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,270
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

401
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:33,688
Okay.

402
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:37,817
Taxi.

403
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,337
Hyeon-jae, you're here.

404
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,463
Ju-yong.

405
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,465
Your café has so many customers.

406
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,426
Isn't the rent really expensive here?

407
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,511
Oh, here?

408
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,679
It's my father's building.

409
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,432
That's incredible.

410
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:12,060
I heard your parents funded
the business too.

411
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,978
Don't even get me started.

412
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,315
They asked for a proper business plan,
so I even made a presentation.

413
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,192
A presentation?

414
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,114
Shinyoung Department Store called
about a franchise deal.

415
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,992
I see. Give them my private number.

416
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:29,118
Yes, sir.

417
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,080
Ju-yong, are you opening
at a department store?

418
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:36,042
Well, I think it's too early for that,

419
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,919
but I've been getting some offers.

420
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,228
Hyeon-jae,
are you really going to drop out?

421
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,813
Do you have a plan?

422
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,899
Yes, I do.

423
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,652
I just got one.

424
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,864
Okay.

425
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,576
Then I'll get a membership
after a trial session today.

426
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,577
Okay.

427
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,036
Pilates?

428
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,914
Yes, I've been putting on some weight
these days.

429
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:19,043
I also should do something about
my uneven hips. Shall I sign up too?

430
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,880
Then I'll tell you how it is
after today's trial session.

431
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:22,922
Okay.

432
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,799
Ms. Byeon.

433
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,427
Do you want to join too?
You need to fix your posture.

434
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,220
Do I?

435
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,723
Aren't Pilates sessions expensive?

436
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,100
No, it's really cheap
since the studio just opened.

437
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,019
Just 550,000 won
for 10 sessions in a month.

438
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,937
You call that cheap?

439
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,647
Group sessions are much cheaper.

440
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,066
Gosh, I'm not interested.

441
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,527
I'm busy these days.

442
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:48,615
Hey, office workers don't exercise
because they have enough money and time.

443
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,241
They do it to survive.

444
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,369
I'd rather use that money for rent.

445
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,998
I'll just do some stretching at home.

446
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:05,048
I should've brought them in last year.
There are so many.

447
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,550
Byeon Moo-jin?

448
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,012
Punks who strike it rich overnight
are all like that.

449
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,976
Hey, cleaning up his mess
is giving me a headache.

450
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,273
Still, I have to do it

451
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,233
if I want to score big.

452
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,654
Easy money is

453
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,614
money easily lost.

454
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,076
Yes.

455
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,667
Why did you swing the door
with so much force?

456
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,001
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,713
You know who I am, right?

458
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,131
Yes.

459
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,926
What's your relationship with Moo-jin?

460
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,640
What do you do?

461
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,809
Oh.

462
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:02,814
I'm a tax accountant.

463
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,774
And my office is here.

464
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:06,859
I help Moo-jin with taxes

465
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,987
and some other things.

466
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:09,904
"Moo-jin"?

467
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,907
Moo-jin and I are high school friends.

468
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,121
Then why haven't I met you before?

469
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,961
Well, it's understandable.

470
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,088
Moo-jin has many friends.

471
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,842
That's impossible.
I've met every single one of his friends.

472
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,262
And he's never mentioned
the name, Oh Jae-geol.

473
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:37,306
We fell out of touch for a while.

474
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,726
Then we began seeing each other often
due to work.

475
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:41,644
I see.

476
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,566
Then how are you going to score big?

477
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,820
What did you mean
by "Easy money is money easily lost"?

478
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:52,905
You won't tell me, right?

479
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,534
I'll ask him then.

480
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,580
Wait.

481
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,429
LATE KIM MYEONG-KYU

482
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,454
Compared to the other products,
its sales are exceptional, as you can see.

483
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,082
This month, the frozen food product
with the highest sales

484
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,500
is Bravo Tteokbokki.

485
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,335
Do you see these numbers?

486
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:52,173
Mr. Nam.

487
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,180
You must be having a meeting.

488
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,641
Yes, we're discussing this month's sales.

489
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,518
Is Bravo Tteokbokki number one?

490
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,479
Yes, Ms. Byeon Mi-rae is in charge.

491
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:08,064
- Byeon Mi-rae?
- She's Byeon Mi-rae.

492
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:11,943
I see.

493
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,779
- You lunatic!
- Father!

494
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:25,206
The day after three celebrities ate

495
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,585
twenty servings of Bravo Tteokbokki
on Guys Who Are Crazy About Tastes,

496
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,255
the online and offline sales skyrocketed.

497
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,593
Oh, right.

498
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,512
I read the article about it too.

499
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:43,182
By the way, how did you know
that it'd appear on TV

500
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,059
and secure enough stock in advance?

501
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,310
Was it product placement?

502
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,148
No, sir. The show's producer is
my university alumna, so I got some help.

503
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:57,488
Wow. Ms. Byeon Mi-rae is
so good at her job!

504
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,199
Give her a round of applause.

505
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:04,120
Let's keep on clapping.

506
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,497
Let's clap until the end of the meeting.

507
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,500
All right.
I'll stop interrupting the meeting

508
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,710
and take my leave.

509
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,795
- Keep it up.
- Yes, sir.

510
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,553
Good.

511
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,433
Let's go home.

512
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,813
Go on in.

513
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:36,611
I'm in trouble.

514
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,322
I think Ms. Byeon will get promoted first.

515
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,283
I hear the number of promotions
will be cut in half.

516
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,327
Mr. Yoo, you're doing well too.

517
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,330
Can't you just let me have this one?

518
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,873
I have two children.

519
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,835
The weight on my shoulders is
just as heavy.

520
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,463
Second floor.

521
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,431
Doors closing.

522
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,143
By the way, Ms. Byeon,

523
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,979
who on earth is the CEO's son?

524
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,774
Why do you ask?

525
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:17,360
Must you ask?

526
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,737
I'll seduce him.

527
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:23,199
Na-ra, you must've watched
a fun TV show yesterday.

528
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,077
Reborn Rich? King the Land?

529
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,045
I'm curious about his identity too.

530
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,216
I'm compiling a list of male employees
whose last name is Nam.

531
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,261
The one with the key is keeping silent.

532
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,889
Could it be that you struck a deal
with the CEO for a promotion?

533
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,644
- I'll get going now.
- Good night.

534
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,145
Good night.

535
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,272
Is she upset?

536
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,993
I'm sorry.

537
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,577
You're suffering because of me.

538
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,831
Don't worry.

539
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,583
I'll earn a promotion
due to my competence.

540
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,803
The person you have reached
is unavailable…

541
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,930
Why hasn't he picked up his phone all day?

542
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,641

JPLUS' SUPERVISOR BYEON MI-RAE

545
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,177
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

546
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,095
Please leave a message…

547
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,352
This is a new product that just came out.

548
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,604
It's available in a variety of colors.

549
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,981
Although it's on the expensive side…

550
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,649
I'll take it.

551
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,276
Okay.

552
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,154
- Will it be a monthly installment plan?
- Over four seasons.

553
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,248
Are you sure Ae-yeon likes this stuff?

554
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,708
Come on, Father.

555
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,585
Mom is a woman too.

556
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:43,255
Sling a designer bag
over her shoulder and say,

557
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,591
"It's nothing special."

558
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:48,677
Then it'll be game over.

559
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:59,105
But didn't you say
that you've never had a girlfriend?

560
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,401
Let's just go give her the present.

561
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:14,203
Let's go.

562
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,712
NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION,
YUHWA ELECTRONICS

563
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,849
I guess it's a delivery.

564
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,603
You got here quickly. It's Unit 102.

565
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,982
- What's that, Mi-rae?
- I bought something.

566
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,943
We bought something too.

567
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:48,946
Is anyone home?

568
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,991
I think so. I'll open the door.

569
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,118
I have missed calls from Ae-yeon.

570
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,162
Five of them.

571
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,040
Gosh, what's going on?

572
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,882
- Hey, Ae-yeon.
- President Byeon.

573
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:11,969
- Chun-sik?
- I found a phone on the street.

574
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,681
The wallpaper was a selfie
of your wife and her dog.

575
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,184
Why was it on the street?

576
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,854
- Where's Ae-yeon?
- Isn't she home?

577
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:25,316
Excuse me.
It looks like there is no one inside.

578
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:30,362
I found this phone in a remote place.

579
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,698
You know, the narrow alley
next to Yongdong Pharmacy.

580
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,367
Many incidents occurred there

581
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,536
especially involving women
walking around alone.

582
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,872
Her groceries were scattered
on the ground too.

583
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,208
It's as if someone dragged her away.

584
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:48,214
Chun-sik, please send the photo
of Ae-yeon to all the neighbors.

585
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,508
Tell them to call me right away
if they see her.

586
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,136
What is it? What happened to Mom?

587
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,265
Your mom disappeared.

588
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,643
- What?
- We'll find her soon.

589
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,103
She might come back, so stay home. Okay?

590
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,230
Here.

591
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,858
Mi-rae, what should we do?

592
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,903
I'll call her.

593
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:14,823
What are you talking about?
Another man has her phone right now.

594
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,497
Gosh.

595
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:33,801
Mom!

596
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,890
Mom!

597
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:43,227
It has only been a few hours, but…

598
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,939
She's never done
anything like this before.

599
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,732
Her phone was on the ground!

600
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:57,616
Hey, have you seen Ae-yeon?

601
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,577
No.

602
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,455
- President Byeon, you're sweating buckets.
- Hello?

603
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,166
I'm looking for a person, not a dog!

604
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,586
Damn it.

605
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,747
Hello?

606
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,665
This is Seodaemun Police Station.

607
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:48,459
Are you Ms. Geum Ae-yeon's guardian?

608
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,130
SEOUL SEODAEMUN POLICE STATION

609
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,635
Mi-rae!

610
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:11,940
Where's Geum Ae-yeon? Geum Ae-yeon!

611
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,192
What are you doing back here?

612
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,235
- Where's Geum Ae-yeon?
- Come on!

613
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,571
She's right there!

614
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:24,787
What's going on?
What are you all doing here?

615
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,163
Mom!

616
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,964
- Where were you?
- Something came up.

617
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:38,384
- What did?
- By the way,

618
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,761
why did you report
Ms. Geum Ae-yeon missing?

619
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,970
Because she was missing.

620
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,681
Wasn't that why you found her?

621
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,517
No. She was getting investigated

622
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,185
for an assault case.

623
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,939
Who the hell was it? Where's that bastard?

624
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:54,858
No, that bastard is the one
who was assaulted.

625
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,862
And these three women here
were writing a police report.

626
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,698
I'm at the police station.

627
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,909
No, I'm just talking to them.

628
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,577
You don't need to come. Stay at home.

629
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,371
- Honey!
- You're here.

630
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:09,373
My goodness.

631
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:11,959
What… What happened?

632
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,335
Tell me! What's this about?

633
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,839
The three of them beat up that man.

634
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,011
You…

635
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,016
- What?
- Did you three put him in that state?

636
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,144
- But why?
- Mom.

637
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,397
I heard you taught him a lesson
the other day.

638
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,446
If I see you again
around this neighborhood,

639
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,364
I'll kill you.

640
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,951
- You bastard! I'll end you!
- No!

641
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,537
- Hey!
- Please calm down.

642
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,455
That's enough.

643
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,417
I've already given him what he deserved.

644
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,516
He's Geum Ae-yeon's ex-husband.

645
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,276
What was that sound?

646
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,028
I'm glad I ran into you.

647
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,821
I'm going to teach you a lesson today.

648
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,158
Hold on! Ouch!

649
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,327
- Hey!
- Ae-yeon!

650
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,370
- Ae-yeon!
- Stop it!

651
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,291
Gosh, are you okay?

652
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,752
Stop that bastard!

653
00:46:36,835 --> 00:46:38,837
- Come here!
- Stop right there!

654
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,509
Stop right there!

655
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,452
You're dead meat.

656
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,169
I see.

657
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,216
I'm going to kill you today

658
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,635
- and go to prison! Let go!
- Let go of him!

659
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:29,054
- Let go! You bastard!
- Father!

660
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:33,559
- Let go!
- Please make him stop.

661
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,486
You reported me missing?

662
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:49,032
Why did you spread my photo around?
You didn't know what had happened.

663
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,787
Hey, you also assumed I was dead
when you saw the news.

664
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:56,707
Father thought
something bad had happened to you,

665
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,126
so he ran around everywhere in tears.

666
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,629
Are you hurt? Are you really okay?

667
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:06,216
Gosh, I bet rumors spread
in the neighborhood.

668
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,759
Rumors, my foot.

669
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:10,846
You guys never listen to me.

670
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,348
In any case, I'm glad that you're okay.

671
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,266
Thank you.

672
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,103
Jin-hee and Se-ri, thank you.

673
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,021
Buy us a drink.

674
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,940
This was a surprise.

675
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:25,319
- That's why…
- I agree.

676
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,904
- How reckless of you.
- Gosh.

677
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:32,284
You guys should head home.
I have somewhere to be.

678
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,037
Father, where are you going?

679
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,791
I should buy the neighbors a drink
for all the trouble.

680
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:43,503
Let's go, Mi-rae.

681
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,715
You guys go first.

682
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,634
Why?

683
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,261
Take Mom home safely.

684
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:24,670
Mom!

685
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,714
Mom!

686
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,138
Just pour me a drink.

687
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:39,017
I need women to pour me a drink

688
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:42,145
so that I don't get drunk, okay?

689
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,608
Sir, you're already quite drunk.

690
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,694
I need to clean up.

691
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:54,574
You're a divorcée.
Why are you playing hard to get?

692
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,499
She has a pretty face,

693
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,209
but she isn't obedient.

694
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:08,505
- Gosh.
- What? You like feisty women.

695
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,881
You think they're fun.

696
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,802
Anyway, do you think you have a chance?

697
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:16,513
I don't think she'll be so easy.

698
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,933
What choice does she have?

699
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:22,561
She rents a place from me,

700
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,313
and I even got her a job at my restaurant.

701
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,652
She must do as I say. Right?

702
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,862
Yes, she must.

703
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,324
You're right.

704
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,368
- Let's go to karaoke.
- Karaoke? Okay.

705
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,826
I wanted to show him

706
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,039
that we were fine

707
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,709
and better off without you.

708
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,378
That I was

709
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,882
doing a better job than you.

710
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,635
But…

711
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:10,043
Byeon Mi-rae.

712
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,558
You…

713
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,811
You're doing well.

714
00:52:31,147 --> 00:52:34,901
You've done so well over the years.

715
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,072
It must've been hard.

716
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,493
You took care of Ae-yeon and Hyeon-jae

717
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,496
as the head of the household.

718
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:51,668
I made you grow up too soon

719
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,005
when you were still just a kid…

720
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,300
Even now,

721
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:01,595
I'm adding weight on your shoulders.

722
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,516
It's all my fault.

723
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,566
I'm sorry, Mi-rae.

724
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,085
Now,

725
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,006
give yourself a break.

726
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,559
And whose fault is that?

727
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,567
I didn't want to be like you.

728
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:01,571
I didn't want to lead my family
the way you did.

729
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,911
- How long will you live that way?
- What kind of question is that?

730
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,416
Right.

731
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:24,970
Also…

732
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,104
Don't worry.

733
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,775
You're…

734
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:43,446
nothing like me.

735
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,690
Medal.

736
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:21,693
What's this?

737
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:24,320
Oh, Mi-rae bought it.

738
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,742
And that one's from Father.

739
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,208
Good grief, Byeon Mi-rae.

740
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:44,799
JPLUS' SUPERVISOR BYEON MI-RAE

741
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,394
The person you have reached is
unavailable…

742
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,118
We can't go on like this.

743
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,404
Ms. Byeon?

744
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:38,496
Ms. Byeon.

745
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:42,959
Go away.

746
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,547
Just go.

747
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,993
So I ran after him.
And when he fell to the ground,

748
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,329
- I grabbed his leg and…
- Well done.

749
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,291
- Are they kissing?
- My goodness.

750
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,252
- Gosh.
- Kids these days kiss anywhere.

751
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,129
- Boy, it's good to be young.
- Right. It sure is.

752
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,090
- Shall we kiss too?
- Be quiet.

753
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,009
What are you doing?

754
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,469
I don't know.

755
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:22,684
But wouldn't you rather
have me see you like this

756
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,563
than give your neighbors
something else to gossip about?

757
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,370
You crazy bitch…

758
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,997
Of course, I'm crazy.

759
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,667
That's what happens
when you get involved with the wrong guy!

760
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,510
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

761
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,680
Geum Ae-yeon is the only woman in my life.

762
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,098
When will you eat with me?

763
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:29,602
- We're a plate that shattered years ago.
- You cruel wench.

764
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:32,980
You have absolutely no intention
of getting back together with him?

765
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,023
Khun Mooy!

766
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,401
Just what happened?

767
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:39,153
You gave me your entire fortune.

768
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,113
What's this?

769
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,323
I'm sorry that I showed up.

770
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,534
I keep getting angry when I see Father.

771
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:46,619
Didn't you catch a cold?

772
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,287
Don't do that from now on.

773
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,331
You keep being nice to me,
and it bothers me.

774
01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:56,587
