00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,976
All right.

3
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,774
Thank you.

4
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,781
Don't tell Mom about my arm.

5
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,992
How would you hide it
when you live with her?

6
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,494
I mean,

7
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,246
it must really hurt.

8
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,750
We're still not talking to each other,
so it will be fine.

9
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:40,934
Let's go.

10
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,318
Okay.

11
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,404
Let's go inside.

12
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:18,429
Come on in.

13
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,057
Moo-jin, you too.

14
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,280
What's this?

15
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,700
PLEDGE

16
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,203
I…

17
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,247
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,961
It must be real
since you're begging on your knees.

19
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,006
Ae-yeon, before you get mad,
let me explain.

20
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,675
I mean, let me give my excuse.

21
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,218
There isn't much time left on this deal.

22
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,304
So…

23
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,434
who gets the ownership of this villa now?

24
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,396
Mom.

25
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,480
Byeon Mi-rae.

26
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,902
It was my idea. Mi-rae would never
suggest something like this.

27
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:18,072
You have no idea how much
you've humiliated me, do you?

28
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,199
Why would I do that? No!

29
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,284
It wasn't like that.

30
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,412
Byeon Mi-rae.

31
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,789
Pack up and get out.

32
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:29,876
Get out!

33
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,509
I can't.

34
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,594
I won't.

35
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,055
I'll explain everything.

36
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,141
Ae-yeon, it's nothing
to get this upset about.

37
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,393
I was afraid that you guys would move out,

38
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,687
so I came up with this
to stop her somehow.

39
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,940
I bought this villa for you
in the first place.

40
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,817
It's just a piece of paper.
Why would you think I've humiliated you?

41
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,238
I told you I could take care of myself.

42
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,405
But what?

43
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,076
"I will pay the alimony owed"?

44
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,744
Have you lost your mind?

45
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,414
Yeah, probably.

46
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,293
I was just worried you might
change your mind about him.

47
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,212
I signed it in a fit of rage. That's all.

48
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,339
If you really didn't think of me
as a joke,

49
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,883
you should've come clean
after writing up this crap.

50
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,469
How could I?
I knew you'd get infuriated like this.

51
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,679
I told you it's my fault!

52
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,305
- Be quiet!
- Stay out of it!

53
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,642
Byeon Moo-jin.

54
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,270
I'm not even mad at you
because I never expected anything.

55
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,022
But Byeon Mi-rae!

56
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:36,567
I turned a blind eye when you picked
childish fights with him.

57
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:40,655
I accepted your threat to leave home
because I understood how angry you were.

58
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,156
But this…

59
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,704
Byeon Mi-rae, why do you keep making me
look like a fool?

60
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,206
- That was not what I--
- I'm the parent!

61
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,083
I'm the mom and you're the daughter.

62
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,501
I know that.

63
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:56,462
I'm not someone
you need to take care of and protect.

64
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,008
Why do you keep trying to carry
all the burden?

65
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:02,969
No one told you to do that.

66
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,637
Why on earth do you do that?

67
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,184
Then who else is going to do that?
Who'll take responsibility?

68
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,270
Who else but me?
I'm the head of the household.

69
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,607
Do you think I like living like this?

70
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:33,207
Mom, I'm in pain. I'm hurt.

71
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,590
What happened? Is it broken?

72
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:42,967
It hurts.

73
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:46,888
How did this happen?

74
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:50,349
EPISODE 8
THE PROMISED EIGHTH INNING

75
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:55,104
ALARM

76
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,022
It's morning!

77
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,655
Oh, my.

78
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,678
All right.

79
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,351
Medal, did you sleep well?

80
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,606
Did you sleep well all night?

81
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,446
Yes, I slept well too.

82
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,668
What?

83
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,589
Medal, when did Mom go out?

84
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:15,017
Thank you. Please enjoy it.

85
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,967
INTRODUCING DIVER TTEOKBOKKI

86
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,181
I need to go to the hospital
during lunchtime.

87
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,266
Go ahead.

88
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,813
I don't want to go alone.

89
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,398
Take a taxi then.

90
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,318
Should I?

91
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,578
Hello?

92
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:18,706
Mr. Lee, I'm reading the synopsis
you sent me.

93
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,374
It's really great.

94
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,752
Now, your novel, RHD Volume Two
will be a big hit.

95
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,003
I know that.

96
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:27,465
I'll begin working on the script,
so let's discuss the release date soon.

97
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,219
By the way, the villain character
is quite realistic.

98
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,970
Did you base the character on someone?

99
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:38,768
There's a man in the neighborhood
who's rich and strong, but in real life--

100
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,604
Suicide? I thought he died in the fire.

101
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:45,024
That was why they didn't post an obituary
for the Veterans Association.

102
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,317
I'll call you back.

103
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,237
I'm sure
the deceased's family simply forgot.

104
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,614
Mr. Kim had no reason to commit suicide.

105
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,908
He was well known
for owning several buildings.

106
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,493
Didn't you know?

107
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,870
He had lost all of his buildings.

108
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,664
He got scammed by youngsters.

109
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,123
Scammed?

110
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,000
He got scammed?

111
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,338
No way. Did President Byeon really…

112
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,635
YONGDONG-DONG VILLA FIRE

113
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,680
"Youngsters"?

114
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,431
If it was done by youngsters…

115
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,726
Does President Byeon have an accomplice?

116
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,145
Who could it be?

117
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,731
This is Oh Jae-geol.

118
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,484
Hello. This is An Jeong-in,
the hairdresser.

119
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,654
Oh, yes.

120
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,698
Why haven't you come to pay me back?

121
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,866
You haven't sent me your account number.

122
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,411
Please text me the number,
and I'll wire the money to you.

123
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:41,956
If you don't want a haircut,
how about you buy me a drink?

124
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,793
Why would I do that?

125
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,254
You could ask Mr. Byeon to join us

126
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,047
if that makes you more comfortable.

127
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,009
You two are close, right?
I am close with him too.

128
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,720
Text me the bank account number
right away.

129
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,805
If you have nothing more to say,
I'll hang up.

130
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,100
What's with her?

131
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,186
What was that?

132
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,440
Why did he suddenly get cranky?

133
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,653
Did the two of them get into a fight?

134
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,494
Do you think I like living like this?

135
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,967
Hey.

136
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,429
Are you brushing your teeth
to torture yourself?

137
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,805
With an injured arm.

138
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,145
- Ms. Lee.
- Yes?

139
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,981
My mom is really mad at me.

140
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,361
But if she won't say anything,
how do I make up with her?

141
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,822
You should get on your knees
and beg for forgiveness.

142
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,658
I already tried that.

143
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,451
You did?

144
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,787
Then you should take
the materialistic approach.

145
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,580
An expensive present or some cash?

146
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,999
She'll never accept it.

147
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:10,378
Her own rules against bribery are
stricter than the national laws.

148
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:15,466
Really?

149
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,843
In that case…

150
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:24,058
This is Byeon Mi-rae.

151
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,434
This is the courier service.

152
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,425
LANDLORD:

153
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,343
I sent some supplements
good for healing your bone.

154
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,518
Take them and get better soon.

155
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:09,895
And I'm sorry.

156
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,652
Here you go.

157
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,405
Taekwon! Good night, Master.

158
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,198
- Bye, Master.
- Bye.

159
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,451
Bye. Goodnight.

160
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,209
Ms. Mi-rae.

161
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,675
Your place is still a few stops away,
isn't it?

162
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,972
You're right. I spaced out
and got off at the wrong stop,

163
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:46,682
so I decided to walk.

164
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,230
Did you have dinner?

165
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,860
No.

166
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,158
HANYANG HANDMADE DUMPLINGS

167
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,202
Hey, it's heavy.

168
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,542
You don't want to get soup
on your clothes.

169
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,821
You're injured, Ms. Mi-rae.
Don't do anything.

170
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,203
Please excuse me.

171
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,582
All right. Here you go.

172
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,501
You can eat it right away.

173
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:56,877
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

174
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,514
Here.

175
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,019
Should I feed you?

176
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,774
I managed everything at work just fine
with one hand.

177
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,111
Wow, your boyfriend cherishes you so much.

178
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,074
She got hurt because of me.

179
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:31,453
Gosh, then you should carry her
on your back until she gets well.

180
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,006
Shouldn't you take a break from work
until you recover?

181
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:48,012
If an office worker does that,
she'll face the risk of getting laid off.

182
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,054
I see.

183
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,602
Eat this too.

184
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,770
This too.

185
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,985
I'm eating well on my own,
so you should eat too.

186
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,530
I won't wait for you
if I finish eating first.

187
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,533
Okay.

188
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:16,749
How are things with your mother?

189
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,336
Still bad?

190
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,508
A mother and daughter can find over
3,650 reasons to fight in a year.

191
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,136
But this time,

192
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,350
I got caught up in the moment
and said some harsh things.

193
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,646
Did you mean it?

194
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,399
No.

195
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,278
I didn't mean it.

196
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,406
Then once your mother cools down,

197
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,617
she'll understand how you feel.

198
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,079
Okay.

199
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:09,927
Ms. Mi-rae,
instead of just running into each other,

200
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,930
why don't we go on a date next time?

201
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,903
Who is it?

202
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,071
It's me.

203
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,867
Hey.

204
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,791
I brought Hyeon-jae's belongings.

205
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:44,837
Where's his room?

206
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,298
That one.

207
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,092
Let me take a look.

208
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,945
It's clean for now.

209
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,908
But it won't stay this way for long,

210
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,619
so make sure he cleans his room, okay?

211
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,972
You have that stupid pledge too, right?

212
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,475
Give it to me.

213
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,977
- Why?
- Now!

214
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:15,010
PLEDGE

215
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:25,062
If you ever do something like this again,

216
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,314
I'll rip you to pieces.

217
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,364
- I'm really sorry.
- Forget it.

218
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,992
Sit down.

219
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,703
Okay.

220
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,257
Moo-jin.

221
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,721
Why do you think

222
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,891
Mi-rae went this far?

223
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,023
Did she really just do it

224
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,110
out of anger?

225
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,905
In your opinion,

226
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,035
how does Mi-rae

227
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,454
seem to you?

228
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,672
She looks overwhelmed.

229
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,511
But she doesn't even realize that.

230
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,228
I know.

231
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:51,857
I know, but…

232
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,819
I didn't realize.

233
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,655
It's my fault.

234
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,037
No, it's my fault.

235
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:14,963
You were right about everything.

236
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,428
You said I think I'm the only one

237
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,389
who had to give up something so important.

238
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,728
I realized that you were right.

239
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,523
You got married at the age of 20,

240
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,651
had Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae,
and raised the kids

241
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,862
and even me.

242
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,201
I can't imagine how much
you had to give up all that time.

243
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,748
Ae-yeon.

244
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,294
If there's anything wrong,
it's all my fault.

245
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,048
So don't blame yourself for it.

246
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,779
YONG DONG TAEKWONDO

247
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,287
Be careful.

248
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,504
Thank you. I'll get going now.

249
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:41,008
Good night.

250
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,979
Let me make up with my mom first.

251
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,773
We can do it then.

252
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,901
The date.

253
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:26,261
FAMILY VILLA

254
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,020
Nam, your lettuce on the roof
has grown a lot already.

255
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,146
Really?

256
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,899
I'll water your plants later.

257
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,818
All right, thanks.
You're working really hard on it.

258
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,113
I need to show my dad how diligent I am.

259
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,449
How should I put it?

260
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,994
It's like sowing seeds.

261
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:16,436
Let's clean the house

262
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:20,190
Let's make the place spotless

263
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:24,945
Let's clean the table too

264
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:25,862
Carefully…

265
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,199
Hyeon-jae, is something going on?

266
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,827
No, nothing's going on!

267
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,579
Enjoy your shower, Father!

268
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:50,470
Let's continue cleaning the house

269
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,305
Let's continue cleaning…

270
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,196
Is this Ae-yeon's?

271
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,077
BLACK CHAUFFEUR SERVICE

272
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,245
"Chauffeur service."

273
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,581
Man, he looks so scary.

274
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,958
Even money?

275
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,719
DRAGON INVESTMENT

276
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,866
Oh, there's so much dust.

277
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,370
Father, dry your hair and come on out.

278
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,080
- I made breakfast.
- Okay.

279
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,424
MISSED CALL

280
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,054
Mr. Byeon Moo-jin, I'm leaving a message
since you aren't picking up.

281
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,558
I'm Kim Myeong-kyu's daughter.

282
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,027
Ae-yeon!

283
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
I'm glad I ran into you.

284
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,992
I'm free today.

285
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,244
- Is it your day off too?
- Yes.

286
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,871
Are you going to take me
to the nail salon again?

287
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,542
I got my nails done already.

288
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,085
Are they too sexy?

289
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,839
Let's eat out together. It's my treat.

290
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,219
Just tell your kids to eat out tonight.

291
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,846
Let's go.

292
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,018
I'll treat you to something delicious.

293
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,815
This is a special free dish
for the residents of Family Villa.

294
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:53,403
You won't make any profits
since you always give freebies.

295
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,988
Exactly.

296
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,031
Don't worry.

297
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:59,284
I'd never let my future wife starve.

298
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,662
Please make sure to tell Jeong-in
I said that.

299
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,998
- Enjoy the food.
- My goodness.

300
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,295
- Let's dig in.
- Okay.

301
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,381
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

302
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,222
- Jin-hee.
- Yes?

303
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,062
After all your kids got married,

304
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,772
didn't you feel bored?

305
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:33,193
Not just bored. I felt so lonely too.

306
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,946
My eldest daughter and I
used to be inseparable.

307
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,531
We were like one person.

308
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:47,791
Then how did you manage to let her go?

309
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,128
It was hard.

310
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,006
I couldn't do anything without her.

311
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,134
Whenever I needed to make reservations

312
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,054
or order something online,
she took care of it for me.

313
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:04,557
Whenever I needed to go out,
she gave me a ride.

314
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:10,688
When she was little,
I held her hand and took her places.

315
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:14,109
Now, she holds my hand
and takes me around.

316
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,363
As time went on, she became the mother,
and I became the daughter.

317
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,077
You're right.

318
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,750
It happened before I even realized it.

319
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:38,091
I think it's also a parent's duty

320
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,093
to let their kids go when the time comes.

321
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:51,563
Besides, you went through so much
to raise the kids at a young age.

322
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,857
Now, you should live your own life.

323
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,444
You're still young and single.

324
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,363
I envy you the most in the world.

325
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:22,927
Mom.

326
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,555
I'll grow up quickly.

327
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:27,974
I'll grow up quickly

328
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,060
and get a decent job
after graduating from a good college.

329
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,228
So wait until then.

330
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,440
I got in.

331
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,276
JPLUS' open recruitment.

332
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,904
You don't have to do
this type of work anymore.

333
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:41,988
Mi-rae.

334
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,660
She looks overwhelmed.

335
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,788
But she doesn't even realize that.

336
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,290
Then who else is going to do that?
Who'll take responsibility?

337
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,335
Who else but me?
I'm the head of the household.

338
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,194
What?

339
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,571
FORGIVE ME, MISS AE-YEON!

340
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,948
I MADE A BIG MISTAKE

341
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,043
You're home.

342
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,755
What's all this?

343
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,225
How sorry I am.

344
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,187
You did all this with that arm?

345
00:30:57,438 --> 00:31:00,358
Oh, Aunt Jeong-in helped me put them up.

346
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:04,028
Have a seat. Let's have some cake.

347
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,204
You didn't have to do this.

348
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,585
I'm sorry, Mom.

349
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:20,753
I made a big mistake.

350
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,506
I'm regretting it all so much.

351
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,595
Can you forgive me now? Please?

352
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:36,060
All right.

353
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,148
So go to your room and rest.

354
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,240
Those words came out in a fit of rage.

355
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,491
I didn't mean them.

356
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:56,623
I just…

357
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:58,833
I just…

358
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,546
Fine.

359
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,550
It'd be a lie to say that working
and making money isn't hard at all.

360
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,136
So I threw a huge tantrum for once.

361
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,681
And you're right. Like you said,

362
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,850
I should've told you
when I was having a hard time.

363
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,646
I'd been acting tough,

364
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,149
and I blew up big time.

365
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:32,158
Are you really not going to forgive me?

366
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:35,912
Do you really want me to move out?

367
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,665
Can you live without me?

368
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,209
I can't live without you!

369
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,762
Come here.

370
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,556
Come on.

371
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,853
Mom.

372
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,486
I'm sorry, Mom.

373
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,158
You've done well.

374
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,956
All these years,
you've worked so hard, Mi-rae.

375
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,211
No. I'll do better, Mom.

376
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,506
Medal, I'll see you later.

377
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,265
Hey. Are you going to work?

378
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,309
Yes.

379
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,145
Then have a good day at work.

380
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,503
YANG CHEOL-HONG:

381
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,341
COACH YANG CHEOL-HONG BECOMES
ACTING MANAGER OF DRAGONS

382
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,261
This bastard.

383
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,809
Damn it.

384
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,770
YANG CHEOL-HONG

385
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,274
- What is it?
- You read my message, right?

386
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,610
Today is my first game as the manager.

387
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:16,989
I've reserved two VIP seats
for you and your wife.

388
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,241
We can't go. Bye.

389
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,868
Hold on! Mr. Byeon!

390
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,497
Mr. Byeon, I really need you to come.

391
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:25,957
Why?

392
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,083
RISE, DRAGONS

393
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,876
I think my team…

394
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:31,087
is going to lose today.

395
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:34,465
Actually, I'm sure we'll lose.

396
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,008
What are you talking about?

397
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,720
You know that we've lost 18 games
in a row, right?

398
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:43,099
If we lose again today,
we'll rewrite the history in a bad way.

399
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,893
That's why they put you in that position.

400
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,604
The nation's forever cleanup hitter,
Yang Cheol-hong!

401
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,606
Exactly.

402
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,443
If we lose, people will slam me for it.

403
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:59,240
Hey, what does that have to do
with me going to the game?

404
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:03,452
You're my savior and lucky charm.

405
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,622
I feel like

406
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,708
if you come,

407
00:36:09,458 --> 00:36:11,085
a miracle will happen.

408
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:15,006
You'll come with your wife, right?

409
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,924
Please?

410
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,053
What a crazy bastard.

411
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,171
Are you free this evening?

412
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,382
Yes.

413
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,010
I'll send you an address. Come after work.

414
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,765
There won't be anyone else today,
so don't worry.

415
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,517
Let's go.

416
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,368
So you need three days of treatment,
not two weeks?

417
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,496
You said it was close to a fracture.

418
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,334
Well, I didn't lie
to make you carry my bag.

419
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,336
You know that, right?

420
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,677
By the way, why is your bag so heavy?

421
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:48,891
My tablet PC, materials, and documents.
I have many things to carry.

422
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:56,941
It's just like you.

423
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,867
Since you're carrying my bag.
And it's been a while.

424
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,051
Go on.

425
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:35,646
I'll get going.

426
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,107
Okay.

427
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,258
CHIEF TAX ACCOUNTANT
OH JAE-GEOL

428
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:06,802
This is Oh Jae-geol.

429
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,139
I'm Kim Myeong-kyu's daughter.
You remember me, don't you?

430
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,683
Mr. Byeon Moo-jin
wouldn't answer my calls,

431
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,852
so I called you instead.

432
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,354
What is this about?

433
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,689
I haven't finished the calculations
with Mr. Byeon.

434
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:24,862
I thought everything was settled
when you sold him Family Villa.

435
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,657
It's for someone's life.
That shouldn't be the end of it.

436
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,206
Right. It shouldn't be.

437
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,213
Why don't we meet up first?

438
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:45,925
What?

439
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,683
What are you doing right now?

440
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,435
- I'm working.
- You're injured.

441
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,395
Let me do it.

442
00:39:57,978 --> 00:40:01,065
My arm is fully healed.
I'm getting my cast removed today.

443
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,150
- Already?
- Yes.

444
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,488
Why do you look disappointed?

445
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:32,596
Well, I can look after you
even if your arm is fully healed.

446
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,688
This morning, it looked like
you had made up with your mother.

447
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,233
Yes.

448
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,652
Congratulations.

449
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,032
I've been sincerely waiting

450
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,951
for the two of you to reconcile.

451
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,164
Well…

452
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,254
Well, then…

453
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,225
They're looking for me,
so I need to go upstairs.

454
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,060
Let's talk later.

455
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,660
This is CEO Nam Chi-yeol's secretary.

456
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,454
Mr. CEO wants to see you.

457
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,589
Did you think that I wouldn't know?

458
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:52,134
Did you approach Tae-pyeong
after finding out that he was my son?

459
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,889
Did you want to move up the social ladder
by marrying into our family?

460
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,726
How dare a mere employee do that?

461
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:03,103
No, sir. It's nothing like that!

462
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,438
No need to hear your excuses.

463
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,442
Take this and stay away from my son!

464
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,958
Maybe not.

465
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,126
Or do they wire you the money these days?

466
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,838
What if he does? Will I accept it?

467
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:33,592
What if he tells me to take the money
and get lost from the office?

468
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,927
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae.

469
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,639
Please go on in.

470
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,432
Okay.

471
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,686
CEO'S OFFICE

472
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:54,989
Are you injured?

473
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,659
I'm all better now.

474
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,330
Why didn't you take some time off work?

475
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,584
I'm sorry.

476
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,630
What are you apologizing for?

477
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,427
I'm not an evil employer
who keeps injured employees from resting.

478
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,605
When you reach this position,

479
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,150
you can tell who is going to succeed.

480
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:35,946
Like you, Ms. Byeon.

481
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,620
I see.

482
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,290
I've been watching you
since the inspection.

483
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,293
You're more talented than
most manager-level employees.

484
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:53,213
You recently fixed the mishap
with the Sokcho Factory in a single day.

485
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:59,511
I knew it. I have an eye for people.

486
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,933
Thank you for the compliment, sir.

487
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,354
To acknowledge your outstanding work,

488
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,273
I called you over for some tea.
Is that okay?

489
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,942
Of course. It's an honor.

490
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,577
You went to Sokcho with Tae-pyeong, right?

491
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,375
Are you okay? Here.

492
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,336
Thank you.

493
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,176
I checked your employee personnel file.

494
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,513
You live in Yongdong-dong too.

495
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,598
The same area as Tae-pyeong.

496
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,648
Did you guys become close
after that incident?

497
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,985
- You lunatic!
- Father!

498
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,205
To be honest, I was quite surprised.

499
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:11,375
He's always refused to work here,

500
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,585
so I could only make him a gatekeeper.

501
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:18,549
But for you,
he went all the way to Sokcho.

502
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,385
I asked him for a favor.

503
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,596
I heard that the factory owner
and Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong were close,

504
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:28,308
so I begged him to help me.
That was why he accompanied me.

505
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,768
He had no choice.

506
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,228
Exactly.

507
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,982
He never listens to me,
but he listened to you.

508
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,569
So I was wondering…

509
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,865
I would like you to help me.

510
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:46,743
With what?

511
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,665
I want you to coax Tae-pyeong.

512
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,917
Excuse me?

513
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,217
I want you to coax him

514
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:04,428
into working here.

515
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,725
Coax him? Me?

516
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:10,893
How?

517
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,812
Well,

518
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:17,524
I know that it's ridiculous
to ask an employee for such a favor.

519
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,529
But before I'm the CEO,

520
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,324
I'm his father.

521
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,793
I think I can trust you.

522
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:41,840
Plus, I have a feeling
that you can get it done.

523
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,092
Can you persuade

524
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,012
Tae-pyeong?

525
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:10,452
Look at that.

526
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,341
A building owner, my foot.

527
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:27,469
He looks like a day laborer.

528
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,092
He did age a bit.

529
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,556
But he's definitely handsome.

530
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,649
All right.

531
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,324
YANG CHEOL-HONG:

532
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,660
I sent the tickets by courier.
Two tickets.

533
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,036
Please come.

534
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,204
Please.

535
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,919
She wouldn't want to go
to a baseball game, would she?

536
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,506
Gosh.

537
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:29,758
Medal, I'm home.

538
00:49:30,592 --> 00:49:31,635
Hey.

539
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,099
Did you make side dishes?

540
00:49:37,974 --> 00:49:41,186
I had no time to make all these.
I bought them.

541
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,692
Don't eat them from the containers.
Serve it on a plate.

542
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,529
Don't eat ramyeon and takeout every day
because there are only men in the house.

543
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,245
Mom, the thing is…

544
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,709
I saw Father's secret box.

545
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,506
"Secret box"?

546
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:14,177
Come on in.

547
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,600
What is it?

548
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,404
Mom.

549
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,866
Do you know why I keep taking Dad's side?

550
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:39,786
Because I hate that he's being left out.

551
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:42,831
And in the future,

552
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,001
I'm going to love someone the way he does.

553
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,192
BYEON MI-RAE, BYEON HYEON-JAE

554
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:27,876
They say the first daughter takes
after the dad.

555
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,754
But she's turning out
more like Ae-yeon. What a relief.

556
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,261
DAD, I LOVE YOU

557
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,392
My crybaby of a son cried
throughout his first birthday party.

558
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:47,562
My cute Mi-rae got her photo taken
while enjoying a lollipop.

559
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,526
The day Mi-rae got her first perm.

560
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,278
She's pretty, just like Ae-yeon.

561
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,369
My joyful house and my happy family.

562
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:12,295
Celebrating the day I hit a grand slam
with Ae-yeon.

563
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,132
I'll hit a home run today.

564
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:19,594
If my team wins, will you marry me?

565
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,764
I've no intention of getting married
before the age of 30.

566
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,016
What will you do until then?

567
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,685
What else?

568
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,063
I'll date at least ten different men.

569
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:32,107
- What?
- I'll save up and go to college.

570
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,025
But you said
you didn't do so well in school.

571
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,694
I'll take night classes if I must.

572
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,117
Don't you want to do anything with me?

573
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:45,745
Byeon Moo-jin! Where are you?

574
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,872
Darn it.

575
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,457
Hey, get going.
I need to go and get ready too.

576
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,420
Seriously?

577
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:57,340
Byeon Moo-jin!

578
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:01,428
Still, I'd like you to be

579
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,639
my first boyfriend.

580
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:09,311
So make sure you hit a home run
and win today.

581
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,438
Good luck!

582
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,207
Geum Ae-yeon's wishes.

583
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,585
- Date ten men.
- Not a chance.

584
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,338
- Get into college.
- I'll stop her from going on blind dates.

585
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,298
- Become a celebrity.
- Never.

586
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,427
My wishes.
Make sure the Dragons win this season.

587
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,262
Play in Major League Baseball.

588
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,641
Geum Ae-yeon.

589
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,740
2023 PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL
DRAGONS VS. LAKES

590
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:07,577
I'm on my way, Father.
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

591
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,329
Go inside first.

592
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,540
Okay. You have your ticket, right?
I'll see you soon.

593
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,577
Do you like the food?

594
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:53,164
Yes. The braised ribs are really good.

595
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,708
Eat up.

596
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,461
Have some seaweed soup too.

597
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,462
Okay.

598
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:09,514
My goodness.

599
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,517
I knew it.

600
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,395
Aren't you too young
to forget your own birthday?

601
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,107
You're right.

602
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,447
If it was on purpose,
you shouldn't do that.

603
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,408
Birthdays are just birthdays.

604
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,998
Next year, buy me seaweed soup
with beef, not flounder.

605
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:38,877
Sure.

606
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,425
How's the security guard job
going for you?

607
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:48,511
- I think it's my calling.
- Why you little…

608
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,183
Our employees frequent the mart

609
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,435
since it's connected
to the head office, right?

610
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:56,770
Well, yes.

611
00:55:57,979 --> 00:56:01,024
You might get close
to the employees your age.

612
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,654
Like the employee

613
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,366
we met in the elevator, Ms. Byeon Mi-rae.

614
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:17,082
- Why did you suddenly bring her up?
- Just because.

615
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,250
I just remembered that we met her.

616
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,546
Did you say something to her?

617
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:24,923
No!

618
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,635
I didn't say much.

619
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,429
I just acknowledged and praised
a talented employee.

620
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,392
Don't ruin such a good day like that.

621
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:37,894
Sit back down.

622
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,021
Don't ever do that again.

623
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,442
Fine. I asked her
to coax you to join the company.

624
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,069
Since you seemed close.

625
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,782
You drove me to such a measure.
The CEO asked that of an employee!

626
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,953
Did you think about how she must feel
doing such a favor for her boss?

627
00:56:55,036 --> 00:56:56,746
She's not doing me any favors.

628
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,414
I'm sorry.

629
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:01,543
I don't think I can do that.

630
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:06,422
What's your reason?

631
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,259
Do you lack confidence?

632
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:13,138
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong should make
that decision for himself.

633
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,767
I wouldn't say
that I know everything about him,

634
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,229
but he isn't someone
who's easily persuaded or swayed.

635
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,444
And no matter what Mr. Tae-pyeong decides,

636
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,737
I want to root for him

637
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:33,575
as a colleague and a neighborhood friend.

638
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,369
I'm sorry.

639
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:42,125
Even if she didn't want to,
she could've just said, "Yes, sir."

640
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,960
But she didn't.

641
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:47,213
It means that she has
an incredible sense of responsibility.

642
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,011
I'll get going first.

643
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,138
Nam Tae-pyeong!

644
00:57:58,433 --> 00:57:59,517
Ms. Mi-rae, where are you?

645
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:08,693
In Korean baseball, there is a phrase.
"The promised eighth inning."

646
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,653
Even in international games,

647
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,323
the Korean teams create miracles
in the eighth inning.

648
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:17,118
Thus, "The promised eighth inning"
or "The miraculous eighth inning."

649
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:21,039
Will the Dragons come from behind
in the eighth inning?

650
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,166
It won't be easy.

651
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,463
They're going to lose.

652
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,844
Dragons!

653
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,061
Hyeon-jae.

654
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,236
They're going to lose.

655
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,490
Cheol-hong will be so embarrassed.

656
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:01,162
You… How did you get here?

657
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,419
I stole the ticket you gave to Hyeon-jae.

658
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,013
Ms. Mi-rae.

659
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,561
Ta-da.

660
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,189
Happy birthday.

661
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,735
Thank you.

662
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,655
Hurry up before it goes out.

663
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:37,365
Make a wish.

664
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:47,041
Happy birthday.

665
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:48,918
- Home run!
- Home run!

666
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,922
It's a swing and a miss. He's out.

667
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:57,135
Bases loaded, two outs
in the bottom of the eighth inning.

668
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:00,430
Since this is the legend of the Dragons,
Yang Cheol-hong's debut game,

669
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,932
his fans must've had high expectations.

670
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,226
But the game has been quite disappointing.

671
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:09,314
I'm sure acting manager Yang Cheol-hong
is the most frustrated right now.

672
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,444
Moo-jin.

673
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:22,535
There's something you need to do.

674
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,669
Lend me some money.

675
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:36,716
Money?

676
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,510
I'm…

677
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:46,351
I'm planning to kick Mi-rae
out of the house now.

678
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,366
When it's time,
the mom should let them go first

679
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,994
so that her kids can spread their wings.

680
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,582
I have

681
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,960
held on to her for too long.

682
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:16,881
So,

683
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,343
I plan to have Mi-rae move out.

684
01:01:23,638 --> 01:01:24,764
But she has…

685
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,944
no money.

686
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,282
Although she works for a good company,

687
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,994
she couldn't save up because of us.

688
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:54,377
Ae-yeon.

689
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,007
Are you okay?

690
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,522
Choi Seung-hyuk has struck out.

691
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:17,734
Now, Yoo Ji-ho enters to bat eighth.

692
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,446
Bases loaded, two outs
in the bottom of the eighth inning.

693
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,950
Come to think of it,

694
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:29,078
it's rather disappointing.

695
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:32,790
College, my foot.

696
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:36,544
I never became a celebrity.

697
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,339
I'll be 50 soon,

698
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:42,383
but the only man in my life

699
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,387
is you, Byeon Moo-jin.

700
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:00,318
I've worked as hard as I could,

701
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,406
but how did I reach
the eighth inning already?

702
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,707
Moo-jin.

703
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,919
What should I do now?

704
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,176
There are…

705
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,095
many things to do.

706
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:31,349
If you can't think of anything
at the moment,

707
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,310
search for them with me.

708
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,062
Byeon Moo-jin.

709
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:41,442
Why would you go through all this for me?

710
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:50,827
Because it's you.

711
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,541
Because it's you, Geum Ae-yeon.

712
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,159
Okay.

713
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,788
Then join me…

714
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,210
in my eighth inning.

715
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:01,898
Forget it if you don't want to.

716
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,704
The ball goes to the right field!

717
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:18,998
It's over the wall!

718
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,207
It's a miracle!

719
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,460
The Dragons create
the promised eighth inning.

720
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:26,047
The Dragons aren't
giving Lakes an easy win.

721
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,011
Hey.

722
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:35,139
I want to kiss you,
but I'm holding myself back.

723
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,300
Will the Dragons' worst dark age
end today?

724
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,886
The game goes back to square one.

725
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:34,615
Thank you.

726
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:39,662
And…

727
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:42,665
I apologize

728
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,128
for what my father, the CEO, did.

729
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:48,963
I'm sorry.

730
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,591
It's okay.

731
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:56,554
I didn't give him
the answer he wanted anyway.

732
01:06:59,390 --> 01:07:01,100
It won't happen again.

733
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:08,733
Shall we go now?

734
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:13,821
Ms. Mi-rae.

735
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:17,450
I like you.

736
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,048
Thank you.

737
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:37,178
But in any case,

738
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:40,181
you're the CEO's son.

739
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,392
And I can't ignore that completely

740
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:45,102
because I work for that company.

741
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,945
But despite all that,

742
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:01,577
it's harder to ignore my feelings.

743
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:07,875
I like you too.

744
01:08:14,298 --> 01:08:15,466
That's all that matters.

745
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,902
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

746
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,946
My ordinary life has started
to feel special.

747
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,948
I guess this is what love is.

748
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:04,950
What?

749
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,410
Why is my room here?

750
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:09,538
Byeon Mi-rae.
As of today, you're on your own.

751
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:12,791
I'm going to show her that
I can do well on my own.

752
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,169
You call this a home?

753
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,714
By the way, Moo-jin,
is there anything you want to do?

754
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:19,924
Cook for Geum Ae-yeon.

755
01:10:20,007 --> 01:10:21,800
Do the dishes for her. Put her to sleep.

756
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,801
Are you sure?

757
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:25,846
Are you sure you can make Mom happy?

758
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,389
That woman contacted me.

759
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:29,183
I think she knows everything.

760
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:31,185
What should I do now?

761
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:39,151
