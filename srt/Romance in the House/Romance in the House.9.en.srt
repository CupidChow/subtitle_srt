00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,598
You're going to a wedding?

3
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,142
Yes. It's Mr. Lee of the sales team.

4
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:00,101
Here, your car keys.

5
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,440
I'm not taking my car.
It's going to be hard to park there.

6
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:06,733
Right.

7
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,239
Medal, I'll be back. Bye.

8
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,407
Bye.

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,492
All right.

10
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:26,628
FAMILY VILLA

11
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,214
- Hey. Are you going somewhere?
- Hello. Yes.

12
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,653
Did you get home safe yesterday?

13
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,073
Yes.

14
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,410
You walked me home yesterday.

15
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,620
Oh, right.

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,378
Shall we go?

17
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,088
It's strange.

18
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,675
I've been seeing him every day,

19
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,554
but I feel nervous
as if I just met him for the first time.

20
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,889
The doors are closing.

21
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,604
My ordinary life
which was the same every day

22
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,942
has started to feel dazzling and special.

23
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:38,616
Let's make a funny face.
You have to do it, okay?

24
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,204
You didn't do it.

25
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,223
MUSICAL
MOONLIGHT ROMANCE

26
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,687
You must be cold.

27
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,407
I guess this is

28
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,618
what love is.

29
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:34,923
What?

30
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,596
What's going on?

31
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,142
Mom! Medal!

32
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,020
Mom, let me in.

33
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,367
Mom, where are you?
The door lock isn't working.

34
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,953
Come meet me here.
I'll text you the address.

35
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,067
- Hey.
- Mom.

36
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,824
What's going on?

37
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,493
Why is my room here?

38
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,453
What do you think?

39
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,123
About what?

40
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,002
From now on, this is your home.

41
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:56,629
What?

42
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,715
What do you mean this is…

43
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:00,967
Why?

44
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,011
I took care of the first month's rent.

45
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,930
You'll have to pay it from now on.

46
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,351
Mom, I thought
you weren't mad at me anymore.

47
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:13,229
- I'm not mad at you.
- Then why are you doing this?

48
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,523
Byeon Mi-rae. As of today,

49
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,942
you're on your own.

50
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:31,497
EPISODE 9
BACK TO THE MI-RAE

51
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,669
Mom!

52
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,258
Why are you kicking me out?

53
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:45,303
I told you. You're moving out,
not getting kicked out.

54
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,388
No one moves out this late at night.

55
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,265
Had I told you in advance,

56
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,309
I wouldn't have been able to push ahead.

57
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,268
Mom.

58
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:56,147
Why on earth are you doing this to me?
What's your reason?

59
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,065
Rather than

60
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,027
living as my daughter and
as the head of the household,

61
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,403
I want you to live on your own.

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,364
What?

63
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,827
You must be baffled and flustered.

64
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,915
But if you continue to live with me,

65
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,793
you'll keep worrying about the family
as you do now.

66
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,796
I don't want you
to live like that forever.

67
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,008
You need to live your life, Mi-rae.

68
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,429
I made this decision for your sake.

69
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,724
What do you mean, it's for my sake?

70
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,809
I don't want to move out.

71
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,685
Cancel the lease and take my stuff back.

72
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,187
I want to live alone too!

73
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,904
What did you say?

74
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,614
Hyeon-jae has moved out.

75
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,909
So, I want to stop looking after you

76
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,079
and try living alone, at last.

77
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,918
Let's try shifting our focus
from the life as mom and daughter

78
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,338
to living our own lives
as Ae-yeon and Mi-rae.

79
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,968
I'll get going.

80
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,098
Mom.

81
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,266
Mom!

82
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,182
You know

83
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,976
how smart and strong she is.

84
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,270
She'll be fine. Don't worry too much.

85
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,653
Ae-yeon, are you going to be all right?

86
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,327
I'll be okay.

87
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:20,541
I need to play the villain
to make sure Mi-rae won't look back.

88
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,505
Okay. You did the right thing.

89
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,758
You've made the right choice.

90
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,552
Right?

91
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,138
I did the right thing, didn't I?

92
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,271
Of course.

93
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,608
Cry all you want. Let it all out.

94
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,978
Why is it that you don't even have
a dining table?

95
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:23,521
Is it because you're too broke?

96
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:27,149
I didn't see your car outside.
Did you take a taxi?

97
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,446
So, your gatekeeper contract is up
in a few days.

98
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,241
- Yes.
- What will you do afterward?

99
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,826
I'll go back to where I belong.

100
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,119
And where's that?

101
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,038
Stop it already.

102
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:42,832
I'll disappear for real.

103
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,585
I'll move and change my number.

104
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:57,597
There was an empty spot, so I put that up.

105
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,558
We said we'd do a cross-country bike trip

106
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,394
once you retired as an athlete.

107
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,067
But I'm too busy now.

108
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,279
Let's do it once I retire as CEO.

109
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,744
Nam Tae-pyeong.

110
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,914
Do you think I'm doing this
to satisfy my own greed?

111
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,125
Then what?

112
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,545
You keep running around in circles.

113
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,466
Ever since you got lost
and quit taekwondo.

114
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,301
Correct me if I'm wrong.

115
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,101
I know

116
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:49,482
that forcing you to work for the company
won't resolve everything.

117
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,735
But this is the best solution
I can think of.

118
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,906
My child is losing his way.

119
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,159
I can't just sit back and watch

120
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:02,953
as your parent.

121
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,062
BYEON HYEON-JAE

122
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,821
Mi-rae, congratulations on moving out.
When's the housewarming party?

123
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,905
Get lost.

124
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,200
AUNT JEONG-IN

125
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,538
Did you sleep well?

126
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,790
I bet you need a lot of stuff
now that you live alone.

127
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:49,083
Tell me. I'll send--

128
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,042
I'm hanging up.

129
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,215
What now?

130
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,759
MR. TAE-PYEONG:

131
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,802
Did you sleep well?

132
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,733
I promise, this is the last time.

133
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,153
Work as an intern for just three months.

134
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,197
Give it a shot,

135
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,951
and if it really isn't for you,
I'll not meddle in your life again.

136
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,454
You're not the type to just give up

137
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,039
without even trying. Am I wrong?

138
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:34,003
Also, if you turn down my offer,

139
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,507
I'll make Ms. Byeon
work directly under me.

140
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,151
Mi-rae, are you okay?

141
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,824
Give me another one. One more.

142
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,576
Three.

143
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:06,952
One more.

144
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,633
Stop breaking them with your grip.

145
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,221
I was just gently holding them. Look.

146
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,516
All right, then.

147
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:29,934
This time,

148
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,102
we'll do ten.

149
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,649
There are no more boards.
You broke them all.

150
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:41,153
Let's take a break.

151
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:45,908
Come. Sit here.

152
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,589
Have some water.

153
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,140
I understand why you're shocked.

154
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,519
Normally, it's children
who suddenly decide to move out

155
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,854
and leave their parents shocked.

156
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,276
But I have to say,

157
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,696
I think your mother did it
for your own sake.

158
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,032
For my own sake?

159
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,036
That's ridiculous.

160
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,122
It's not like I wanted to move out.

161
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:40,921
You would've never moved out
had this not happened.

162
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,299
That's right!

163
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,718
I had no plans to move out.

164
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,805
What do you want to do now?

165
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,308
Do you want to move back in?

166
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,518
No, I don't.

167
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,230
I'm going to show her that

168
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,357
I can do well on my own.

169
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,943
I will show her.

170
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,157
Okay.

171
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,700
All right.

172
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,160
Let's go.

173
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,997
- Where?
- To live well on your own.

174
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,958
Ta-da. Aren't they fresh?

175
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,668
Organic, at its finest.

176
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,255
What? Do you want a compliment?

177
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:08,258
No, I want to cook you a meal. Let's go.

178
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,259
Come on.

179
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,475
All right.

180
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,938
There.

181
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,064
Here, try it.

182
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,280
Gosh, they really are so fresh.

183
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,157
It's good, right?

184
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,826
Eat up.

185
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,957
There you go.

186
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,928
I'm full.

187
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,064
Have you thought
about what you want to do?

188
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,362
First,

189
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,283
I want to do nothing.

190
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,331
I want to eat simple meals like this
without setting the table,

191
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,085
and do a half-ass job
on cleaning and laundry too.

192
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,172
I'll let dirty dishes pile up in the sink.

193
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,925
I want to laze around
without doing anything.

194
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,432
I can't even remember
the last time I got to do that.

195
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,814
All right.

196
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,359
Okay. Let's be lazy cows.

197
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,909
If you're sitting at home,
you aren't lazing around.

198
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,744
Come here and lie down.

199
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,585
I don't need your arm.

200
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:22,226
By the way, Moo-jin,
is there anything you want to do?

201
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,938
Anything I want to do?

202
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,065
There are many things.

203
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,110
Cook for Geum Ae-yeon.

204
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,611
Do the dishes for her.

205
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,612
Put her to sleep.

206
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,323
And take Geum Ae-yeon
to all the places she wants to go,

207
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:39,284
and follow her around at those places.

208
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,786
The list goes on and on.

209
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,711
And…

210
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,757
This time, I really want

211
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:58,011
to be a good dad…

212
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,016
to Hyeon-jae and Mi-rae.

213
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,040
Mr. Lee.

214
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:30,085
The launch date is set.
You can't put it on hold like this.

215
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,004
I'm sorry.

216
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,591
I can't really write at the moment.

217
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,177
Why not? You said
it was going really well.

218
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,888
Didn't you say you'd found
the perfect model for the villain--

219
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,807
I'll give you a call
once I clear my head a little.

220
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,108
Mr. Lee.

221
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,195
- Hello.
- What are you doing?

222
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,947
- Hello.
- Hello.

223
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,490
Hello.

224
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,163
Grandpa, ta-da!

225
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:09,124
Gosh, you're good. Way to go!

226
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,793
Cheer with me.
He gets bored if I do it alone.

227
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:12,794
Oh, sure.

228
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:17,257
- Well done, my Eun-woo.
- Well done, my Eun-woo.

229
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,426
- Hurrah.
- Hurrah.

230
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:24,014
Mr. Jang, you've known
President Byeon for a long time, right?

231
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:26,516
Yes. For over 20 years.

232
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:29,645
About how he suddenly got rich
and bought the building…

233
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:34,858
It wasn't cryptocurrency,
lottery, or stocks.

234
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,945
You said he wasn't capable
of becoming successful through business.

235
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:42,407
Then how do you think he did?

236
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,244
- Ta-da!
- Well done!

237
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,330
- Well done, my Eun-woo.
- Well done, my Eun-woo.

238
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,253
I don't know. Had I known how,
I would've already done it too.

239
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:56,672
What if it's

240
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,383
fraud?

241
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,055
- "Fraud"?
- And what if the victim was

242
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,934
President Kim, the former landlord?

243
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,353
Are you saying President Kim was

244
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,565
so shocked that
he'd fallen victim to fraud…

245
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,734
Ta-da!

246
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:21,029
- Well done, my grandson!
- Well done!

247
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,990
- My goodness.
- Will you keep going?

248
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,866
All right. Keep it up.

249
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,201
Well done.

250
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,954
- That's enough, Mr. Lee.
- Excuse me?

251
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,956
He's the landlord and we're the tenants,

252
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,917
but we're all neighbors.
Let's not do this.

253
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,546
Stop writing such a crazy novel
about President Byeon, okay?

254
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm doing this because
I want to write that novel in peace.

255
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,636
And use a different finger
to push up your glasses!

256
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,680
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

257
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,891
What did I do?

258
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,101
This is it.

259
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:55,605
President Kim seemed very excited
when he gave us this.

260
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,401
We were tempted because
the return on investment seemed high,

261
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,237
but we didn't have the money for it.

262
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:05,157
And the youngsters
who talked my father into this were

263
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,159
Mr. Oh Jae-geol and Mr. Byeon Moo-jin.

264
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,328
Correct?

265
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:12,831
I don't remember their names.

266
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:17,502
But I do remember that Byeon was
one of their surnames. Right?

267
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,837
That's right.

268
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,549
Byeon like "beer" with the letter N
at the end. I remember it clearly.

269
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,134
BYEON MOO-JIN OF DRAGONS RETIRES

270
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,844
DRAGON INVESTMENT

271
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,274
I haven't finished the calculations
with Mr. Byeon.

272
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,861
Why don't we meet up first?

273
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,280
I know you're in on it too.

274
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,241
There must be a misunderstanding--

275
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:51,787
Just relay my message to him.
If he keeps screening my calls,

276
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,289
I'll have to visit him in person.

277
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,006
Hey!

278
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,266
Are you okay?

279
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,851
It hurts.

280
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,732
I must've looked hideous just now.

281
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:22,317
How embarrassing.

282
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:26,321
I was actually
on my way to your hair salon.

283
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,326
You paid for my noodles the other day.

284
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,287
Thanks.

285
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:38,542
I'll use this to buy you another meal.
Let's go.

286
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:40,669
No, I'm good.

287
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,882
It was me.

288
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,677
I've been doing intermittent fasting,

289
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,596
so I feel weak now and fall down easily.

290
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,806
I should eat something.

291
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:54,724
You're hungry too, right?

292
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,644
Let's go.

293
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,314
Thank you.

294
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,529
Why is it that you keep wanting
to eat with me?

295
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,823
Because I'm interested in you.

296
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,996
I have two kids.

297
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:18,248
That's not surprising,
considering your age.

298
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:19,833
But you're single now.

299
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,253
Did Moo-jin tell you about me?

300
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:27,007
No. I just can tell, at a glance.

301
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,344
What makes you say that?

302
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,765
Your face.

303
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,144
Your face is full of loneliness.

304
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,815
I think we're similar in that sense.

305
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:50,238
How about we meet up from time to time
for a meal as friends?

306
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,241
My treat.

307
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,710
I do not need someone to pay for my food.

308
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,131
Please excuse me. I have to go.

309
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,774
Gosh, what is all this?

310
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,734
I don't need so many things.

311
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,445
You need all of them. You'll see.

312
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:33,240
But I'm at work all day
and only go home to sleep.

313
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:40,163
Mold can grow on these.
Get the ones with drainage holes instead.

314
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:46,086
This one doesn't make bubbles easily.
Get mesh sponges instead.

315
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,880
And this…

316
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,135
It's a dishcloth, not a towel.

317
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:56,972
Is it?

318
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,893
You're a fearless army captain at work,

319
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,687
but at home,
I guess you're like a princess.

320
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,381
These have been cleaned.

321
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,174
Put them at the doorway,
where everyone can see.

322
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,385
Why?

323
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,763
For security purposes.

324
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,931
I see.

325
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:44,102
Have people leave the deliveries
at the door, if you can.

326
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:46,354
- Just in case.
- Okay.

327
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,316
And

328
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,900
I got you these too.

329
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,235
COUPLE SLEEPER

330
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,195
Thanks.

331
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,656
Why did you get two pairs?

332
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,827
Your mother might
want to visit you later on.

333
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,790
Or someday in the future,

334
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,085
your boyfriend might come over too.

335
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,172
I see.

336
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,475
I'll call you.

337
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,019
Get home safe.

338
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,142
I see that she isn't even curious.

339
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,159
Let's go take out the trash.

340
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,536
Come here.

341
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,164
What are you doing? Hey.

342
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,458
What do you think? I'm recycling.

343
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,337
Just leave these menial chores to me.

344
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,673
- It's fine. Don't overreact.
- Hey.

345
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,593
Don't even lift a finger, okay?
Quit your job too.

346
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,556
How am I going to spend my days
if I quit my job?

347
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,477
What do you think?
Since you've been through a lot,

348
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,312
you deserve to be treated
like a princess by me.

349
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,981
What?

350
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:56,359
All right. It's all done.

351
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,154
Hold this.

352
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,655
From now on,

353
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,326
I'll walk Medal too.
You go back in and just lie down. Okay?

354
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,662
See? Medal likes me.

355
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,788
What's with her today?

356
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,041
You're such a good girl, aren't you?

357
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,877
Shall we go for a walk?

358
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,395
What are you looking at?
Did you see something over there?

359
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,284
- I'll have a beer too.
- Sure.

360
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,045
Are you sure?

361
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,715
Are you sure you can make Mom happy?

362
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:04,928
No.

363
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,431
I couldn't even keep the promise I made
when we got married.

364
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,724
How could you say that?

365
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,228
I've never kept my promise as you know.

366
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,314
I've always ruined everything
and lost all our money.

367
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,277
But now,

368
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,572
it's about time she found happiness
on her own.

369
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,704
I'll just be there by her side.

370
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,957
Of course, sometimes,

371
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,167
I'll meddle in her affairs.

372
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
So,

373
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,882
trust your mom, not me.

374
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,927
Don't worry about her,
and live your own life.

375
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,430
The family won't fall apart

376
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,891
without you, Mi-rae.

377
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,987
I understand why you guys had to do this,

378
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,114
but I am not grateful at all.

379
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,999
Why is it that everyone thinks
I've been struggling all this time?

380
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,932
Don't tell me you and Mom will remarry.

381
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,727
No, don't answer that question.

382
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,918
- Are you okay?
- Well,

383
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:03,046
it's all part of the process.

384
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,715
You know what?

385
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:10,094
I thought you bought the building

386
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:13,348
in order to live with Ae-yeon, Mi-rae,
and Hyeon-jae.

387
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:17,477
To reunite with your ex-family.

388
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,188
But it seems like

389
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,107
Hyeon-jae lives on the third floor
and Mi-rae has moved out.

390
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,319
And you go back and forth
between the first and third floors

391
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,947
and have a situationship with Ae-yeon.

392
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:34,661
What exactly do you want to do
with your family?

393
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,625
Nothing.

394
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,715
I came here to just be here.

395
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,886
Whatever the situation is,
and whenever they need me,

396
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,348
I'll be by their side when they need me.

397
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,475
I want to offer them

398
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,520
a shoulder to lean on.

399
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,564
That's all I want.

400
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,777
Slowly.

401
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,447
One at a time, hop on.

402
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,825
Get in the van.

403
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,202
Fasten your seat belts. Let's go!

404
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,961
YONG DONG TAEKWONDO

405
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,630
I'll drive you home after I drop her off.

406
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,175
Seul-a, you have your seat belt on, right?

407
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,218
Yes.

408
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,304
Master,

409
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,309
I can't come to the gym
from tomorrow onward.

410
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,228
Why not?

411
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,689
Your mother didn't say anything.

412
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,606
Just because.

413
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,903
Taekwondo isn't fun anymore.

414
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,448
Really?

415
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:58,036
But you cried when you passed
the red belt test yesterday.

416
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,245
You were so happy.

417
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,123
I didn't cry. That was just sweat.

418
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,547
Seul-a, you can pay for your class later,
so don't worry about it. Okay?

419
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,550
I'm not quitting
because I can't afford it.

420
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:18,181
That's not what I meant.

421
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:19,807
I was just…

422
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,643
You meant that she won
a scholarship, right?

423
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:27,899
Yes, that's right. That's what I meant.

424
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,193
What's that?

425
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,946
It's an award that's given
to the best taekwondo student.

426
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,659
When you're on a scholarship,
you get a certificate and free lessons.

427
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,495
Do you still want to quit?

428
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,582
I didn't necessarily want to quit.

429
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,629
Then I'll keep taking the classes.

430
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:58,888
Bye.

431
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,769
Don't worry about the fees.

432
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:09,607
She always does her best at the gym.
I adore her for that.

433
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,192
Thank you so much.

434
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:12,610
- Don't mention it.
- Thank you.

435
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,028
Thank you for your help.

436
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:17,448
I was reminded of Mi-rae's childhood.

437
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,660
Even when she was little,

438
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,830
she never said
that she wanted to do something.

439
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,916
She only talked about what she had to do.

440
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,088
When the family struggles financially,

441
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:35,800
the child matures quicker than the mom.

442
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,015
Still, don't offer the scholarships
to too many students.

443
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,892
You'll end up closing the gym.

444
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,353
I won't.

445
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,027
I couldn't raise Mi-rae

446
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,656
like a princess, given my situation.

447
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,077
But she grew into a fine young lady
all on her own.

448
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:10,626
So, don't you dare
look down on my daughter.

449
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,420
Understood?

450
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:21,095
Mi-rae is a strong

451
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:22,930
and cool woman.

452
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,767
There's much to learn from her.

453
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,021
That's why I like her.

454
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:34,233
I'm lacking in many ways,

455
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,238
but I promise
that I won't cause you any worries.

456
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,659
Make sure you keep your promise.

457
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,244
Yes, I will.

458
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,190
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors!

459
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,859
Gosh, you won.

460
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,612
Since you won, I'll grant a wish.

461
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,822
A wish?

462
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,741
Anything you want.

463
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,452
There's nothing.

464
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,291
There's nothing you want to do with me?

465
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,419
No, it isn't like that.

466
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,463
Tell me. It can be anything.

467
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:42,051
Like something you wanted to do
but couldn't when you were little.

468
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,650
Did you want to try ice skating?

469
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,822
I tried it during a field trip
back in elementary school.

470
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,157
I wanted to go ice skating again,

471
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,243
but I could not pester my mom about it.

472
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,121
Let's do it often now.

473
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:15,001
How about a race?
The winner gets a season pass.

474
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,502
Forget it.

475
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,837
Fine, if you're not confident.

476
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,089
What? No way.

477
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,500
Oh, no. I forgot to pick up bread.

478
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,919
Hyeon-jae. Mi-rae…

479
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,596
Now, I just need to worry about my meals.

480
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,483
Father, you're up early.

481
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,236
Give me just a minute.
I'll make you breakfast.

482
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:07,696
Before you do that, sit down for a moment.

483
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,704
Your break from school ends this year.

484
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,624
Go back to school next semester.
I'll pay for your tuition.

485
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:22,378
I told you. I won't go back to school.

486
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,630
I didn't do anything
while attending school.

487
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,215
It's a waste of money and time.

488
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,427
Fine.

489
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:33,973
These days, college degrees don't mean
as much as they used to.

490
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,934
You can drop out
if it really isn't your thing.

491
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,310
But what will you do, then?

492
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,272
- Business.
- Anything other than that.

493
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,941
That's the only thing I want to do.

494
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,445
Okay. Fine, then.

495
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,447
What business? Any ideas?

496
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,073
I have many.

497
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:54,368
I have over 50 ideas written down
on my tablet.

498
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,454
That tells me you're not ready.

499
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,997
Come on. Why not?

500
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,376
If not a college degree, get a license.

501
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,503
I'll pay for the courses.

502
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:08,048
Father, I understand that
you don't trust me.

503
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:12,636
Soon, I'll submit a great business plan
and give you a presentation.

504
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,972
If you invest in it, it'll--

505
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,599
Hyeon-jae.

506
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,934
Men in this household have--

507
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:20,728
No talent in business?

508
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,729
Right.

509
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,399
I don't know about Mi-rae and Mom,
but you should support me.

510
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,235
Father, please trust me this once.

511
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,280
I said that to your mom every day
a few years ago.

512
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:35,534
But I might be a better version of you.

513
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,038
Why do you want to run a business?

514
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,168
You don't want to do
what you need to do now. You're scared.

515
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,214
But you want to do something
that looks cool in other people's eyes.

516
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,256
Am I wrong?

517
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,928
I'll just have breakfast on my own.

518
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,850
Hyeon-jae.

519
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,935
You know,

520
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,356
you hate the idea of me
starting my business,

521
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:06,732
and it's making me wonder.

522
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,275
Then,

523
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,446
how did you become so rich?

524
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:21,080
FAMILY VILLA

525
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,256
Excuse me.

526
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,592
Do you happen to know
Mr. Byeon's unit number?

527
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,346
Unit 302.

528
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,057
Who might you be?

529
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,647
He's got some nerve.

530
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,613
It must be a famous restaurant.

531
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,700
GANGMI BULGOGI

532
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,493
We won't run into anyone, right?

533
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,161
Don't worry.

534
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,290
No one comes here
because it's too far from the company.

535
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,125
Ms. Byeon?

536
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,921
Can't we line up after eating?

537
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,923
I see you got here early
to get us a table.

538
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,341
Of course, Mr. Park.

539
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,302
A table for two, right?

540
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,386
No, for five.

541
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,013
I see. Please come inside.

542
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,728
- Let's go inside.
- You're the ace indeed.

543
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,856
Hello.

544
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:34,320
Are you here alone? You should join us!

545
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,738
Stop, Shin Na-ra.

546
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,657
No, it's okay.

547
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,201
Hold on. Our security guard?

548
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,246
Let's eat together. I'll pay for your meal

549
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,498
with the company card.

550
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,085
I want to shoot him
with a tranquilizer gun.

551
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,343
Don't the three of you
usually have lunch together?

552
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,470
Why did you come so far alone?

553
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,807
I came on my way back from a meeting.

554
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,643
I wanted to check it out
since it's famous.

555
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,523
Do you eat alone often?

556
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,317
Yes. I mean, sometimes.

557
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,194
I see.

558
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,656
Let's eat together sometimes
so we could get to know each other.

559
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,575
Ms. Byeon, how is it to live alone?

560
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,744
Don't you miss your mom's food?

561
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,830
I envy Ms. Byeon.
I want to live alone too.

562
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:30,167
The house is under my name,
but it doesn't feel like mine.

563
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,002
There's no space for me.

564
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,921
Your mom must be sad though.

565
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,798
It's not like
you got married and moved out.

566
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,259
You suddenly decided to move out
for no reason, you know?

567
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,596
- She isn't.
- I'm glad to hear that.

568
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,556
Anyway, how old are you?

569
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,975
I'm 28.

570
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,812
You're 28. It's a great age.

571
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,314
How long will you work
as a security guard?

572
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:55,734
Well, I'm planning to quit soon.
I'm looking for another job.

573
00:44:55,818 --> 00:44:58,570
It's nice to try new things
when you're young.

574
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,949
Youngsters these days are free-spirited.
It's cool.

575
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,119
But they lack tenacity.

576
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:07,788
They're lighthearted and flippant.
They're rude too.

577
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,957
I need a tranquilizer gun.

578
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,500
Mr. Park?

579
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:15,421
What? Did I cross the line again?

580
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,591
Even though times have changed,

581
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:22,302
I think men should keep
their eyes on one goal.

582
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:25,139
Men should settle down at the right time

583
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,057
so that they can start a family.

584
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,309
That's the meaningful life
of a Korean man--

585
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,644
Mr. Park.

586
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,524
I'm sorry, but you just crossed the line.

587
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,569
What? I crossed the line?

588
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,029
Your elbow.

589
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,701
I'm worried that you'll get hurt
if it spills.

590
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,121
I literally crossed the line.

591
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:52,624
My elbow was derailed.
I should be punished for this.

592
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,336
Let's all dig in!

593
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,589
- Let's dig in.
- Don't cross the line.

594
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,635
What's your MBTI personality type?

595
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:05,929
No, let me guess.

596
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,514
I'm sorry.

597
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,017
Don't be sorry.

598
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,186
Your manager is cute.

599
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:17,107
"Cute" is an adjective I use
when describing Medal.

600
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,447
Who rides such a motorcycle these days?

601
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,873
Isn't she Ms. Byeon's mom?

602
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:37,836
My goodness.

603
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,463
I'm glad I made it on time.

604
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,382
You were running late.
I could drop you off at the company.

605
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:46,094
Everyone at the company knows
that I'm Mi-rae's mom.

606
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,055
They'll think I'm in a biker gang…

607
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,311
My goodness!

608
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:57,523
So a courier service
even delivers a person.

609
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,900
Oh, right.

610
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,155
- Thank you for your service.
- Sure! Please call me again!

611
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,448
Okay. Take care.

612
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,295
I guess your mother has no time to be sad.

613
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,713
She has the acting skills too.

614
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,882
Was it her dream to be an actor?

615
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,138
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae.

616
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,481
I'm Byeon Mi-rae. Where are you from?

617
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,653
My father's columbarium.

618
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,655
I visit him every day.

619
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:48,907
I see.

620
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,994
Okay. How can I help you?

621
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:54,871
It must be nice to have a rich dad.

622
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:56,707
Excuse me?

623
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,252
I just wanted to meet you.

624
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:05,048
To see what the daughter
of the man who made me cry looked like.

625
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,218
- Who are you?
- You'll find out soon.

626
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,142
Hey!

627
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,654
LANDLORD

628
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,870
Maybe she's just a lunatic.

629
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,253
- I envy you.
- Seriously.

630
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,214
Hey, we're launching
new cosmetic products.

631
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,133
But we haven't found a model yet.

632
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,092
A model?

633
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,720
I'm not quite satisfied
with the candidates.

634
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,972
The target buyers are middle-aged women.

635
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,684
We need a natural-looking face
that suits the products.

636
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:01,104
All the models got so much work done
on their faces.

637
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,482
- Really?
- May I take more shifts?

638
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:08,403
Ms. Lee, is there any good-looking
middle-aged woman you can introduce to me?

639
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:10,989
What are you looking at?

640
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,242
I can work late at night and on weekends.

641
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,078
If the sample section shifts are full,

642
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,246
the cashier job is fine too.
Or anything else.

643
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,247
But why, all of a sudden?

644
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,669
My children moved out of the house,

645
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,420
so I have nothing to do at home.

646
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:28,340
I also need to make more money
for my living expenses.

647
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,761
Okay. I'll check and get back to you.

648
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,931
In that case, may I make an offer?

649
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,938
We're looking for a model
for infomercials.

650
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,857
It'll be great if you can take the job.

651
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,822
Gosh, I can't do something like that.

652
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:54,366
You're perfect for the job.
Don't you agree?

653
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,659
Yes.

654
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,619
You're the one we've been looking for.

655
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,626
Thank you for the offer,

656
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,628
but I can't do it.

657
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:11,591
To tell you the truth,
when I saw you in front of the company,

658
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:16,096
you got off the motorcycle
and took off the helmet.

659
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:26,857
You looked so beautiful then.

660
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,900
I almost fell in love with you.

661
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,278
What?

662
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,699
I think you'll look amazing on camera.

663
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,668
Still, I can't do it.

664
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,878
The pay is very high.

665
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,508
How much is it?

666
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:04,519
So please think about it
and let us know. Please?

667
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:21,286
Did you sell a lot today?

668
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:26,917
It's popular as always.

669
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,085
Tomorrow, the free gift event begins.

670
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,504
Please keep up the good work.

671
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,548
Yes, Ms. Byeon.

672
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,554
Are you locking the door properly?

673
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,014
Are you eating your meals?

674
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,475
Why do you worry when you kicked me out?

675
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:52,984
All right. You can be mad at me
as long as you want.

676
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,198
How about you?

677
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,742
Do you enjoy Geum Ae-yeon's life alone?

678
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,704
I bet. You looked so happy earlier.

679
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:12,671
Even if you don't understand
anything else,

680
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:15,674
I want you to know this.

681
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:22,514
I made this decision with a heavy heart
for your sake.

682
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,517
If you did it for my sake,

683
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:28,645
shouldn't I be very happy right now?

684
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:34,734
May I try it?

685
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,279
Of course. Please wait.

686
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,284
Here you go.

687
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,621
It looks so good.

688
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:14,524
There are so many surveillance cameras.

689
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,404
You're finally done with work.

690
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,656
You did well.

691
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:26,244
Waiting for you to come down was fun.

692
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:28,747
I'm sad it's over.

693
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,749
Me too.

694
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,961
I too went down to the mart more often
on purpose to see you.

695
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:37,005
Really?

696
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,643
This is a blind spot.

697
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,193
Let's have dinner together.

698
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:04,741
Today, I promised to have dinner
with Hak-seung and Hyeong-ki.

699
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:08,536
I came to walk you to your car
before I go.

700
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,542
- Okay.
- Your present will be at home.

701
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,669
My present?

702
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,629
See you tomorrow.

703
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,935
TO MI-RAE

704
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:41,403
I was torn between this and ice skates
and chose this.

705
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,781
Now that you live closer to the office,
you should ride this to work.

706
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,157
It isn't a bumper car,

707
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,451
so don't crash into things
like you did last time.

708
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,642
You call this a home?

709
00:55:19,274 --> 00:55:21,526
So Hyeon-jae is giving you
the silent treatment?

710
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:22,485
That's right.

711
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:26,239
I bought his favorite food, pork cutlet,
but he refused to eat it.

712
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,745
Still, don't give in and do as he wants.

713
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,331
Hyeon-jae is still immature
because I did that.

714
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,584
Don't worry.

715
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,754
By the way, aren't you lonely?
Shall I go downstairs?

716
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:43,715
Forget it.

717
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,969
It's my long-awaited freedom.
Don't disturb me.

718
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:50,055
Just look after Hyeon-jae well.

719
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:52,474
Okay, I'll look after him well.

720
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:12,285
I didn't know one person
could shed so much.

721
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:25,090
I thought rinsing with water was
the end of dishwashing.

722
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:31,096
I didn't know that
the bathroom got dirty so quickly.

723
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,058
Household chores are like that.

724
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:39,312
If you don't notice the work,
it means they were done perfectly.

725
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,733
Mom has done them perfectly
without me noticing it

726
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:46,277
all her life.

727
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,621
When will I wash and dry my clothes?

728
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,164
I'll do it later.

729
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,417
Let's just eat.

730
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:31,382
Byeon Mi-rae, you must be having
a mental breakdown by now.

731
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:38,097
"When do I do my laundry?"

732
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:40,767
It's hard to do it after work.

733
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:44,729
If you do it when you go to work,
your clothes will smell.

734
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,815
So you should do it on the weekend.

735
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,027
There won't be a lot of laundry
by yourself,

736
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,530
so it'll be all right.

737
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,200
Rice tends to dry out after a day or two,

738
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:02,872
so put it in small containers
and freeze them.

739
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:08,419
If you microwave it before eating,
it'll be as good as freshly-made rice.

740
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,966
Take out the food waste right away
even if it's annoying.

741
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,468
It'll get moldy otherwise.

742
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:22,016
No matter how busy you get,
clean the bathroom floor once a week.

743
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,645
And most importantly…

744
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:31,067
although you live there,

745
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,361
your home is right here

746
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,990
at Unit 102 of Family Villa.
Don't forget that.

747
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,791
I hope that our home

748
00:59:48,459 --> 00:59:51,087
will no longer be
the battlefield you must protect.

749
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,340
I hope that it'll be a sanctuary

750
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:56,384
where you can rest when things get hard.

751
00:59:57,302 --> 01:00:00,263
When life gets too hard,

752
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,181
when you're exhausted,

753
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:04,142
and when you want to cry,

754
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:06,436
you can come to Mom anytime.

755
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,691
Mi-rae, thank you
for protecting me all your life.

756
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,860
I love you.

757
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,959
How did you know the passcode?

758
01:01:55,169 --> 01:01:56,170
Today is that day.

759
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,300
When I'm exhausted and I want to cry.

760
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:02,969
That's how I feel today.

761
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:17,775
Mom.

762
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:20,403
I get it now.

763
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,533
You must've had it hard all these years.

764
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:33,708
I thought I was taking care
of you, Hyeon-jae, and Medal.

765
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,836
But it wasn't me.

766
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,922
It was you.

767
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,678
To be honest, I knew that.

768
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,098
But I forgot for a while.

769
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,730
I…

770
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:02,278
It wasn't as hard
as everyone thinks it was for me.

771
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,531
I was just

772
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,701
happy when you smiled.

773
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,122
I was scared…

774
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:17,627
when you cried.

775
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:23,925
You were my home,

776
01:03:25,635 --> 01:03:27,345
my umbrella,

777
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,806
and my world.

778
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:41,526
So all this time, I was protecting myself,

779
01:03:44,153 --> 01:03:45,571
not you.

780
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:51,202
I wanted to be Wonder Woman like you.

781
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:57,291
Then what will you be, a Wonder Girl?

782
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:04,924
I'll try.

783
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,635
I'm not confident yet.

784
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:14,475
But as you want,

785
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:18,145
I'll try to fly

786
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:21,315
to where I want to be.

787
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:08,321
What is it?

788
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:12,325
That woman contacted me.
I think she knows everything.

789
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:13,242
And?

790
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:17,204
What should I do now?

791
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:20,207
Why are you asking me?

792
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:22,877
Take care of it on your own.
Don't drag me into it.

793
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:02,124
Everyone, we'll have a weekly meeting
in 600 seconds.

794
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,793
- Okay.
- Okay.

795
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,137
Everyone, rise!

796
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:29,568
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

797
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:32,113
What are you doing here?

798
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,576
- I hired someone as a favor.
- Right.

799
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:40,413
We're ready to accept someone
hired through connections.

800
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,374
But who is

801
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:45,751
the new employee?

802
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:49,171
My son.

803
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,259
Your son?

804
01:06:56,303 --> 01:07:00,266
He's at the very bottom of the ranks,
so work him hard. And his mentor will be…

805
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,146
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae.

806
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:52,651
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

807
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:55,071
The fact that the CEO had a son
was a surprise.

808
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,948
And he even made a supervisor his mentor
instead of a team leader?

809
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:01,077
Ms. Byeon will do her best as your mentor.

810
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,746
I'm very thorough at work.
Will you be able to handle it?

811
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:05,081
He's dancing.

812
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,583
How could you distribute so many samples?

813
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,001
Go easy on him.

814
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,962
I need to teach him diligently.
The CEO trusted him with me.

815
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:15,883
- Ma'am, who are you?
- The former landlord, Mr. Kim's daughter.

816
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:18,094
You scammed my father, didn't you?

817
01:08:18,177 --> 01:08:19,678
I ruined it again.

818
01:08:21,013 --> 01:08:26,018
