00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,641
Byeon Moo-jin,
don't you have something to say to me?

3
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:00,977
Not really.

4
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,233
Hey, I didn't even get a wedding ceremony.

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,527
I'm just getting my photos taken
in this state.

6
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,780
Yet you have nothing to say?

7
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:16,951
Let's…

8
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,537
live a good life together?

9
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,791
- Please look over here.
- Okay!

10
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,837
Is that all?

11
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,799
What else do you want me to say?

12
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,802
Do you have a death wish?

13
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,638
Hey, why do
those meaningless words matter?

14
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,518
Until my hair turns gray
and I'm in diapers,

15
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,186
I'll live with you only!

16
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,523
That's good enough.

17
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,817
What's good enough?

18
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:52,946
Make sure you keep your word.

19
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,034
You keep your word.

20
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,956
I'll take the photo now.
Kimchi. Cheese. Smile.

21
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,083
- Kimchi!
- Kimchi!

22
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:09,003
EPISODE 5
A MIDLIFE CRISIS BEGINS

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,679
You reject all advances anyway.

24
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,223
Why do you always get dolled up?

25
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,060
I want to know if I've still got it.

26
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:34,696
You should date while you've still got it.

27
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,281
Aren't you lonely?

28
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,163
Men who hit on me
are usually one of three things.

29
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,582
Penniless,

30
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,500
slow-witted,

31
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,127
or scummy.

32
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,713
Have you seen him since then?

33
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:54,591
- Who?
- You know who.

34
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:58,970
The penniless, slow-witted, and scummy man
who ruined your life in Thailand.

35
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:20,575
Sir.

36
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,452
President Byeon.

37
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,916
Hey, Mr. Byeon!

38
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:34,589
Khun Mooy!

39
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,571
Considering the exchange rate
and four years' worth of interest,

40
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,531
it should be about this much.

41
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,993
Is this what you wanted to give me?

42
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,914
- Forget it.
- Just take it.

43
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,625
- I'm leaving.
- Just…

44
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,336
what happened?

45
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,343
When we first met in Thailand,
it was after you caused trouble in Korea.

46
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,761
And when we parted ways…

47
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:28,226
you gave me your entire fortune.

48
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,234
I didn't ask you anything.

49
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,032
As for the baby…

50
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:47,662
I lost it.

51
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,709
Soon after returning to Korea.

52
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,690
AMILY VILLA

53
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,068
- Mom, let's go.
- Okay.

54
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:21,446
What?

55
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,284
- I returned the fridge.
- Why?

56
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,244
The current one works fine.

57
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,330
We agreed to get a new fridge.

58
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:33,291
- The monthly installments aren't much.
- Gosh.

59
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,501
If you have money, spend it on yourself.

60
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,756
Get a designer bag or laser treatments
for your face like other girls.

61
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,632
Don't be ridiculous.

62
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,596
Look at this.

63
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,973
Because you always work late
and get stressed out,

64
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,433
you have under-eye bags.

65
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,437
Are these age spots?

66
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
Don't!

67
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,778
- What about the bag?
- What bag?

68
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,741
Hey, you think I only returned the fridge?

69
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:10,620
Okay then.

70
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,497
Byeon Mi-rae.

71
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,507
I can take care of myself.

72
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:27,720
- What?
- You don't need to worry about everything.

73
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,638
Last time too.

74
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,849
I could've taken care of it myself,
but you let everyone know.

75
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,685
- You created a big mess.
- I thought you were kidnapped.

76
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,562
I didn't know you were beating him up.

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:40,525
So stop engaging in a childish battle
of wits with Byeon Moo-jin!

78
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,110
I can take care of myself.

79
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,529
What? Childish?

80
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,326
What I'm trying to say is…

81
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,412
Hey, wait for me.

82
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:57,041
I'm a childish brat,
so I can't give you a ride.

83
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,044
Didn't you catch a cold?

84
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,632
No, I didn't. I'm fine.

85
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,427
That's good to hear.

86
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:55,933
First floor.

87
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:57,018
Bye.

88
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,189
The doors are closing.

89
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,362
Gosh, what am I doing?

90
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,589
If you can afford this,
why not just buy a car?

91
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,427
It's secondhand. It was cheap.

92
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,804
What? Are you worried?

93
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,308
Don't worry. I won't make you a widow.

94
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,940
When will you eat with me?

95
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:50,863
Okay, let's do that.

96
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,243
- Really?
- What do you want to eat?

97
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,128
- I'll bring out the dessert.
- Okay.

98
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:10,800
Was it good?

99
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:14,220
Of course, it was.
It was an expensive meal.

100
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,100
Then why did you return the bag?
It was expensive too.

101
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,313
Why do you keep spending money like water?

102
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,023
Because you're nouveau riche?

103
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,485
The villa residents, neighbors, and…

104
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:34,282
Hey, cleaning up his mess
is giving me a headache.

105
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,869
Still, I have to do it

106
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,330
if I want to score big.

107
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,751
They're just taking advantage of you.
Don't you know that?

108
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,877
Of course I do.

109
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,629
It isn't a problem.

110
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,797
Be more frugal.

111
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,426
What will you do if you throw away
all your money and go bankrupt again?

112
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,138
Then you should keep me in check.

113
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,644
Why me?

114
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,563
What kind of question is that?

115
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:10,276
Geum Ae-yeon is the only woman in my life.

116
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,992
Here's your dessert.

117
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,663
Please enjoy.

118
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:25,958
Byeon Moo-jin.

119
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,796
Date someone new.

120
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,884
Put the past behind you and move on.

121
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,428
Why are you calling yourself my past?

122
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,679
We're

123
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,515
a plate that shattered years ago.

124
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,980
If it's shattered,
we can glue the pieces back together.

125
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,485
No, we can't.

126
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,865
When we got a divorce…

127
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,370
and I deserted you by kicking you out,

128
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm sure you resented me.

129
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,253
But back then,
it was the best decision I could make.

130
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,673
Had I kept living that way,

131
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,841
our kids' future would've been ruined.

132
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,844
I don't resent you.

133
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,015
You had every right to desert me.

134
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:24,809
But Ae-yeon,

135
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm no longer the immature Moo-ron.

136
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,691
I've matured.

137
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,777
No.

138
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,154
You just have a lot of money now.

139
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,032
You're the same as before.

140
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:46,122
You know Mi-rae is having a hard time
these days because of you, right?

141
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,459
I didn't agree to stay in the villa
to see Mi-rae like that.

142
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:56,715
Let's not forget that we're parents.

143
00:11:58,342 --> 00:11:59,885
Just do that much.

144
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,055
Don't cross the line.

145
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,980
I have absolutely no intention
of getting back together with you.

146
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,818
And now, my family consists
of Mi-rae, Hyeon-jae, and me.

147
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,654
Just us three.

148
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:19,947
There's no place

149
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:22,908
for you.

150
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,831
If you came here

151
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,417
to say this…

152
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,922
you shouldn't have come looking pretty.

153
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:46,265
You cruel wench.

154
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,965
DUMMY DOME SECURITY CAMERA

155
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,235
You must be worried about your mom.

156
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,239
You should've asked your dad…

157
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,744
You should've asked the landlord to do it.

158
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,087
Forget it.

159
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,466
- Give me that.
- Forget it.

160
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,095
Come on.
You have to put it back on the rooftop.

161
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,681
I'm going there anyway, so let me take it.

162
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,976
Suit yourself.

163
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,283
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

164
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,409
Please leave…

165
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,786
BYEON MOO-JIN

166
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,999
That damn woman.

167
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,293
Then how are you going to score big?

168
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:39,795
You won't tell me, right?

169
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,964
I'll ask him then.

170
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,424
Wait.

171
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,469
Forget it.

172
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,973
He's in the palm of my hand anyway.

173
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,773
BYEON MOO-JIN
CHECKING ACCOUNT

174
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,007
Byeon Mi-rae!

175
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,344
Wake up. The sun's up.

176
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,099
It's the weekend.

177
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,726
I'm not eating breakfast.

178
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,021
Come on!

179
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,189
Will you sleep all day?

180
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,524
Get up now. Let's head out with Medal.

181
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,027
Where to?

182
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,363
Here it is.

183
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,240
I won't give it back for free.

184
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,578
You're so happy. Come here.

185
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:57,206
Here it is. That's right.

186
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,041
Sit.

187
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,751
Medal, sit.

188
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,337
It's tasty, isn't it? Well done.

189
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,964
You're the best, Geum Medal.

190
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,924
You're so cute.

191
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,435
Careful, it's hot.

192
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,205
Mom.

193
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,459
Did you get divorced because of me?

194
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,671
What?

195
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,382
Back then,

196
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,094
I pushed you

197
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:54,888
to end things with Father.

198
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,147
Was that why you got a divorce?

199
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:04,898
Because of me?

200
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:15,117
I held out until then because of you guys.

201
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,246
And I made up my mind thanks to you.

202
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,085
If I hadn't divorced him then,

203
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,756
that jerk would've never come
to his senses.

204
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,092
And neither we nor Byeon Moo-jin

205
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,846
would've had a normal life like we do now.

206
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,102
It's all thanks to you, Mi-rae.

207
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,532
This is so nice.

208
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,912
Lie down. Come on.

209
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,011
Have you ever felt lonely?

210
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,767
Back then, I had no time to get lonely.

211
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:24,895
Now, I am

212
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,023
too old for such feelings.

213
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,030
How so? Your skin is still plump.

214
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,324
And unlike me,
you don't have any age spots.

215
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
My neck hurts. Give me your arm.

216
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,542
I'm fine since I have you.

217
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,129
I hope Byeon Moo-jin finds a nice woman.

218
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,883
I feel bad for him.
I think he's consumed by loneliness.

219
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,139
I guess you really don't have
any feelings for him anymore, Mom.

220
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:03,433
But the thing is,

221
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,436
unlike you, I…

222
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,857
I'm sure he can take care of himself.

223
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,237
I keep getting angry when I see Father.

224
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,825
What's wrong with me?

225
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:44,516
Make sure you keep your word.

226
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:46,560
You keep your word.

227
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,229
- Kimchi!
- Kimchi!

228
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,402
Ae-yeon.

229
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,574
- On your way to pick up Eun-woo?
- No, it's the weekend.

230
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,826
His parents took him.

231
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,745
- What are you doing here?
- That's good.

232
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:08,665
I wanted to hang out with Mi-rae,
but something came up and she had to work.

233
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,918
And Hyeon-jae went out too.

234
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,920
Why don't we have a drink
since we're free?

235
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,672
I promised to buy you a drink.

236
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,841
Call Se-ri and tell her to come
to Gangnam Hof.

237
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,884
Okay.

238
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,556
We went to the police station
because of you.

239
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:27,392
A few glasses of draft beer won't cut it.

240
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,773
What do you want then?

241
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,693
Was this what you wanted?

242
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,072
While risking my life
to save you that day,

243
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,657
my nails got ruined.

244
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,409
Beating up that jerk
almost did a number on my wrists.

245
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,912
A nail artist's hands are her livelihood.

246
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,207
All right.

247
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:53,293
Get any treatment you want,
and I will wire you the money.

248
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,713
I'm done. It's your turn.

249
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,049
- Me?
- Yes.

250
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,467
It's okay.

251
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,637
I've always wanted to do your nails.

252
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,891
Don't you know that women should
get their nails done regularly?

253
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
All right then. Just make them look neat.

254
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,024
You should get a French manicure
while you're at it.

255
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,402
Don't you want to look good
for President Byeon?

256
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,699
That's right. Men tend to look at
women's hands and feet…

257
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:33,292
- Just make them look neat.
- Yes, Ae-yeon.

258
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,089
Let me ask you this woman-to-woman
one last time.

259
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,593
You have absolutely no intention
of getting back together with him?

260
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,345
None whatsoever?

261
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,728
No. None whatsoever. Never.

262
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,523
And I already talked it over with him.

263
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,442
- I see.
- I see.

264
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,862
Whether he's a landlord or not,
it's never going to happen.

265
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:08,035
I mean, if I could,

266
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,828
I'd introduce him to a nice woman.

267
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,955
I want him to get a fresh start.

268
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,373
Okay.

269
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,501
You heard her.
So stop pestering her, okay?

270
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,462
Just cut my nails short.

271
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,141
The weather is nice.
Why don't we go for a run?

272
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,684
I'm in.

273
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,604
I'm going to get going.

274
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,190
I really would if I could,

275
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:42,235
but it'd be hard since we already printed
the packaging and wrappers--

276
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,991
Of course, I know that.

277
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:52,621
Sokcho Factory has been our client
since the foundation of the company.

278
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,166
But that could create confusion
in our promotions for the new product,

279
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,293
so the higher-ups didn't approve--

280
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,586
What?

281
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,296
Hello? Ma'am?

282
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,598
YONG DONG TAEKWONDO

283
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,395
I'd feel so much better
if I could break just three boards.

284
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,865
Seriously.

285
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,299
Why do you always show up
when I'm doing something stupid?

286
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,010
I know, right?

287
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,021
Do you work on weekends too?

288
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,566
Well, yes.

289
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,319
Is this the way to your place?

290
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,280
It's the opposite way.

291
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,160
- Are you walking me home?
- Yes.

292
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,957
A few days ago, a woman
got kidnapped in this neighborhood.

293
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,543
I haven't yet heard
that the culprit got caught.

294
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,462
It's dangerous to walk alone at this hour.

295
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,844
Three ladies beat up the culprit
and put him behind bars.

296
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,679
Really?

297
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,141
Are they ex-athletes?

298
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,062
So don't worry about me, and head home--

299
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,981
Okay, then. I'll just head home.

300
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,983
Get home safe.

301
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,501
This is dangerous.

302
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,629
Ms. Byeon?

303
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,425
Go away.

304
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,178
Just go.

305
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,437
Him just leaving like that…

306
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,408
makes me sad.

307
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:10,652
It wouldn't be very nice of me
to leave you like that. Right?

308
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,530
This is…

309
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,492
very dangerous.

310
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,287
What's wrong?

311
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,038
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong.

312
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,042
Why did you put an umbrella
over me that day?

313
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,174
Don't do that from now on.

314
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,137
You keep being nice to me,
and it bothers me.

315
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:44,477
Even if I get swept away in a flood,
just go on your way. Understood?

316
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,148
Have a safe trip home.

317
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,049
Go away.

318
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,135
Just go.

319
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,117
The weather is nice.
Why don't we go for a run?

320
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,035
I'm in.

321
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,097
It's confusing.

322
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,896
Where are you?

323
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,606
You're almost home?

324
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,901
I don't see you.

325
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,114
I'm almost home.

326
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,075
Ae-yeon!

327
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,038
What a nuisance. My goodness.

328
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,416
Hey!

329
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,130
Ae-yeon.

330
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,217
My back.

331
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,762
Where am I?

332
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:45,724
Home?

333
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:48,977
Gosh.

334
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,980
I can't tell if this is your home
or a dumpster.

335
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,902
Why are you drinking so much these days?

336
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,321
You hadn't done that in a while.

337
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,491
Ae-yeon.

338
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,664
Do you know what I want to be
in the future?

339
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:11,291
What?

340
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,168
A drunkard?

341
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,549
Geum Ae-yeon.

342
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:30,727
Because you have everything.

343
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,855
What?

344
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,903
You have Mi-rae.

345
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,864
You have Hyeon-jae.

346
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:46,201
And…

347
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,913
And…

348
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,050
And what?

349
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,248
What's this?

350
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,093
President Byeon, where are you?

351
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,346
- Why do you ask?
- It's about the signboard.

352
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,891
They messed up the order.
I can't believe these people.

353
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,143
We'll need to toss this
and place a new order.

354
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,479
It's okay. Just put it up.

355
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,315
What?

356
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,527
I don't want you to complain later.

357
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:46,070
When will you come back to Seoul?

358
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,199
What the…

359
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,926
You don't want it?

360
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,721
Hey! Ae-yeon!

361
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:13,932
What are you doing?

362
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,452
Mom has been a bit strange these days.

363
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,622
Mom, what do you want to drink?

364
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:40,375
A hot iced latte.

365
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,548
Mom, did we do something wrong?

366
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,513
I bought too many eggs by mistake.

367
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,517
We need to eat them all
before they go bad.

368
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:00,728
She acts even weirder at night.

369
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:04,190
Medal, I'm home.

370
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,824
Mom, what are you doing?

371
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:14,867
It's hot.

372
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,871
FAN SPEED

373
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,547
THAILAND TOUR SPECIAL LIVE
HAPPY PACKAGE

374
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,382
FIVE DAYS IN BANGKOK
AND PATTAYA CITY

375
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,176
That is definitely strange.

376
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,178
Did you notice anything weird about her?

377
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,346
I'm not sure.

378
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,099
Could it be a midlife crisis?

379
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,350
A midlife crisis?

380
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,228
You mean like menopause.

381
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,023
It's too soon for that.

382
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,609
All right, Aunt Jeong-in.

383
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,365
For two quarters of the year,

384
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,828
we failed to place first
in online sales performance.

385
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:03,458
Am I the only one
who feels a sense of crisis?

386
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,921
If we continue to place second,

387
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:11,132
it won't be long before we plummet

388
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,302
and begin placing third, fourth, or fifth.

389
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,347
Am I, the CEO, the only one
who has such worries?

390
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,400
Mr. Nam, it's an urgent call.

391
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,360
What is it?

392
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,040
- Hello?
- I never asked for a big favor.

393
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,833
How could you turn me down like this?

394
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,254
I've already explained it to you.

395
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,049
We'll release the new product first,

396
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:56,636
and then we'll add it
after sales stabilize.

397
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,221
Stop with that nonsense!

398
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,642
Please don't yell.

399
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:08,773
Forget it. Starting today, we will
no longer supply goods to your company.

400
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,609
Ms. President.

401
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:13,986
Auntie!

402
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,154
Auntie!

403
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,542
Who's in charge of Diver Tteokbokki?

404
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,547
Have a good day.

405
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,973
Ms. Byeon!

406
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,600
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?
- What is it?

407
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,353
Sokcho Factory's owner
called Mr. Nam directly and said

408
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,855
they'd stop supplying to us.

409
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,315
- It'll begin with Diver Tteokbokki.
- What?

410
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,109
The new product launches in two days.

411
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:54,569
What should we do?

412
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,529
What are we going to do?

413
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,364
- I'll go now.
- Will it change anything?

414
00:35:58,447 --> 00:36:01,284
Everyone knows
that old woman is as stubborn as a mule.

415
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,785
I'll beg on my knees if I must.

416
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,662
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

417
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:07,123
What you need now is speed! Speed!

418
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,512
- I'll go with you.
- Where?

419
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,599
Aren't you going to the factory in Sokcho?

420
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,977
- I know the factory owner well.
- And?

421
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,147
She never forgives once she gets upset.
But it'll be different if I go.

422
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,567
Are you sure?

423
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,194
Hurry up and drive.

424
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,138
What a coincidence to move in
on the same day.

425
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,518
We're a family of three.
I have a daughter and a son.

426
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,315
You'll be done in no time
since you don't have much stuff.

427
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,986
How far along are you?

428
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:23,074
Moms can tell right away.

429
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,954
- Sir.
- Yes?

430
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,705
Please call me when you're done.

431
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,665
Okay.

432
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,174
Isn't she the woman
who lives on the third floor?

433
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,093
She shouldn't be drinking.

434
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,847
What? She got drunk yesterday as well
and slipped in front of the villa.

435
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,182
What?

436
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,228
My goodness.

437
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:00,987
Are you sober now?

438
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,118
Yes.

439
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,377
Have some seaweed soup.

440
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,842
It isn't your fault
that you lost the baby.

441
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,261
Just think…

442
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,889
that it wasn't meant to be this time.

443
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,788
Don't cry.

444
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,934
- Please wait.
- Okay.

445
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,187
Oh, my goodness.

446
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:21,192
Ae-yeon, what are you doing here?

447
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,904
- Jeong-in.
- Yes?

448
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,532
When

449
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,369
you lived in Thailand…

450
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,122
Yes?

451
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:48,761
Was it nice?

452
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,518
You want to go to Thailand, right?

453
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,270
Then you should go
on a short trip with Mi-rae.

454
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,398
I'll take care of Medal and Hyeon-jae.

455
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:02,900
Jeong-in.

456
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,744
Turn off the flat iron.

457
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,663
Right, the flat iron.

458
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,044
Ae-yeon…

459
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,130
What?

460
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,271
An Jeong-in, can you explain that photo?

461
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:42,857
What happened?

462
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,776
Forget it. If you can't ask her about it,

463
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,944
just let it go.

464
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,280
Why didn't she say a thing to me?

465
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,408
Why did she pretend
not to know Byeon Moo-jin?

466
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,993
I'm sure she had her reasons.

467
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,619
Why do you care, Geum Ae-yeon?

468
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:57,455
Are you Byeon Moo-jin's wife?

469
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,581
Geum Ae-yeon.

470
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,416
Didn't you miss me?

471
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:05,671
Yes. I knew when I bought it.
I wanted to live with you.

472
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,800
- Byeon Moo-jin.
- Byeon Moo-jin.

473
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,427
- I can't believe you.
- I can't believe you.

474
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:16,474
What kind of question is that?
Geum Ae-yeon is the only woman in my life.

475
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,519
What's wrong with you?

476
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:44,627
My goodness, you drank so much.

477
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,253
You've been drinking for hours

478
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,672
instead of ordering snow crabs
at a snow crab place.

479
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,717
The total won't even cover
the cost of the table.

480
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,513
Then sit down and drink with me.

481
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:01,644
So what's the story?

482
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,103
Here.

483
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,314
Tell me.

484
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,275
I got rejected

485
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,736
by my wife.

486
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,450
If you got rejected, it's game over.

487
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,535
You know that, right?

488
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,829
When women say it's over, it's over.

489
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:26,418
Here. Guzzle down the drinks today
and forget about it.

490
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,882
Excuse me.

491
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,348
Hey, my daughter. Yes.

492
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:41,642
Why would I drink?

493
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,477
I haven't closed the restaurant yet.

494
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,354
I'm not drinking.

495
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,524
I gave you an allowance the other day.

496
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:49,608
What?

497
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:55,906
Of course, Daddy will get it for you.

498
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,826
Excuse me. She acts all cute
when she wants something.

499
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:01,078
Okay.

500
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,621
All right.

501
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,916
It seems like…

502
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,796
other daughters want a lot
from their dads.

503
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,938
Our president?

504
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,275
She went diving to blow off some steam.

505
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,873
Ms. President.

506
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,000
I'm Byeon Mi-rae of JPLUS.

507
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,337
I've nothing to say to you guys.

508
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:54,673
- Ms. President.
- What are you doing?

509
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,924
Ms. President.

510
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,430
Please reconsider your decision
to stop supplying to JPLUS.

511
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:07,227
Get up, kid. Your legs are
just going to ache. It's no use.

512
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:09,688
Even if Mr. Nam comes himself and begs,

513
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,565
I won't change my mind. Okay?

514
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,068
Grandma!

515
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,612
Grandma!

516
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:19,365
- Who are you?
- Grandma!

517
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:23,160
- Have you been well?
- Tae-pyeong, is that you?

518
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,537
What are you doing here?

519
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:28,749
Gosh, when did you become so tall?

520
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,878
You were so short as a kid. You punk.

521
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,714
Come on, Grandma. I'm all grown up.

522
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:40,678
I heard that you were upset,
so I came to comfort you.

523
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,764
Tae-pyeong, it doesn't concern you. Okay?

524
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:48,268
I've cut all ties with JPLUS, okay?

525
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:51,522
Grandma, open wide.

526
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,816
- Hurry up and open wide.
- What's this?

527
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:56,693
It's your favorite snack,
sweet red bean jelly from the market.

528
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,238
I ran over to the market to buy it.

529
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,490
Aren't you going to eat it?

530
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,326
Come on. Open wide.

531
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,495
Open wide.

532
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,083
What on earth are you trying to do?

533
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,587
Here comes the sweet red bean jelly.

534
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,673
Whoosh.

535
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,550
Knock, knock.

536
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,306
Knock, knock, knock.

537
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,272
That's enough!

538
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,488
I heard the story on my way here.

539
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,866
Since you used to be a diver here,

540
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,909
you were sad to see
the tradition dying out

541
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,662
since people didn't know
about Gangwon Province's divers.

542
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:53,584
You might think that an old woman
is making a fuss for no reason.

543
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:57,546
When I supplied
the seafood soft tofu stew two years ago,

544
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,756
I asked the company to promote the divers.

545
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,092
When I supplied
the seafood jjamppong last year,

546
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,678
I made the same request and was ignored.

547
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,388
It wasn't intentional.

548
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,224
The product was discontinued
in a few months due to low sales.

549
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,311
- So we couldn't make that happen.
- Exactly.

550
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,397
You'll discontinue the product
in a few months

551
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,109
and forget about the promise
this time as well.

552
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,905
I don't want to be treated
like a fool anymore.

553
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,115
Find a different factory.

554
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,285
No, it'll be different this time.

555
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,330
Diver Tteokbokki will be a big hit.

556
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,875
How do you know that?

557
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,084
I'm

558
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,212
very good at my job.

559
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:44,426
And I'll make sure to promote
Gangwon Province's divers this time.

560
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,428
It isn't included in the packaging,

561
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,306
but we'll run a campaign
on our website and social media.

562
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,016
We'll run active promotions.

563
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,316
These days, online promotions
work the best, Grandma.

564
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:02,694
Please give us one last chance.

565
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,614
Well… If we fail
to keep our promise again,

566
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,824
I'll quit my job,
move to Gangwon Province,

567
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,618
and become a diver.

568
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,039
You may look like a child,

569
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,708
but you're a proper businesswoman.

570
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,044
All right. Go ahead and eat.

571
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:21,046
- Let's clink our glasses.
- Okay.

572
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,217
Let's eat.

573
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,554
Thank you for the food.

574
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,516
You've done a lot today.

575
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,184
Thank you.

576
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,312
I'll drive you safely to Seoul.

577
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:40,107
Since we worked hard,

578
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,819
let's stop by the beach for a bit.

579
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,009
It's okay. Keep it on.

580
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,178
There was sand on it.

581
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,055
I was about to shake it off.

582
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,724
I see.

583
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,025
I was joking.

584
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:28,363
- Do you tease people often?
- Once I'm close to them.

585
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:37,873
What? The seagulls are floating
on the water asleep.

586
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,542
Is this your first time at the beach?

587
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:47,007
It isn't my first time, but I've only
passed by it during business trips.

588
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,509
It's my first time looking at the ocean

589
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,054
without doing anything.

590
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,062
You should do this
when you come to the beach.

591
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,944
Mi-rae, you do it too. Come on.

592
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,780
Stop teasing me.

593
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,617
See?

594
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:34,554
I should've just disappeared
quietly and for good.

595
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,349
Why did I come back?

596
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:39,518
Why?

597
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,996
No wonder I hadn't seen him
for a few days.

598
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,636
I'll be in the car.

599
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,982
What brings you two here?

600
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,986
What are you doing here?

601
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,658
Soothing my broken heart.

602
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:42,289
Once I'm over it, I'll go back.

603
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,961
It would've been better
if you hadn't come back.

604
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,094
If you had remained as a dead person,

605
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,890
it would've been better.

606
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:08,940
I just thought that it might be

607
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:14,946
a good idea to make amends.

608
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,702
For you…

609
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,333
I thought I could lighten

610
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:33,215
the heavy burden on your shoulders,
even though it was belated.

611
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,595
That's what I thought.

612
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,231
Have a safe trip back to Seoul.

613
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,428
I came here with Mi-rae
to help her with work.

614
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,556
We were just about to head back.

615
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:25,809
Is your name Tae-pyeong?

616
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,645
Yes, it's Nam Tae-pyeong.

617
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,564
It probably won't work out.

618
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,317
The women in that household

619
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,903
are sick and tired of athletes.

620
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:41,616
I'm sorry.

621
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:35,128
You must be worried about your mom.

622
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,976
Thank you.

623
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,441
I waited for an hour on the weekend
to eat here.

624
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,901
Keep an eye on this place.

625
00:53:58,485 --> 00:54:00,987
It's packed
even during the day on a weekday.

626
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,781
- It must be really delicious.
- Yes.

627
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,452
Oh, yes! We got a bonus.

628
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,748
Have flight ticket prices dropped?

629
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,583
Are you going on a trip?

630
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,379
Right. You should go
on a vacation this year, Ms. Byeon.

631
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,672
Where are you going?

632
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:22,008
Thailand.
My mom has never traveled abroad.

633
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,760
Are you going with your mom?

634
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:27,889
That's a business trip, not a vacation.

635
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,057
Why don't you go alone?

636
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:31,643
I can do that in the future.

637
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,284
Ju-yong, I just need tips
on how you made a presentation

638
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,371
and got your father's approval
for the business.

639
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,707
Is your father well-off?

640
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,375
Yes, he is totally loaded!

641
00:54:59,212 --> 00:55:00,422
GRIM REAPER

642
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,132
Excuse me.

643
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,134
She'll kill me if I don't answer.

644
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:07,804
Hey, Mi-rae.

645
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,181
Byeon Hyeon-jae, where are you right now?

646
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,643
I'm at school. I told you it's exam week.

647
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,395
I have to go take my exam now.

648
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,022
Is that so?

649
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,816
- But this isn't your school.
- What?

650
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,318
What are you…

651
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,829
Mi-rae, what are you doing

652
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,873
here?

653
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,668
Did you just miss school today?

654
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,920
Or is there something else you're hiding?

655
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,256
Answer me!

656
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:47,552
Mi-rae, the thing is…

657
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,681
I'm sorry. I'll pay you back
when I become successful.

658
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,518
Pay me back? What have you done?

659
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,021
This punk.

660
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,911
Where is he?

661
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,954
This is a café I run.

662
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,916
I'll just grab him and leave quietly.
Where is he?

663
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,043
Well, I'm not sure.

664
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:23,046
I don't know.

665
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:35,725
You traitor! How could you give me away?

666
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:37,477
How? Hey!

667
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,439
You did what?

668
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,692
- I took a leave of absence.
- On whose terms?

669
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,905
As you know, I'm majoring
in Smart Fusion and Content Marketing.

670
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:52,450
But no matter how hard I try,
I can't fuse myself with my studies.

671
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,662
Then what have you been doing
while pretending to study?

672
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:59,541
The Entrepreneur's Club has seniors
who started businesses and hit it big.

673
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,334
I followed around those seniors

674
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:04,504
to get know-how
and talk about business items.

675
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,923
You drove for them,
did menial tasks for them,

676
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,883
and went drinking with them, I'm sure.

677
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:11,886
Who would share their know-how for free?

678
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:12,804
Gosh.

679
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,516
What about your tuition?

680
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,353
Mi-rae, you know what?

681
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,939
It's the crazy ones who go far in life.

682
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,567
Currently, I'm crazy about
becoming successful,

683
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,736
and you're investing in my future.

684
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:31,573
That's why my name means "present"
and yours means "future."

685
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,032
Eight million won is nothing!

686
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:38,288
I'll pay you back tenfold in no time,
so don't worry about a thing, okay?

687
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:43,084
Eight million won?
You wasted two semesters of tuition?

688
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,003
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

689
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,171
You crazy bastard!

690
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:48,256
Don't you feel sorry for Mom
for having a son like you?

691
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,592
What are you going to do now?

692
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,344
I'll quit school and run a business
with Father's investment.

693
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,346
What?

694
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,308
Father came back, so why worry?

695
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,351
He won't ignore me when I need help.

696
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,498
MI-RAE

697
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,085
Where are you?

698
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:29,631
Let's meet. I have something to say.

699
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,674
Okay.

700
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,219
I have something to say too.

701
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,442
Geum Ae-yeon, you're crazy.

702
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:40,118
- Ae-yeon, why are you here?
- What?

703
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,454
President Byeon asked me if he could use
the pub before business hours.

704
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:46,124
Is Byeon Moo-jin at Gangnam Hof right now?

705
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,208
Yes.

706
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,392
Just what false hope
did you give Hyeon-jae?

707
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,936
- What did he do?
- He wants to quit school.

708
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:09,480
- To do what?
- Run a business.

709
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,233
What?

710
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,613
I should've known.

711
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,575
He had too much free time for a student.

712
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:21,826
What are you going to do?

713
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:32,712
What is it?

714
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:34,505
Open it.

715
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:43,806
PLEDGE

716
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,935
TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP
APPLICATION

717
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,145
TRANSFEREE GEUM AE-YEON

718
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,150
As I promised, I'll pack up and leave.

719
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,281
FIANCÉ SALON

720
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:05,828
TEMPORARILY OUT OF OFFICE

721
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,924
JEONG-IN

722
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:28,434
Once I'm gone,
Hyeon-jae will come to his senses.

723
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,523
I'm sorry that I showed up.

724
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:40,613
Take the villa and live comfortably.
Both you and your mom.

725
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,285
Are you going to leave

726
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,204
like this?

727
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,086
After showing up and creating this mess,

728
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,089
you're just going to run away?

729
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:02,427
I'm angry.

730
01:02:03,594 --> 01:02:06,139
I'm angry that he showed up as he pleased.

731
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:08,766
But now that he wants to leave
as he pleases,

732
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,103
I'm livid.

733
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,112
It seems like

734
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,448
I've caught

735
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,242
Mom's midlife crisis.

736
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:31,581
You can't leave before you fix him.

737
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:33,708
- Who?
- Byeon Hyeon-jae!

738
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,712
- How will I do that?
- I'll send him to the third floor today.

739
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,715
Take responsibility and raise that punk.

740
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:48,431
Is that what you want from me?

741
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:50,391
Yes.

742
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,071
Even though you never wanted it,

743
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,076
you're a parent.

744
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,288
So take responsibility.

745
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:17,460
What do you mean by that?
I never wanted it?

746
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:34,519
Hide! Mom's coming.

747
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,814
Your mom?

748
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:15,142
By the way,

749
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:20,064
why are we hiding?

750
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,943
I don't know.

751
01:04:26,112 --> 01:04:29,657
But what do you think will happen
if she finds out

752
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,660
that we wrote
this pledge behind her back?

753
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:40,918
I think she'll kill us.

754
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:44,922
She'll be furious
that we placed a bet on her.

755
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,550
Exactly.

756
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:57,351
FIANCÉ SALON

757
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,499
Come out in five minutes.

758
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:37,516
You startled me.

759
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,684
Who were you with?

760
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,229
- I was alone.
- Really?

761
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:44,523
Why would I lie to you?

762
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:48,861
You snorted!

763
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,489
Hey, I told you, I was alone!

764
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:53,449
- Let go of me!
- Come here!

765
01:05:53,532 --> 01:05:54,367
Let go of me!

766
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,578
- Heave-ho!
- Let go of me!

767
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,539
- Put me down. Now!
- Hey.

768
01:06:02,249 --> 01:06:03,417
What's up with you?

769
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:06,754
You! What did you do in Thailand?

770
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:17,056
That bastard
who knocked up Jeong-in and ran off…

771
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:21,394
Byeon Moo-jin, was that you?

772
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:26,649
What on earth is going on
between you and Jeong-in?

773
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:30,194
Geum Ae-yeon.

774
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,072
Are you jealous?

775
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:38,244
- What?
- I asked you if you were jealous.

776
01:06:39,745 --> 01:06:41,747
Just answer my question!

777
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:48,421
I don't want to.

778
01:06:49,630 --> 01:06:51,841
- What?
- I said I don't want to.

779
01:08:04,538 --> 01:08:07,249
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

780
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,919
Why did you keep it a secret from me?

781
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,880
If you find out
what President Byeon did in Thailand…

782
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:14,715
Who exactly are you?

783
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,884
Call your landlord right now!

784
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,385
The landlord is here.

785
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:20,137
Did he beat people up? Was he a thug?

786
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,555
A gangster? Drugs?

787
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:23,599
Will you marry me again, then?

788
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:25,768
It has been a while
since I've seen you laugh.

789
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:26,977
I missed it.

790
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,855
Byeon Mi-rae, stop working overtime,
and get off work on time.

791
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,399
Ms. Byeon, how many hours
have you been awake?

792
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,151
Ms. Mi-rae!

793
01:08:34,235 --> 01:08:36,403
He keeps catching me
in vulnerable moments.

794
01:08:37,029 --> 01:08:39,198
This time, it's seriously dangerous!

795
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:44,036
