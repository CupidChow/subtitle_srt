00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,890
Do you remember

3
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,602
what you used to say to me the most?

4
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,147
"Don't do anything."

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,026
I ruined it again.

6
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,114
No, you didn't.

7
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,743
You didn't ruin it.

8
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,399
Let's go home.

9
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,111
Oh, right. Okay.

10
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,989
Sure. Let's go.

11
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,998
- There you are.
- What is it this time?

12
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,544
You have no idea.

13
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,754
All this time,

14
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,090
I just couldn't get you

15
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,427
out of my mind, Byeon Moo-jin.

16
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,181
I'm sick and tired

17
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,894
of feeling resentment and fear toward you.

18
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,607
I can't focus on my work because of you.

19
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:13,860
Is this a confession of love?

20
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,946
Can you please just tell me

21
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,782
how you made the money now?

22
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,457
Ms. Geum, are you really
not curious at all?

23
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,299
I never asked because it wasn't important,

24
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:38,676
not because I wasn't curious.

25
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,844
What?

26
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:48,686
But can you just tell us the truth now?

27
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,190
So everyone can sleep in peace.

28
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,619
Is everyone…

29
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,581
still at Gangnam Hof?

30
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:15,838
EPISODE 11
FOLLOWING THE JOURNEY OF MOO-JIN…

31
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,465
MI-RAE SNACK BAR

32
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:18,925
- It's the best!
- Hurry.

33
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,594
Ma'am, please give us
another serving of tteokbokki.

34
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,347
Okay. I'll give you two eggs for free.

35
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,265
Thank you.

36
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,058
The snack bar did very well.

37
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,143
Then…

38
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,688
How could you do this out of the blue?

39
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,773
The landlord doubled the rent.

40
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,567
Please try to understand
our situation, sir.

41
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,444
Try to understand my situation too.

42
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,293
I'm Wang Jae-mun, a team manager
from the development firm.

43
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,210
Hello.

44
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:57,547
As you can see, there are
apartments and schools.

45
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,882
The commercial area is fully formed.

46
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,259
FOR LEASE

47
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,512
- My wife runs a snack bar.
- I see.

48
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,431
I bet the landlord raised the rent

49
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:08,558
when the business began to flourish,
right?

50
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,394
- Yes.
- That's the problem with renting.

51
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,187
They're such bullies.

52
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,774
It's much better to purchase your own lot
and run your business there.

53
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:18,276
Don't you agree?

54
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,446
Well, I should go and get permission
from my wife first--

55
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,947
Of course.

56
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,325
Once you do that, contact me…

57
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,327
Oh, no.

58
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,621
This is the last lot on the first floor.

59
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,666
If you miss your chance now,
it'll get sold right away.

60
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,339
Even if I want to sign the contract,
I need the key money for the snack bar--

61
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:41,799
You can take out a loan for that.

62
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,053
There's a loan company we work with.

63
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,139
I'm sure the interest on the loan
will be cheaper than your rent.

64
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:49,974
Really?

65
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,686
Sir, it sounds like your wife must've
gone through a lot.

66
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,980
Why don't you give her a nice surprise?

67
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,275
Think about how happy she'll be.

68
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,321
This really is our last chance.

69
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,698
So don't cause trouble, okay?

70
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,492
Don't do anything.

71
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,578
If you want to do something,
make sure you consult with me first.

72
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,164
I should've listened to Ae-yeon.

73
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,461
OFFICE
REAL ESTATE

74
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,339
What is going on?

75
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,342
It was a pre-sale scam.

76
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,720
Then what about my down payment?

77
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,473
Right now, the interest is
twice the principal.

78
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,225
Didn't you know how private loans work?

79
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,935
I'll pay back the money!

80
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,687
You can't pay it back.
Hand over the house and snack bar.

81
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,859
That's how you screwed up your business.

82
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,198
I thought I'd be able
to get the money back

83
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,036
if I found that bastard at all costs.

84
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,375
Is there any news

85
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,128
on Wang Jae-mun's whereabouts?

86
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:04,006
Wang Jae-mun, that bastard, fled abroad.

87
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,801
- Where abroad?
- Thailand.

88
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,638
I don't think
he'll ever come back to Korea.

89
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:14,308
Let's just give up now.

90
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,356
So many families got ruined
because of that bastard.

91
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:23,317
My family and Ae-yeon's snack bar
got ruined

92
00:07:23,818 --> 00:07:24,652
because of me.

93
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,532
I wanted to find him no matter what
to get back what we'd lost.

94
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,621
How were you going to find him
with just his name?

95
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,749
You know how reckless I am.

96
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,089
All I had left was
my body and time anyway.

97
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,679
Khun Mooy, you can walk in those
better than me now.

98
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,140
Do you want to do a show with me?

99
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,058
Be quiet.

100
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,899
Stockings, on the house.

101
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,775
- Great!
- Great!

102
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,360
- You're so nice.
- You're so nice.

103
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,320
- The best!
- The best!

104
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,071
Thank you.

105
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,240
I held out

106
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,202
until that bastard
finally showed up before my eyes.

107
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,330
I'm Wang Jae-mun, a team manager
from the development firm.

108
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:18,915
That bastard.

109
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,958
He's the owner of the bar we work at.

110
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:32,011
He took over the bar recently.

111
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,805
I heard he had his own business in Korea.

112
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:37,433
Everyone says he's filthy rich!

113
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,476
It's a tip.

114
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:40,520
Let's go!

115
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,238
I only had one chance.
I had to succeed no matter what.

116
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,414
Who are you?

117
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,584
There you are, Khun Mooy.

118
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,671
He's my partner
who'll perform with me today.

119
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,901
Darn it.

120
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,065
Who's there?

121
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,238
Stop right there!

122
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,381
Darn it.

123
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,470
Over there.

124
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,312
Who is he?

125
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,988
Hey, get him!

126
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,324
- No, I'll come with you.
- Darn it.

127
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,038
Hey, your heel!

128
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,356
Who the hell are you?

129
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,609
I'm the man you swindled ten years ago.

130
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,696
- What?
- Wang Jae-mun, it's over for you.

131
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,411
What are you going to do?
Hand me over to the police?

132
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,370
I have bad news.

133
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,248
Even if I end up in jail here,
I'll get out in no time.

134
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,416
I knew that'd happen,

135
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,920
so I brought someone who could punish you.

136
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:16,962
Who?

137
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,114
Excuse me.

138
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,876
I also flew over to Thailand
to catch Wang Jae-mun

139
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,295
because he conned me.

140
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,215
How much money did you lose?

141
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,801
About…

142
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,595
four billion won.

143
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,098
- Excuse me?
- It was my daughter, not me.

144
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,934
It was a marriage scam.

145
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,770
He ran off on the day of the wedding.

146
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:16,981
I see.

147
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:20,734
To be honest, that money isn't
a big deal to me.

148
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,695
The problem is my daughter.

149
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,534
She feels so betrayed that she hasn't been
able to eat or sleep for months.

150
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,872
So what do you want from me?

151
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:37,835
Reward good and punish evil.

152
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,463
Ms. Seo, you should
get your money back first.

153
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,216
I just need this guy.

154
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,051
You can have my money.

155
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,264
It's okay. I just need to get back
what I'd lost.

156
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,226
Then let me buy this bastard from you

157
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,270
for four billion won.

158
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,148
Why are you doing this?

159
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,861
You said your family kicked you out
because of the money.

160
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,779
For goodness' sake.

161
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:08,616
Well, the truth is…

162
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:12,161
I'm in the same boat.

163
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,790
Why do you think
my daughter fell for such a man?

164
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:20,502
It's because I didn't do a proper job
as a parent.

165
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,338
I was so busy making money

166
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,299
that I left her alone
and failed to give her love.

167
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,302
That's why she fell
for a piece of garbage like him.

168
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,556
So Mr. Byeon Moo-jin, go back to Korea

169
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,892
and do a proper job as a parent.

170
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,895
I'm sure you can tell that I'm rich.

171
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:40,898
So just take the money.

172
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:44,026
Think of it as a present from me

173
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,113
for a junior parent
who has more chances than me.

174
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,162
Also,

175
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,290
I'm a die-hard fan

176
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,876
of Dragons.

177
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,920
The 1994 winner of
Rookie of the Year Award,

178
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,255
Byeon Moo-jin!

179
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,144
What a piece of garbage.

180
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,243
Mr. Byeon, what's the money you sent me?

181
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,121
Did you really catch Wang Jae-mun?

182
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,958
Even the police gave up a long time ago.
How did you catch him?

183
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,045
Mr. Byeon! Byeon Moo-jin!

184
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,882
You're our hero!

185
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,311
That was why

186
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,648
I couldn't tell you

187
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,110
when you asked me how I earned money.

188
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,654
I didn't earn it.

189
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:14,324
It practically dropped from the sky.

190
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,045
I ruined the party, so put it on my card.

191
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,129
What?

192
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:28,922
Okay.

193
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,073
He had my attention
when he talked about getting conned.

194
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,658
The latter part was too much of a movie.

195
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:02,081
I didn't know
President Byeon was such a big talker.

196
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:06,335
But his eyes looked like
he was telling the truth.

197
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,294
Maybe not.

198
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,340
Why would my dad make up such a story?

199
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,592
Right?

200
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:19,598
We should go home too.

201
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,801
Let's just believe him
and not ask any more questions about it.

202
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,718
Okay?

203
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:58,470
Okay.

204
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,767
By the way, isn't Father so modest?

205
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,271
Had it been me, I would've told
the tale of my heroic deed

206
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,565
as soon as I came back to Yongdong-dong.

207
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,609
He really is Byeon-sby.

208
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,571
Go upstairs and sleep.

209
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:20,784
Good night.

210
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,352
So many families got ruined
because of that bastard.

211
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,980
My family and Ae-yeon's snack bar
got ruined…

212
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,194
because of me.

213
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,198
I wanted to find him no matter what…

214
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,162
to get back what we'd lost.

215
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:15,589
LANDLORD

216
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,895
I can feel it

217
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:16,650
What was that, a talent show?

218
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,501
Gosh, there must be
something wrong with me.

219
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,134
What is it?

220
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,219
We're ordering jjajangmyeon. Want to join?

221
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,513
Yes, I'll be right there.

222
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,325
Oh, my. Are you okay?

223
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,995
If you're angry, just say so.
Why try to cut off my wrist?

224
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:11,955
Oh, no. Let me see.

225
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,792
Why are you avoiding me?

226
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,880
What do you think?

227
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,632
I'm just embarrassed.

228
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,177
About what? The kiss?

229
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,599
Be quiet.

230
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,188
You broke the seal.

231
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,274
I'm going to do it
whenever I feel like it.

232
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,826
It isn't up to you.

233
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,920
What do you want?

234
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,379
Well…

235
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,590
This one.

236
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,176
And coffee.

237
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,763
You'll have coffee at work.

238
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,598
You should drink milk in the morning.

239
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,225
I need caffeine in the morning.

240
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,810
You'll get holes in your stomach.

241
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,728
You're ridiculous.

242
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,522
- This is on me.
- This is on me.

243
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,023
- Why? I'll treat you.
- I'll treat you.

244
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,483
- Why?
- Let me pay.

245
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,401
- Stop it.
- Let me pay.

246
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,070
- You always pay.
- No.

247
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,405
- Tomorrow. Stop.
- Let me do it.

248
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,573
What are you guys doing?

249
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,505
When your mentor offers to pay,
just say, "Thank you," Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong.

250
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,549
Okay, Ms. Byeon.

251
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:48,009
What would you like? It's on me.

252
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,344
Really?

253
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:51,638
Then I'll have the same one.

254
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,223
Okay.

255
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,108
- It's good.
- Right?

256
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,068
The egg is really soft.

257
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,696
How did they make this?

258
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:08,947
It's so good.

259
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:11,825
Can you make it?

260
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:14,619
No. Can you make it?

261
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,829
Probably not.

262
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,746
By the way,

263
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,000
you two have become quite close.

264
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,547
I saw you two laughing together earlier.

265
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,176
We always laugh
when Mr. Park makes jokes too.

266
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,636
Right. You have a point.

267
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:35,682
Listen. If Ms. Byeon gives you
a hard time,

268
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,933
come to me.

269
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,686
We can bad-mouth her together.

270
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,522
- Okay.
- Jeez.

271
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:46,943
Mr. Tae-pyeong, where do you live?

272
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,696
- I live nearby.
- I see.

273
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,079
- You know what it is.
- Oh, Ae-yeon!

274
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,539
- Hey.
- You're here.

275
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:04,085
Wow, it looks so delicious.

276
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,046
My goodness.

277
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,050
- Right. An Jeong-in.
- Yes?

278
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:12,469
Why were you
with Moo-jin's friend yesterday?

279
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,095
What's going on?

280
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,681
Isn't it obvious? We're seeing each other.

281
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:18,892
You're seeing him?

282
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,437
No way. Who cares
if he's a tax accountant?

283
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,482
It seemed like he's flat broke now
thanks to the scam.

284
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,568
I earn enough money to make a living.

285
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,403
I'll take care of myself.

286
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,032
Does Mr. Lee feel relieved now?

287
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,785
Don't even get me started.

288
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,704
His obsession with President Byeon

289
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,706
just doesn't end.

290
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:45,752
His confession to Byeon Moo-jin yesterday
was quite desperate.

291
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,381
By the way, aren't you going to
get back together with President Byeon?

292
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,758
What?

293
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,593
How should I put it?

294
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,096
You two are like in between lovers
and a married couple.

295
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,723
It seems like
you two are testing the waters.

296
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,726
- "Testing the waters"?
- I'm against remarriage.

297
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,978
Why would she do that?

298
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:07,357
It's nice to see them
being romantic with each other.

299
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,234
That's true, but…

300
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:13,238
I don't want her to regret it later.

301
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:17,826
"Perhaps I should've tried to live
with him once more when I was younger."

302
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,577
- You have a point.
- Right?

303
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:22,747
President Byeon bought this villa

304
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,834
in order to live with Ae-yeon again.

305
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,043
That's right.

306
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:31,131
Back in the day, you guys fought
because it was hard to make a living.

307
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,842
But things might be different this time.

308
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,804
I'll take care of myself.

309
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,556
When did I say it like that?

310
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:40,849
You did.

311
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,314
- Hey. Wipe your mouth, will you?
- I've been pigging out lately.

312
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,276
CHIEF TAX ACCOUNTANT
OH JAE-GEOL

313
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,159
What brings you here?
I need to go out soon.

314
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,746
It's a delivery.

315
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:09,919
Is it for me?

316
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:22,640
Why are you here?

317
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,772
Because I missed you.

318
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:37,489
President Kim's daughter
won't cause more problems.

319
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,618
She asked me to tell you that
she's sorry for the misunderstanding.

320
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,583
Thanks for clearing up
the misunderstanding for me.

321
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,671
I was…

322
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,134
jealous.

323
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,307
That our situations
got switched overnight…

324
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,268
It was hard to accept.

325
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,940
I could deal with going bankrupt.

326
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,734
But by my side…

327
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,197
you'd become so successful.

328
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,201
It ruined me more.

329
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,080
That said…

330
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:29,833
Let's never…

331
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,754
see each other again, Moo-jin.

332
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,344
No.

333
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,888
I feel uncomfortable.

334
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,306
When I went bankrupt,

335
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,977
you were the only friend
who answered my calls

336
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,520
and bought me meals.

337
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,524
I was being a hypocrite.

338
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,401
To feel superior to you.

339
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,030
Back then,

340
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,825
I even needed such hypocrisy.

341
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,245
No matter how you felt about it,

342
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,539
I was so grateful to you.

343
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,046
Besides,

344
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,676
I'll end up drinking alone all my life
without you.

345
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,977
Gosh. What did you order? Let's share it.

346
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,271
Order your own food.

347
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,107
- You said you needed to leave.
- Come on.

348
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,276
Shall we order tangsuyuk?

349
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,903
Hurry up and order it. It's on me.

350
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,792
Other teams were using all of the plates,
so I bought one at the mart.

351
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,794
Oh, thank you.

352
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,421
- We just need to set it up now, so rest.
- Okay.

353
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,382
Sorry, I should've taken care of it.

354
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,468
No. It's okay.

355
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,014
It's hectic, right?

356
00:30:08,097 --> 00:30:11,768
It's always like a war
when we hold a new product evaluation.

357
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,355
- Did you wash the plate?
- Yes.

358
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,443
Mr. Tae-pyeong,
you ride a bicycle to work, right?

359
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,780
Yes, it's the fastest.

360
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,157
I love riding my bike too.

361
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,910
I see. Where do you usually go?

362
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,788
On weekends, I go to the Han River Parks.

363
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,290
Sometimes, I go all the way to Yangpyeong.

364
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,125
That's right!

365
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:39,629
How about we go
for a ride together sometime?

366
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,464
Like a workplace social club.

367
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,846
Sorry, I'm busy on weekends.

368
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,181
What do you do on weekends?

369
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,976
I go out with my girlfriend.

370
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,987
Which group's daughter is she?
Dolmuone? PJ?

371
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,864
Is it like an arranged marriage?

372
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:06,906
Excuse me?

373
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,742
Shin Na-ra, are you done resting?
Let's move these.

374
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,704
Are you ready?

375
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:13,997
Yes, Ms. Lee.

376
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,041
Okay. You make a pitch
at the evaluation, Ms. Byeon.

377
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:20,461
- Me?
- This product was your idea.

378
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,423
And you were in charge
of the development too. Give it a go.

379
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,092
Let's go.

380
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,010
Okay.

381
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:37,562
2024 FOOD AND BEVERAGE DIVISION
INTERNAL NEW PRODUCT EVALUATION

382
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,024
SEAFOOD TEAM

383
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,442
FROZEN FOOD TEAM

384
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,237
Hey.

385
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,197
It looks like she'll make a pitch.

386
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:52,035
Look at that. She treats her manager
like her assistant.

387
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,912
Unbelievable.

388
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,830
Please finish setting up now.

389
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:06,633
BROILED BONELESS CHICKEN FEET

390
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:10,178
All of you must've worked very hard
to prepare all this.

391
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,013
- Shall we begin?
- Mr. Nam is here.

392
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,310
I heard about the new product evaluation.

393
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,479
- Yes, sir.
- Would it be okay to join you?

394
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,147
Of course. Please go ahead.

395
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:24,984
A sandwich?

396
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,279
Yes. The sandwiches sold
at a major entertainment agency's canteen

397
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,448
were popular among K-pop idol fans.

398
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,575
So we developed a product based on that.

399
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:38,414
- People will go on about how dry it is.
- Pardon?

400
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:41,125
You know that the bakery team has
the lowest sales, right?

401
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:44,128
JPLUS used to be known
for its bakery product.

402
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,006
But everyone talks about
our frozen food these days.

403
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:50,385
Make sure to develop
a good product this time.

404
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,013
Here…

405
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,516
Oh, Ms. Byeon.

406
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:03,606
It looks like the frozen food team
prepared chicken feet.

407
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,030
- Is it the tteokbokki sauce?
- Yes.

408
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:14,659
Many people have spicy chicken feet
as a beer snack or a late-night snack.

409
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,787
To increase its mass appeal,
I tested it out using various recipes

410
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:21,082
and found that using tteokbokki sauce
gave it a nice and clean taste.

411
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,503
The sauce goes very nicely with it.

412
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:30,216
What are your sales goals?

413
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,386
It's our goal to sell 30 packages a day
at 130 stores.

414
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,471
Then the monthly sales will be
500 million won.

415
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,640
- How will you promote it?
- On weekends, we plan to do

416
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,893
free sample events and give out flyers
at the point of purchase.

417
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:43,813
We're securing the endcaps
at the major stores for display.

418
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,568
By the way, why is a supervisor
making a pitch for this team?

419
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:53,614
Ms. Byeon's been in charge of this product
since the ideation stage,

420
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,867
so I made her do it
since she'd do it better than me.

421
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,620
Yes. Ms. Byeon increases
the sales of the frozen food team.

422
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,955
That's right.

423
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,707
Well done.

424
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,296
For how many years
have you been with the company?

425
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,090
I'm on my fourth year.

426
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,176
Keep it up.

427
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,055
Is the promotion evaluation next month?

428
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,306
Yes, sir.

429
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,393
Have a good day, sir.

430
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:32,320
It passed the evaluation today,
so we must launch the product next month.

431
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,614
I told you that
we can't meet that deadline.

432
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,575
It's giving me a headache
as we have to modify the production lines.

433
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,079
Of course, I know
that it's troublesome for you.

434
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,581
But it can be done, right?

435
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,458
Please do your best to meet the deadline.

436
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,836
We'll go help out at the factory then.

437
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:52,673
Whatever. I can't meet that date,
so adjust the schedule.

438
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,258
No, sir!

439
00:34:58,971 --> 00:34:59,889
Did he say no?

440
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,103
Of course. Nothing is easy.

441
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,485
We'll have to go to the sauce factory
and beg soon, so prepare yourself.

442
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,529
We must meet the launch date.

443
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,114
Okay, Ms. Byeon.

444
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,952
Right.

445
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,996
Why did you do that earlier?

446
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,500
Even people from other teams
were listening with their ears pricked up.

447
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:32,797
I felt like she'd stop
if I told her that I had a girlfriend.

448
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,013
What are we doing this weekend?

449
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,225
Do you want to go cycling?

450
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,685
It's too cold for that.

451
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,646
Let's do that in spring.

452
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,692
Do you want to come over to my place?

453
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,033
I'd like that.

454
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:03,369
Okay.

455
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,788
Let's wrap up and get off work.

456
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,342
Your face is really red right now.

457
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,099
I've been busted.

458
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,815
Stop it.

459
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,069
Your face turned red again, Ms. Byeon.

460
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,742
Room service is here.

461
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,535
Ta-da.

462
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,340
It's good.

463
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:59,967
- Did you really make it yourself?
- Yes.

464
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,052
I'm impressed.

465
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:04,722
Back in the day, you couldn't even
fry an egg by yourself.

466
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,266
Hey, I've come a long way.

467
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,685
I've been living alone for years now.

468
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,066
Go ahead and eat.

469
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,194
MS. CHOI YU-RI OF HOME SHOPPING

470
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,405
Hello, Ms. Choi.

471
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:25,117
Ms. Ae-yeon, you did so well
on TV the last time

472
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,162
that other teams want to hire you.

473
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,289
Really?

474
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,125
So they're all asking
for your model portfolio.

475
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,836
Portfolio?

476
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,880
Not my resume?

477
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,883
Photos?

478
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,469
I don't have any.

479
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,347
Hold on.

480
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,267
Hello. She'll send it to you
before the end of the day.

481
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,810
Okay.

482
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,939
- Let's go.
- What?

483
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,900
Hey, it's here. Look here and smile.

484
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,404
Well done. This time, smile naturally.

485
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,155
Show your teeth a bit.

486
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,448
There you go.

487
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,035
- Now, turn your head like this.
- Like this?

488
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,996
- Yes. Show your jawline.
- Like this?

489
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,914
- There you go. We got it, right?
- Yes.

490
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,583
- We got it.
- Really?

491
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:17,503
- Did we get good shots?
- Yes. Please come after 30 minutes.

492
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:20,715
Okay. Please take care
of the final touches.

493
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,258
She'll be on TV--

494
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,345
Please make it look good, sir.

495
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:28,431
Your husband must be your manager.

496
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,975
You guys still look like newlyweds.
It's so nice.

497
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,313
We'll be back in 30 minutes.

498
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:36,522
Okay.

499
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,566
All right.

500
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,494
Do you want to try it?

501
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,206
Forget it.

502
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,791
Come on. It's been so long.

503
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:56,751
I'm good.

504
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,294
Here comes the ball!

505
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,909
My goodness.

506
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,744
You still got it.

507
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,997
You're the former cleanup hitter
of the Dragons indeed.

508
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,499
What are you talking about?

509
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,502
I'm reminded of the old days.

510
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:49,428
When we were 20. I told you
I'd go out with you if you hit a home run.

511
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:52,848
That day,

512
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,977
I was on pins and needles

513
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,439
while running around with your bat.

514
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,111
I was worried you might
fail to hit a home run.

515
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,953
Back then, I swung my bat
as if my life depended on it.

516
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:16,872
Byeon Moo-jin.

517
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,001
Is there anything you want to do?

518
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,212
Like I said that day,

519
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,673
I'm doing everything
I wanted to do with you.

520
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,883
Not those things.

521
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,846
Are you going to follow me around
and be my manager forever?

522
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,774
SEOUL CHILDREN'S BASEBALL CLASS

523
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,485
Coach Park ran it until he passed away.

524
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,739
They're looking for an instructor
who'll take Coach Park's place.

525
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,075
Why don't you apply for it?

526
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,293
How will I do that?
I quit baseball a long time ago.

527
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:03,836
I'm your best student.

528
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,922
I'm called
Yongdong-dong's Lee Seung-yuop here.

529
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,133
And you may own a building,

530
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,051
but you're practically jobless.

531
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,929
You could get dementia early
if you don't work at all.

532
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,141
Hey. The photos must be ready. Let's go.

533
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,187
Let's find out what you really want.

534
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,148
Except for being
Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae's dad

535
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,483
and my husband,

536
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,651
think of what you want to do.

537
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,821
Something you

538
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,782
haven't been able to do.

539
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,662
Like me,

540
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,581
this is the eighth inning of your life.

541
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,588
Stop being so focused on the family

542
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,175
and think about Byeon Moo-jin's life.

543
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,732
Father, welcome back.

544
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:09,527
Hey.

545
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,571
Please have a seat.
I'll make a business report.

546
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:18,953
We live in an age
where there are ten million pets.

547
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,956
There are already
numerous pet-related businesses.

548
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,543
- Right.
- Kindergartens for pets

549
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:28,295
even go on field trips.

550
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,089
Here's the idea I've come up with.

551
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,049
WOOF-KAGE

552
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:35,844
It's an international tour package
you can go on with your pet!

553
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:41,100
Pet owners want to be with their pets
no matter where they go.

554
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,436
However, an overseas trip has
many limitations.

555
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,688
Thus,

556
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,942
I'll book flights, hotels,
tourist attractions, and restaurants

557
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,861
that can accommodate pets.

558
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,574
I designed such a tour package business.

559
00:42:56,657 --> 00:43:00,411
But it'll take a lot of work
to look up information and make bookings.

560
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,998
I have many successful seniors
at the Entrepreneurship Club.

561
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:08,335
I already have a travel agency
I can work with.

562
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,336
Also,

563
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:14,174
look up "Woof-kage" on the app store
right now.

564
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,470
"Woof-kage."

565
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,472
WOOF-KAGE

566
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
It's well-made.

567
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,060
This is interesting. Hotels and flights.

568
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,562
What? This…

569
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:30,232
It's the beta version,
so it can be a bit slow.

570
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,027
But it won't happen
after the official release.

571
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,236
Is that so?

572
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,990
You prepared a lot for this.

573
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:40,159
I'm proud of you. Well done.

574
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:43,662
It wasn't a waste of one million won.

575
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,456
Well done.

576
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,333
Father.

577
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:49,918
All right.

578
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,381
I got you enrolled.
Attend the academy class starting Monday.

579
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,382
Father.

580
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,551
I heard it was helpful for finding a job.

581
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,804
But if you need to take other classes,
just let me know.

582
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,058
- I don't want this.
- Byeon Hyeon-jae.

583
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,976
Just do as I say.

584
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,485
Hold on.

585
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:21,033
You must've thought that I'd fail
even before you saw the results

586
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,661
and enrolled me in the academy.

587
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,498
- Hyeon-jae.
- All right.

588
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,709
I won't talk about business anymore.

589
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,586
- Hyeon-jae, listen--
- Forget it.

590
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,465
You'll only pretend
to listen to me anyway.

591
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,930
That's how the whole family treats me.

592
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:46,934
Hyeon-jae.

593
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,712
This is so annoying.

594
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:20,968
I can't believe I have nowhere to go
at times like this.

595
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,434
FATHER

596
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,941
Father is just like the others.

597
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,386
My friend sent me a post
from a workers' community late at night.

598
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,304
HAK-SEUNG:

599
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,639
I think it's about you and Ms. Mi-rae.

600
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:13,812
At my company, the son of the CEO
and a low-level employee

601
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,939
are dating rather openly.

602
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,365
The CEO's son wasn't even an employee.

603
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,326
He worked as a security guard at a mart.

604
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,536
The female supervisor found out about it

605
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,455
and started dating him before he joined.

606
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:34,416
She made a move on him
since he was the CEO's son.

607
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,294
I don't know how she coaxed the CEO.

608
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,087
The CEO made her his mentor

609
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:43,008
and began coddling her
before other employees.

610
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,219
Recently, there was
a team leaders' meeting

611
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,762
and that supervisor participated.

612
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,181
She might become a team leader next month

613
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,767
and marry the CEO's son next year.

614
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:04,905
They say that one rotten apple
spoils the barrel.

615
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,700
Because of that woman,
the company system became a mess.

616
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,328
Should I keep working
at such a lousy company?

617
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,474
Ms. Byeon, see me for a second.

618
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:34,935
Yes, sir.

619
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,496
Is it true?

620
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,585
Did you know that Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong was
the CEO's son?

621
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,590
Yes.

622
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,511
Was that why Mr. Nam sent him to our team
and made you his mentor?

623
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:12,848
Yes.

624
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,393
And are you two dating?

625
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:21,898
Yes.

626
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:27,779
Okay.

627
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,700
You have a meeting with the sauce factory.
You should get going.

628
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:34,953
Yes, sir.

629
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,900
- I'm stepping out for a meeting.
- Okay.

630
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,622
I hear Mi-rae is seeing the CEO's son.

631
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:21,291
The CEO's son?

632
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:23,919
What are you talking about?

633
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,755
You know
that tall, handsome security guard

634
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:28,590
with big eyes, right?

635
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,425
He's the CEO's son.

636
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:31,885
He is?

637
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,430
What? You didn't know at all?

638
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:39,434
Does everyone at JPLUS
know about this now?

639
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:42,312
Does that really matter right now?

640
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,773
My goodness.

641
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,442
You might become in-laws with the CEO.

642
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:50,570
You must've saved the world
in your last life.

643
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:56,410
I know that it's a tight schedule

644
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,870
since you need to change
the production lines.

645
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:01,164
Then why did you come up
with this schedule?

646
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,835
Forget it. I can't do it. Sue me.

647
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,754
Sir.

648
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:21,017
He didn't know the news. I'm sorry.

649
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,645
What? What do you mean?

650
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,772
I was just joking when I said, "Sue me."

651
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,109
We'll do everything to meet the date.

652
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:34,948
So, when will be the wedding?

653
00:50:36,032 --> 00:50:37,534
You'll invite me, right?

654
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,724
I think it's my company.
Ms. B from frozen food team, right?

655
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,893
She's never missed the overtime bonus
and now, the CEO's son.

656
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,478
She's always been messy with men.

657
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,688
Her ex-boyfriend made a scene
at the company.

658
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,565
She was known for pushing herself forward.

659
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,067
- She's so ambitious.
- They're coddling her already.

660
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,819
I guess an employee made a big break.

661
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:23,955
You were surprised too, right?

662
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:29,795
To be honest, I feel like
I made a fool of myself.

663
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,672
She saw me hit on Mr. Tae-pyeong.

664
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,842
There's something else that worries me.

665
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:41,097
If Ms. Byeon gets promoted instead of me,
I'll feel uncomfortable around her.

666
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,808
You probably had no idea either.

667
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,435
Right. I had no idea.

668
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:49,189
But I would've kept quiet too.

669
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:53,902
No matter how close you get,
there's a line between colleagues.

670
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,781
Anyway, I wonder
how much of the post is true.

671
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,534
I can't ask Ms. Byeon.

672
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,952
Don't ask her.

673
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,162
Right now, I'd say
silence is the best answer.

674
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,508
Welcome.

675
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:18,885
Sit where you want…

676
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,931
Ms. Mi-rae.

677
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,272
I fell asleep.

678
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,943
What? You came.

679
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:36,319
How did you know?

680
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:39,155
You sent me your location.

681
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,658
Did I?

682
00:52:43,243 --> 00:52:45,912
I see.

683
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,087
Let's go.

684
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:56,298
Let's go. Get up.

685
00:52:56,381 --> 00:52:58,466
Let's go. Be careful.

686
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,222
- We're ready to pay.
- Are you leaving?

687
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:06,182
But who are you?

688
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:07,642
Oh.

689
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,979
He's my boyfriend.

690
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:14,649
He's handsome, right?

691
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,942
I see.

692
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,112
He's so handsome.

693
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:21,865
He's also generous.

694
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,200
He has broad shoulders

695
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,620
and a warm back.

696
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:28,663
Is that so?

697
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,712
He knows me so well.

698
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:42,135
He even knows some things about me
that I didn't know about.

699
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:45,722
That's why

700
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:51,019
I like him a lot.

701
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,817
Careful.

702
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,280
Ms. Mi-rae?

703
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,919
What's going on?

704
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:19,130
What do you think?

705
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,841
You're going home.

706
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:28,181
It has been a while
since I got on the back

707
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:30,058
of Mr. Handsome Back from JPLUS.

708
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:32,769
Do you remember?

709
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,480
You passed out then.

710
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,483
Of course, I remember.

711
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:44,531
Your back was broad, warm, and hard.

712
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,620
I even wanted to buy a stone bed
that resembled you.

713
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:57,168
I'm sorry.

714
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,841
Don't be sorry.

715
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,218
I'm okay.

716
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:09,347
I just need to hold out.

717
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,475
If I hang in there…

718
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,605
it'll all blow over
before we even know it.

719
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,757
I'm trying to find out who made the post.

720
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,550
What's the point?

721
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:48,511
Everyone has already read it.

722
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:52,849
Is Ms. Byeon having a hard time?

723
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:57,395
You knew I had feelings
for Ms. Mi-rae, right?

724
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:03,735
She was the reason
I decided to join the company.

725
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,196
I wanted to stop feeling so lost
like you said.

726
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:07,363
Like Ms. Mi-rae,

727
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,659
I wanted to do things properly.

728
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:14,871
Yes. I know that.

729
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,206
But because of me,

730
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:20,293
all of her hard work is being devalued.

731
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,172
This is wrong.

732
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,299
Devalued, my foot.

733
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,385
I know the truth, so it doesn't matter.

734
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,304
You were the CEO from the start.

735
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:34,641
So, nothing matters to you,
and you know nothing.

736
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,019
Had you cherished Ms. Mi-rae
as your employee,

737
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,813
you wouldn't have made her my mentor

738
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,900
to make my relationship with her obvious
in front of everyone.

739
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,363
Are you disappointed in me?

740
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:50,907
No.

741
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,410
I'm disappointed in myself.

742
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,290
I should've been more careful
not to cause Ms. Mi-rae any trouble.

743
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,710
I was too inconsiderate.

744
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:08,925
Nam Tae-pyeong.

745
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:12,804
I'll get going.

746
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,325
Ms. Na-ra.

747
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:35,827
Yes?

748
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:38,663
When Mr. Tae-pyeong comes,

749
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,083
can you go to the mart
and put up these flyers with him?

750
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,920
I'll go and do it now.

751
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,215
Or shall we do it together?

752
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,177
It's okay.

753
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,345
I'll go and take care of it quickly.

754
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,202
Listen, everyone.
We have team dinner today.

755
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:19,579
Even if you have other plans,
make sure to attend.

756
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,706
Mr. Tae-pyeong, you too.

757
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,834
Ms. Byeon, you too. Okay?

758
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,004
You heard it, right?

759
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,131
That girl on the frozen food team.

760
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:35,595
She's unbelievable. How did she
think of seducing the CEO's son?

761
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,430
She's something else.

762
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,517
I ran into her
when I visited the marketing team.

763
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,394
She shamelessly said hello
as if nothing had happened.

764
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:46,105
What should I do from now on?

765
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:49,108
- Should I get on her good side?
- I think so.

766
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,362
Judging by the way
the CEO coddles her, it's game over.

767
00:58:52,445 --> 00:58:54,531
- Gosh.
- She'll be his daughter-in-law soon.

768
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,867
Coming through.

769
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,181
JPLUS' SUPERVISOR BYEON MI-RAE

770
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,855
What's wrong?

771
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:34,779
What is it? Was there
a crazy customer again?

772
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,407
No.

773
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,703
It's about Mi-rae.

774
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,539
Mi-rae?

775
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,014
How about a toast first
to lift up our team's spirit?

776
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,850
Okay. Here.

777
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:06,519
Cheers.

778
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:17,196
You know,
ever since Mr. Tae-pyeong joined our team,

779
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,949
I've felt like
I was walking on thin ice, honestly.

780
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,618
That alone was a lot to handle,

781
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,703
but now that he and Ms. Byeon are dating,

782
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,163
I feel even more uncomfortable.

783
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,336
But here's the thing.

784
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:35,048
If I feel like this,
how would the two of them feel right now?

785
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:40,428
We're strangers with different last names,

786
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:44,515
but we're like a family
who work for the same company.

787
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,643
You know that the post

788
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,687
and the rumors going around these days
are not true.

789
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:52,565
We've seen how much effort
Ms. Byeon put into her work

790
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,233
all these years.

791
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:58,446
Thus,

792
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:03,868
let's embrace, defend, comfort,
and support each other from now on.

793
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:06,579
This is a boomer manager's order.

794
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:10,124
If you don't do as I say,
I'll be very sad.

795
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,548
Whether or not it's a false rumor,

796
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,551
I should've explained first.

797
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,346
But I had no chance to do that.

798
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,600
For not telling you sooner

799
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:32,188
and making other employees
talk about our team in a bad way,

800
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,857
I'm truly sorry.

801
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:39,904
I'm sorry, Ms. Byeon.

802
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,451
As a senior, I should've stepped up
and defended you first.

803
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,577
Same here.

804
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:53,668
I was just embarrassed of how I'd been
hitting on Mr. Tae-pyeong all this time.

805
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,545
Now, I understand.

806
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,673
I was being sensitive
since the promotion season was coming up.

807
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:02,009
I should've sided with you
and defended you first as a colleague.

808
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,553
I'm sorry.

809
01:02:10,518 --> 01:02:11,519
To be honest,

810
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,231
I wasn't okay.

811
01:02:17,859 --> 01:02:19,569
But I'm really okay now.

812
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,238
I'll do better

813
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:26,367
and put an end to the false rumors
with my good work and skills.

814
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,874
I'm truly sorry
for causing you inconvenience.

815
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,420
I'm sorry.

816
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,756
- Come on. Sit down.
- Sit down.

817
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,924
All right.

818
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,510
Shall we eat everything and make up?

819
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:48,973
If there's a single piece of meat
remaining, you can't go home.

820
01:02:49,056 --> 01:02:50,433
Let's eat, drink, and get drunk!

821
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:53,686
- Okay! Let's eat.
- Let's eat! I'll grill the meat.

822
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,772
- Okay. Grill the meat.
- Let's eat.

823
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:03,946
Mr. Park was quite cool today, right?

824
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,199
You were cooler.

825
01:03:07,241 --> 01:03:08,451
Me? I didn't even do anything.

826
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,369
Seriously, you were cooler.

827
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,789
- What?
- Seriously.

828
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:13,998
What's wrong with you?

829
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:30,306
Wait in the car.

830
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:38,773
Mr. Nam.

831
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:41,359
I know that it's bad manners,
but I came anyway.

832
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,529
Had I called you to my office,
someone would've seen it.

833
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:47,782
I'm sorry, Ms. Byeon.

834
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,576
I only thought about myself
and didn't look ahead.

835
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:51,619
I was careless.

836
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:53,746
No, sir.

837
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:57,041
I thought about it all day today.

838
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,961
Since it happened because of me,

839
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:02,922
I should clean up this mess.

840
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:10,805
Let's turn the rumor into a truth.

841
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,975
Thus, I'm thinking of accepting you

842
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,143
as a member of my family in the future.

843
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,353
- Excuse me?
- Father!

844
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:20,606
Who are you to decide?

845
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:24,652
Father.

846
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,656
"Father"?

847
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:31,200
Oh, he must be Ms. Byeon's father.

848
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,496
Hello, I'm Nam Chi-yeol,
Tae-pyeong's father

849
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,832
and the CEO of Ms. Byeon's company.

850
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,589
I refuse to say hello.

851
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,511
I'll visit you tomorrow, sir.

852
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:52,221
Let's go inside.

853
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,599
How could you let this happen?

854
01:04:58,019 --> 01:04:59,437
I'm sorry, Father.

855
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,314
- It's my fault.
- Of course it is.

856
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:06,360
You must've acted
in a ridiculously obvious manner

857
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:08,988
to get Mi-rae involved
in such a nonsensical rumor.

858
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,323
Don't you think so?

859
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:17,330
Are you talking to me?

860
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:20,625
Let's go inside. Now!

861
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,959
You know,

862
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:25,796
I've kept quiet
because I had no right to oppose, but…

863
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:28,716
Taekwondo boy, you punk.

864
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,677
You have no right to date Mi-rae.

865
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,055
What are you saying?

866
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:38,267
Wait a second.
Who are you to call my son "punk"?

867
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,150
What's wrong with Tae-pyeong?

868
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,235
Father.

869
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,529
And why does Mi-rae have to

870
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,990
put up with such rumors
because of your family?

871
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:54,617
She could do a lot better than him!

872
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,286
You don't know what you're talking about.

873
01:05:57,370 --> 01:06:00,206
Tae-pyeong's talent is overshadowed
by his family,

874
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,833
but he made it to the Olympics
as a taekwondo athlete.

875
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,796
He won silver at the Asian Championship
and gold at the World Championship.

876
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:08,756
Do you know how impressive that is?

877
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:11,217
Why are you bringing that up?

878
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:16,681
Although Mi-rae came
from a family that didn't have anything,

879
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,432
she studied hard,

880
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:21,686
graduated from a good university,
and is doing well at your company.

881
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,938
She's the future of JPLUS.
Don't you know that?

882
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:25,231
Stop!

883
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:26,524
That is true.

884
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:31,696
But the fact
that such an incredible woman has

885
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,447
such a classless and rude father

886
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,450
surprises me so much! Unbelievable.

887
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,329
I am surprised too, okay?

888
01:06:41,122 --> 01:06:45,626
Tae-pyeong, I thought
that you grew up well and upright.

889
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:48,963
I guess you could steel your mind
since you had such a father.

890
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:51,465
What did you say, you jerk?

891
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:54,677
- I'll never give my daughter to you, okay?
- That's what I want to say.

892
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,013
I can't give you my son. I won't!

893
01:06:57,096 --> 01:06:59,056
I won't!

894
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,599
I won't!

895
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,519
Let go of me!

896
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:06,522
- Stop!
- Stop!

897
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:15,948
Let go.

898
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,783
And keep your mouth shut.

899
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:01,410
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

900
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,287
Did I ruin it again?

901
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:04,413
Must you ask?

902
01:08:04,497 --> 01:08:07,792
Maybe he'll ask you to break up with me
because of what happened yesterday.

903
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,212
Why are you planning my life without me?

904
01:08:11,295 --> 01:08:15,132
I'll take care of my business,
so don't tell me what to do.

905
01:08:15,216 --> 01:08:17,843
So what happens to Mi-rae's mom
and President Byeon now?

906
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,470
Will they live together?

907
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:22,139
You can live with him or live alone.

908
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,809
It made me think, "Mom will really live

909
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:27,311
Geum Ae-yeon's life in a cool way now."

910
01:08:27,394 --> 01:08:29,939
Just make a decision that makes you happy.

911
01:08:33,025 --> 01:08:38,030
