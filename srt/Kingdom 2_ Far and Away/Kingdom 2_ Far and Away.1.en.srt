1
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,078
245 B.C.

2
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:14,102
Qin Dynasty - Inside the Palace

3
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:33,927
Guards!

4
00:02:47,859 --> 00:02:48,942
Is this the main chamber?

5
00:02:51,154 --> 00:02:52,321
Whose name is it?

6
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:56,116
There's no point in
talking to a dying person.

7
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:14,843
It's in the conference chamber, guards!

8
00:03:15,136 --> 00:03:16,178
Guards!

9
00:03:18,014 --> 00:03:19,431
Protect His Majesty!

10
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:22,643
Where the hell are they from?

11
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:26,248
Your Majesty, it's my negligence.

12
00:03:26,272 --> 00:03:27,481
Your Majesty, please
get behind the guards.

13
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,525
Yin Zheng.

14
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:54,549
Be prepared!

15
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,604
Am I a bit late?

16
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:11,108
Shin.

17
00:04:11,734 --> 00:04:13,360
How are you...

18
00:04:14,028 --> 00:04:15,696
I called.

19
00:04:16,572 --> 00:04:17,739
Jie Shi!

20
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,869
If there are enough assassins
to break into this place,

21
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:26,206
Unification is still far away.

22
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,506
You, who were once the subordinates
of illegal rebels,

23
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,697
Why are you called Shin?

24
00:04:59,907 --> 00:05:01,950
At the time of the civil
war half a year ago.

25
00:05:01,993 --> 00:05:04,786
Defeat the mastermind
and Muta alone.

26
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:07,372
A former slave who
eventually slain the left.

27
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:18,717
Honestly, better than
His Majesty's subordinates.

28
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,887
Wouldn't he be of more help?

29
00:05:37,111 --> 00:05:38,111
Shin!

30
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,735
This kid!

31
00:06:33,835 --> 00:06:35,043
Thanks Diao.

32
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,925
Have your skills improved?

33
00:06:44,429 --> 00:06:47,347
Your Highness the Great, I apologize.

34
00:06:48,057 --> 00:06:50,767
All of this is my
stupid negligence.

35
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,145
If you like, this servant

36
00:06:53,688 --> 00:06:55,564
I'll apologize with death!

37
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,586
You still make a fuss, mister.

38
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:00,610
Uncle?

39
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:10,370
Chiyu...

40
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,001
If only Chiyu had come

41
00:07:18,087 --> 00:07:21,673
you all would be dead.

42
00:07:31,893 --> 00:07:33,101
Chiyu?

43
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:38,231
A legendary assassin clan said
to have superhuman strength.

44
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:43,737
There is an anecdote that he
once destroyed a small country alone.

45
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,906
Is he a monster?

46
00:07:46,407 --> 00:07:49,451
Also known as
the 'Clan of Sorrow'

47
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,412
'Clan of Sorrow'?

48
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,625
Shit, it's just a
rumor anyway, right?

49
00:07:57,126 --> 00:08:00,647
Whoever it is,
I'll take it lightly.

50
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:04,318
Assassins enter the castle.

51
00:08:04,342 --> 00:08:05,903
It's a big deal if it's
known to the outside world.

52
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,696
Never say anything about this.

53
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,803
Your Majesty!

54
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:13,350
- I think you should go back.
- What's going on?

55
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:16,937
It is said that the state of Wei crossed
the border and began to advance.

56
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:19,773
What?

57
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:39,561
The far-off world of war.

58
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,897
<i>Qin, Zhao, Han, Yen, Wei, Qi, Cho</i> is the
Spring and Autumn Warring States period.

59
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,734
The fierce battle between the
seven countries in the Central Plains.

60
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:47,759
It has been going
on for 500 years.

61
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,870
Shin, who grew up as a war orphan in
Jin, a country west of the Central Plains,

62
00:08:56,894 --> 00:09:00,981
He had a dream of becoming
a general with his friend Piao.

63
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:06,421
But because of his similar appearance
with the king

64
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,674
Piao then became the king's substitute.

65
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:12,450
He loses his life in a
civil war in the palace.

66
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:20,143
Shin meets Yin Zheng, a young king of the Qin
Dynasty who dreams of reunifying the Central Plains.

67
00:09:20,167 --> 00:09:24,254
Along with Yang Duan He, the King of the
Mountains, the royal road heads to Xianyang.

68
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,112
The new party who recaptured the throne.

69
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,972
One step closer
to turbulent times.

70
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,622
And now the
neighboring country of Wei.

71
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,814
Initiate a cross-border invasion.

72
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:49,112
The two countries are about to meet the
time of decisive battle on the Dakan Plains.

73
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:14,130
<i>Kingdom 2: Far and Away</i>

74
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,579
<i>Xianyang, the royal
capital of the Qin Dynasty</i>

75
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,910
Set!

76
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:40,538
It's an invasion of Wei.

77
00:10:46,295 --> 00:10:48,129
A great war is about to begin.

78
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,933
Once you become a slave, you become
a slave for life!

79
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:02,018
The only way out is the sword

80
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:03,937
Yes.

81
00:11:05,523 --> 00:11:08,108
I will soon become
the General of the World

82
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,112
Piao.

83
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,322
It's finally starting.

84
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,995
This is the true first step towards
becoming the Great General of the World.

85
00:11:25,376 --> 00:11:26,835
Good luck

86
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,213
Yes

87
00:11:32,049 --> 00:11:34,384
Diao, you wait here.

88
00:11:35,553 --> 00:11:37,637
- But...
- It's okay.

89
00:11:42,226 --> 00:11:43,476
Nice!

90
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:46,855
Where should I go for a run?

91
00:12:17,428 --> 00:12:18,970
Good!

92
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:21,765
Go ahead!

93
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,370
Hurry up, the war is over!

94
00:12:25,394 --> 00:12:26,663
Noisy, kid!

95
00:12:26,687 --> 00:12:28,957
What are you? Move fast!

96
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,857
Don't hesitate!

97
00:12:32,234 --> 00:12:32,901
What?

98
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:35,005
No, are you Shin?

99
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,197
You're the gangster Mi-ssi's brother!

100
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:40,116
Don't call me that

101
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,138
you were alive.

102
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:46,224
Ever since Piao died,
you have gone missing.

103
00:12:46,248 --> 00:12:48,625
Of course I thought you were dead too.

104
00:12:50,961 --> 00:12:52,253
Yes, the funeral...

105
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:58,153
A lot of people
came to the funeral.

106
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:02,388
Yeah, because
everyone liked Piao.

107
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,517
When one returns from the war, one
is expected to straight to the heaven

108
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:08,812
Yes

109
00:13:09,814 --> 00:13:10,814
Thanks.

110
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:16,027
But we'll only go to heaven
after our dreams come true.

111
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:22,158
Shin, I think you've changed.

112
00:13:22,493 --> 00:13:23,785
What happened to you?

113
00:13:27,081 --> 00:13:30,268
I saved the king of this great
country with my own hands

114
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,770
I even got a small house as a prize.

115
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,294
It's my own castle!

116
00:13:40,928 --> 00:13:43,073
Still talking stupid.

117
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:45,951
From long ago, Piao and I wanted to
become the Great Generals of the World.

118
00:13:45,975 --> 00:13:47,202
We always say he was bluffing.

119
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,078
Noisy!

120
00:13:48,102 --> 00:13:50,603
The path for me
and Piao starts now.

121
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,232
- Hey, wait.
- Wait!

122
00:13:57,278 --> 00:13:58,611
Is that a warlord?

123
00:13:59,572 --> 00:14:01,406
An annoying enemy.

124
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:06,221
Because of being surrounded by enemy countries on
all sides and having been at war for a long time,

125
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,413
The Wei army is
accustomed to fighting.

126
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:12,000
In addition, our army
was only just being organized.

127
00:14:12,877 --> 00:14:13,960
Losing the war...

128
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:16,731
... seems to be the only option.

129
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,965
There was a general
called Hwaryong, right?

130
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:20,925
That's right.

131
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,095
Like the six generals of our
Qin Dynasty,

132
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:26,533
In the Wei Dynasty, there was a 'Hwaryongchilsa'.

133
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:29,017
They say these are survivors.

134
00:14:30,853 --> 00:14:34,480
If he ever comes out...

135
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,567
it won't be hard to defeat them.

136
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:49,454
People are assembling

137
00:14:50,998 --> 00:14:54,208
I'll make 'O', so
let's get together!

138
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:56,461
Five?

139
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,440
Don't you even know 'O'?

140
00:14:58,464 --> 00:15:02,527
Where did you come from and what did you
do? We know that we are the first to go out

141
00:15:02,551 --> 00:15:03,718
What is that?

142
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,198
'O' is a group of
five infantrymen

143
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:08,909
centered on the five viscera.

144
00:15:08,933 --> 00:15:12,852
Five foot soldiers fight
as a community of destiny.

145
00:15:13,896 --> 00:15:16,875
Our infantrymen, depending
on which 'O' they enter.

146
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:20,818
It's decided whether to go back after
building a major or become a corpse.

147
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,804
Hey, isn't it Hwiryun and Sangyeol?

148
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,806
- Let's fight together!
- What?

149
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,208
I'll introduce you to my little sister
when I get back, so come to us.

150
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,478
Already married.

151
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:40,732
Hey guys, come in my 'O'

152
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:41,775
you are...

153
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:43,443
It's Paerang!

154
00:15:43,467 --> 00:15:44,676
Move!

155
00:15:46,595 --> 00:15:48,281
They took Paerang.

156
00:15:48,305 --> 00:15:49,931
Their 'O' must be the best

157
00:15:50,975 --> 00:15:51,975
Next!

158
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:55,622
Also.

159
00:15:55,646 --> 00:15:57,730
Taking away the
strong-looking guy...

160
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,877
Hear everyone!

161
00:16:00,901 --> 00:16:03,672
I am Shin from
Seongho Village!

162
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:06,030
Of these, I am the strongest!

163
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,453
Are you kidding me?
I will become the general of the world...

164
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:14,455
Stop it!

165
00:16:14,748 --> 00:16:15,999
You're embarrassing yourself.

166
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,803
Are you sick of cold food too?

167
00:16:29,847 --> 00:16:31,305
Like a kid.

168
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:34,744
You're not the place to
come, it's better to go back.

169
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:37,061
Let's get along well
with the rest of us.

170
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:41,607
Hey.

171
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,235
When people talk to
you, you have to answer

172
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:51,075
Hey!

173
00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:55,955
Those are the ones left

174
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:57,373
What?

175
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,752
My name is Taku Kei, a master craftsman.

176
00:17:00,794 --> 00:17:04,756
I was always with the remaining people
because I was an incompetent 5 jang.

177
00:17:06,842 --> 00:17:08,468
Who is this weak-looking man?

178
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:13,283
Oh, so there are five of us

179
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:14,432
We are doomed!

180
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,725
If it's like this, it's the
road to the underworld.

181
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:19,520
Shall we introduce ourselves?

182
00:17:19,938 --> 00:17:21,064
I am Shin

183
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,273
I'm Mipyeong.

184
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,942
This is my younger brother,
Mido. Please take care of us.

185
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,989
What about that one?

186
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,142
We'll be colleagues who will
be with you through life and death.

187
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,333
so what's your name

188
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:47,840
Outcast.

189
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,655
I hate to talk.

190
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,098
- What's that attitude?
- Fine.

191
00:17:57,559 --> 00:17:59,477
Sort them all!

192
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,937
Thousands of cavalry will be passing by.

193
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:02,957
The cavalry of the thousand soldiers?

194
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,125
Hurry up.

195
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,044
A commander of a thousand
soldiers will be passing by soon.

196
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,027
Rude people sometimes get cut down.

197
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,112
Come on!

198
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:24,168
Is that person the Millennium Master?

199
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:36,347
Hey!

200
00:18:36,557 --> 00:18:39,934
That idiot is going to run away.

201
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,644
Hey, Mr. Wall!

202
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Long time no see.

203
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,191
Who is this, Shin!

204
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,546
You look good

205
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:51,487
named after the
<i>Ceiling Wall of Qin Dynasty</i>

206
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,031
E h?

207
00:18:59,913 --> 00:19:02,039
- Murder?
- Yes.

208
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:06,836
Wei attacked
Hwanseong on the border.

209
00:19:09,006 --> 00:19:11,581
<i>Qin, Hwancheng, Wei</i>
The army of Wei was about 90,000.

210
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:13,945
Against him was our army.

211
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:17,889
Although it was defended by 5,000
border guards near Hwanseong,

212
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,891
It was captured in the blink of an eye.

213
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:24,706
His Highness, the king to the General
Biao Gong who is preparing an expedition..

214
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,230
... gave the order to conquer.

215
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:29,483
Upon realizing this, the Wei
army gathered their resources and

216
00:19:29,526 --> 00:19:31,694
deployed their troops
to the Dakan Plains.

217
00:19:33,363 --> 00:19:36,616
<i>Dakan Plains</i>
At that time, the Wei army set fire to the lands.

218
00:19:37,034 --> 00:19:42,121
It was said they have slaughtered
women, the elderly and even children.

219
00:19:49,796 --> 00:19:54,050
What kind of guy would
do such a ruthless thing?

220
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:57,220
I am General Oh Gyeong, the
commander-in-chief of the Wei army.

221
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:00,348
- General Oh Gyeong?
- Yes.

222
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:04,769
He is one of the seven great
generals of the Wei Dynasty.

223
00:20:08,148 --> 00:20:10,691
He's not even from Wei.

224
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:14,487
He is said to have risen to the
rank of general as the God of War.

225
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:19,177
General Oh Gyeong this time.

226
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:22,745
He said he volunteered to be the
general commander of the Qin attack.

227
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,792
Commander Gung Yuan completed herding on the 1st Hill.

228
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,857
General, we secured
the two hills first.

229
00:21:14,881 --> 00:21:18,134
This gave our military an
overwhelming advantage.

230
00:21:19,783 --> 00:21:25,470
<i>Oh Gyeong-gun,
commander-in-chief of the Wei Dynasty.</i>

231
00:21:31,565 --> 00:21:33,441
You lost the hill?

232
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:37,630
Are you going to spread
your defenses while invading?

233
00:21:37,654 --> 00:21:40,633
Hills are like castles
in flatland battles.

234
00:21:40,657 --> 00:21:43,242
Strong defense and easy attack.

235
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:47,705
- General!
- General!

236
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,627
General Biao Gong.

237
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:56,005
Not all infantry
have been rallied yet.

238
00:21:56,673 --> 00:22:00,403
The enemy intends to overwhelm
the two hills and set up a defensive line.

239
00:22:00,427 --> 00:22:02,261
Better not to move...

240
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,326
<i>Commander-in-Chief of the Qin
Dynasty General Biao Gong.</i>

241
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,477
If the hill was lost,
you can take it back

242
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:15,024
Go out!

243
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:19,820
What do you think?

244
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:23,426
We need a quick decision.

245
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,160
Isn't it too hasty to
move in this state?

246
00:22:26,185 --> 00:22:27,054
<i>Qin Dynasty
Cheoninjang Evergreen</i>

247
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,747
this will bleed a lot.

248
00:22:30,123 --> 00:22:32,833
What is our
commander-in-chief's thinking?

249
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,280
Hurry up!

250
00:22:44,304 --> 00:22:46,639
The enemy is already in formation

251
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:50,328
How much longer
do you have to run?

252
00:22:50,352 --> 00:22:52,520
It means we're behind

253
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,458
Ready your mind.

254
00:22:55,482 --> 00:22:57,942
A lot of people will die.

255
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:04,592
Something has changed in the air.

256
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:05,866
What is it?

257
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,369
There's something in front of this

258
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,579
Hey Shin!

259
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:13,249
Wait a minute.

260
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,626
All forces, stop!

261
00:23:29,516 --> 00:23:32,017
Is this a real battlefield

262
00:23:56,877 --> 00:23:59,336
4th Army infantrymen, gather!

263
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:05,676
- 4th Army?
- This is our army.

264
00:24:06,428 --> 00:24:07,428
Let's go.

265
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,098
I am Park Ho-shin, the master of heaven!

266
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,826
We will attack soon.

267
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:14,809
<i>Park Ho-sin, commander
of the Qin Dynasty.</i>

268
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:16,812
Arrange the troops in a line!

269
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:18,606
Get going!

270
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:24,153
Chief, please wait.

271
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:28,365
We have been running for two
days straight to the Dakan Plains here.

272
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:30,595
Rest at least until
you catch your breath

273
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:31,762
We can't afford it.

274
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:35,623
But do you mean to charge
without knowing the situation?

275
00:24:35,665 --> 00:24:37,583
Don't talk back to your chief!

276
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:40,563
Stop!

277
00:24:40,587 --> 00:24:42,171
Don't blindly lead the soldiers.

278
00:24:47,802 --> 00:24:49,739
From now on, I will fight
with my life on the front line

279
00:24:49,763 --> 00:24:50,971
these are precious soldiers.

280
00:24:51,681 --> 00:24:53,933
- That person a while ago...
- Wall

281
00:24:54,851 --> 00:24:57,019
Did you say 'Wall'?

282
00:24:58,021 --> 00:24:59,897
Don't get into a discussion with a newbie

283
00:25:01,358 --> 00:25:03,692
Mind your zone!

284
00:25:06,154 --> 00:25:07,947
Arrange Park Ho-shin's troops!

285
00:25:08,615 --> 00:25:10,491
Move on, you slugs!

286
00:25:15,664 --> 00:25:16,872
Get ready!

287
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:20,626
Our advance is currently
at a numerical disadvantage.

288
00:25:21,127 --> 00:25:24,964
Wei army lost two hills and
was geographically inferior.

289
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:28,551
You have only one purpose!

290
00:25:29,177 --> 00:25:31,595
Take the hill at
the risk of your lives!

291
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:36,202
From now on, the
infantry is the full force.

292
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:39,979
Break through the defense
line at the foot of the mountain!

293
00:25:40,981 --> 00:25:43,709
What kind of an order is that!

294
00:25:43,733 --> 00:25:44,900
Nonsense

295
00:25:45,986 --> 00:25:47,570
Be prepared.

296
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:51,407
Because Park Ho-shin is known to be a
crazy attack guy.

297
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:55,703
He will fall back at the first strong challenge

298
00:26:37,787 --> 00:26:40,456
Do we really have
to fight these guys?

299
00:26:43,043 --> 00:26:45,210
Are you okay, brother?

300
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:48,213
To throw up like an idiot.

301
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:02,436
Commander Gong Yuan.

302
00:27:03,146 --> 00:27:06,732
Jin's infantry troops that have just
arrived are aligning their formations.

303
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:08,353
<i>Oh Gyeong-gun,
general of the Wei Dynasty.</i>

304
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,920
Is it an immediate charge upon arrival?

305
00:27:11,404 --> 00:27:12,738
You're too hasty.

306
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:14,800
Now that the hill has been taken away.

307
00:27:14,824 --> 00:27:17,618
Waiting for the
maintenance of the soldiers.

308
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,753
Sound the charge signal!

309
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,733
The 3rd Army
Infantry is still there!

310
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:31,757
Does not matter

311
00:27:34,678 --> 00:27:35,696
What?

312
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,513
The assault order has been given.

313
00:27:38,139 --> 00:27:41,183
Listen up, you'll
never be left alone.

314
00:27:41,768 --> 00:27:42,810
Do you know?

315
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:45,729
Got it.

316
00:27:47,315 --> 00:27:49,149
It's finally starting.

317
00:27:50,276 --> 00:27:54,071
Are you watching, Piao?

318
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,408
Even for our hero.

319
00:27:58,326 --> 00:28:00,828
We must return to
Seongho Village alive.

320
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,458
Infantry, ready!

321
00:28:11,423 --> 00:28:12,858
Rear regular army.

322
00:28:12,882 --> 00:28:13,882
Preparations!

323
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,697
Get set

324
00:28:49,502 --> 00:28:51,128
Charge!

325
00:29:11,983 --> 00:29:13,233
Defensive Formation!

326
00:29:17,614 --> 00:29:19,239
What is that?

327
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,536
Come back!

328
00:29:24,954 --> 00:29:26,955
You can't go alone!

329
00:29:27,582 --> 00:29:28,707
Come back!

330
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,508
Cut that fool down first!

331
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,763
Shin!

332
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:51,647
Die.

333
00:30:10,458 --> 00:30:11,458
Encircle him!

334
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:39,403
Over there! Let's charge!

335
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:47,744
Come!

336
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,846
Push now or never!

337
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:35,000
It's impossible.

338
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,336
I cannot

339
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:40,547
Brother!

340
00:31:40,882 --> 00:31:42,257
Brother!

341
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:44,384
Help me!

342
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:46,511
This kid!

343
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,056
It's okay?

344
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,331
It hurts, you bastard!

345
00:31:55,355 --> 00:31:57,856
Run away, brother, we
are no match for you.

346
00:32:00,193 --> 00:32:01,193
Brother Taku Kei!

347
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:02,861
Two minutes now

348
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:06,531
Stupid stuff!

349
00:32:07,033 --> 00:32:09,473
Speaking of small puppies who
can't do anything by themselves!

350
00:32:10,036 --> 00:32:11,370
Shut up!

351
00:32:24,217 --> 00:32:25,926
I don't care what anyone says.

352
00:32:26,135 --> 00:32:28,303
This is how 'O' fights.

353
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,868
Here goes!

354
00:32:52,912 --> 00:32:55,099
'Five people fighting as one'

355
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,165
This is a great tactic.

356
00:32:59,419 --> 00:33:00,419
Damn it.

357
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:02,587
But we are alone after
that Shin fellow jumped off.

358
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:05,215
There's even a kid who
don't do anything, so it's just us three

359
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,135
Where did Shin go?

360
00:33:34,662 --> 00:33:35,746
You missed

361
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:36,997
Damn!

362
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Leader!

363
00:34:01,481 --> 00:34:02,481
Shin.

364
00:34:16,204 --> 00:34:17,389
Commander Gong Yuan.

365
00:34:17,413 --> 00:34:19,372
The lines are shifting unexpectedly.

366
00:34:19,624 --> 00:34:21,374
Shall we deploy the 3rd Battalion?

367
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
No.

368
00:34:26,089 --> 00:34:27,089
Send it out.

369
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,345
Come up and see!

370
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:45,698
What.

371
00:34:50,613 --> 00:34:51,613
Wow, this is dangerous.

372
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,289
Are you running away?!

373
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,042
The enemy is retreating

374
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:06,211
Did we win?

375
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,404
Hey Shin! You were awesome!

376
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:15,781
Stupid kid!

377
00:35:15,805 --> 00:35:17,180
Run away!

378
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:19,641
Run away!

379
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:05,664
This is not the time to stand idly by!

380
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:08,083
Shin, I have lived, thanks to you.

381
00:36:08,107 --> 00:36:09,357
What is that?

382
00:36:09,984 --> 00:36:11,318
It's the armored chariot squad.

383
00:36:11,944 --> 00:36:15,504
That is the armored chariot squad that prides
itself on being the strongest in the midfield.

384
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:17,866
What is an armored chariot squad?

385
00:36:18,576 --> 00:36:20,869
There's no way we can win

386
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,913
The real fight starts now.

387
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:28,710
This is only the first wave.

388
00:36:29,378 --> 00:36:31,418
That is the chariot squad, the
main unit will come with the 2nd wave.

389
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,799
A large army will come, so that
there will be no chance of escape.

390
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:46,811
Enemy chariots are overrunning
the infantry of the 4th Army.

391
00:36:47,146 --> 00:36:48,897
The cavalry needs help!

392
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:51,233
General Biao Gong.

393
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:57,405
Tell all the cavalry.

394
00:36:58,366 --> 00:36:59,532
Yeah!

395
00:37:03,537 --> 00:37:04,788
Wait.

396
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:06,915
Yeah!

397
00:37:07,041 --> 00:37:08,041
Yes?

398
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:15,840
Damn it.

399
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,093
Are there no reinforcements?

400
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:19,863
I'm going to die from this!

401
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:21,698
Everyone stick close behind me

402
00:37:21,722 --> 00:37:23,325
I will try to collide
in front of this judge

403
00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:24,368
That's so reckless.

404
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,517
So what do we do?

405
00:37:25,893 --> 00:37:26,935
There is a way...

406
00:37:29,355 --> 00:37:31,500
- You...
- You're alive.

407
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:32,459
What a relief.

408
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,733
What's the way?

409
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:36,778
- You can build a barrier.
- A barrier?

410
00:37:37,196 --> 00:37:38,989
How do you do that?

411
00:37:41,117 --> 00:37:42,367
Pile up the corpses

412
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:48,665
What kind of stupid idea is that?

413
00:37:48,708 --> 00:37:49,791
Let's try.

414
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,961
Guys, collect the corpses
and stack them up!

415
00:37:53,754 --> 00:37:55,088
Brother Taku Kei!

416
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,673
Come on!

417
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:13,898
Is the chariots charge ordered yet?

418
00:38:16,652 --> 00:38:18,653
Another standby flag has been raised

419
00:38:25,953 --> 00:38:27,370
Come on!

420
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,374
Now it's done

421
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,792
Hide behind the barrier!

422
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:05,408
Shin, hurry up!

423
00:39:10,247 --> 00:39:13,625
The rat is escaping. Catch and kill him!

424
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:35,188
Beware!

425
00:39:55,167 --> 00:39:56,960
We did it!

426
00:39:57,336 --> 00:39:59,087
Good job, Outcast!

427
00:40:03,134 --> 00:40:04,217
Listen up!

428
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:06,803
We haven't lost yet!

429
00:40:07,513 --> 00:40:09,431
The fight starts now!

430
00:40:18,774 --> 00:40:19,793
Our fleet...

431
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,338
attacked the enemy's 4th, 2nd, and 1st
infantry corps and annihilated most of them.

432
00:40:23,362 --> 00:40:26,281
Only a few remnants of
the 4th Infantry are resisting.

433
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:30,410
Biao Gong seems to have
completely abandoned the infantry.

434
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,705
Completely divided and
isolated from the main camp.

435
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:36,791
Our army has an
overwhelming advantage!

436
00:40:39,587 --> 00:40:43,173
General Biao Gong does not understand war.

437
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,926
Leaving only the
garrison to defend the base.

438
00:40:47,678 --> 00:40:50,263
All troops, get down
from the hill and march

439
00:40:50,973 --> 00:40:52,974
Annihilate the remaining infantry below.

440
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,394
Bring me the head of that Biao Gong!

441
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,230
Report!

442
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:03,234
The main forces of the enemy general Gong
Yuan have begun to descend from the hills.

443
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:05,380
What happened to our infantry?

444
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:07,466
1st Army, annihilated.

445
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:08,573
Report!

446
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,118
4th Army, almost annihilated.

447
00:41:12,161 --> 00:41:15,056
Reports came in that a small group
of infantry had defeated the chariot squad!

448
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,539
Now it's just a matter of time

449
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:20,168
2nd Army, mostly annihilated.

450
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,754
3rd Army, struggling.

451
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,925
Please retreat.

452
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:32,032
So, there are only a
few left in the 4th Army?

453
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,056
That's right.

454
00:41:34,767 --> 00:41:36,017
General.

455
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,247
For now, let us evacuate!

456
00:41:39,271 --> 00:41:42,065
No, let us wait.

457
00:41:43,317 --> 00:41:44,776
General!

458
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:48,154
I say wait!

459
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,492
Yeah!

460
00:42:01,669 --> 00:42:04,022
Enemies descending from the hill.

461
00:42:04,046 --> 00:42:06,673
Why aren't the reinforcements coming?

462
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:11,970
Don't expect anything like that!

463
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:33,176
His Highness the Great, the
report of the war has arrived.

464
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,325
What is the front line like?

465
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:38,955
Reportedly,

466
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,835
our infantry has been trampled
by Wei armored chariot squad!

467
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,129
Most of them.

468
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:48,548
It is said to be destroyed

469
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,472
Is it true?

470
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:04,564
The infantry is destroyed...

471
00:43:41,769 --> 00:43:43,936
Wei troops are clearing
out the remnants.

472
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:47,857
Damn, I got nowhere to go

473
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:49,317
Damn.

474
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,736
I'm going to kill without
leaving anyone behind.

475
00:43:52,529 --> 00:43:54,280
Let's move to the side
with fewer enemies

476
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:03,831
Over there!

477
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:07,418
Mipyeong!

478
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,722
Outcast, you...

479
00:44:20,432 --> 00:44:21,641
Amazing...

480
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,830
If you're capable enough,
you should have helped.

481
00:44:25,854 --> 00:44:29,501
I protect my own self, and
no obligation to protect you.

482
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:31,753
We are the same team.

483
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:33,695
Then why did you
come to the battlefield for?

484
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:40,159
I found it!

485
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:42,347
It's here!

486
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:43,598
- I came.
- Now it's wrong.

487
00:44:43,622 --> 00:44:46,059
I'll cover you here, you guys go.

488
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:48,209
- It's too dangerous.
- Shut up and go!

489
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:49,460
Over there

490
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:50,920
This way.

491
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,591
Come on!

492
00:44:58,137 --> 00:44:58,947
Brother.

493
00:44:58,971 --> 00:45:00,138
Surround yourself!

494
00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:02,724
Okay

495
00:45:03,517 --> 00:45:06,185
I'll be sure to join you later, Shin!

496
00:45:07,104 --> 00:45:08,479
Go! Hurry!

497
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:27,206
Kid, let go of this!

498
00:45:36,425 --> 00:45:39,154
Outside the river, are you stupid?
Why did you stay?

499
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:40,196
You should run away too.

500
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,366
It's easier to hit enemies
from back here than run away

501
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:44,909
Go over there!

502
00:45:44,933 --> 00:45:47,746
Do whatever you want,
even if you die, I don't care

503
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:48,978
I won't die.

504
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:53,107
I can't die in a place like this.

505
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,611
Me too, stupid kid.

506
00:45:58,614 --> 00:46:01,157
Are you a kid?
Hurry up and get rid of it

507
00:46:05,412 --> 00:46:07,246
Damn.

508
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:11,793
Toong, Tangtang.

509
00:46:12,878 --> 00:46:14,629
Toong, Tangtang

510
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:16,589
What?

511
00:46:16,715 --> 00:46:18,382
Toong, Tangtang.

512
00:46:23,096 --> 00:46:24,764
Toong, Tangtang.

513
00:46:42,908 --> 00:46:44,668
Are you turning around
because you are scared?

514
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,199
Is this guy a monster?

515
00:48:24,343 --> 00:48:26,552
- What?
- Now, go get 'em!

516
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:31,242
What is it?

517
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:32,975
- Breath...
- Breath?

518
00:48:47,282 --> 00:48:48,324
Are you a woman?

519
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,035
He must have played with us!

520
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:52,889
Run away! I'll be surrounded

521
00:48:52,913 --> 00:48:53,913
Get up

522
00:49:05,384 --> 00:49:06,384
You...

523
00:49:09,638 --> 00:49:10,680
Come on!

524
00:49:23,902 --> 00:49:25,152
Out of the river, run away.

525
00:49:25,654 --> 00:49:28,114
Yes, you too!

526
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,658
Stupid kid!

527
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:40,710
Crazy fellows

528
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:43,045
took their own lives

529
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,284
Don't move yet

530
00:50:13,994 --> 00:50:15,327
You have injured your head

531
00:50:22,669 --> 00:50:24,170
You barely survived yourself

532
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:26,922
Barely

533
00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:43,731
Did you do it?

534
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:47,902
It'll do for now.

535
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:56,243
What the hell are you doing?

536
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,873
Why did you, a woman,
come to the battlefield?

537
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,541
How did you become so strong?

538
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,215
Don't talk

539
00:51:09,716 --> 00:51:10,716
What?

540
00:51:11,551 --> 00:51:14,011
You threw your whole body
and also mine into the pit.

541
00:51:14,471 --> 00:51:16,055
Ouch!

542
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,556
That hurts.

543
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:19,577
My side hurts so much

544
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:21,204
Help me!

545
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:22,228
Noisy.

546
00:51:23,271 --> 00:51:25,397
I will give you only
one answer, so choose

547
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:27,233
It better be good.

548
00:51:29,694 --> 00:51:31,153
How strong...

549
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:33,447
No.

550
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:37,743
Why did you, a woman,
come to the battlefield?

551
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,250
To avenge

552
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,335
an enemy?

553
00:51:47,337 --> 00:51:48,337
Or someone else's?

554
00:51:58,390 --> 00:52:01,183
Who are you?

555
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:07,940
Sister.

556
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,576
Sister Kang Sang's enemy.

557
00:52:22,247 --> 00:52:24,999
My older sister, who was more
precious than my life, was murdered.

558
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,384
The man who killed your sister.

559
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:37,970
Is the killer in this battlefield?

560
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:39,555
No.

561
00:52:41,683 --> 00:52:43,058
The enemy is in the country of Wei

562
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,062
but I don't know how to go.

563
00:52:48,356 --> 00:52:51,168
Did you go to war
because of that reason?

564
00:52:51,192 --> 00:52:52,610
Is it like that?

565
00:52:53,361 --> 00:52:55,029
Revenge

566
00:53:00,952 --> 00:53:02,077
Which is why...

567
00:53:02,537 --> 00:53:04,455
you said you couldn't die.

568
00:53:05,207 --> 00:53:07,791
It was because you had
to kill your sister's enemy.

569
00:53:09,669 --> 00:53:10,836
Not a man

570
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:12,546
What?

571
00:53:13,131 --> 00:53:15,132
The enemy is a kinswoman

572
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,469
We only have girls

573
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:21,221
Only women?

574
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:27,061
It's okay, don't worry about me.

575
00:53:27,646 --> 00:53:28,979
How are you?

576
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:30,856
Your eyes...

577
00:53:33,318 --> 00:53:34,944
You have such sad eyes.

578
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:43,160
Also known as
the 'Clan of Sorrow'

579
00:53:44,704 --> 00:53:49,333
There is an anecdote that she
once destroyed a small country alone.

580
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:55,506
A legendary assassin clan said
to have superhuman strength.

581
00:53:56,591 --> 00:53:57,841
Chi-woo.

582
00:54:00,637 --> 00:54:01,887
How do you know that name?

583
00:54:03,598 --> 00:54:04,974
What are you doing?

584
00:54:12,565 --> 00:54:13,816
I am Shin

585
00:54:16,569 --> 00:54:18,737
a colleague of the same class

586
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:21,991
What colleague?

587
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:25,244
I know your pain.

588
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,807
I also have a friend
who is like a brother...

589
00:54:27,831 --> 00:54:28,872
You mean the clan?

590
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,126
I heard you talking
to brother Mipyeong.

591
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:37,047
He lost a guy like that so he's
in the same situation as me?

592
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:41,844
Yes

593
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:45,889
Totally different.

594
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:48,600
What do you know about Chiyu.

595
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,438
So tell me what's different.

596
00:54:54,566 --> 00:54:56,358
What are you?

597
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:03,574
Chiyu is a cursed clan

598
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,577
not coming out of the mountain.

599
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:10,831
Ever since I was a kid,
I've been training only to kill.

600
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:18,297
When choosing a successor.

601
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:22,885
Candidates to become the next
Chiwoo from each clan gather.

602
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:26,847
Kill and kill each other
until the last one is left.

603
00:55:29,809 --> 00:55:33,270
Only the last one who
survives becomes Chi-woo.

604
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:36,106
Hassan is allowed

605
00:55:43,365 --> 00:55:44,823
bereaved family.

606
00:55:45,617 --> 00:55:47,242
Ajok's Lord.

607
00:55:48,328 --> 00:55:50,162
Everyone is a strong opponent.

608
00:55:53,333 --> 00:55:54,666
Sword Noksu.

609
00:55:56,503 --> 00:55:59,171
Tomorrow, I must protect Outcast.

610
00:56:05,178 --> 00:56:06,178
Sister Kang Sang

611
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:11,016
Outcast.

612
00:56:15,021 --> 00:56:19,691
I really thought of you
as my younger sister

613
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:23,403
Me too, sister.

614
00:56:28,201 --> 00:56:33,080
But tomorrow we have to
fight each other for ourselves.

615
00:56:33,998 --> 00:56:38,919
Even if the enemy in
front of us is each other.

616
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,551
Don't worry about it.

617
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,595
The one who will survive
tomorrow is my sister.

618
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:54,852
That means tomorrow you die.

619
00:56:57,355 --> 00:56:58,397
I don't care.

620
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:11,535
I hope you don't die tomorrow.

621
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:14,872
That's not possible.

622
00:57:15,915 --> 00:57:17,875
There can only be one person left.

623
00:57:18,126 --> 00:57:20,169
- That's the rule.
- I know.

624
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:25,215
I know

625
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,058
Me too

626
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,269
... to survive.

627
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:41,023
There are so many
things I want to do.

628
00:57:42,942 --> 00:57:44,276
What do you want to do?

629
00:57:49,324 --> 00:57:50,782
I want to get to know a man

630
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:52,868
Man?

631
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,622
Isn't it too early for you?

632
00:58:01,127 --> 00:58:05,923
I want to go out of the mountains and
visit a place called 'Nara' on the plains.

633
00:58:07,258 --> 00:58:09,760
I want to meet the
people who live there too.

634
00:58:13,014 --> 00:58:14,806
And above all...

635
00:58:30,114 --> 00:58:32,241
I will do my best
as soon as I can.

636
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:35,744
I once cut a guy who looked strong first.

637
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:39,331
My sister will take care of the rest.

638
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:41,917
Kang Sang's older sister.

639
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:45,128
She'll be Chi-woo and
she'll go out into the world

640
00:58:55,265 --> 00:58:56,682
it's okay, Noksu.

641
00:58:58,059 --> 00:58:59,643
Because I decided to

642
00:59:01,688 --> 00:59:02,813
Let's sleep.

643
00:59:50,695 --> 00:59:51,987
It smells like sleeping drug!

644
00:59:53,865 --> 00:59:55,115
Sister!

645
01:00:02,915 --> 01:00:03,957
Sister

646
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:20,223
Thank God

647
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:23,644
It looks like my sister won

648
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:38,408
Oh no

649
01:01:33,131 --> 01:01:34,631
Sister.

650
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:11,126
It wasn't because she had a weak sister.

651
01:02:12,211 --> 01:02:15,547
Because she was rather strong, everyone
was aiming for her right from the start.

652
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:19,968
It was all done by Yu-ryun.

653
01:02:23,097 --> 01:02:26,016
Is that guy her sister's nemesis?

654
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:27,642
Yes

655
01:02:28,936 --> 01:02:30,353
My life is just.

656
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,315
She only exists to kill him.

657
01:02:37,069 --> 01:02:38,945
When will the revenge be over?

658
01:02:42,783 --> 01:02:45,160
When I die, I will go
to where my sister is.

659
01:02:46,913 --> 01:02:48,390
Don't talk nonsense

660
01:02:48,414 --> 01:02:50,081
I won't allow it!

661
01:02:50,625 --> 01:02:52,584
- You're wrong.
- What?

662
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:54,480
I don't know what's going on.

663
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:58,692
Keep chasing the
enemy with those eyes.

664
01:02:58,716 --> 01:03:00,800
After avenging against your
enemies, you will die too?

665
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:02,863
Yes, is that bad?

666
01:03:02,887 --> 01:03:04,346
Of course!

667
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:09,351
Is that the only
reason I can't die here?

668
01:03:12,104 --> 01:03:13,104
Stupid bastard.

669
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,867
I will become the Great
General of the World.

670
01:03:26,786 --> 01:03:28,453
It was also Piao's dream.

671
01:03:31,624 --> 01:03:33,333
I made a promise with Piao

672
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:36,169
so I can't die

673
01:03:36,921 --> 01:03:38,171
I will be the best.

674
01:03:39,882 --> 01:03:43,635
If you see that,
Piao will surely smile

675
01:03:47,765 --> 01:03:49,724
This is why I can't die

676
01:03:54,605 --> 01:03:55,605
Outcast

677
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:58,775
How about your sister?

678
01:04:01,654 --> 01:04:04,698
If you take revenge and die.

679
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:08,285
Will your sister be happy?

680
01:04:10,872 --> 01:04:11,872
But...

681
01:04:13,374 --> 01:04:14,874
I have nothing else to do.

682
01:04:16,627 --> 01:04:18,188
What about your sister's dream?

683
01:04:18,212 --> 01:04:19,588
I don't remember.

684
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:21,599
She must have had a
dream of her own too.

685
01:04:24,385 --> 01:04:25,969
When you recall that dream

686
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,098
you might ease the sorrow

687
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:11,723
the sun has risen

688
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:15,018
I'll be spotted by the enemy

689
01:05:15,770 --> 01:05:16,811
it's over now

690
01:05:20,608 --> 01:05:21,941
Hey!

691
01:05:25,363 --> 01:05:27,364
- Here!
- What?

692
01:05:35,957 --> 01:05:38,041
- Here you are.
- Shin.

693
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:39,751
You're here!

694
01:05:40,378 --> 01:05:41,795
You are alive!

695
01:05:43,297 --> 01:05:44,631
You're all right.

696
01:05:46,759 --> 01:05:48,301
I'm so glad

697
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:50,656
What are you happy about?

698
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,514
There's only one thing
we're dangerous for.

699
01:05:56,477 --> 01:05:58,311
- Outcast!
- Kang Oe.

700
01:05:59,063 --> 01:06:01,981
- You're both alive.
- Good.

701
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:03,900
You are...

702
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:06,111
... a woman?

703
01:06:10,157 --> 01:06:11,866
Victory or defeat will be decided today.

704
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:15,203
Due to the chariots attack yesterday.

705
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:17,706
Most of the enemy front line
troops were destroyed.

706
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:21,876
There will be no strength
left to resist the advance.

707
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,109
Send the 3rd Battalion
out to the plains!

708
01:06:27,133 --> 01:06:28,133
Yeah!

709
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,403
All troops, that's the charge signal.

710
01:06:49,530 --> 01:06:54,075
Gung Yuan's battalion begins marching
toward the enemy headquarters!

711
01:07:13,512 --> 01:07:15,764
The main body of the Wei army is coming.

712
01:07:17,391 --> 01:07:21,936
Those who are mobile, take the
weapons and return to your ranks.

713
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:28,610
Damn!

714
01:07:28,903 --> 01:07:31,404
We must have the momentum to attack General
Biao Gong's headquarters at once.

715
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:32,989
Are there orders yet?

716
01:07:34,116 --> 01:07:35,241
Still waiting

717
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,662
4th Army Cavalry.

718
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:41,581
Defensive Formation!

719
01:08:19,578 --> 01:08:23,373
It looks like it's engaged in a
skirmish with the main force above.

720
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:26,269
Where we are.

721
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:30,672
It is between the enemy's large army
and the hill where the base is located.

722
01:08:31,298 --> 01:08:35,093
They are completely
isolated from their allies.

723
01:08:36,554 --> 01:08:38,763
How many allies are left around?

724
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:41,701
There should be about 30 infantrymen.

725
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:42,851
Let's run away

726
01:08:43,769 --> 01:08:45,144
Let's go to the plains

727
01:08:46,272 --> 01:08:47,272
No.

728
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:49,774
How about attacking
instead of running away?

729
01:08:50,192 --> 01:08:51,192
What?

730
01:08:51,402 --> 01:08:54,279
Kid!
How are we going to attack?

731
01:08:56,407 --> 01:08:57,490
Over there

732
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:13,631
... the garrisons

733
01:09:14,258 --> 01:09:15,569
... are trapped.

734
01:09:15,593 --> 01:09:18,238
It'll be fine, Shin!

735
01:09:18,262 --> 01:09:19,804
Advance!

736
01:09:27,771 --> 01:09:28,832
Report.

737
01:09:28,856 --> 01:09:31,126
Dozens of enemy
remnants at the foot of the hill

738
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:32,567
coming up this way

739
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:34,068
Dozens?

740
01:09:34,820 --> 01:09:36,404
That hill?

741
01:09:38,324 --> 01:09:40,450
The Qin Dynasty is full of idiots.

742
01:09:41,869 --> 01:09:43,953
Leave the puppies alone.

743
01:09:44,663 --> 01:09:47,184
Respond with 2,000
garrisons in the middle

744
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,374
more than that.

745
01:09:49,335 --> 01:09:52,003
Our target is the neck of the Biao Gong.

746
01:09:59,136 --> 01:10:02,305
The front line was annihilated
by the main forces of the palace.

747
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:08,895
Great General, we must retreat.

748
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,711
Dozens of survivors from the 4th Army.

749
01:10:14,735 --> 01:10:17,339
It is a report that you have reached the
foot of the hill where the palace is located.

750
01:10:17,363 --> 01:10:18,529
Dozens?

751
01:10:18,572 --> 01:10:20,365
Too few in number.

752
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:24,077
It's just a matter of time

753
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:27,247
Funny.

754
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,332
General Biao Gong!

755
01:10:32,753 --> 01:10:34,420
It's a tiny spark

756
01:10:36,257 --> 01:10:37,465
but...

757
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:40,885
Among the infantry of the 4th Army.

758
01:10:41,095 --> 01:10:43,930
There is an unusual little spark.

759
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:49,310
There's always something
special about that place.

760
01:10:53,565 --> 01:10:56,276
One movement moves a column.

761
01:10:56,527 --> 01:10:59,028
It is connected by cloth
and breaks down the bay.

762
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:04,534
The chain that starts with
a small fire starts a big fire.

763
01:11:05,077 --> 01:11:08,121
The whole country will
come to an end in an instant.

764
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,961
That's what war is, guys.

765
01:11:15,379 --> 01:11:16,379
Yeah!

766
01:11:17,715 --> 01:11:19,716
- Send a messenger.
- Yes.

767
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,137
To the battlefield of the 4th Army

768
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:27,348
My entire army!

769
01:11:27,641 --> 01:11:29,392
It's an assault!

770
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:30,810
Yeah!

771
01:11:31,437 --> 01:11:34,541
Order the 1st, 2nd,
and 3rd Cavalry.

772
01:11:34,565 --> 01:11:37,525
Gather on the battlefield of the 4th Army!

773
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,422
Order the 4th Army Cavalry.

774
01:11:40,446 --> 01:11:42,280
Stop the invasion of the enemy battalion!

775
01:11:42,322 --> 01:11:44,324
Join the 4th Army on the battlefield!

776
01:11:45,784 --> 01:11:47,577
It's an assault order!

777
01:11:47,911 --> 01:11:48,911
This is it!

778
01:11:49,496 --> 01:11:51,122
Charge!

779
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:06,156
Park Ho Shin!

780
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,158
You can't beat an enemy
battalion by numbers.

781
01:12:08,182 --> 01:12:09,307
Split in two!

782
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:12,579
The enemy is not a battalion of shores.

783
01:12:12,603 --> 01:12:14,914
General Biao Gong's real goal is

784
01:12:14,938 --> 01:12:17,398
... to turn
the tide from now on.

785
01:12:19,109 --> 01:12:20,795
Break through enemy lines like this

786
01:12:20,819 --> 01:12:22,672
with the remaining infantry.

787
01:12:22,696 --> 01:12:25,239
Aim for the head on the hill!

788
01:12:25,574 --> 01:12:28,493
It's unreasonable,
it'll be a dog's death!

789
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:36,501
Reinforcement!

790
01:12:38,545 --> 01:12:41,130
Wall, can't go back now.

791
01:12:41,548 --> 01:12:42,548
Damn it

792
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:46,594
Wall bag! Support the
breakthrough of Park Ho-shin's unit.

793
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:49,741
Our troops break
through the center.

794
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,099
Follow me!

795
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:21,170
Let go of this!

796
01:13:21,922 --> 01:13:24,048
- Brother!
- Holy shit!

797
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:25,693
Too many enemies.

798
01:13:25,717 --> 01:13:27,468
The garrison is like this.

799
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:36,811
Park Ho-shin's troops assault!

800
01:13:39,064 --> 01:13:42,066
Hit the garrison above!

801
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:55,746
Wei garrison retreat to the
forest and regroup your positions!

802
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:58,958
I'm Captain Park Ho-shin.

803
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:00,793
Did that guy just pierce it?

804
01:14:01,795 --> 01:14:02,939
It's over now.

805
01:14:02,963 --> 01:14:05,275
We can live now!

806
01:14:05,299 --> 01:14:07,152
The cavalry will
take care of the rest.

807
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,177
Idiots, nothing is final yet!

808
01:14:14,141 --> 01:14:16,684
You have survived the chariots attack.

809
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:20,575
In addition, it is the pride of Park Ho-shin's
unit that they even launched a counterattack.

810
01:14:21,482 --> 01:14:24,544
If you are the ones who came
out through with desperate hands.

811
01:14:24,568 --> 01:14:26,944
Even more hands can help overcome
the enemy

812
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:29,155
From now on, our unit

813
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:31,908
will take the top of the hill

814
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:34,118
I will take the head of
the enemy commander.

815
01:14:34,661 --> 01:14:35,703
Is that true?

816
01:14:35,996 --> 01:14:38,099
I thought we were barely alive.

817
01:14:38,123 --> 01:14:39,684
Should have been.

818
01:14:39,708 --> 01:14:41,834
There are only
weird guys in my unit

819
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:43,396
this time before.

820
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,060
Keep in mind that this is a very important
battle that is directly related to Jin's victory.

821
01:14:47,174 --> 01:14:49,300
Infantry, follow the cavalry!

822
01:14:49,343 --> 01:14:51,446
The cowards fled
without hesitation.

823
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:52,845
Be prepared!

824
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:56,784
You mean break through that front?

825
01:14:56,808 --> 01:14:59,810
If the goal is to break through,
there's no need to defeat the enemy

826
01:15:01,313 --> 01:15:03,147
Rush them with full power.

827
01:15:04,608 --> 01:15:07,193
What's up? Speak up.

828
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:10,257
'Cause I can't die in a place like this

829
01:15:12,673 --> 01:15:13,673
Right

830
01:15:16,495 --> 01:15:17,995
Okay, you guys.

831
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:21,123
It's an assault!

832
01:15:21,166 --> 01:15:22,583
Are you the leader?

833
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:32,260
Hey, what's that?

834
01:15:34,846 --> 01:15:36,055
Is it a raid?

835
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:39,141
Is it the cavalry?

836
01:15:40,018 --> 01:15:42,205
Did you break through to the army?

837
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:43,729
It's an enemy attack!

838
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:48,234
Enemies are everywhere

839
01:15:48,485 --> 01:15:50,152
How do you fight this?

840
01:15:50,571 --> 01:15:52,215
Don't be swayed by the numbers!

841
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,925
Breaking through is the goal.

842
01:15:53,949 --> 01:15:57,929
If you only cut down the enemies in
front of you, you can definitely escape!

843
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,662
Right!

844
01:15:59,913 --> 01:16:01,956
Easy to say!

845
01:16:12,926 --> 01:16:14,051
Stop it!

846
01:16:24,563 --> 01:16:26,272
The troop's gap is too big

847
01:16:26,607 --> 01:16:28,524
I can't stand it for long!

848
01:16:43,957 --> 01:16:45,207
Mido!

849
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:15,196
Now.

850
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:20,368
Follow Shin!

851
01:17:24,331 --> 01:17:25,873
Break through!

852
01:17:38,804 --> 01:17:40,179
Are you okay?

853
01:17:52,526 --> 01:17:54,212
Separated from infantry.

854
01:17:54,236 --> 01:17:56,556
The cavalry corps heads for
the summit with all their might

855
01:17:59,741 --> 01:18:00,741
Hey.

856
01:18:00,867 --> 01:18:03,096
Without the protection of the
cavalry, those guys don't stand a chance

857
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,682
Both mounted and
infantry are in the line of attack.

858
01:18:05,706 --> 01:18:08,624
It's all for victory, that's
what an 'army' is all about.

859
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:12,063
Come out of the
'O' and take the lead.

860
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,088
'Cause now I need one more horse

861
01:18:20,011 --> 01:18:21,429
Go ahead Shin.

862
01:18:23,890 --> 01:18:25,785
That Shin is not to be trifled with

863
01:18:25,809 --> 01:18:27,560
I knew it right away.

864
01:18:27,811 --> 01:18:29,979
Did you not say you were going
to become a Great General?

865
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:48,622
Outcast

866
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:51,500
What do you think?

867
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:58,466
It's just a nuisance

868
01:19:00,177 --> 01:19:01,510
Do not say that.

869
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:02,803
Here goes

870
01:19:02,929 --> 01:19:04,346
Meet you at the top

871
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:05,973
Yes.

872
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,311
Go!

873
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:44,637
If you cut the leader's head,
you can turn the tide of the game.

874
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,932
Let's defeat the Wei General
Oh Dyeong from the enemy base!

875
01:20:23,635 --> 01:20:25,094
There is no end.

876
01:20:41,027 --> 01:20:42,069
Mido!

877
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:45,489
I am Shin

878
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,702
a colleague of the same class

879
01:21:03,466 --> 01:21:04,758
Thanks

880
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:07,595
Help my brother more than me.

881
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:10,472
I can't move
because I hurt my leg.

882
01:21:18,732 --> 01:21:20,232
What was your sister's dream?

883
01:21:21,651 --> 01:21:23,527
She must have had a
dream of her sister too.

884
01:21:28,658 --> 01:21:30,200
If you remember that dream.

885
01:21:31,953 --> 01:21:34,455
Might ease your sorrow

886
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:51,991
Wake up and run away.

887
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:53,015
No.

888
01:21:55,268 --> 01:21:56,352
I can't move.

889
01:21:57,228 --> 01:22:00,564
I'm done, help my brother

890
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:02,149
Please!

891
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,780
It's because his brother asked for it.

892
01:22:15,455 --> 01:22:16,455
Outcast

893
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:28,592
Done! It's over now.

894
01:22:29,803 --> 01:22:31,011
I die here

895
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:33,847
You will live.

896
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:42,625
I too survived.

897
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:45,025
There are so many
things I want to do.

898
01:22:47,112 --> 01:22:48,529
What do you want to do?

899
01:22:49,572 --> 01:22:54,493
I want to go out of the mountains and
see a place called 'Nara' on the plains.

900
01:22:56,287 --> 01:22:58,831
I want to meet the
people who live there too.

901
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,376
And above all...

902
01:23:05,588 --> 01:23:09,091
I want to laugh to my heart's content.

903
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:35,617
What is it

904
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,078
Sister

905
01:23:41,624 --> 01:23:42,958
Outcast

906
01:23:49,841 --> 01:23:51,633
Just laugh.

907
01:23:57,265 --> 01:23:58,390
Out of the river, go!

908
01:24:00,185 --> 01:24:01,852
Get up, go.

909
01:24:03,229 --> 01:24:04,605
I'm wrong

910
01:24:31,591 --> 01:24:32,883
You can do it

911
01:24:39,057 --> 01:24:41,683
You are still alive!

912
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:55,322
Okay

913
01:25:15,135 --> 01:25:16,487
Brother, are you okay?

914
01:25:16,511 --> 01:25:17,511
Yes

915
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:19,221
Let's go.

916
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:21,932
Leave Fumi to me.

917
01:25:22,976 --> 01:25:24,977
Everyone has to
get to the top alive

918
01:25:28,439 --> 01:25:29,439
Go!

919
01:25:31,192 --> 01:25:32,234
See you from above.

920
01:25:57,177 --> 01:25:58,552
I see the main base.

921
01:26:01,973 --> 01:26:02,973
Commander Gong Yuan.

922
01:26:03,308 --> 01:26:06,351
A cavalry unit that broke through the
halfway garrison is heading this way.

923
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:09,062
Lihyeon Hwang

924
01:26:12,859 --> 01:26:13,942
Leave it to me.

925
01:26:25,997 --> 01:26:29,917
Hwang Ri-hyeon archers
ready to fire a salvo!

926
01:26:32,212 --> 01:26:33,212
Launch!

927
01:26:40,261 --> 01:26:41,345
Caught the enemy.

928
01:26:44,057 --> 01:26:45,933
Don't be afraid of arrows.

929
01:26:46,351 --> 01:26:47,976
The summit is right in front of you!

930
01:26:52,565 --> 01:26:53,565
Launch!

931
01:27:03,242 --> 01:27:04,326
Are you okay?

932
01:27:04,994 --> 01:27:07,537
Can't fall here.

933
01:27:07,914 --> 01:27:08,914
Yeah

934
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:16,380
This is over.

935
01:27:25,682 --> 01:27:28,183
Nonsense! Did you see my arrows?

936
01:28:29,787 --> 01:28:32,683
Chief, evacuate!

937
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:33,832
Don't panic.

938
01:28:34,625 --> 01:28:37,044
You guys just got lucky

939
01:28:37,587 --> 01:28:38,920
No luck.

940
01:28:40,757 --> 01:28:43,800
Crossing the bridge
made by dead comrades.

941
01:28:45,219 --> 01:28:46,928
I came here

942
01:28:57,815 --> 01:28:59,149
Stupid.

943
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:04,321
If you don't defeat
me, everyone will die.

944
01:29:08,826 --> 01:29:10,035
Thousands!

945
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:21,171
You're coming to me
who can't see anymore

946
01:29:22,298 --> 01:29:25,092
You are really stupid.

947
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:40,232
Wei army commander Gong Yuan

948
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:43,527
Defeated!

949
01:30:18,771 --> 01:30:20,313
Head of the palace!

950
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,818
Retreat!

951
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:27,863
Retreat immediately!

952
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,159
Come on get off!

953
01:30:45,715 --> 01:30:47,109
Wall, look over there!

954
01:30:47,133 --> 01:30:49,301
There's a Qin flag on the hill.

955
01:31:12,950 --> 01:31:16,912
The flag of the Qin Dynasty
was raised on the Hill of Gong Yuan.

956
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:24,002
It is thanks to the dance
of the Cheoninjangnim.

957
01:31:26,797 --> 01:31:30,777
But the garrison
halfway up is pursuing.

958
01:31:30,801 --> 01:31:33,678
There are only ten of us compared
to over a thousand enemy troops.

959
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:39,476
I'm angry, but I have to go down the
hill with the head of the palace attendant.

960
01:31:39,936 --> 01:31:41,436
Don't be stupid.

961
01:31:42,188 --> 01:31:44,041
Guys who want to go down
can go down

962
01:31:44,065 --> 01:31:45,690
I will fight here

963
01:31:46,234 --> 01:31:47,526
What's up.

964
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:50,005
Refrain from talking about infantry!

965
01:31:50,029 --> 01:31:51,738
Park Ho-sin Cheoninjang.

966
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:56,284
He said he was able to come this far
because of the sacrifices of his allies.

967
01:31:57,119 --> 01:31:58,870
Such an important place.

968
01:31:59,121 --> 01:32:02,666
Are you saying you would give up just
because a thousand people were pushing up?

969
01:32:07,088 --> 01:32:08,255
Kid.

970
01:32:09,173 --> 01:32:10,382
What is your name?

971
01:32:12,218 --> 01:32:13,218
Shin

972
01:32:14,554 --> 01:32:17,055
Listen up, Shin.

973
01:32:18,683 --> 01:32:22,727
Bravery and recklessness are different

974
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,065
If you get it wrong.

975
01:32:27,817 --> 01:32:31,945
It leaves nothing behind,
only hastening death.

976
01:32:33,572 --> 01:32:34,781
With this,

977
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:38,868
the tide will change

978
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:43,373
Go down the hill with everyone

979
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,960
To the dead

980
01:32:48,170 --> 01:32:53,258
You go forward

981
01:32:58,889 --> 01:33:00,307
to win...

982
01:33:05,271 --> 01:33:07,022
Park Ho-shin, Cheoninjang!

983
01:33:10,192 --> 01:33:14,863
- Park Ho-shin, Cheoninjang!
- Cheoninjang!

984
01:33:25,249 --> 01:33:26,458
Shin!

985
01:33:34,675 --> 01:33:35,925
You!

986
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:39,679
You were alive!

987
01:33:42,433 --> 01:33:43,933
Ow, ow

988
01:33:44,435 --> 01:33:45,643
So painful.

989
01:33:53,527 --> 01:33:55,320
Thanks to Kang Oe

990
01:33:56,072 --> 01:33:57,781
stay behind for us.

991
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:03,078
I fought until I was exhausted

992
01:34:09,794 --> 01:34:12,212
Thanks, Outcast

993
01:34:14,674 --> 01:34:16,091
The enemy is coming up

994
01:34:17,218 --> 01:34:19,260
With the head of a palace.

995
01:34:19,595 --> 01:34:22,430
Go down the hill to the back
where there are no enemies.

996
01:34:23,474 --> 01:34:25,369
Who is Park Ho-shin, Cheoninjang?

997
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:26,995
Of course I'll take you

998
01:34:27,019 --> 01:34:28,019
Let's go.

999
01:34:28,896 --> 01:34:30,415
I can't leave it between enemies

1000
01:34:30,439 --> 01:34:31,500
I will help.

1001
01:34:31,524 --> 01:34:34,067
- You take the way back.
- Yeah.

1002
01:35:06,475 --> 01:35:07,684
Nonsense.

1003
01:35:08,769 --> 01:35:10,937
Where are all
these large armies...

1004
01:35:12,314 --> 01:35:13,648
Look over that hill.

1005
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:17,902
The hill above where the
base was located was empty.

1006
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:21,092
Does that mean the enemy
commander-in-chief has started moving?

1007
01:35:21,574 --> 01:35:22,615
Damn it.

1008
01:35:23,033 --> 01:35:25,702
I just reached the top of the hill.

1009
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:28,371
He looks like he's going to
be trapped in a pincer attack.

1010
01:35:29,498 --> 01:35:31,583
It will be twice as many
as the palace troops.

1011
01:35:33,419 --> 01:35:35,462
The Fire Dragons above, the Five Classics.

1012
01:35:43,846 --> 01:35:48,057
It is said that there are more than one hundred
tactics of the Red Masters and Pentecostals.

1013
01:35:48,100 --> 01:35:50,996
Our commander-in-chief, Changpyeong-gun,

1014
01:35:51,020 --> 01:35:53,813
I'm on an expedition
with the Monk Yeobulwi.

1015
01:35:54,482 --> 01:35:59,360
If only Xianyang had
a military like that...

1016
01:36:09,163 --> 01:36:10,246
What?

1017
01:36:12,750 --> 01:36:14,417
What's going on, window?

1018
01:36:17,129 --> 01:36:19,130
Bird we don't know

1019
01:36:19,882 --> 01:36:21,716
Which army.

1020
01:36:22,593 --> 01:36:25,637
It's a report that went
to the Dakan Plains.

1021
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:28,681
Someone

1022
01:36:31,227 --> 01:36:32,644
from the war.

1023
01:36:34,688 --> 01:36:37,482
He's been away for a long time

1024
01:36:40,903 --> 01:36:42,028
No way...

1025
01:37:09,723 --> 01:37:11,099
Why are you here?

1026
01:37:16,397 --> 01:37:17,981
Are you really that guy?

1027
01:37:18,649 --> 01:37:23,319
Yes, it is said that he
climbed the first hill 500 times.

1028
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:28,116
Only 500?

1029
01:37:30,619 --> 01:37:32,537
What are you thinking?

1030
01:37:42,464 --> 01:37:44,609
In any case, you must run to
the side with fewer enemies.

1031
01:37:44,633 --> 01:37:48,113
Gee! Are you going back already?

1032
01:37:48,137 --> 01:37:51,806
I just got fun.

1033
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:55,101
General Ouki
- General Ouki

1034
01:37:59,356 --> 01:38:00,982
Boy Shin.

1035
01:38:02,902 --> 01:38:05,028
We met again

1036
01:38:07,031 --> 01:38:08,031
You.

1037
01:38:08,741 --> 01:38:11,993
It was quite noticeable
from a distance.

1038
01:38:13,829 --> 01:38:15,955
- Surprised?
- But.

1039
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:21,169
It's a different story if you
become a general in the world.

1040
01:38:22,046 --> 01:38:23,815
In short.

1041
01:38:23,839 --> 01:38:26,758
Do you think it fell short of expectations?

1042
01:38:27,343 --> 01:38:28,570
Does it fall short of your expectations?

1043
01:38:28,594 --> 01:38:30,178
Yes.

1044
01:38:31,096 --> 01:38:32,472
Are you saying I look weak?

1045
01:38:34,391 --> 01:38:36,184
Similar.

1046
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:39,562
Do you think it's just ahead of the curve?

1047
01:38:40,064 --> 01:38:41,522
You know what?

1048
01:38:45,778 --> 01:38:50,698
That I've been standing
on a limb ever since.

1049
01:39:00,668 --> 01:39:03,586
Forgive our foot soldiers
for their rudeness!

1050
01:39:04,672 --> 01:39:06,232
In this situation.

1051
01:39:06,256 --> 01:39:08,841
The general's arrival
is heaven's help.

1052
01:39:09,843 --> 01:39:13,221
Please lead the 4th
Army including us

1053
01:39:13,263 --> 01:39:14,555
I hate it.

1054
01:39:16,725 --> 01:39:17,869
General.

1055
01:39:17,893 --> 01:39:21,229
We are not allowed to go to war

1056
01:39:21,981 --> 01:39:25,233
I'll get scolded if I
arbitrarily intervene

1057
01:39:25,401 --> 01:39:26,859
I just.

1058
01:39:27,277 --> 01:39:31,049
The view looks
good, so I just went up.

1059
01:39:31,073 --> 01:39:32,657
Right, back adjutant?

1060
01:39:33,033 --> 01:39:36,619
Yes, the best view

1061
01:39:37,079 --> 01:39:38,162
Look at this.

1062
01:39:39,289 --> 01:39:43,084
This is the moment when
the game of war moves

1063
01:39:45,045 --> 01:39:47,023
detect signs of change.

1064
01:39:47,047 --> 01:39:49,799
Move cautiously and boldly.

1065
01:39:50,134 --> 01:39:52,821
Wu Qing, the general of
the Wei Dynasty, must have.

1066
01:39:52,845 --> 01:39:56,658
He is a great general who will
become a threat to the nations.

1067
01:39:56,682 --> 01:39:59,976
When it comes to
resourcefulness, the best in Wei.

1068
01:40:00,769 --> 01:40:05,523
But the battlefield isn't
all about resourcefulness

1069
01:40:06,859 --> 01:40:08,026
sometimes.

1070
01:40:08,652 --> 01:40:13,322
Sometimes the instinct to act
according to wild intuition wins.

1071
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:15,575
Instinct?

1072
01:40:15,826 --> 01:40:17,076
Look over there.

1073
01:40:18,162 --> 01:40:20,640
A general who follows his instincts.

1074
01:40:20,664 --> 01:40:23,708
You're about to collide with
the Five Books of Resources.

1075
01:40:34,011 --> 01:40:35,053
Fast.

1076
01:40:36,388 --> 01:40:38,431
That man is our commander-in-chief.

1077
01:40:38,932 --> 01:40:40,349
You're General Biao Gong.

1078
01:41:02,873 --> 01:41:04,415
Boy Shin.

1079
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:09,170
Won't you stick with me?

1080
01:41:10,756 --> 01:41:12,882
Will resourcefulness win?

1081
01:41:14,176 --> 01:41:16,093
Will instinct win?

1082
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:43,120
Amazing.

1083
01:41:43,956 --> 01:41:48,251
Now, how do we draw the
Wei General Oh Dyeong out?

1084
01:41:49,461 --> 01:41:50,688
Report.

1085
01:41:50,712 --> 01:41:53,422
Commander Biao Gong broke
through the 1st Battalion!

1086
01:41:54,216 --> 01:41:55,633
Smashed them into pieces!

1087
01:41:59,471 --> 01:42:00,638
It's a chariots charge from the back!

1088
01:42:28,876 --> 01:42:31,085
The cavalry behind the
general is being attacked.

1089
01:42:34,006 --> 01:42:36,401
It is a strategic tactic
in the Book of War

1090
01:42:36,425 --> 01:42:38,843
It takes the opposite side by surprise, but...

1091
01:42:38,886 --> 01:42:41,929
Response must be quick and appropriate

1092
01:42:42,347 --> 01:42:43,867
It's like catching an angry bull.

1093
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:47,871
One don't have to
concentrate on the head

1094
01:42:47,895 --> 01:42:52,732
Yes, first of all, one must break down
the momentum by attacking the rear

1095
01:43:07,247 --> 01:43:10,833
It's true.

1096
01:43:11,668 --> 01:43:13,294
Was that a reckless charge
by the general?

1097
01:43:14,087 --> 01:43:15,982
Definitely it is an
important point in the battle.

1098
01:43:16,006 --> 01:43:20,593
Up until now, the charge looks to be recklessly carried out.

1099
01:43:20,969 --> 01:43:24,616
But as a result, something must
happen to turn the tide of the battle

1100
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:29,412
Oh Dyeong came down the
advantageous hill to face Biao Gong.

1101
01:43:29,436 --> 01:43:30,603
In other words,

1102
01:43:31,146 --> 01:43:34,959
even if the charge seemed like a reckless move, it
can be turned into an advantage on the battle field

1103
01:43:34,983 --> 01:43:37,962
All for victory.

1104
01:43:37,986 --> 01:43:41,864
The move is a noble sacrifice.

1105
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,493
Then...

1106
01:43:48,997 --> 01:43:50,915
Do you understand?

1107
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,209
Boy Shin.

1108
01:43:54,962 --> 01:43:57,398
All the sacrifices made so far.

1109
01:43:57,422 --> 01:44:00,652
The final outcome is everything!

1110
01:44:00,676 --> 01:44:05,263
These are the war moves that
the two of them have taken in order to win.

1111
01:44:08,267 --> 01:44:10,059
Just two people

1112
01:44:11,228 --> 01:44:13,437
Such a great battle...

1113
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,322
Boy Shin.

1114
01:44:26,410 --> 01:44:30,997
That's what being a general is about

1115
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,126
General

1116
01:44:42,300 --> 01:44:44,260
General of the World

1117
01:44:54,521 --> 01:44:56,772
General Ouki, please
lend me a horse

1118
01:44:59,318 --> 01:45:00,318
Please give it to me.

1119
01:45:05,342 --> 01:45:07,342
Commander

1120
01:45:07,367 --> 01:45:08,367
Yes

1121
01:45:20,297 --> 01:45:21,297
Thank you

1122
01:45:22,758 --> 01:45:23,758
Hey!

1123
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:28,679
See you later

1124
01:45:32,476 --> 01:45:33,476
That guy..

1125
01:45:33,810 --> 01:45:35,811
gone.

1126
01:45:39,691 --> 01:45:43,944
You seem to like
that boy quite a bit.

1127
01:45:46,490 --> 01:45:51,095
Fools like that
usually die early.

1128
01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:52,119
Yeah.

1129
01:45:52,579 --> 01:45:57,166
But sometimes you
may find a special one

1130
01:46:07,552 --> 01:46:09,720
There's a villager on your left!

1131
01:46:37,958 --> 01:46:39,667
Close in on him!

1132
01:46:46,716 --> 01:46:48,342
Stick with me!

1133
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:56,725
Get him!

1134
01:47:31,178 --> 01:47:32,511
Surround him!

1135
01:47:43,648 --> 01:47:45,316
Get him!

1136
01:48:32,113 --> 01:48:34,448
Break through to
where the Five Classics are.

1137
01:48:35,700 --> 01:48:36,867
Yes!

1138
01:48:52,384 --> 01:48:54,176
- The army is coming.
- Stay calm.

1139
01:48:54,678 --> 01:48:56,530
All troops, prepare for battle!

1140
01:48:56,554 --> 01:48:57,532
All right.

1141
01:48:57,556 --> 01:48:59,765
General, please retreat.

1142
01:49:02,769 --> 01:49:03,936
Ouki...

1143
01:49:18,994 --> 01:49:20,744
you have come.

1144
01:49:24,666 --> 01:49:27,001
That's why I can't stop

1145
01:49:27,919 --> 01:49:29,003
I must stand and fight!

1146
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:15,007
Oh Dyeong.

1147
01:50:16,760 --> 01:50:18,677
I have only met you

1148
01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:35,653
You men must not intervene

1149
01:50:42,577 --> 01:50:44,995
I thought you were only a
cold-hearted book-keeper.

1150
01:50:45,413 --> 01:50:47,873
But who would have expected
you to have such deep ambitions.

1151
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:54,672
It's going to be a battle
between the generals.

1152
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,132
That's me!

1153
01:50:59,094 --> 01:51:01,303
Your Qin Dynasty have destroyed

1154
01:51:02,138 --> 01:51:04,056
my family from a small country

1155
01:51:07,352 --> 01:51:09,269
My country and my family.

1156
01:51:10,397 --> 01:51:12,833
In order to destroy the Qin
Dynasty, which have caused much sufferings.

1157
01:51:12,857 --> 01:51:14,733
I have been dreaming of it!

1158
01:51:15,819 --> 01:51:17,528
I come from the country of Wei

1159
01:51:17,946 --> 01:51:20,072
I have risen to the rank of general.

1160
01:51:21,408 --> 01:51:22,533
Yes, that I did.

1161
01:51:23,660 --> 01:51:26,120
Is that your reason for starting the war?

1162
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:32,376
The culling of small countries is a common
occurrence in the Warring States period.

1163
01:51:33,712 --> 01:51:35,629
Like the bitter pain you have experienced.

1164
01:51:36,339 --> 01:51:38,507
They are everywhere!

1165
01:51:40,009 --> 01:51:41,343
Right.

1166
01:51:43,346 --> 01:51:45,889
So the war never ends!

1167
01:51:51,521 --> 01:51:54,625
War has been going
on for 500 years.

1168
01:51:54,649 --> 01:51:56,734
It could continue for
another 500 years.

1169
01:51:57,944 --> 01:52:01,905
I will sacrifice my sword to prevent
the next 500 years of war.

1170
01:52:08,913 --> 01:52:09,955
I will...

1171
01:52:15,295 --> 01:52:18,505
become the first king
to unify the Central Plains.

1172
01:52:38,234 --> 01:52:40,027
I will settle this score!

1173
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:41,779
Come on, Oh Dyeong!

1174
01:53:40,338 --> 01:53:42,631
It's been quite a while

1175
01:53:43,091 --> 01:53:44,967
General.

1176
01:53:45,218 --> 01:53:47,803
Or is it 'king'?

1177
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:54,518
The way you stared from the
top of the hill gave me inspiration

1178
01:53:55,061 --> 01:53:56,061
Is that so?

1179
01:53:56,813 --> 01:54:01,233
I was just passing
by and having a look.

1180
01:54:02,652 --> 01:54:05,863
It's amazing that you
can defeat that Oh Dyeong.

1181
01:54:27,719 --> 01:54:29,678
Raise a shout of victory!

1182
01:54:40,732 --> 01:54:45,504
Defeating the Fire Dragons and the Five Classics
lowered the morale of the Wei troops.

1183
01:54:45,528 --> 01:54:50,324
Having lost their general, the Wei
army had no choice but to retreat.

1184
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:54,244
Also to avoid further confrontation.

1185
01:54:54,287 --> 01:54:58,957
It can be said that the further losses
of our military was minimized.

1186
01:55:17,769 --> 01:55:19,853
Shin!

1187
01:55:20,563 --> 01:55:22,481
Hey Shin!

1188
01:55:22,899 --> 01:55:24,316
You are here.

1189
01:55:25,068 --> 01:55:26,420
- You're okay.
- Yes.

1190
01:55:26,444 --> 01:55:27,588
It is over.

1191
01:55:27,612 --> 01:55:28,904
We are still alive!

1192
01:55:35,411 --> 01:55:36,662
Let's go home!

1193
01:55:56,182 --> 01:55:57,975
Go to Asu

1194
01:55:59,477 --> 01:56:00,602
Drink or no drink?

1195
01:56:01,562 --> 01:56:02,896
Unfortunately,

1196
01:56:03,398 --> 01:56:06,066
I have other business to attend to.

1197
01:56:17,453 --> 01:56:18,537
Come on, it's a drinking party!

1198
01:56:38,641 --> 01:56:39,641
Outcast.

1199
01:56:41,728 --> 01:56:42,811
Wait a minute

1200
01:56:46,232 --> 01:56:47,441
Where are you going?

1201
01:56:48,901 --> 01:56:50,610
To avenge your sister?

1202
01:56:52,822 --> 01:56:55,866
At least we should celebrate
together at least once.

1203
01:56:56,242 --> 01:56:57,993
You have won a hard fight

1204
01:57:00,246 --> 01:57:01,246
I am done here.

1205
01:57:02,874 --> 01:57:04,833
I'm going after the Wei.

1206
01:57:06,377 --> 01:57:08,712
Is it because you don't
know where Wei is?

1207
01:57:10,131 --> 01:57:11,298
Noisy as usual

1208
01:57:18,306 --> 01:57:21,475
You came to this battlefield.

1209
01:57:22,852 --> 01:57:24,853
I think you're lucky to have met us

1210
01:57:26,814 --> 01:57:27,814
Why?

1211
01:57:30,359 --> 01:57:31,693
You were a little something.

1212
01:57:33,071 --> 01:57:35,238
It seems that your eyes have changed.

1213
01:57:38,367 --> 01:57:39,409
It's my mood that's changed

1214
01:57:41,370 --> 01:57:42,370
Maybe so

1215
01:57:44,165 --> 01:57:45,165
Rather...

1216
01:57:47,001 --> 01:57:49,795
I helped you more.

1217
01:57:52,673 --> 01:57:53,799
You did.

1218
01:57:55,802 --> 01:57:57,427
I have a long way to go too.

1219
01:57:58,554 --> 01:58:02,599
To become the Great General of
the World, training is still required.

1220
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:05,769
- Training?
- Yes.

1221
01:58:09,774 --> 01:58:11,942
I saw the generals and
knew what I have to do

1222
01:58:15,071 --> 01:58:16,071
Me too.

1223
01:58:17,115 --> 01:58:19,795
If you sincerely wish for the
unification of Yin Zheng and Jungwon,

1224
01:58:20,743 --> 01:58:22,869
than I have to do more.

1225
01:58:26,916 --> 01:58:28,625
I must be stronger than now

1226
01:58:30,378 --> 01:58:32,045
Be sure to come back

1227
01:58:33,714 --> 01:58:34,756
Outcast

1228
01:58:38,636 --> 01:58:40,846
You're our mate now.

1229
01:58:46,102 --> 01:58:50,188
And once again we will
fight as mates to win.

1230
01:58:50,898 --> 01:58:53,108
That's when I will make a toast.

1231
01:58:53,860 --> 01:58:57,988
We can then celebrate
and laugh heartily

1232
01:59:05,663 --> 01:59:06,955
See you again

1233
01:59:22,221 --> 01:59:23,305
See you again

1234
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:30,500
Shin.

1235
02:00:38,172 --> 02:00:39,464
Diao.

1236
02:00:49,976 --> 02:00:51,226
What?

1237
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:53,979
Were you worried
that I might die?

1238
02:00:55,356 --> 02:00:56,564
No, I'm not.

1239
02:00:58,484 --> 02:01:02,195
By the way, you came back with a
certain confidence about yourself, right?

1240
02:01:03,864 --> 02:01:05,198
Of course, you missed me?

1241
02:01:09,036 --> 02:01:11,371
Yes, it was hard

1242
02:01:12,999 --> 02:01:14,332
Yes

1243
02:01:14,959 --> 02:01:16,334
Welcome back

1244
02:01:22,675 --> 02:01:23,675
Yes

1245
02:01:25,219 --> 02:01:26,219
Shin.

1246
02:01:27,013 --> 02:01:29,889
While you were gone,
I have made up my mind

1247
02:01:30,391 --> 02:01:31,391
What was it?

1248
02:01:32,268 --> 02:01:33,852
I'm going to the battlefield too

1249
02:01:34,854 --> 02:01:35,854
What?

1250
02:01:36,230 --> 02:01:38,982
Weak guys like
you die quickly

1251
02:01:39,025 --> 02:01:42,337
I fight with my
head, not my sword

1252
02:01:42,361 --> 02:01:43,361
Huh?

1253
02:01:45,156 --> 02:01:49,159
Someday I will help
you fool with this head

1254
02:01:50,077 --> 02:01:51,786
Do you know what it is?

1255
02:01:53,789 --> 02:01:55,457
Don't say "military", it's "strategy".

1256
02:01:59,045 --> 02:02:00,772
Do as you will

1257
02:02:00,796 --> 02:02:02,047
Must be fun.

1258
02:02:36,415 --> 02:02:38,602
- Shin is to be a centurion?
- Yes.

1259
02:02:38,626 --> 02:02:41,146
It has just been decided in the treatise.

1260
02:02:41,170 --> 02:02:44,381
A slave boy turned into
a centurion in one battle?

1261
02:02:45,508 --> 02:02:47,509
It's obviously an unusual achievement.

1262
02:02:47,885 --> 02:02:50,887
It was said he also had
recommendations from many field officers.

1263
02:02:54,433 --> 02:02:55,725
Yes.

1264
02:02:59,313 --> 02:03:01,898
This is our war.

1265
02:03:05,694 --> 02:03:06,922
Jie Shi.

1266
02:03:06,946 --> 02:03:10,615
Thank you for
coming to our camp.

1267
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:15,453
The real fight starts now.

1268
02:03:18,457 --> 02:03:19,457
Your Highness the Great.

1269
02:03:20,084 --> 02:03:23,628
I did a detailed investigation of
what happened the other day, and

1270
02:03:24,964 --> 02:03:28,026
who lured the assassins
into the depths of the castle

1271
02:03:28,050 --> 02:03:31,428
I wonder if there
is an insider

1272
02:03:33,806 --> 02:03:36,266
Who could have done that?

1273
02:03:37,434 --> 02:03:39,018
There's only one person

1274
02:03:41,230 --> 02:03:42,647
No matter...

1275
02:03:49,071 --> 02:03:50,257
Report.

1276
02:03:50,281 --> 02:03:53,283
Shohei has just arrived.

1277
02:03:54,076 --> 02:03:59,539
Together with Lu Buwei and Meng Wu, they
request an audience with Your Highness

1278
02:04:08,299 --> 02:04:09,632
- Audience granted.
- Yes.

1279
02:04:30,063 --> 02:04:32,063
Prime Minister
Lu Buwei

1280
02:04:33,087 --> 02:04:35,087
Shohei

1281
02:04:36,111 --> 02:04:38,111
Meng Wu

1282
02:04:47,588 --> 02:04:49,506
It was a great win.

1283
02:04:50,591 --> 02:04:54,969
The Battle of Dakan Plains
is being rejoiced by all the people

1284
02:04:57,681 --> 02:05:00,767
Ah, it was a victory by the soldiers

1285
02:05:05,189 --> 02:05:06,439
Haonde

1286
02:05:07,274 --> 02:05:11,194
I've heard rumours of some
commotion in the palace.

1287
02:05:12,279 --> 02:05:16,384
Someone is trying to
assassinate His Highness.

1288
02:05:16,408 --> 02:05:19,077
Was there an treacherous gang within?

1289
02:05:22,540 --> 02:05:24,392
Regarding that...

1290
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:27,168
It must have been a top
secret, but how did you know?

1291
02:05:29,755 --> 02:05:30,755
That...

1292
02:05:33,008 --> 02:05:35,969
It's because the darkness
is the God of Gods.

1293
02:05:40,516 --> 02:05:41,683
I admit.

1294
02:05:51,819 --> 02:05:53,987
Stop kidding, Sang-sang.

1295
02:05:54,321 --> 02:05:56,447
There's no way you'd
do something like that.

1296
02:06:08,419 --> 02:06:09,794
Of course here comes the joke.

1297
02:06:12,047 --> 02:06:15,717
He's committed great rudeness
in an attempt to lighten the mood.

1298
02:06:17,261 --> 02:06:18,595
Forgive me.

1299
02:06:19,638 --> 02:06:20,805
Nonsense.

1300
02:06:21,765 --> 02:06:25,351
You can't catch me even
if I claim to be the culprit.

1301
02:06:25,853 --> 02:06:28,187
That's the difference in power.

1302
02:06:28,897 --> 02:06:30,690
Now I will have to be patient.

1303
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:35,903
By the end of this day.

1304
02:06:37,197 --> 02:06:41,701
My men will definitely
reveal the details.

1305
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:45,288
Please protect me.

1306
02:07:19,948 --> 02:07:21,366
I'm sorry, Shin

1307
02:07:22,284 --> 02:07:23,261
It's alright.

1308
02:07:23,285 --> 02:07:27,622
Because I was ordered
by Wall to support Shin.

1309
02:07:36,423 --> 02:07:38,257
That's General Ouki's Castle.

1310
02:07:38,675 --> 02:07:39,675
Right.

1311
02:07:41,261 --> 02:07:45,932
But for what purpose...

1312
02:07:49,144 --> 02:07:50,978
I am going to be trained

1313
02:07:52,481 --> 02:07:54,023
under General Ouki

1314
02:07:56,151 --> 02:07:58,695
I can't wait!

1315
