1
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,083
May 11, 12:00, Hospital, MRI Scan

2
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,291
This is today

3
00:01:25,375 --> 00:01:27,666
TVC song deadline tomorrow

4
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,583
Read this when you wake up

5
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,125
Good morning, Lu Yao.

6
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,166
You must be confused right now.

7
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,375
There are many things you can't remember.

8
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,500
Because 18 months ago,

9
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:59,416
a peach-size tumor was found
in your brain.

10
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,833
The doctor had to remove

11
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:05,333
part of your hippocampus
during the surgery,

12
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,541
so you've lost the ability
to create new memories.

13
00:02:08,666 --> 00:02:09,875
You still remember

14
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:12,333
things from your life before the surgery,

15
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:16,541
like your family, work, and friends.

16
00:02:17,583 --> 00:02:18,708
As for your new memories,

17
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,125
they perish in your sleep.

18
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:22,250
In other words,

19
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:25,250
every time you wake up,

20
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:28,000
anything or anyone
you encountered the day before

21
00:02:28,583 --> 00:02:29,958
is forgotten.

22
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,416
Lu Hong, what happened to me?

23
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,208
I found this big scar on my head

24
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,666
and a journal telling me

25
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,208
that I've become amnesiac.

26
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,125
Calm down and listen.

27
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:46,625
You make this call to me every day.

28
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,333
Finish reading
the When You Wake Up journal.

29
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,166
Then come to my house.

30
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:09,375
Lu Hong.

31
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,625
Come in.

32
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,041
Lu Hong, whose child is this?

33
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,666
He's mine.

34
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:17,416
-Yours?
-Yes.

35
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,958
Are you kidding me?

36
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,208
No, I'm not.

37
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,833
You've babysat him many times.

38
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,625
You made up with your ex?

39
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,958
Of course not.

40
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,166
Then who's the father?

41
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,666
I already told you, but you keep asking.

42
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,875
Here, hold the baby.

43
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,625
-Hold your nephew.
-I can't.

44
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,250
Of course you can.

45
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:38,333
Don't cry.

46
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,416
How did you become so open?

47
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,583
I'm in a hurry.

48
00:03:41,666 --> 00:03:43,291
He just woke up, so you have to feed him.

49
00:03:43,375 --> 00:03:44,750
One level scoop of formula
and 60 ml of water.

50
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,375
Put the water in first.

51
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,625
Read the sticky notes
if you forget the steps.

52
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,458
-Also...
-I can't do this.

53
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,500
I'll be having long meetings
with the nurses today.

54
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:54,583
I'll be home late.

55
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,250
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.

56
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:57,666
The baby's schedule is here.

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,958
When will you be back?

58
00:03:59,083 --> 00:03:59,916
Bye.

59
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,416
Hush.

60
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:08,958
Hush.

61
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:29,666
Lu Yao,

62
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:32,375
do you know why you're here today?

63
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,041
I'm here for a follow-up consultation.

64
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,041
That's right.

65
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:40,250
You have a condition called
anterograde amnesia.

66
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,500
I'm your attending physician.
Do you remember me?

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,541
Not at all.

68
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,208
Do you recall
doing the mirror drawing test before?

69
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:50,375
No.

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,583
You've actually done that test 48 times.

71
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,875
The average time for a first-timer
is 110 seconds.

72
00:04:56,958 --> 00:04:58,958
Just now, you took 28 seconds.

73
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,125
Does it mean I'll recover my memories?

74
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:05,375
It means despite your inability
to create new memories consciously,

75
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:08,375
your subconscious
is retaining the new information.

76
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:09,708
Lu Yao.

77
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:13,500
Tell me how you feel today.

78
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:16,666
I woke up to a room full of sticky notes.

79
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,750
I couldn't even tell if it was my room.

80
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,958
And there's a journal that says
I had surgery and became an amnesiac.

81
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:24,375
I don't recall the surgery.

82
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,166
My new memories get erased daily.

83
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,333
How am I supposed to feel?

84
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:31,166
A university psychology department
is running an experiment

85
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,916
on using the subconscious
to consolidate memory.

86
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,333
I think you're an ideal candidate
for this program.

87
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:40,416
Would you like to give it a try?

88
00:05:45,375 --> 00:05:47,541
Jimmy, Lu Yao may have a memory issue,

89
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,000
but he still rocks as a songwriter.

90
00:05:49,083 --> 00:05:50,750
Why not hire him

91
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,416
for Meisu's new album's title song?

92
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,791
Meisu has always loved his music.

93
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, Meisu has got new ideas.

94
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:58,541
The songwriters vying for the spot

95
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:00,125
will send in their work by Friday.

96
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:02,083
The album title is You and I.

97
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,125
So maybe next time.

98
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,666
But it won't hurt
to include one more candidate.

99
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,958
Do you remember last year?

100
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,875
Meisu joined the Heavenly Voices Contest

101
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,416
and sang Lu Yao's "Imperishable Love."

102
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,708
She went on to win the final, didn't she?

103
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,666
Lu Yao

104
00:06:18,875 --> 00:06:21,166
hasn't written a single song
since he got sick.

105
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,416
He has written plenty.

106
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,041
We're saving the songs for Meisu.

107
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:26,958
Jimmy.

108
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:28,500
Jimmy.

109
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,083
Trust me on this.

110
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:32,208
Give him a chance. He can do this.

111
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,541
Hold me to my word.

112
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,583
All right, he can submit a song.

113
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:39,208
Thank you so much.

114
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,250
As for Meisu's concert music director,

115
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,625
-Lu Yao is your man.
-Xiaojin.

116
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,250
Both Xiaoyu and Hua hired him

117
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,541
for their last tours.

118
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,583
Things turned out great.

119
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:49,583
Buddy is leaving.

120
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:50,666
I have to work now.

121
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,833
How about dinner
after you finish recording?

122
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,625
I'll set it up with Xiaojin.

123
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,791
-What does Jimmy like to eat?
-Come this way.

124
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,708
Darn it, you scared me.

125
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,000
You're amazing.

126
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,250
Let go.

127
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,750
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

128
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:16,375
You've become one of the candidates
for writing the title song

129
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,291
of Meisu's new album, You and I.

130
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,333
We made it.

131
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,583
You have until Friday
to complete the song.

132
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,708
The album title is You and I with lyrics.

133
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:27,583
Buddy.

134
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,541
You know my condition.

135
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,541
I can't write anything now.

136
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,583
I can't even write half a song.

137
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,166
Then write a whole song.

138
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,541
Our studio has had no income for a year.

139
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:47,833
We're finished if we miss this chance.

140
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,041
Buddy.

141
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,416
I don't want you to waste this chance
because of me.

142
00:07:58,375 --> 00:07:59,375
Go find someone else.

143
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,666
Good luck.

144
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,666
Lu Yao.

145
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:10,333
You promised that we would stick together.

146
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,375
Having amnesia is no excuse.

147
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,291
Are you abandoning me?

148
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,375
You want me to find someone else?

149
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:24,666
Find someone else...

150
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,083
You go find someone else.

151
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,333
-Leave me alone.
-Shut up.

152
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:39,750
Let's figure out who can be our lyricist.

153
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,041
Hong Xi?

154
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,166
He's outdated.

155
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,375
Alex Blue?

156
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,708
He emigrated.

157
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,208
The deadline is Friday.
There isn't enough time.

158
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:53,041
Just compose the melody.

159
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,291
Leave the lyrics to me.

160
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,041
You copied my homework
to get through school.

161
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,250
How can you write lyrics?

162
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,458
-You...
-I have to go meet my shrink.

163
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,833
-Give it a try, okay?
-Sure.

164
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:17,416
Buddy said he would do the lyrics.

165
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
It's a bad idea.

166
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,083
We need a lyricist.

167
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,458
Friday.

168
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:22,958
Friday is important.

169
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,208
I must find the right lyricist.

170
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,125
Are you delusional?

171
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,291
You must be. I'm sure of it.

172
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,833
Why would I bother
calling you late at night?

173
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,000
You must have cheated on too many women.

174
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,500
That's why you get creepy calls.

175
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:38,541
Listen, Ma Xiu.

176
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,416
One without ethics has no reason to live.

177
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,375
Die, you jerk!

178
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,541
You try to call

179
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,333
But the line is busy

180
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,125
You can't spell out

181
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:39,708
The pain you're holding in

182
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:40,625
Just wait

183
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:43,583
In the car next to mine
sits a beautiful woman.

184
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,666
She seems a little crazy,

185
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,166
but she has good taste in music.

186
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,208
She's playing my song, "I'm Okay."

187
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:55,958
I'm not feeling your love at all right now

188
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,333
I'm okay

189
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,625
I'm okay!

190
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:10,833
Department of Psychology,
Huaren University

191
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,708
You're so early.

192
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:39,041
I'm your therapist, Xu Xingyue.

193
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,458
I didn't plan to meet you this way.

194
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:45,291
Would you mind waiting outside?

195
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,041
I have to wait again?

196
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,583
Hello, Lu Yao.

197
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,166
I'm your therapist and researcher

198
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,041
conducting this experiment, Xu Xingyue.

199
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,250
How are you feeling?

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,333
I feel kind of weird.

201
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:17,625
Weird?

202
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:19,583
No way. Come inside.

203
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,166
Wait.

204
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,250
Listen to me first.

205
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,833
Remove your shoes.

206
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,416
Then walk on the rug slowly

207
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:31,958
and sit on the sofa.

208
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,958
Do it.

209
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,375
Darn it.

210
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,333
What are you feeling?

211
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,875
It's painful.

212
00:12:50,125 --> 00:12:51,083
How painful?

213
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,250
Very painful.

214
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,333
Very painful?

215
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,541
This is part of the experiment.

216
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,791
Have some carrot juice.

217
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,166
No, thank you.

218
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,000
Just one sip.

219
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,291
It's an important part of the experiment.

220
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,708
What are you feeling?

221
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,125
Why is the carrot juice spicy?

222
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you plan to keep pranking me
and ask how I feel?

223
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:26,916
Of course not.

224
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,666
I've done plenty of research about you.

225
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:33,333
Next, I'll ask you a few questions

226
00:13:33,416 --> 00:13:36,333
to determine the period
where your memory might linger.

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,916
Ma Xiu

228
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,375
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,375
You can answer the call.

230
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:47,833
No need, let's get started.

231
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:52,791
Do you remember which year you won
your first Best Songwriter Award?

232
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:56,833
In 20...

233
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:58,041
In 2011.

234
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,375
That's correct.

235
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,000
You're funny.

236
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,500
I'm not, I'm dead serious.

237
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,208
I'm trying to connect with you
using music.

238
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:12,666
In the 2016 Golden Melody Awards,

239
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,791
which song did you lose to?

240
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,458
"Breakup."

241
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:25,291
That's correct.

242
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:28,833
Ma Xiu

243
00:14:31,833 --> 00:14:33,958
Honestly, I still can't understand

244
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,458
why that song got more votes than mine.

245
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:38,583
Let me tell you why.

246
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,500
Because there are too many two-timing men

247
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:42,541
and women are silly.

248
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:43,916
Once she falls in love,

249
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,166
she'll do anything for him.

250
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,375
But what does she get in the end?

251
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:50,541
Being cheated on.

252
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,000
Are you okay?

253
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:55,666
I'm fine.

254
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:58,791
We can talk about it.

255
00:14:59,708 --> 00:15:01,875
I don't think we should.

256
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,250
Why not?

257
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:07,041
A therapist shouldn't discuss
her personal issues with a patient.

258
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,375
But I'm different.

259
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,000
I'll forget everything tomorrow.

260
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,250
That's true.

261
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,541
His name is Ma Xiu.

262
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:25,625
It's not the first time he cheated on me.

263
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,625
He used to beg for forgiveness every time.

264
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:29,916
But this time,

265
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,125
he had the nerve to tell me

266
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,958
he wanted to break up.

267
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:37,166
I refused. I want to see what he can do.

268
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:40,333
It seems you want to break up too,

269
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:42,250
but you can't let go of your grudges.

270
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:44,625
I can help you.

271
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:46,291
What does he do?

272
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,125
He's a musician.

273
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:51,416
My mom used to say
that all musicians are two-timers.

274
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,916
I always contradicted her.

275
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:57,625
Sorry, I didn't mean you.

276
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,708
It's okay.

277
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:01,541
So tell me more.

278
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,666
What are his flaws?

279
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:06,708
He insists that he has long thick hair.

280
00:16:06,875 --> 00:16:08,833
The truth is his hairline is receding.

281
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,333
He always wears a cap.

282
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,625
-He's bald on the top.
-He's bald on the top?

283
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,625
Yes.

284
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,625
Bald at the top.

285
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,458
He always claims

286
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,166
that he doesn't care about body types,

287
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,625
but he only follows busty chicks on Weibo.

288
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:24,750
What are you doing?

289
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,500
Don't mind me.

290
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,791
Busty...

291
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,500
-Busty chick.
-Busty chick?

292
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:33,166
He also tattooed his eyebrows

293
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,458
and they got way too thick.

294
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:36,250
But he denied that he had done it

295
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,916
and even accused me instead.

296
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,083
I would never do that.

297
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,541
Ma Xiu

298
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,291
Is that him calling?

299
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,208
Yes.

300
00:16:45,291 --> 00:16:46,916
Wait, give me a second.

301
00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:51,375
Okay, bring it closer.

302
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,291
Wait for me.

303
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,083
Put him through.

304
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,916
-Put him through?
-Turn on the speakerphone.

305
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,500
Hi, Ma Xiu.

306
00:17:02,083 --> 00:17:04,166
You're a VIP of two-timers

307
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,666
Your calling is to cheat

308
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,500
Not only did you look
at busty chicks' Weibo

309
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,708
But you also secretly tattooed your brows

310
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,833
With little hair to comb over with

311
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:15,375
Ma Xiu, you're gross indeed

312
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,208
You're a VIP of two-timers

313
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,250
Two-timer VIP

314
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:20,333
It hurts.

315
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, two-timer VIP

316
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,541
Two-timer VIP

317
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,125
Who would fall for you, creep?

318
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:27,625
Ma Xiu!

319
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:31,000
Who's that? Who sang just now?

320
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:32,750
Who are you with?

321
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,166
It's your turn, come on.

322
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,375
Hey, say something.

323
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,541
I no longer have feelings for you,
two-timing jerk.

324
00:17:37,625 --> 00:17:39,750
I hereby declare that we are finished.

325
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,250
Remember this.
I dumped you, not vice versa.

326
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:45,500
What are you feeling?

327
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,041
-I'm elated.
-Elated.

328
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,291
-I'm greatly relieved.
-That's the power of music.

329
00:17:52,708 --> 00:17:53,750
Thank you.

330
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:57,583
But you don't fit the description
in your profile.

331
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,041
What description?

332
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:00,416
A serial cheater.

333
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,791
Goodness, our time is up.

334
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,666
I apologize for only talking about myself

335
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,166
and neglecting your therapy.

336
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,333
How about this?

337
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,166
Do you have time tomorrow?

338
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,583
-Tomorrow?
-Yes.

339
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,833
Check the calendar on your phone.

340
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:21,375
I'm free tomorrow.

341
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:24,125
Good, let's meet
at the same time tomorrow.

342
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,416
Promise me

343
00:18:27,583 --> 00:18:29,666
you won't write down what I said today.

344
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,208
Don't worry.

345
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,833
Your secrets are safe with me.

346
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:34,791
Good.

347
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,583
Thank you for today.

348
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,375
-Bye.
-Wait.

349
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,458
My assignment for you
is to continue to write songs.

350
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:46,875
Creativity can enhance your therapy.

351
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,333
I hope you can trust me.

352
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:49,458
Let's work together.

353
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:52,166
Thank you.

354
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,833
I'll work hard.

355
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,250
What was that for?

356
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,375
The file says the last thing you remember

357
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,708
is being slapped by a woman.

358
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:01,833
Do you remember anything?

359
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:03,291
Not at all.

360
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,375
Not this time.

361
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,000
But maybe next time.

362
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:07,166
There's next time?

363
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,625
Come on. I'll see you out.

364
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,333
No need, I know my way around.

365
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,791
Lu Hong,

366
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,583
what brings you here?

367
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,958
I want to meet your new therapist.

368
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,666
I told you I could handle it myself.

369
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,791
What happened to your face?

370
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,041
What's that red mark?

371
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:28,916
It's part of the experiment.

372
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:31,583
Hi.

373
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:32,708
Hi, Ms. Lu.

374
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,833
I'm Lu Yao's therapist, Xu Xingyue.

375
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,625
How old are you?

376
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,708
I'm 28.

377
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,333
Actually, I'm not a doctor yet.

378
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,875
I'm writing my PhD thesis.

379
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,166
You're a PhD student?

380
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,583
They found a student to give you therapy.

381
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,625
Then they will write about your case
and publish a thesis.

382
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:51,708
Is that right?

383
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,166
No worries, Ms. Lu.

384
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,875
I won't use Lu Yao's real name.

385
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:56,000
I really want to help him.

386
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,500
Right, thank you.

387
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:58,541
Lu Hong.

388
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,083
-What's with the attitude?
-Xingyue is very serious.

389
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,916
Let's go.

390
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:05,958
Thank you.

391
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,208
-What's with the attitude?
-Nothing.

392
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,208
Thank you, Xingyue.

393
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,333
Stop pulling me.

394
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,750
Therapist

395
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,000
Hi, Lu Yao.

396
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,916
I'm your therapist, Xu Xingyue.

397
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,708
Hi.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Why is it so cold?

399
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:55,583
Come in.

400
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:57,250
It's part of the experiment.

401
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,333
Please describe how cold you're feeling.

402
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,208
It's freezing cold.

403
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,500
That hurts.

404
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,166
What's that?

405
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,083
Do you remember?

406
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,833
Remember what?

407
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,791
Do you remember
drinking spicy carrot juice?

408
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,291
Water...

409
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,041
I went a little overboard today.

410
00:21:28,291 --> 00:21:29,250
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:31,791
I almost forgot.

412
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:38,958
What's this?

413
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:40,541
A lime-scented perfume.

414
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:42,708
I'll use this in every meeting.

415
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,416
By stimulating your olfactory bulb,

416
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,208
I may make your subconscious remember me.

417
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:48,500
You've got many gadgets here.

418
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:50,166
These aren't gadgets.

419
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:51,666
Let me explain.

420
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:53,666
The hardest memories
for human brains to lose

421
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,250
are people or things
that give us special feelings.

422
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,500
I'm trying to create
emotional memories for you

423
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:00,000
by stimulating your five senses.

424
00:22:05,583 --> 00:22:06,958
Go ahead, answer the call.

425
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:07,875
There's no need.

426
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,250
Yesterday was bad enough.

427
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,916
I can't be distracted again.

428
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,041
I'll turn it off.

429
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,291
Today, I'll use hearing
to stimulate your memory.

430
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,666
Xingyue, your landlord is on the phone.

431
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:26,375
But I'm busy.

432
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:29,125
There's an emergency at your house.
You should talk to him.

433
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,666
Excuse me, I need to step outside.

434
00:22:31,958 --> 00:22:32,791
It's okay.

435
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,333
I'm sorry, Lu Yao.

436
00:22:51,416 --> 00:22:53,041
I really have an emergency.

437
00:22:53,125 --> 00:22:54,833
Let's postpone this session, okay?

438
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,250
Do you need a lift?

439
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,958
-Thank you.
-No problem.

440
00:23:17,458 --> 00:23:18,500
Do you need a hand?

441
00:23:18,583 --> 00:23:19,500
I'm fine, thank you.

442
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:26,583
No way.

443
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:27,833
This is bad.

444
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:32,625
No.

445
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:36,458
My gosh.

446
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:38,916
I'm doomed.

447
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,416
Come help me!

448
00:23:57,333 --> 00:23:58,416
Get the towel.

449
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,333
Towel...

450
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,125
Here you go.

451
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,250
Where is your main shutoff valve?

452
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:06,833
In the bathroom.

453
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,333
I shut it off! Did it work?

454
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:47,166
Did you write all these?

455
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:53,083
Do you have copies?

456
00:25:05,166 --> 00:25:06,416
Once the papers dry,

457
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,000
the print will become legible again.

458
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,000
Then we can make copies.

459
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,708
So there's no need to be sad.

460
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:16,250
Thank you.

461
00:25:18,208 --> 00:25:19,625
This belongs to my ex.

462
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,916
You can wear it if you don't mind.

463
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:24,291
"Dragon Punk"?

464
00:25:25,541 --> 00:25:26,625
That's his band.

465
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:30,083
He's the lead singer.

466
00:25:30,958 --> 00:25:32,583
I've never heard of them.

467
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:38,833
Give me your t-shirt.

468
00:25:38,916 --> 00:25:40,000
I'll hang it to dry.

469
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,791
Thank you.

470
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,708
Who are you?

471
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,083
Why are you wearing my clothes?

472
00:25:54,958 --> 00:25:57,000
We broke up. Why are you even here?

473
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,750
No wonder you changed the lock

474
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,875
as soon as we broke up.

475
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,458
You've got yourself a new boyfriend.

476
00:26:05,125 --> 00:26:06,500
I don't want to see you.

477
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:07,458
Get out.

478
00:26:07,708 --> 00:26:09,125
I've come to take my stuff.

479
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,166
What stuff? What right do you have?

480
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:14,291
-The guitar you bought me.
-I gave it to him.

481
00:26:14,375 --> 00:26:15,708
-You gave it to him?
-Yes.

482
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:16,833
Can he even play?

483
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:18,208
That's none of your own business.

484
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:26,583
Kid.

485
00:26:27,125 --> 00:26:29,750
That guitar is too good for you, got it?

486
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,625
Don't touch him.

487
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,833
You wear my clothes

488
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,916
and date my woman.

489
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,416
Watch your mouth.

490
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,375
Fine.

491
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,291
I'll be generous.

492
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,250
You keep the woman.

493
00:26:47,291 --> 00:26:48,291
I'll take the guitar.

494
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:50,958
Stay put.

495
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,916
Why?

496
00:26:53,541 --> 00:26:54,833
Have you got more men in there?

497
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,208
Is anyone there?

498
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:00,083
You mad woman!

499
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:01,000
What are you doing?

500
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:04,916
Are you all right?

501
00:27:12,541 --> 00:27:13,541
Stop it.

502
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,166
Stop it.

503
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,333
I said stop it!

504
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,250
Take your crappy guitar.

505
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:24,500
Get out!

506
00:27:32,833 --> 00:27:34,083
Are you all right?

507
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,041
-You're hurt.
-I'm fine.

508
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,625
Are you all right?

509
00:27:57,166 --> 00:27:58,583
Where did you find a guitar?

510
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,375
It was in my trunk.

511
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:04,333
I want to write a song to mock your ex,

512
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,625
then you'll feel better.

513
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,541
You've already written such a song.

514
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:09,958
I did?

515
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,291
Yes.

516
00:28:12,125 --> 00:28:13,333
How was it?

517
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:14,666
It was very creative.

518
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:21,625
Are you feeling better?

519
00:28:22,041 --> 00:28:23,916
Yes, the cold beer helps.

520
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,416
Do you want some red wine?

521
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,500
Sure.

522
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,083
Thank you.

523
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:43,208
I've wanted to punch him for a long time.

524
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,833
A man like him is not worth your tears.

525
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:56,666
"That person who leaves
after sharing passion

526
00:28:57,625 --> 00:29:02,708
is just a transition in the narration."

527
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,083
Am I right?

528
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:06,333
How do you know these lines?

529
00:29:06,416 --> 00:29:07,583
I saw them at your place.

530
00:29:07,666 --> 00:29:08,708
Did you write them?

531
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:10,666
You're very talented.

532
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:14,458
My high school teacher
said the same thing.

533
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:18,041
My dream was to become a poet
like Joy Haijo

534
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,541
and publish a poetry collection.

535
00:29:19,875 --> 00:29:20,958
Joy Haijo.

536
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,083
An American poet.

537
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,041
You know her?

538
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:26,041
Of course.

539
00:29:26,666 --> 00:29:27,541
How?

540
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,625
I'm well-read.

541
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,625
Joy Haijo hosts a workshop
in the US every year

542
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,833
to invite poets
with different mother tongues

543
00:29:36,916 --> 00:29:38,833
to translate her work.

544
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:41,458
It was my dream to submit my poems

545
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,625
and attend this workshop.

546
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,166
And?

547
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:50,750
It never happened.

548
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,000
I've entered many poetry contests.

549
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,125
For reasons I don't understand,

550
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:59,166
I received harsh criticism every time.

551
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:03,000
Never mind.

552
00:30:04,125 --> 00:30:05,666
My manuscripts are ruined now.

553
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,625
It's my fate.

554
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,583
From now on,
I'll focus on being a good therapist

555
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,041
and handle your case.

556
00:30:13,666 --> 00:30:15,916
I'm sure you can handle my case well.

557
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,625
But isn't it lame to quit
after getting some criticism?

558
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:21,958
I mean it.

559
00:30:23,083 --> 00:30:25,375
Before I broke into the industry,

560
00:30:25,541 --> 00:30:27,750
I was apprenticing
at a veteran songwriter's studio.

561
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,250
I once played him the songs that I wrote.

562
00:30:31,333 --> 00:30:32,833
I wanted his advice.

563
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:34,291
Guess what he told me.

564
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,208
He said,

565
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,458
"Lu Yao, are people supposed
to enjoy listening to this?"

566
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:38,625
What the heck are these?

567
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:39,791
You call this music?

568
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:43,250
-How could he say that?
-He said much worse.

569
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:44,958
But never mind.

570
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,500
At that moment,

571
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,958
a cure-all saying came into my mind.

572
00:30:50,041 --> 00:30:53,458
It went on to help me
get through many bad days.

573
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,791
Without it, I wouldn't be here today.

574
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,958
What's that?

575
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,083
Screw him.

576
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:02,791
Look. I wasn't mocking you.

577
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:06,041
I said "screw him" all the time
while sending out demos.

578
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,458
Guess what.

579
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:10,125
Someone finally picked up my song,

580
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,791
"Imperishable Love."

581
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:13,083
You see,

582
00:31:13,166 --> 00:31:15,541
if I hadn't cursed them and persevered,

583
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,250
that song would have never been heard.

584
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:21,125
Repeat after me.

585
00:31:21,791 --> 00:31:22,708
Screw him.

586
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:24,625
Screw him.

587
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,375
As creative workers,

588
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:33,000
we create when we have things to say.

589
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,583
If we have things to say,

590
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:36,000
an audience will emerge.

591
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,083
Now, I'm your audience.

592
00:31:41,375 --> 00:31:42,416
You can improvise.

593
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,666
Improvise?

594
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,125
You can do it. Be confident.

595
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,333
What's the title?

596
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:50,625
You and I.

597
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,416
You and I.

598
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:00,416
-Give me some time.
-Of course.

599
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:08,583
Screw him.

600
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:18,666
How many

601
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:21,583
looks of willfulness,

602
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:25,875
how many

603
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,583
sounds of discord,

604
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:35,125
how many shared secrets

605
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,333
before we become you and I?

606
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:50,666
How many

607
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:54,291
How many looks of willfulness

608
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,916
How many

609
00:32:57,708 --> 00:33:00,208
sounds of discord

610
00:33:00,291 --> 00:33:06,125
How many shared secrets

611
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:10,125
Before we become you and I

612
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,458
It's amazing.

613
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:14,833
Go on.

614
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,416
How sensitive are your actions,

615
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:27,791
how relentless is your courage

616
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,875
that made you the memory

617
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:35,750
that can never be erased?

618
00:33:41,791 --> 00:33:45,541
How sensitive are your actions

619
00:33:45,625 --> 00:33:50,458
How relentless is your courage

620
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:55,000
That made you the memory

621
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:58,000
That can never be erased

622
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,833
I will say I do 10,000 times.

623
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:11,833
I will say I do 10,000 times

624
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,875
It's lovely.

625
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:18,916
Did you just come up with that?

626
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:22,875
I was tipsy. I was just goofing around.

627
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:25,708
Did you just come up with that?

628
00:34:26,166 --> 00:34:27,000
Yes.

629
00:34:27,958 --> 00:34:29,708
I was inspired by your lyrics.

630
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:32,791
How about this?

631
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:35,625
Would you be my lyricist?

632
00:34:36,166 --> 00:34:38,375
I can't, definitely not.

633
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:39,958
Listen.

634
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,166
I already overstepped my bounds
by drinking with you.

635
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,708
Your bounds?

636
00:34:48,583 --> 00:34:50,166
If you write lyrics for me,

637
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,541
we'll be work partners.

638
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,625
You'll be my lyricist,

639
00:34:53,708 --> 00:34:55,000
not my therapist.

640
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:56,333
So there's no such bound.

641
00:34:56,791 --> 00:34:57,958
No way.

642
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,583
Stop joking.

643
00:34:59,666 --> 00:35:00,708
Listen,

644
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:02,791
I already failed to graduate last year.

645
00:35:03,041 --> 00:35:04,250
That means this year,

646
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:07,833
I must complete
your case study regardless.

647
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,583
If you become my lyricist,

648
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:13,708
you can come to my house

649
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,958
and get in-depth information

650
00:35:16,041 --> 00:35:17,708
on how an amnesiac lives.

651
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:19,541
Wouldn't that be a big help
to your research?

652
00:35:21,916 --> 00:35:23,125
You must keep it a secret.

653
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:24,041
Of course.

654
00:35:24,125 --> 00:35:26,125
-The school must never find out.
-They won't.

655
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:27,583
If they do, I'm done for.

656
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,208
I will never tell.

657
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,541
So it's a deal?

658
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:36,416
Yes!

659
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,125
Let's set a time.

660
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:42,000
Come to my house at 9 a.m. tomorrow, okay?

661
00:35:42,083 --> 00:35:43,291
You can't back out now.

662
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,291
You won't, right?

663
00:35:46,291 --> 00:35:47,750
Let's take a photo.

664
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:49,625
-Take a photo?
-Yes.

665
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,916
-Don't.
-Why not?

666
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,958
I'm a mess.

667
00:35:52,041 --> 00:35:53,958
Come on, I want a memento.

668
00:35:54,041 --> 00:35:55,166
No.

669
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,291
Today was memorable.

670
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:57,791
We had our first collaboration.

671
00:35:58,166 --> 00:35:59,916
We might even write a great song together.

672
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:01,666
Here.

673
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:05,083
One, two, three.

674
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:20,791
What have you done?

675
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:21,958
What do you think?

676
00:36:22,083 --> 00:36:23,750
It's fine. It serves to remind me.

677
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,833
-Is that okay?
-Sure.

678
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,416
You can

679
00:36:31,708 --> 00:36:32,666
just relax tomorrow.

680
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,750
Is it okay to leave your car behind?

681
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,875
Yes, I'll get it tomorrow.

682
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,250
It's raining.

683
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,000
It's raining!

684
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:47,500
It's raining harder.

685
00:36:47,583 --> 00:36:49,916
I'm sorry, give me a second.

686
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,708
What's happening?

687
00:37:21,958 --> 00:37:23,750
We got soaked all day.

688
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,208
We got soaked through.

689
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,708
Are you all right?

690
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:43,541
Thank you for everything today.

691
00:37:44,625 --> 00:37:46,250
My place is over there.

692
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,375
Wait a minute.

693
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,708
Let's empty the bottle before you go.

694
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:58,666
Sure.

695
00:37:58,750 --> 00:37:59,833
We'll both drink.

696
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,041
Take it easy.

697
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:07,375
Are you all right?

698
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:08,291
I'm fine.

699
00:38:12,083 --> 00:38:15,583
I am here with you

700
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:18,708
My love will be with you

701
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:23,583
When I, when I am gone

702
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,625
I'm your therapist.

703
00:38:45,625 --> 00:38:46,708
Right.

704
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,125
You're my therapist.

705
00:38:50,666 --> 00:38:52,083
I'm your patient.

706
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,166
Right.

707
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,041
I have to go.

708
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:32,375
What were you thinking?

709
00:39:32,541 --> 00:39:33,375
You can't.

710
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:35,000
You must not.

711
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:45,708
Signs that a shrink is falling in love
with their patient

712
00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:50,458
"You've spent more time
on a particular patient."

713
00:39:52,125 --> 00:39:53,458
I only have one patient.

714
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:57,125
"You've visited that patient
during your off time."

715
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:01,125
I'll be working tomorrow.

716
00:40:01,208 --> 00:40:02,791
I'll be working as a lyricist, okay?

717
00:40:02,875 --> 00:40:04,666
"You've rearranged your schedule

718
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,000
to spend more time with him."

719
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:08,791
Tomorrow...

720
00:40:08,875 --> 00:40:10,625
Tomorrow is my day off to begin with.

721
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,583
It's my day off.

722
00:40:12,666 --> 00:40:14,958
"You've answered questions
unrelated to the therapy

723
00:40:15,041 --> 00:40:18,041
involving your personal life."

724
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,666
Let's skip this one.

725
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,333
"You've touched your patient
in an atypical manner

726
00:40:23,416 --> 00:40:26,333
like resting your hand
on your patient's shoulder."

727
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,958
Of course not, I would never do that.

728
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:31,750
Out of these five signs,

729
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:34,166
I scored four no's.

730
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:37,583
See, I'm not unprofessional.

731
00:40:37,833 --> 00:40:39,375
Stop imagining things.

732
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,416
It's shower time.

733
00:40:44,333 --> 00:40:46,833
Xingyue's Dream: Joy Haijo's workshop

734
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:49,500
Joy Haijo.

735
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:56,833
Lu Yao.

736
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,875
You've got to remember Xingyue

737
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:02,875
because...

738
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,041
you've fallen in love with her.

739
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:33,583
You're mine

740
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:39,666
Hi.

741
00:42:42,416 --> 00:42:43,416
Hi.

742
00:42:48,541 --> 00:42:49,416
Come in.

743
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:53,375
My gosh.

744
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:57,125
Your place is so spacious and stylish.

745
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,916
Can I look around and take some pictures?

746
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,833
Sure, no problem.

747
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,875
This sculpture is super cool.

748
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:09,375
Is this Michael Jackson?

749
00:43:09,458 --> 00:43:10,291
Yes.

750
00:43:11,375 --> 00:43:12,958
This is Yang Mian's sculpture.

751
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,708
I've always liked his work.

752
00:43:14,875 --> 00:43:15,916
Come and look at this.

753
00:43:17,666 --> 00:43:19,541
It's one of his RGB pieces.

754
00:43:20,541 --> 00:43:23,791
If you stare at the picture on the left
for two minutes

755
00:43:23,875 --> 00:43:24,958
and shut your eyes,

756
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:27,333
the picture on the right
will pop up in your mind.

757
00:43:27,958 --> 00:43:29,833
-Really?
-Give it a try.

758
00:43:30,166 --> 00:43:31,250
Look at this one first.

759
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:43,625
-What was that?
-I'm tidying up my sticky notes.

760
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:45,625
Sticky notes.

761
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:46,916
Would you like a drink?

762
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,166
Sure.

763
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:49,625
How about carrot juice?

764
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:52,458
What?

765
00:43:53,708 --> 00:43:54,583
Carrot juice.

766
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:59,250
Yes, I love carrot juice.

767
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:03,583
Here's your carrot juice.

768
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:12,916
What's wrong?

769
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:14,875
Nothing.

770
00:44:22,166 --> 00:44:23,791
We can start whenever you're ready.

771
00:44:25,666 --> 00:44:28,875
I think our improvisation last night
was amazing.

772
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:31,041
I'll play a verse for you first.

773
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:36,583
How many looks of willfulness

774
00:44:36,666 --> 00:44:40,041
How many sounds of discord

775
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:44,291
How many shared secrets

776
00:44:44,375 --> 00:44:47,500
Before we become you and I

777
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:52,208
You and I

778
00:44:52,291 --> 00:44:55,333
You and I

779
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:58,958
You and I

780
00:44:59,041 --> 00:45:01,708
-You and I
-Wait.

781
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:04,291
I'm used to brainstorming by myself.

782
00:45:04,833 --> 00:45:06,291
My mind is blank now.

783
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,958
No problem.
It will eventually come to you.

784
00:45:09,041 --> 00:45:10,541
I'll go over there to write.

785
00:45:26,166 --> 00:45:28,625
I'll play the piano
for you to soak up the vibe.

786
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,416
No.

787
00:45:36,791 --> 00:45:37,875
I have no inspiration.

788
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,583
Can I have some wine?

789
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:47,458
Here.

790
00:45:53,708 --> 00:45:54,916
Xingyue.

791
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:01,708
Can I have another one?

792
00:46:02,041 --> 00:46:03,500
Xingyue, this isn't right.

793
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,875
You're about to get drunk.

794
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:05,916
Think again.

795
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,791
When you brainstorm at home,

796
00:46:07,875 --> 00:46:10,208
what do you normally do?

797
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:11,750
Normally?

798
00:46:12,791 --> 00:46:13,958
I normally...

799
00:46:23,875 --> 00:46:26,208
Which is better,
"gratifying" or "reassuring"?

800
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:27,583
"Reassuring."

801
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:29,833
-"Gratifying" doesn't sound right.
-Which one rhymes...

802
00:46:30,291 --> 00:46:31,916
-"Reassuring"?
-"Reassuring."

803
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,500
"Anytime at all

804
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:37,291
is reassuring."

805
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,250
"Anytime at all is reassuring."

806
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,375
Yes.

807
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:44,041
Taking a shower certainly helps.

808
00:46:46,208 --> 00:46:48,666
But my skin is peeling off.

809
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:52,208
How do you like the dishes?

810
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:54,250
The dirtier, the better.

811
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,166
You want them dirty?

812
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,375
Yes, dirty.

813
00:46:57,458 --> 00:46:59,083
Chili sauce, vinegar, and soy sauce.

814
00:46:59,166 --> 00:47:00,500
Hurry.

815
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,916
Let's write a part about a movie date.

816
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,458
Most couples go on movie dates.

817
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,083
Movie dates?

818
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,583
Lu Yao.

819
00:47:12,041 --> 00:47:13,875
Do you cry when you watch movies?

820
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:16,833
Sure.

821
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:19,083
I cry when I'm touched.

822
00:47:22,458 --> 00:47:24,833
Okay, let's change it to

823
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:26,416
"What was the movie

824
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,208
that made us cry like little kids?"

825
00:47:32,166 --> 00:47:33,041
"Us"?

826
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,500
Yes, "us."

827
00:47:34,791 --> 00:47:37,125
"Made us cry like little kids."

828
00:47:39,333 --> 00:47:40,375
That's good.

829
00:47:40,708 --> 00:47:42,541
What do you want me to play
to inspire you?

830
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:45,791
Whatever will do.

831
00:47:46,291 --> 00:47:47,791
I'm trying to find the emotion.

832
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,083
Is it done?

833
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:03,875
Listen to this.

834
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,750
Can I have another hamburger later?

835
00:48:10,916 --> 00:48:12,625
Yes, but take a break for now.

836
00:48:12,708 --> 00:48:14,666
Listen to our song first, okay?

837
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:15,916
Focus.

838
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,833
A cuddle at night

839
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:27,083
So ordinary but so blissful

840
00:48:27,791 --> 00:48:30,916
In this chilly weather

841
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:34,708
Spicy hot pot matters

842
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,333
Wait.

843
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:38,875
Why is there a hot pot all of a sudden?

844
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,375
Isn't it kind of odd?

845
00:48:40,958 --> 00:48:41,791
Is it?

846
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,041
Little Fatty.

847
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,833
Do you have a problem with the hot pot?

848
00:48:45,916 --> 00:48:46,875
-No.
-See?

849
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:47,958
I quite like it.

850
00:48:48,041 --> 00:48:50,125
What about the song?

851
00:48:50,208 --> 00:48:51,166
It's great.

852
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,166
-Little Fatty.
-He says it's great.

853
00:48:56,083 --> 00:48:57,666
I'll think about it on my own.

854
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:16,833
Lu Yao.

855
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,416
Lu Yao.

856
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:21,958
Cheers.

857
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:24,875
Cheers.

858
00:49:27,875 --> 00:49:29,083
Did you open a new bottle?

859
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:31,166
Can't I?

860
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:33,666
Go easy on the drinking.
We have to sing later.

861
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,291
Cut the crap.

862
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:39,083
Can you get me nominated
for the Best New Lyricist Award?

863
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:40,833
What?

864
00:49:40,916 --> 00:49:43,625
The Best New Lyricist Award.

865
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:46,250
I'll get you nominated
if there is such an award,

866
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:47,291
but there isn't.

867
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:48,916
Don't patronize me.

868
00:49:50,291 --> 00:49:52,708
Go easy on the champagne.
You have to sing later.

869
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:54,208
I know.

870
00:50:31,083 --> 00:50:31,916
Xingyue.

871
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:33,458
I'm all set.

872
00:50:33,541 --> 00:50:34,625
Let's start recording.

873
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:36,333
Are you sure?

874
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:37,291
Come on, hurry.

875
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:39,333
I'm a bad singer.

876
00:50:40,666 --> 00:50:42,291
Hello.

877
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,166
I'm a singer now.

878
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,250
Yes.

879
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:47,333
Really?

880
00:50:48,208 --> 00:50:49,166
Just a second.

881
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:54,916
First, I would like to thank my fans,

882
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,750
my mom, and my dad.

883
00:50:57,125 --> 00:50:59,083
Wait, I also want to thank

884
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,250
-Lu Yao for giving me the chance.
-Calm down.

885
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,791
You have to get ready
and settle down, okay?

886
00:51:04,708 --> 00:51:05,666
All good?

887
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,166
Don't you think I'll mess up?

888
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,750
-No.
-It's my first recording.

889
00:51:10,958 --> 00:51:11,958
Take it easy.

890
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:13,541
Relax.

891
00:51:13,625 --> 00:51:14,458
Okay.

892
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:29,583
A cuddle at night

893
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:36,250
So ordinary but so blissful

894
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,750
In this chilly weather

895
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:42,791
We breathe on each other

896
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:45,250
To keep colds at bay

897
00:51:45,333 --> 00:51:49,916
What was the movie

898
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:57,000
That made us cry like little kids

899
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:03,166
Impish, carefree, it's all okay

900
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:09,666
Even your fuming face
is taking my breath away

901
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:14,375
How many looks of willfulness

902
00:52:14,458 --> 00:52:17,791
How many sounds of discord

903
00:52:17,875 --> 00:52:19,375
How many...

904
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:52,166
Joy Haijo Translation Workshop

905
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:06,958
Lu Yao, believe me.

906
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,291
After what happened today,

907
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:12,583
you don't want to ever forget Xingyue.

908
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:15,875
When you wake up tomorrow,

909
00:54:16,375 --> 00:54:17,708
tell her

910
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:19,458
that you love her.

911
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,250
Professor Shu

912
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:10,916
It's a pity

913
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,291
that you'll forget me when you wake up.

914
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:54,958
Good morning, doctor.

915
00:55:55,291 --> 00:55:57,250
-Good morning.
-Nice weather today.

916
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:58,666
What a firm grip.

917
00:55:58,750 --> 00:55:59,875
You must be doing well.

918
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:01,416
What happened? Tell me.

919
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,541
Nothing special. I'm just in love.

920
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:07,875
What did you say?

921
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:09,916
I'm in love.

922
00:56:11,666 --> 00:56:12,791
Listen to him.

923
00:56:12,875 --> 00:56:15,625
Just because he has a few photos
and voice memos,

924
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:16,875
he thinks he's in love.

925
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,250
You can't keep your memories,
but you talk about love.

926
00:56:19,333 --> 00:56:22,083
My memory may be broken,
but my emotions are intact.

927
00:56:22,166 --> 00:56:24,708
The moment I see her pictures,
all my feelings for her return.

928
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:27,958
That's true.

929
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:31,250
His brain may not retain
new data permanently,

930
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:34,041
but his feelings for things
and people may grow.

931
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:36,125
Our memories and feelings are processed

932
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:37,708
by two entirely different systems.

933
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:40,416
In short, Lu Yao is still capable of love.

934
00:56:41,041 --> 00:56:42,583
I'm capable of love, Lu Hong.

935
00:56:43,375 --> 00:56:44,708
Then what's her name?

936
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:45,875
Where did you meet her?

937
00:56:45,958 --> 00:56:47,416
I'll tell you when the time is right.

938
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,291
You can't even remember her.

939
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,875
-But you love her?
-All right.

940
00:56:51,375 --> 00:56:53,791
Let's fill out the questionnaire
for his periodic follow-up.

941
00:56:53,958 --> 00:56:55,833
Has Lu Yao experienced any symptoms lately

942
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:58,750
like headaches or dizziness?

943
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:01,416
He told me he felt dizzy on Wednesday.

944
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,250
I'm sorry, we can't talk about that now.

945
00:57:03,333 --> 00:57:04,208
Here.

946
00:57:05,333 --> 00:57:06,333
Doctor, look at this.

947
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,333
I found this on the Internet.

948
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:11,000
It's a scientific paper published
by the University of Pennsylvania.

949
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:13,375
By planting an electrode
in the human brain,

950
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:15,166
they can electrically stimulate the brain

951
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:18,833
to improve memory function
of amnesiacs like me.

952
00:57:19,375 --> 00:57:21,083
I want to try this treatment.

953
00:57:21,166 --> 00:57:23,375
I'm young and able to afford it.

954
00:57:23,958 --> 00:57:25,125
What do you both think?

955
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,500
I'm sorry, Lu Yao.

956
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:32,875
This experimental treatment

957
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,583
was given to you a year ago,

958
00:57:35,666 --> 00:57:36,583
but to no avail.

959
00:57:43,583 --> 00:57:46,250
Did I get the most up-to-date treatment?

960
00:57:46,958 --> 00:57:47,875
You did.

961
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,000
So for now,

962
00:57:56,791 --> 00:57:58,250
there aren't other options?

963
00:58:02,375 --> 00:58:03,583
Not at the moment.

964
00:58:06,833 --> 00:58:07,750
Lu Yao.

965
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:10,708
Do not despair.

966
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:14,250
There have been patients

967
00:58:14,333 --> 00:58:17,750
who are able to retrieve memories
after hearing a familiar song

968
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:19,333
or smelling a particular scent.

969
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,375
That's why you must remain optimistic.

970
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,166
You'll recover one day.

971
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,375
When will that be?

972
00:58:27,083 --> 00:58:28,333
I don't want to wait anymore.

973
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:31,541
I want to be like everyone

974
00:58:31,625 --> 00:58:34,041
and remember what happens and whom I meet.

975
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,250
I want to be normal. Why can't I even...

976
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,083
Why can't I even do these basic things?

977
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,833
Do you know how it feels?

978
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:42,375
It's like drifting alone in the sea,

979
00:58:42,458 --> 00:58:44,750
struggling to hold onto something in vain.

980
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:46,791
Do you know how it feels

981
00:58:46,875 --> 00:58:48,625
to be robbed of your tomorrow?

982
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:49,791
"Wait."

983
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,250
All I do is wait!

984
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:54,541
Excuse me.

985
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,083
Okay, until then.

986
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,250
Go ahead.

987
00:59:06,791 --> 00:59:09,250
I'm making good progress
in the case study.

988
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,125
He suddenly fell in love
with carrot juice.

989
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:13,875
His fridge is now filled
with carrot juice,

990
00:59:13,958 --> 00:59:15,583
but there are no other drinks.

991
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:18,208
It's because I gave him carrot juice
during therapy.

992
00:59:18,708 --> 00:59:22,333
His house has many scented products
that smell just like my lime perfume.

993
00:59:22,916 --> 00:59:24,833
His walls are plastered with sticky notes.

994
00:59:24,916 --> 00:59:26,916
Even his shower screen is custom-made

995
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,333
to display water-proof sticky notes.

996
00:59:33,083 --> 00:59:35,875
How did you find out
all these intimate details?

997
00:59:37,916 --> 00:59:39,041
He told me.

998
00:59:40,791 --> 00:59:41,958
I asked him

999
00:59:43,166 --> 00:59:44,791
to keep a daily journal

1000
00:59:44,875 --> 00:59:46,125
and share it with me.

1001
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,041
I got these details from his journal.

1002
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:50,291
Did you violate the code of ethics?

1003
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,375
No.

1004
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,083
It seems your methodology
is producing substantial results.

1005
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:58,291
Tell my assistant about your next session.

1006
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,458
I'll arrange for all the PhD students
to observe you.

1007
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:04,541
All PhD students?

1008
01:00:05,333 --> 01:00:06,291
Do you have a problem?

1009
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:07,500
No.

1010
01:00:15,708 --> 01:00:19,416
Do you remember the last time

1011
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,250
we got wasted?

1012
01:00:26,541 --> 01:00:27,458
No.

1013
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,208
It was when I got divorced.

1014
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:34,625
Back then,

1015
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,041
when you heard
that he was still fooling around,

1016
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,833
you beat him up for me.

1017
01:00:41,708 --> 01:00:44,666
You grabbed his collar
and threw a couple of punches.

1018
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,750
You were so cool.

1019
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,500
Lu Hong.

1020
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,666
You had it rough.

1021
01:01:00,208 --> 01:01:02,166
I want to tell you this.

1022
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:06,625
Don't waste so much effort

1023
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,791
on this thing called love.

1024
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,666
Love is a game.

1025
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:14,458
Whoever takes it too seriously
is the loser.

1026
01:01:15,625 --> 01:01:17,750
Life is not easy for you.

1027
01:01:18,625 --> 01:01:21,208
Why make it more difficult?

1028
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:22,416
This time is different.

1029
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,208
I love her.

1030
01:01:27,291 --> 01:01:28,916
I really want to be with her.

1031
01:01:29,708 --> 01:01:30,583
Okay.

1032
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:32,583
I'm not playing games.

1033
01:01:33,458 --> 01:01:35,208
Is she aware of your condition?

1034
01:01:39,083 --> 01:01:39,958
What?

1035
01:01:41,208 --> 01:01:42,875
You've tried all day

1036
01:01:42,958 --> 01:01:44,041
to find out who she is.

1037
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,208
I have not.

1038
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:50,875
So?

1039
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:56,583
She's my therapist.

1040
01:02:31,958 --> 01:02:35,208
This song will win you
the Best Songwriter of the Year.

1041
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:36,250
Let's go.

1042
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:39,041
Buddy, my head is hurting.

1043
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:40,333
I'm not going.

1044
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,708
I'll wait for you here.

1045
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:46,791
Wait, are you nervous?

1046
01:02:47,666 --> 01:02:49,458
All right, I'll handle it.

1047
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,125
Here.

1048
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,750
Wait for me.

1049
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,500
-Hi, Xiaojin.
-Hi, Buddy.

1050
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:03,708
-I've got a demo for Meisu.
-What demo?

1051
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,291
The title song of her new album.

1052
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:06,291
Lu Yao's entry.

1053
01:03:06,375 --> 01:03:08,750
But she has picked the winner
and is recording it now.

1054
01:03:12,833 --> 01:03:14,500
-Meisu, I...
-What are you doing?

1055
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,125
Hear me out.

1056
01:03:16,208 --> 01:03:17,916
Please give Lu Yao a chance.

1057
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:18,833
I'm begging you.

1058
01:03:18,916 --> 01:03:20,875
I'm Lu Yao's agent.

1059
01:03:20,958 --> 01:03:21,791
Please listen to it.

1060
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:30,416
-Hello?
-Hi, Mr. Lu Yao.

1061
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:33,375
This is Huaren University's
Department of Psychology calling.

1062
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:35,208
Your therapy session at 4 p.m.

1063
01:03:35,291 --> 01:03:37,458
will be conducted in a different room.

1064
01:03:37,541 --> 01:03:39,666
I'll see you at the entrance
and usher you there.

1065
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,375
I'm sorry. Do you mean today?

1066
01:03:44,458 --> 01:03:46,166
Yes, see you later.

1067
01:03:46,625 --> 01:03:47,750
All right, thank you.

1068
01:03:54,291 --> 01:03:55,208
How did it go?

1069
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,125
What happened?

1070
01:04:13,333 --> 01:04:14,833
They had chosen another song.

1071
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:16,166
They're recording it.

1072
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,666
-I see.
-I didn't expect that either.

1073
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,708
They had made their decision.

1074
01:04:22,916 --> 01:04:24,333
But after listening to your song,

1075
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,583
they picked yours instead.

1076
01:04:28,625 --> 01:04:30,125
Lu Yao, you won!

1077
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:31,208
We made it?

1078
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:32,791
Of course.

1079
01:04:32,875 --> 01:04:34,375
Why were you fooling me?

1080
01:04:34,458 --> 01:04:36,583
-Because I wanted to.
-You suck.

1081
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,458
-So?
-Screw him.

1082
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,250
Screw the whole world.

1083
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:42,958
Don't spit when you talk.

1084
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,750
Lu Yao is back to his top form.

1085
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:46,625
This is it.

1086
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,458
You really have to thank me this time.

1087
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:50,333
From now on,

1088
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:53,208
just focus on composing.

1089
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:55,500
Leave everything else to me.

1090
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,583
I am your Buddy.

1091
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:00,708
Repeat after me "I am your Buddy."

1092
01:05:02,208 --> 01:05:03,375
Thank you, my buddy.

1093
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:07,916
And your lyrics are incredible, you know?

1094
01:05:08,125 --> 01:05:09,291
How did you write so well?

1095
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:13,500
Or did you just steal mine
since I have amnesia?

1096
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:14,458
I...

1097
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:18,666
-I inherited all of your lost memories.
-Is that so?

1098
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:19,791
I'll give them back now.

1099
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:21,666
I'll give them back.

1100
01:05:22,458 --> 01:05:24,125
You've really made leaps and bounds.

1101
01:05:24,208 --> 01:05:25,875
I'll write all your lyrics from now on.

1102
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,625
Xingyue.

1103
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:29,750
Here you are.

1104
01:05:29,833 --> 01:05:31,458
A lady is asking for you at the reception.

1105
01:05:31,875 --> 01:05:33,125
A lady?

1106
01:05:39,083 --> 01:05:41,875
Ms. Lu, are you here for Lu Yao?

1107
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,125
I'm here for you.

1108
01:05:45,166 --> 01:05:46,041
Me?

1109
01:05:47,708 --> 01:05:48,583
See for yourself.

1110
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:00,791
You spied on us.

1111
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,750
I spied on you?

1112
01:06:04,208 --> 01:06:06,750
Those cameras were installed
for my brother's sake.

1113
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:09,500
He sleepwalks and passes out all the time.

1114
01:06:09,583 --> 01:06:10,833
If I hadn't kept watch,

1115
01:06:10,916 --> 01:06:12,625
he could have had a serious accident.

1116
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,666
You've only seen him
when he's in good shape.

1117
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,625
Don't do this to him, Xingyue.

1118
01:06:16,708 --> 01:06:18,875
You can get any man you want.

1119
01:06:18,958 --> 01:06:21,791
Why write your thesis in my brother's bed?

1120
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,083
You've gone too far.

1121
01:06:23,166 --> 01:06:24,416
Don't go near him again

1122
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:27,041
or I'll send this clip to your school.

1123
01:06:27,125 --> 01:06:30,208
The whole world will know
that you molested a patient.

1124
01:06:30,291 --> 01:06:32,000
It's not what you think, Ms. Lu.

1125
01:06:32,333 --> 01:06:35,583
I know I shouldn't be intimate
with a patient,

1126
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,208
but please believe me.

1127
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,916
I sincerely like Lu Yao.

1128
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,916
I wasn't using or playing him.

1129
01:06:42,125 --> 01:06:43,500
If you really like him,

1130
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,958
you should stay away.

1131
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:48,583
Listen, Lu Yao will not remember you.

1132
01:06:49,208 --> 01:06:51,541
I got rid of all traces of you.

1133
01:07:02,791 --> 01:07:03,833
Tell Xingyue "I love you"

1134
01:07:04,208 --> 01:07:05,500
Wednesday, 9 a.m., Xingyue came to
write the lyrics for "10,000 Times I Do"

1135
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,708
My first meeting with Xingyue,
"10,000 Times I Do" lyrics

1136
01:07:11,041 --> 01:07:12,000
As for the song,

1137
01:07:12,083 --> 01:07:14,666
it has nothing to do with you anymore.

1138
01:07:15,375 --> 01:07:16,583
From today onward,

1139
01:07:16,958 --> 01:07:19,000
you're a complete stranger to Lu Yao.

1140
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:20,958
Even if you seek him out,

1141
01:07:21,458 --> 01:07:22,875
he won't remember you.

1142
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:29,833
You crossed the line.

1143
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,083
Are you Mr. Lu?

1144
01:07:38,166 --> 01:07:39,291
Yes.

1145
01:07:39,375 --> 01:07:40,625
I'm Xiaoxin.

1146
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:42,125
I'll take you to the therapy room.

1147
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,375
Please follow me.

1148
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:44,375
Thank you.

1149
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:46,958
Is this my first time coming here?

1150
01:07:47,041 --> 01:07:49,333
I'm sorry, I'm not sure.

1151
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:46,333
Thank you.

1152
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:48,833
Hi, Lu Yao.

1153
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,250
Who are you?

1154
01:08:54,958 --> 01:08:56,041
I'm your...

1155
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:59,083
I'm your therapist, Xu Xingyue.

1156
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:02,291
Hi.

1157
01:09:04,291 --> 01:09:05,291
Please come in.

1158
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:14,791
Please take off your shoes.

1159
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:17,458
Then walk across the rug to the sofa.

1160
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,625
I'm sorry.

1161
01:09:32,416 --> 01:09:34,333
I don't want to remove my shoes.

1162
01:09:37,291 --> 01:09:38,125
Do I sit there?

1163
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:39,458
Yes.

1164
01:09:41,041 --> 01:09:42,041
I would like to ask you.

1165
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,416
Why did you refuse to remove your shoes?

1166
01:09:47,208 --> 01:09:48,166
I just...

1167
01:09:50,041 --> 01:09:51,541
I just didn't want to.

1168
01:09:55,791 --> 01:09:57,708
Have some carrot juice.

1169
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,375
Thank you.

1170
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,625
How many times have we met?

1171
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:19,791
What's going on?

1172
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:26,250
This is our third session.

1173
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,833
It's only the third one?

1174
01:10:29,916 --> 01:10:30,791
Yes.

1175
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:35,041
That means

1176
01:10:35,750 --> 01:10:37,875
we aren't that close.

1177
01:10:42,791 --> 01:10:45,291
That's right, we aren't close.

1178
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:50,875
Tell me how you're feeling today.

1179
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:54,791
It's okay.

1180
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,791
-What's going on?
-It's odd.

1181
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:14,916
What are you doing?

1182
01:11:27,541 --> 01:11:28,791
This scent

1183
01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:31,250
is familiar.

1184
01:11:37,166 --> 01:11:38,708
You'd better...

1185
01:11:38,791 --> 01:11:40,166
You'd better sit down first.

1186
01:11:49,250 --> 01:11:51,208
How do you feel about this scent?

1187
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:12,458
I'm not sure
if it's okay for me to tell you.

1188
01:12:14,583 --> 01:12:16,458
Never mind. Don't force yourself.

1189
01:12:19,875 --> 01:12:21,166
Do you like music?

1190
01:12:45,208 --> 01:12:46,166
What's wrong?

1191
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:51,875
Are you all right?

1192
01:12:56,833 --> 01:12:58,125
Are you sure we aren't close?

1193
01:13:05,083 --> 01:13:06,041
I'm sorry.

1194
01:13:06,916 --> 01:13:08,291
Why is she leaving?

1195
01:13:08,375 --> 01:13:09,583
What's wrong?

1196
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,125
Lu Yao left.

1197
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:47,041
Come and see me in my office.

1198
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:02,041
I'm sorry, I was unprofessional.

1199
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:04,541
I can't carry on with Lu Yao's case.

1200
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:06,500
Don't worry.

1201
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:08,708
I'll take over the case myself.

1202
01:14:09,166 --> 01:14:12,458
Just compile
and pass all the materials to me.

1203
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:15,583
I didn't expect your five-senses therapy
to work so well.

1204
01:14:15,666 --> 01:14:17,708
You did an excellent job this time.

1205
01:14:26,625 --> 01:14:28,333
I actually made it this piquant.

1206
01:14:54,375 --> 01:14:56,208
We received your partner
Lu Yao's submission

1207
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,666
of your work "10,000 Times I Do."

1208
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,375
You are offered a translation residency.

1209
01:15:02,083 --> 01:15:03,458
I made it.

1210
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,708
We look forward to working with you soon.

1211
01:15:07,208 --> 01:15:09,291
How did he remember Joy Haijo?

1212
01:15:26,333 --> 01:15:31,041
A cuddle at night

1213
01:15:31,791 --> 01:15:37,708
So ordinary but so blissful

1214
01:15:38,291 --> 01:15:41,333
In this chilly weather

1215
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,666
We breathe on each other

1216
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,208
To keep colds at bay

1217
01:15:48,166 --> 01:15:49,083
Lu Yao!

1218
01:15:50,875 --> 01:15:51,916
Lu Yao!

1219
01:15:55,125 --> 01:15:56,500
How much did you drink?

1220
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:57,625
Come on.

1221
01:15:57,708 --> 01:16:00,041
There's no time for self-indulgence, man.

1222
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,541
What is it now?

1223
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,458
Get up.

1224
01:16:02,541 --> 01:16:03,958
You are recording with Meisu today.

1225
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:06,625
I'm not going. I'm not in the mood.

1226
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,458
I'm not in the mood either.

1227
01:16:10,541 --> 01:16:11,958
-But...
-Buddy, you know,

1228
01:16:12,750 --> 01:16:15,875
I began to feel horrible when I woke up.

1229
01:16:15,958 --> 01:16:16,958
It's like

1230
01:16:17,291 --> 01:16:19,750
my heart has been hollowed out, you know.

1231
01:16:20,041 --> 01:16:22,166
It's fine to have a hollow heart.

1232
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:25,166
Our savings have been hollowed out too.

1233
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:26,958
We can't live without money.

1234
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:28,083
Lift your hips.

1235
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:31,750
Be good.

1236
01:16:31,833 --> 01:16:34,333
Just be there for a while.

1237
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:41,250
Even if the clock turns back,
I will not forget

1238
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:48,041
I will say I do 10,000 times

1239
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,500
I'm glad to have you as a special guest
at my album release show.

1240
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,583
I look forward
to your amazing performance.

1241
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,583
See you tomorrow.

1242
01:17:00,333 --> 01:17:02,625
The studio will go bankrupt
if I don't get myself together.

1243
01:17:32,458 --> 01:17:33,750
"You're mine"?

1244
01:17:42,041 --> 01:17:43,083
Who's this girl?

1245
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:51,125
How could you and my ex-girlfriend

1246
01:17:51,666 --> 01:17:53,666
take this kind of intimate picture?

1247
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:57,333
Darn it.

1248
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:58,708
It serves me right.

1249
01:17:58,791 --> 01:17:59,625
Buddy.

1250
01:18:00,541 --> 01:18:02,875
My memory may be crippled,
but not my intellect.

1251
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:04,458
What do you mean?

1252
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,125
I don't remember who she is,

1253
01:18:06,208 --> 01:18:07,208
but I have a hunch

1254
01:18:07,291 --> 01:18:09,375
that we've known each other for some time.

1255
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,500
And...

1256
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:12,000
I've seen her in my dream.

1257
01:18:12,416 --> 01:18:13,333
She...

1258
01:18:13,666 --> 01:18:16,708
She visited you in your dream, but not me?

1259
01:18:17,958 --> 01:18:20,000
What the heck? How blind was I?

1260
01:18:20,083 --> 01:18:22,250
Just tell me the truth, will you?

1261
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:25,875
Look at this photo,
I should be the one who's angry.

1262
01:18:25,958 --> 01:18:28,000
Buddy, I have to know
what exactly happened.

1263
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,375
Two weeks' worth of data
is missing from my computer.

1264
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,916
Someone deleted them, right?

1265
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,291
I'm coming.

1266
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,458
Tell me.

1267
01:18:45,541 --> 01:18:46,541
About what?

1268
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:47,958
What did you do?

1269
01:18:48,708 --> 01:18:50,083
What did you do behind my back?

1270
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:52,791
What are you talking about?

1271
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:56,333
I'm talking about Xingyue.

1272
01:18:56,875 --> 01:18:58,083
I know everything.

1273
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:01,791
Who gave you the right
to delete my journal entries?

1274
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:04,666
The lyricist was Xingyue,
but you changed it to Buddy.

1275
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,125
Who gave you the right?

1276
01:19:06,625 --> 01:19:08,375
Who gave you the right
to tamper with my life?

1277
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:21,041
You couldn't even remember her name

1278
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,916
or who wrote the lyrics.

1279
01:19:23,375 --> 01:19:24,833
How can you love?

1280
01:19:25,208 --> 01:19:26,500
How can you take care of her?

1281
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,625
If she cared about you,

1282
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,166
why hasn't she come back?

1283
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,541
Wake up.

1284
01:19:34,375 --> 01:19:35,333
Lu Hong.

1285
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:39,750
I'm lucid.

1286
01:19:41,541 --> 01:19:42,833
I live lucidly every day.

1287
01:19:42,916 --> 01:19:44,625
This is my most lucid self ever.

1288
01:19:46,333 --> 01:19:47,625
But what kind of life is this?

1289
01:19:48,333 --> 01:19:49,833
Do you know how I feel?

1290
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:52,333
I can't hold onto anything.

1291
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:54,625
I finally seized something
that gave my life meaning,

1292
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:56,083
but you snatched it away.

1293
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:58,791
Don't you think you're cruel?

1294
01:20:14,625 --> 01:20:15,958
These things belong to you.

1295
01:20:16,666 --> 01:20:17,875
This letter too.

1296
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:20,666
I took it from your mailbox.
It's unopened.

1297
01:20:26,833 --> 01:20:29,416
I was only trying to protect you.

1298
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:32,041
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

1299
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:34,541
Here.

1300
01:20:59,458 --> 01:21:01,583
Dear Lu Yao

1301
01:21:24,666 --> 01:21:30,708
"10,000 Times I Do" New Song Release

1302
01:21:32,250 --> 01:21:35,625
-Meisu!
-Meisu!

1303
01:21:35,708 --> 01:21:37,333
Hello, everyone.

1304
01:21:41,666 --> 01:21:45,375
The next song I'll perform is special.

1305
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:48,625
It's written by Lu Yao.

1306
01:21:48,708 --> 01:21:51,333
His personal story has got me thinking

1307
01:21:51,416 --> 01:21:54,083
whether someone who has amnesia

1308
01:21:54,416 --> 01:21:58,083
would always fall in love
with the same person.

1309
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:01,375
Here's my new song for all of you,

1310
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,250
"10,000 Times I Do."

1311
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:09,750
How many looks of willfulness

1312
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:15,708
How many sounds of discord

1313
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:22,000
How many shared secrets

1314
01:22:22,083 --> 01:22:26,916
Before we become you and I

1315
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:49,833
A cuddle at night

1316
01:22:50,625 --> 01:22:56,333
So ordinary but so blissful

1317
01:22:57,125 --> 01:23:00,166
In this chilly weather

1318
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:03,500
We breathe on each other

1319
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:05,458
To keep colds at bay

1320
01:23:05,541 --> 01:23:10,208
What was the movie

1321
01:23:10,958 --> 01:23:17,458
That made us cry like little kids

1322
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:23,416
Impish, carefree, it's all okay

1323
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:25,541
Lu Yao.

1324
01:23:27,708 --> 01:23:29,416
You probably don't remember me.

1325
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:31,958
I'm Xingyue,

1326
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:35,333
someone who briefly lived

1327
01:23:36,416 --> 01:23:38,625
in your memory.

1328
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,041
You couldn't remember so many things,

1329
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,250
but every time we looked at each other,

1330
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:48,750
you seemed to recognize me.

1331
01:23:51,333 --> 01:23:53,083
Thank you for working so hard for me.

1332
01:23:54,291 --> 01:23:55,666
And thank you

1333
01:23:56,791 --> 01:23:58,500
for valuing my dream dearly.

1334
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:03,791
No one had ever encouraged
or believed in me

1335
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:05,000
like you did.

1336
01:24:07,833 --> 01:24:10,125
I often worried that I wasn't good enough.

1337
01:24:11,625 --> 01:24:13,000
It was you

1338
01:24:14,375 --> 01:24:16,541
who made me feel unique.

1339
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:20,666
How blessed I am

1340
01:24:21,375 --> 01:24:22,833
to have met you.

1341
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:26,125
I often wonder.

1342
01:24:27,291 --> 01:24:30,291
if we had met before you had the accident,

1343
01:24:30,833 --> 01:24:32,291
would there have been

1344
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:37,333
a better ending for the two of us?

1345
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:40,541
But my answer is no

1346
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,416
because the you that I like

1347
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:45,500
is the you right now.

1348
01:24:51,208 --> 01:24:53,208
You may not remember my name,

1349
01:24:53,291 --> 01:24:54,583
your promise,

1350
01:24:54,666 --> 01:24:57,041
or the days that we spent together.

1351
01:24:58,583 --> 01:24:59,750
But please

1352
01:25:01,458 --> 01:25:03,208
don't forget that I love you.

1353
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,750
How many looks of willfulness

1354
01:25:07,833 --> 01:25:11,083
How many sounds of discord

1355
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:15,291
How many heartbreaks have I been through

1356
01:25:15,375 --> 01:25:17,791
Before I met you

1357
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:21,125
How sensitive are your actions

1358
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:25,916
How relentless is your courage

1359
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:32,083
That made you the memory
that can never be erased

1360
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:35,666
Even if the clock turns back

1361
01:25:35,750 --> 01:25:40,208
I will not forget

1362
01:26:37,416 --> 01:26:38,250
Xingyue!

1363
01:26:45,875 --> 01:26:46,958
Xingyue!

1364
01:26:59,125 --> 01:27:00,208
Xingyue!

1365
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:10,458
How many looks of willfulness

1366
01:27:10,541 --> 01:27:13,708
How many sounds of discord

1367
01:27:13,791 --> 01:27:17,958
How many heartbreaks have I been through

1368
01:27:18,041 --> 01:27:20,541
Before I met you

1369
01:27:20,625 --> 01:27:23,833
How sensitive are your actions

1370
01:27:23,916 --> 01:27:28,625
How relentless is your courage

1371
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:31,416
That made you the memory

1372
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,000
-That can never be erased
-Xingyue.

1373
01:27:38,083 --> 01:27:39,791
Do you remember me?

1374
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,375
I don't remember you,

1375
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:45,916
but I just know...

1376
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,041
I know I never want to lose you again.

1377
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:17,083
Stop looking at me.

1378
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:19,833
Stop it.

1379
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:21,458
Turn away.

1380
01:28:21,541 --> 01:28:22,583
Why can't I look?

1381
01:28:22,666 --> 01:28:23,625
Turn away.

1382
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:24,666
To where?

1383
01:28:24,750 --> 01:28:25,916
It's embarrassing.

1384
01:28:28,791 --> 01:28:30,875
Let me look at you for ten more seconds.

1385
01:28:34,708 --> 01:28:36,541
Three, two, one. Stop, no more.

1386
01:28:36,625 --> 01:28:37,916
Let me look at you some more.

1387
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,666
No.

1388
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:45,250
Why do you keep looking at me?

1389
01:28:45,583 --> 01:28:47,208
Because I want to remember you.

1390
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:49,125
I want to remember today.

1391
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:52,041
I don't want to fall asleep.

1392
01:28:52,125 --> 01:28:54,166
If I fall asleep, I will...

1393
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,333
Okay?

1394
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:04,375
Give me your phone.

1395
01:29:05,250 --> 01:29:06,416
Give me your phone.

1396
01:29:25,375 --> 01:29:26,791
I, Xu Xingyue...

1397
01:29:27,791 --> 01:29:28,791
And you?

1398
01:29:30,041 --> 01:29:31,333
I, Lu Yao.

1399
01:29:32,708 --> 01:29:33,958
We hereby pledge

1400
01:29:34,750 --> 01:29:36,166
that from today onward,

1401
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:38,541
no matter what happens,
we will stay together.

1402
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:42,875
I will never leave you.

1403
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:48,291
From now on, I'll be your brain

1404
01:29:49,333 --> 01:29:51,041
and your eyes.

1405
01:29:53,541 --> 01:29:56,083
I'll journal everything that happens to us

1406
01:29:56,458 --> 01:29:58,916
so you'll remember me
the moment you wake up every day.

1407
01:30:00,541 --> 01:30:01,791
That's so sweet.

1408
01:30:10,916 --> 01:30:12,583
Now, you can sleep without worries.

1409
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:21,625
Xingyue.

1410
01:30:24,166 --> 01:30:26,041
When was the last time
you watched the sunrise?

1411
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,791
I've decided not to attend
Joy Haijo's workshop,

1412
01:30:41,291 --> 01:30:42,958
but I will continue to pursue my dream.

1413
01:30:43,250 --> 01:30:44,833
I have decided to write poetry

1414
01:30:44,916 --> 01:30:46,125
about Lu Yao and I.

1415
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:48,125
To see and not see

1416
01:30:48,208 --> 01:30:50,125
How many wrong turns

1417
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:58,291
Before meeting someone and telling him

1418
01:30:58,375 --> 01:31:02,250
Cherish the dark sky above
and the landscape within

1419
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:06,833
Four months later

1420
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:08,666
Lu Yao, ring the doorbell.

1421
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,000
We've got things in the car.

1422
01:31:10,083 --> 01:31:11,333
Ask Lu Hong to help me.

1423
01:31:11,875 --> 01:31:12,833
There's more?

1424
01:31:13,291 --> 01:31:14,125
Yes.

1425
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,208
What took you so long?

1426
01:31:18,291 --> 01:31:19,833
Can you help get our things in the car?

1427
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:21,375
Sure, give me a second.

1428
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:29,416
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

1429
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:32,958
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

1430
01:31:33,041 --> 01:31:37,041
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

1431
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:41,083
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

1432
01:31:50,250 --> 01:31:51,416
Put the tomato in the pot.

1433
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,416
-I'll be with you in a second.
-Okay, no problem.

1434
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:02,833
It smells good. Is this beef stew?

1435
01:32:02,916 --> 01:32:04,583
Yes, it will be ready soon.

1436
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:06,208
Just put two more.

1437
01:32:06,291 --> 01:32:07,833
Good. Thank you.

1438
01:32:08,250 --> 01:32:10,208
Try this. See if it needs more salt.

1439
01:32:16,166 --> 01:32:17,083
What's wrong?

1440
01:32:17,708 --> 01:32:21,166
Lately, I feel nauseated
whenever I smell something strong.

1441
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:23,208
It's all right.

1442
01:32:23,916 --> 01:32:24,875
Let me see.

1443
01:32:25,333 --> 01:32:26,500
Give me your hand.

1444
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:27,833
You're sweating.

1445
01:32:27,916 --> 01:32:29,125
I'm going to the loo.

1446
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:31,583
But you just did a moment ago.

1447
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:34,000
Right, but I've been like this
for a while.

1448
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,791
Judging from my experience,

1449
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:38,416
with urinary incontinence, nausea,

1450
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:40,416
sweaty hands, and slight fever,

1451
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,458
all these call for a pregnancy test.

1452
01:32:42,541 --> 01:32:43,583
It can't be.

1453
01:32:56,625 --> 01:32:57,833
The results are out.

1454
01:32:57,916 --> 01:32:59,708
Ms. Xu, you're eight weeks pregnant.

1455
01:32:59,791 --> 01:33:01,833
I'll arrange
for the prenatal screening tests.

1456
01:33:01,916 --> 01:33:02,750
Congratulations.

1457
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,750
Are you not going to talk ever again?

1458
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:13,541
Do you find me annoying?

1459
01:34:16,291 --> 01:34:17,666
Fine, I know.

1460
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,333
You can't say anything.

1461
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:20,833
If you say you don't want the baby,

1462
01:34:20,916 --> 01:34:21,750
I'll hate you.

1463
01:34:21,833 --> 01:34:23,666
But if you say you want to keep the baby,

1464
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,333
I can't decide what to do either.

1465
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:30,208
You sister might have been right.

1466
01:34:30,916 --> 01:34:32,875
We shouldn't be together

1467
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,916
because our relationship has no future.

1468
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:35,833
Am I right?

1469
01:34:35,916 --> 01:34:36,916
We have no future.

1470
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:38,958
-Then why bother staying together?
-Xingyue.

1471
01:34:39,041 --> 01:34:40,708
Don't touch me.

1472
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,125
Listen.

1473
01:34:42,208 --> 01:34:43,875
It's not that I don't want
to say anything.

1474
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:47,125
I'm just not sure if I can speak my mind

1475
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,666
given my condition.

1476
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,041
You don't want it.

1477
01:34:53,375 --> 01:34:54,500
You don't want it, right?

1478
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:56,041
It's not that simple.

1479
01:34:56,125 --> 01:34:58,500
I just don't know what to tell you
given my condition.

1480
01:34:58,583 --> 01:34:59,916
I knew that you didn't want it.

1481
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:01,125
I won't ask you anymore.

1482
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:02,375
Xingyue.

1483
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:04,416
Xingyue!

1484
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:08,791
Xu Xingyue, come back here.

1485
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:10,166
Leave me alone.

1486
01:35:10,541 --> 01:35:11,500
Are you crazy?

1487
01:35:11,583 --> 01:35:12,958
-You may get hit by a car.
-Crazy?

1488
01:35:13,041 --> 01:35:14,333
I'm crazy?

1489
01:35:14,416 --> 01:35:16,250
You don't want the baby anyway.

1490
01:35:16,333 --> 01:35:18,416
Why do you care about us
being hit by a car?

1491
01:35:18,916 --> 01:35:20,083
Xingyue, stop there!

1492
01:35:24,875 --> 01:35:26,083
How could you say that?

1493
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:30,333
Do you think
I don't want to keep our baby?

1494
01:35:35,958 --> 01:35:37,875
It's wonderful to have our own baby.

1495
01:35:37,958 --> 01:35:39,375
It's a blessing.

1496
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:43,541
But when I think of my condition...

1497
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,916
How can I be so selfish?

1498
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:05,541
As long as we're together,

1499
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:07,083
I have nothing to be afraid of.

1500
01:36:14,125 --> 01:36:16,625
The baby's CRL is 3.6cm.

1501
01:36:16,958 --> 01:36:19,708
That's normal at 11 weeks pregnant.

1502
01:36:19,791 --> 01:36:21,375
Your baby is healthy.

1503
01:36:22,583 --> 01:36:23,875
This is his hip.

1504
01:36:24,333 --> 01:36:26,916
He's moving his hands and legs,
and his head too.

1505
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,166
-His hands.
-Do you see that?

1506
01:36:28,250 --> 01:36:29,916
His head moved again.

1507
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,291
He's waving to you. Do you see that?

1508
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:40,041
Our beautiful Xu Xingyue.

1509
01:36:40,125 --> 01:36:42,958
This is your third wedding.
How do you feel?

1510
01:36:43,208 --> 01:36:45,208
I feel triple blessed.

1511
01:36:45,291 --> 01:36:47,166
Since Lu Yao can't remember
that we're married,

1512
01:36:47,250 --> 01:36:49,416
I'll remarry him again until he does.

1513
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:51,375
Lu Yao.

1514
01:36:51,458 --> 01:36:54,416
Do you take Xu Xingyue
to be your lawful wife?

1515
01:36:55,708 --> 01:36:56,541
Yes, I do.

1516
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:57,583
I do too.

1517
01:36:57,666 --> 01:36:58,583
I object.

1518
01:36:59,583 --> 01:37:00,666
What are you doing, Lu Hong?

1519
01:37:00,750 --> 01:37:01,750
We object too.

1520
01:37:02,583 --> 01:37:04,333
-We object.
-We object.

1521
01:37:04,416 --> 01:37:06,291
-We object.
-What's wrong with you? Come on.

1522
01:37:06,375 --> 01:37:07,416
This is your third wedding.

1523
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:10,125
We're obliged to do something different.

1524
01:37:10,208 --> 01:37:11,041
Yes.

1525
01:37:11,125 --> 01:37:13,500
-You're using up my annual leave.
-We object.

1526
01:37:13,583 --> 01:37:14,708
But Lu Hong,

1527
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:16,708
I still have several wedding gowns
to debut.

1528
01:37:16,791 --> 01:37:18,541
Don't mind them.

1529
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,833
Hush, let's continue.

1530
01:37:21,041 --> 01:37:23,208
You will now exchange the rings.

1531
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:38,083
-Kiss her.
-Kiss her.

1532
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:41,833
Don't stop.

1533
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:57,458
Mrs. Lu,

1534
01:37:57,541 --> 01:37:59,041
the results are out.

1535
01:37:59,125 --> 01:38:00,291
Your baby is healthy.

1536
01:38:01,916 --> 01:38:04,958
But your blood pressure was hitting 160.

1537
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:07,750
That's far too high for a pregnant woman.

1538
01:38:08,083 --> 01:38:10,083
You may have preeclampsia.

1539
01:38:11,916 --> 01:38:13,916
What is preeclampsia?

1540
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:15,375
Is it serious?

1541
01:38:15,458 --> 01:38:17,041
It can be very serious.

1542
01:38:17,125 --> 01:38:19,500
The disorder can progress quickly

1543
01:38:19,583 --> 01:38:21,625
and cause the mother's blood pressure
to skyrocket.

1544
01:38:21,708 --> 01:38:23,416
You may be talking in this second,

1545
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:25,208
then pass out in the next.

1546
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:26,625
If not treated promptly,

1547
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:27,916
you may have a stroke.

1548
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:30,958
I understand your husband's condition,

1549
01:38:31,541 --> 01:38:33,041
but don't put pressure on yourself.

1550
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:35,958
It's important to relax during pregnancy.

1551
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,333
Thank you, doctor.

1552
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:39,625
Doctor.

1553
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,958
Please keep this a secret from my husband.

1554
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,333
I don't want him to worry.

1555
01:38:53,666 --> 01:38:56,250
The next massage technique is called

1556
01:38:56,333 --> 01:38:57,583
"I Love U."

1557
01:38:57,666 --> 01:38:59,625
Start from your baby's navel.

1558
01:38:59,708 --> 01:39:01,666
Swipe upward.

1559
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:02,791
Very good.

1560
01:39:02,875 --> 01:39:05,125
Now, swipe to the side,

1561
01:39:05,208 --> 01:39:07,041
then down, writing an "L."

1562
01:39:07,583 --> 01:39:09,125
-Then turn slowly.
-Turn.

1563
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:10,708
-Turn slowly.
-Yes.

1564
01:39:10,958 --> 01:39:12,750
Like a "U."

1565
01:39:12,833 --> 01:39:13,708
It's quite simple.

1566
01:39:13,791 --> 01:39:16,125
You'll be fine
after some practice at home.

1567
01:39:16,208 --> 01:39:17,500
-Okay.
-Thank you.

1568
01:39:17,583 --> 01:39:19,333
The instructor went over many things.

1569
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:20,625
I can't remember it all.

1570
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:22,250
You've got me to do that.

1571
01:39:24,291 --> 01:39:26,791
-This is heavy.
-Let me.

1572
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:28,291
Goodness, it is heavy.

1573
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:29,583
Thank God I got you.

1574
01:39:29,666 --> 01:39:31,833
You'll be stuck with me

1575
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:33,333
until after postpartum confinement.

1576
01:39:34,791 --> 01:39:36,250
Xingyue, come here.

1577
01:39:36,333 --> 01:39:37,458
I'm coming, honey.

1578
01:39:37,541 --> 01:39:39,541
My husband just bought
a lot of things for our baby.

1579
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:41,541
Let's keep a record of his purchase.

1580
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:43,166
Look.

1581
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,583
-Do you like it in blue?
-It's so cute.

1582
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:47,500
Yes.

1583
01:39:47,583 --> 01:39:49,625
-I love it.
-Look, I like this feature the most.

1584
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:51,583
It helps the baby fall asleep.

1585
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:52,708
It's so cute.

1586
01:39:52,791 --> 01:39:54,208
Our baby will love it.

1587
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:55,583
Star and moon, like your name.

1588
01:39:55,666 --> 01:39:56,958
-Xingyue.
-Thank you, honey.

1589
01:39:57,958 --> 01:39:59,125
Thank you, I love you.

1590
01:39:59,208 --> 01:40:00,208
I'll clean up.

1591
01:40:00,583 --> 01:40:01,958
-You do that.
-Okay.

1592
01:40:03,875 --> 01:40:06,458
This is the tenth time

1593
01:40:06,541 --> 01:40:09,416
my husband bought this crib.

1594
01:40:09,708 --> 01:40:10,958
I'll return it tonight.

1595
01:40:11,041 --> 01:40:12,583
He'll buy another one tomorrow.

1596
01:40:12,916 --> 01:40:14,750
Well, as long as he is happy.

1597
01:40:47,458 --> 01:40:48,541
Honey, I've been waiting.

1598
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:51,166
Where have you been? Are you all right?

1599
01:41:25,583 --> 01:41:26,708
-Someone fainted!
-Wake up!

1600
01:41:26,791 --> 01:41:27,750
-Wake up!
-Help!

1601
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,791
-Hurry, call the ambulance.
-Wake up.

1602
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:33,125
-What happened?
-Wake up.

1603
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:46,625
What have we got?

1604
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:49,125
A pregnant woman fainted in the street.

1605
01:41:49,208 --> 01:41:51,000
Her blood pressure was 180 over 120.

1606
01:41:51,333 --> 01:41:53,333
Are you feeling dizzy or any discomfort?

1607
01:41:53,416 --> 01:41:55,458
Where is my husband?

1608
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:57,291
We'll contact your family
as soon as possible.

1609
01:41:58,291 --> 01:41:59,875
Is my baby all right?

1610
01:41:59,958 --> 01:42:01,416
We'll have to run some tests,

1611
01:42:01,500 --> 01:42:03,125
but your blood pressure is way too high.

1612
01:42:03,208 --> 01:42:05,250
So don't move and stay calm, okay?

1613
01:42:06,666 --> 01:42:07,541
Hello.

1614
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:09,041
Are you Xu Xingyue's husband?

1615
01:42:09,125 --> 01:42:09,958
Yes, I am.

1616
01:42:10,041 --> 01:42:11,500
She fainted on the street.

1617
01:42:11,583 --> 01:42:12,916
She's in the ER right now.

1618
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:14,541
-Please come quickly.
-What?

1619
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:23,625
The test results confirm

1620
01:42:23,708 --> 01:42:25,333
that you have severe preeclampsia.

1621
01:42:25,416 --> 01:42:27,541
Your blood pressure is approaching 200.

1622
01:42:27,791 --> 01:42:29,625
The blood flow to your placenta

1623
01:42:29,708 --> 01:42:30,875
is severely insufficient.

1624
01:42:30,958 --> 01:42:33,875
We have to perform an emergent C-section.

1625
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,916
Can I see my husband first?

1626
01:42:38,291 --> 01:42:40,000
The baby is getting weak.

1627
01:42:40,083 --> 01:42:41,416
We must get the baby out now

1628
01:42:41,500 --> 01:42:42,916
to bring your blood pressure down,

1629
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,875
or you may have a seizure
and go into a coma.

1630
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:46,458
Your baby may even die.

1631
01:42:46,708 --> 01:42:48,666
We must go to the operating room now.

1632
01:42:48,750 --> 01:42:50,208
Your husband is on his way here.

1633
01:42:50,291 --> 01:42:52,375
Sign the consent form first.

1634
01:43:02,958 --> 01:43:05,333
Your wife has severe preeclampsia.

1635
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:07,333
Her condition is very serious.

1636
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:09,333
Are you saying her life is endangered?

1637
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:12,791
I'm afraid so
if we can't deliver the baby promptly.

1638
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,458
The patient's blood pressure
has surged past 200.

1639
01:43:16,875 --> 01:43:18,958
Her blood pressure is too high
for spinal anesthesia.

1640
01:43:19,041 --> 01:43:20,541
More complications will occur.

1641
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:22,375
We'll give her general anesthesia instead.

1642
01:43:22,458 --> 01:43:23,500
Test for pre-transfusion.

1643
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:25,041
Be prepared for a massive hemorrhage.

1644
01:43:25,125 --> 01:43:26,541
We'll give you general anesthesia.

1645
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:27,833
Relax, take it easy.

1646
01:43:29,708 --> 01:43:32,208
We have to deliver the baby
by C-section now,

1647
01:43:32,291 --> 01:43:34,958
or the baby's life will be in danger.

1648
01:43:37,083 --> 01:43:38,083
Prepare for transfusion.

1649
01:43:55,083 --> 01:43:56,333
The head is out.

1650
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:58,291
Here, press it down.

1651
01:43:58,375 --> 01:43:59,250
Here.

1652
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:00,666
Scissors.

1653
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,625
Quickly.

1654
01:44:01,875 --> 01:44:03,458
It's a boy. Hold on tight.

1655
01:44:04,666 --> 01:44:06,833
Her blood pressure hasn't come down.
Give me the gauze.

1656
01:44:07,500 --> 01:44:08,458
Hurry.

1657
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:09,958
More gauze.

1658
01:44:10,333 --> 01:44:11,875
Here. Press it down.

1659
01:44:11,958 --> 01:44:12,875
Harder.

1660
01:44:13,208 --> 01:44:14,750
More gauze. Hurry.

1661
01:44:15,833 --> 01:44:16,833
He's not crying.

1662
01:44:17,166 --> 01:44:18,250
He's not responding.

1663
01:44:18,333 --> 01:44:20,458
The body has turned blue and limp.

1664
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:21,708
Perform CPR now.

1665
01:44:21,791 --> 01:44:23,250
Blood oxygen level is 60%.

1666
01:44:23,333 --> 01:44:24,625
Heart rate is 68bpm.

1667
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:36,250
We can't stop it.

1668
01:44:36,333 --> 01:44:38,000
Where is the blood? Hurry!

1669
01:44:38,083 --> 01:44:39,666
Go get it. Hurry.

1670
01:44:42,250 --> 01:44:43,291
He still hasn't cried.

1671
01:44:43,375 --> 01:44:44,250
He's not responding.

1672
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:45,791
Hurry.

1673
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:46,708
Gauze.

1674
01:45:44,375 --> 01:45:45,250
I'm sorry.

1675
01:45:45,333 --> 01:45:46,750
We have tried our best.

1676
01:45:47,833 --> 01:45:49,458
She has lost too much blood.

1677
01:45:50,250 --> 01:45:51,500
She won't make it.

1678
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,750
Honey.

1679
01:47:10,291 --> 01:47:11,166
Honey.

1680
01:47:13,041 --> 01:47:14,041
Honey.

1681
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:19,125
Please, I can't do it alone.

1682
01:47:22,041 --> 01:47:24,125
I can't do it alone, honey.

1683
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:29,541
I beg you.

1684
01:47:29,625 --> 01:47:31,041
Please don't leave me.

1685
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:33,291
Please don't leave me.

1686
01:47:33,375 --> 01:47:34,791
Honey.

1687
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:39,000
I already promised

1688
01:47:40,458 --> 01:47:44,250
that I would never leave you.

1689
01:47:47,458 --> 01:47:49,583
It would break my heart to leave you.

1690
01:47:51,166 --> 01:47:54,166
Let the three of us walk out of here
safe and sound, okay?

1691
01:47:56,291 --> 01:47:57,458
Promise me,

1692
01:47:58,666 --> 01:47:59,708
okay?

1693
01:48:00,666 --> 01:48:01,708
Okay.

1694
01:48:02,375 --> 01:48:04,541
We'll go home together.

1695
01:48:07,458 --> 01:48:09,791
Let's do that.

1696
01:48:15,041 --> 01:48:16,000
Honey.

1697
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:24,958
It's getting very cold.

1698
01:48:27,166 --> 01:48:28,333
Can you

1699
01:48:31,458 --> 01:48:33,291
hold me one more time?

1700
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:42,291
It's okay.

1701
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,500
Honey.

1702
01:49:20,208 --> 01:49:23,083
Tomorrow is our first anniversary.

1703
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:28,833
Once we are discharged,

1704
01:49:28,916 --> 01:49:31,833
you must celebrate with me.

1705
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:01,833
Honey.

1706
01:50:03,416 --> 01:50:04,583
Honey.

1707
01:50:06,833 --> 01:50:07,833
Honey.

1708
01:50:12,416 --> 01:50:13,416
Honey.

1709
01:50:15,583 --> 01:50:16,833
Honey.

1710
01:50:18,666 --> 01:50:20,375
Honey, don't go.

1711
01:50:21,458 --> 01:50:22,375
Honey.

1712
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:24,250
From today onward,

1713
01:51:24,333 --> 01:51:26,875
no matter what happens,
we will stay together.

1714
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:35,291
I will never leave you.

1715
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:41,333
I will never leave you.

1716
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:27,500
May 11, 12:00, Hospital, MRI Scan

1717
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,125
This is today

1718
01:52:32,291 --> 01:52:34,208
TVC song deadline tomorrow

1719
01:52:42,333 --> 01:52:43,166
Lu Hong,

1720
01:52:43,416 --> 01:52:44,791
what's going on?

1721
01:52:44,875 --> 01:52:46,583
My house is plastered with sticky notes.

1722
01:52:46,666 --> 01:52:48,833
Calm down and listen.

1723
01:52:48,916 --> 01:52:52,291
You make this call to me every day.

1724
01:52:52,375 --> 01:52:54,625
Finish reading
the When You Wake Up journal.

1725
01:52:54,708 --> 01:52:56,708
Then come to my house.

1726
01:53:03,583 --> 01:53:04,625
Lu Hong.

1727
01:53:04,708 --> 01:53:05,541
Come in.

1728
01:53:07,041 --> 01:53:08,708
Lu Hong, whose child is this?

1729
01:53:09,708 --> 01:53:10,875
He's mine.

1730
01:53:11,500 --> 01:53:13,083
-Hold your nephew.
-I can't.

1731
01:53:13,166 --> 01:53:14,625
Of course you can.

1732
01:53:14,708 --> 01:53:16,083
Don't cry.

1733
01:53:16,166 --> 01:53:17,000
I'll be home late.

1734
01:53:17,083 --> 01:53:18,708
Help yourself to anything in the fridge.

1735
01:53:18,791 --> 01:53:20,125
The baby's schedule is here.

1736
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:21,500
When will you be back?

1737
01:53:21,583 --> 01:53:22,416
Bye.

1738
01:53:30,958 --> 01:53:32,958
Hush.

1739
01:53:41,875 --> 01:53:42,791
What is it?

1740
01:53:44,791 --> 01:53:45,958
What's wrong?

1741
01:53:46,916 --> 01:53:48,916
You've already eaten and pooped.

1742
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:50,750
How about a nap?

1743
01:53:50,833 --> 01:53:51,916
Do you want to take a nap?

1744
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,166
Hush. Let's take a nap.

1745
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:55,291
Hush.

1746
01:53:55,375 --> 01:53:56,291
Let's take a nap.

1747
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:02,750
Are you feverish?

1748
01:54:03,291 --> 01:54:04,583
Are you feeling unwell?

1749
01:54:06,166 --> 01:54:07,166
You don't have a fever.

1750
01:54:08,791 --> 01:54:10,708
Good boy.

1751
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:12,041
Don't cry. Let's call your mom.

1752
01:54:13,916 --> 01:54:16,500
Hi, may I speak to Head Nurse Lu Hong?

1753
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:18,250
She's on leave today.

1754
01:54:19,333 --> 01:54:20,291
It can't be.

1755
01:54:20,375 --> 01:54:22,208
She told me she was off to work.

1756
01:54:22,291 --> 01:54:25,166
She's hosting a memorial service today
for a family member

1757
01:54:25,250 --> 01:54:27,000
at the hall right next to our hospital.

1758
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,958
Xingyue, you are
the brightest star in the sky.

1759
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,541
Xingyue may have departed,

1760
01:55:24,958 --> 01:55:26,958
but it feels like she has never left us.

1761
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:29,000
I think

1762
01:55:29,583 --> 01:55:31,583
she's still living among us,

1763
01:55:31,916 --> 01:55:33,916
only in another way.

1764
01:55:35,125 --> 01:55:37,166
Today is Xingyue's birthday.

1765
01:55:37,500 --> 01:55:41,541
Let's celebrate her on this occasion.

1766
01:55:42,500 --> 01:55:44,083
Xingyue had intended

1767
01:55:44,166 --> 01:55:46,708
to give the following video to her child

1768
01:55:46,791 --> 01:55:48,500
when he grows up.

1769
01:55:48,583 --> 01:55:50,708
She wanted her child to know

1770
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:52,750
the unusual and beautiful love story

1771
01:55:53,500 --> 01:55:55,958
of his mom and dad.

1772
01:55:56,750 --> 01:55:59,500
I'm sure if she were here today,

1773
01:55:59,708 --> 01:56:02,583
she would be eager
to share this video with you.

1774
01:56:06,291 --> 01:56:07,791
Hi, baby.

1775
01:56:09,125 --> 01:56:10,208
Look.

1776
01:56:10,291 --> 01:56:12,250
This is you now.

1777
01:56:12,333 --> 01:56:14,166
Aren't you cute?

1778
01:56:14,375 --> 01:56:15,916
I want you to know

1779
01:56:17,666 --> 01:56:21,750
that you have
the most special dad in the world.

1780
01:56:23,833 --> 01:56:25,583
A dad who forgets things.

1781
01:56:27,208 --> 01:56:28,750
Every day, I'm surrounded

1782
01:56:28,833 --> 01:56:30,458
by all kinds of flowers.

1783
01:56:30,541 --> 01:56:32,791
He always forgets
he has gotten me flowers.

1784
01:56:33,041 --> 01:56:34,958
He chooses a different bouquet
for me every day

1785
01:56:35,041 --> 01:56:36,958
according to his different feelings.

1786
01:56:37,041 --> 01:56:39,583
I hope he'll keep this up for good.

1787
01:56:43,583 --> 01:56:45,625
Since every day

1788
01:56:45,708 --> 01:56:47,833
is the first day Lu Yao meet me,

1789
01:56:47,916 --> 01:56:50,125
I get up early each morning
to do simple makeup

1790
01:56:50,208 --> 01:56:52,083
so that I'll meet him in my best form.

1791
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:55,375
Perfect.

1792
01:57:00,083 --> 01:57:01,375
He's up.

1793
01:57:01,791 --> 01:57:02,666
Lu Yao.

1794
01:57:03,583 --> 01:57:05,041
Hello, I'm Xingyue.

1795
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:07,625
Hi.

1796
01:57:08,166 --> 01:57:09,291
What is it?

1797
01:57:09,375 --> 01:57:10,625
You're so beautiful.

1798
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:12,791
Are you really my girlfriend?

1799
01:57:12,875 --> 01:57:14,000
Is it hard to believe?

1800
01:57:22,833 --> 01:57:25,625
This is the first time
we watched the sunrise.

1801
01:57:25,708 --> 01:57:28,666
It's too bad that it's kind of cloudy.

1802
01:57:28,750 --> 01:57:30,000
That's why...

1803
01:57:31,083 --> 01:57:31,958
The sun is not out.

1804
01:57:32,166 --> 01:57:34,833
I promise to watch every sunrise
with you all my life

1805
01:57:34,916 --> 01:57:37,458
as long as I'm not busy or sleepy.

1806
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:45,375
This is the first time
he made noodles for me.

1807
01:57:46,208 --> 01:57:48,291
Objection. How is it my turn to cook?

1808
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,458
I cooked for you
the last time I wrote lyrics here.

1809
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:52,583
It's your turn today.

1810
01:57:53,458 --> 01:57:55,041
-Are you sure?
-You promised.

1811
01:57:55,125 --> 01:57:56,875
-I did?
-Yes.

1812
01:57:56,958 --> 01:57:58,333
-Do you love me?
-I do.

1813
01:57:58,416 --> 01:57:59,541
Then get on with the cooking.

1814
01:57:59,625 --> 01:58:01,041
Kiss me and I'll cook.

1815
01:58:03,958 --> 01:58:04,958
Hurry.

1816
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:08,666
Actually, I've never cooked for him.

1817
01:58:09,041 --> 01:58:10,625
The fact that he doesn't remember

1818
01:58:10,708 --> 01:58:11,958
is quite convenient sometimes.

1819
01:58:12,041 --> 01:58:14,791
-The master chef is here.
-Keep it up.

1820
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,083
This is the first time
I celebrated his birthday.

1821
01:58:18,833 --> 01:58:22,625
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

1822
01:58:22,708 --> 01:58:24,666
-Kiss her!
-Kiss her!

1823
01:58:24,791 --> 01:58:27,500
Let me!

1824
01:58:29,125 --> 01:58:32,125
This is the 100th day we held hands.

1825
01:58:32,208 --> 01:58:33,166
I'm sorry.

1826
01:58:33,375 --> 01:58:35,250
-Let's hold our hands forever.
-Naughty.

1827
01:58:47,833 --> 01:58:49,541
Since your dad can't remember,

1828
01:58:49,875 --> 01:58:53,208
we've held five weddings so far.

1829
01:58:56,625 --> 01:58:57,708
On our first wedding,

1830
01:58:57,791 --> 01:59:00,083
before the banquet even started,

1831
01:59:00,958 --> 01:59:02,500
we already got drunk.

1832
01:59:03,833 --> 01:59:05,458
We ended up dancing through the night.

1833
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:11,708
This is our fifth wedding.

1834
01:59:12,083 --> 01:59:15,083
Look at how big my tummy was
with you inside.

1835
01:59:15,291 --> 01:59:16,166
Xu Xingyue.

1836
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:18,750
Do you take Lu Yao
to be your lawful husband?

1837
01:59:18,833 --> 01:59:19,791
I don't.

1838
01:59:21,041 --> 01:59:22,041
Why not?

1839
01:59:22,166 --> 01:59:23,708
You've never proposed to me.

1840
01:59:23,791 --> 01:59:25,041
I didn't propose?

1841
01:59:25,666 --> 01:59:27,083
Buddy, didn't I propose?

1842
01:59:27,166 --> 01:59:28,083
Do it now.

1843
01:59:28,166 --> 01:59:29,750
-I did not?
-No.

1844
01:59:32,708 --> 01:59:36,458
My most beautiful,
thoughtful and magnanimous Xingyue.

1845
01:59:37,041 --> 01:59:38,291
Please marry me.

1846
01:59:38,791 --> 01:59:40,375
Despite the many things that I'll forget,

1847
01:59:40,458 --> 01:59:42,750
I'm sure I won't forget our love.

1848
01:59:44,041 --> 01:59:45,458
If your dad wants to,

1849
01:59:46,083 --> 01:59:47,625
I'll marry him again and again

1850
01:59:47,708 --> 01:59:49,166
until he remembers.

1851
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:54,583
Baby.

1852
01:59:56,708 --> 01:59:58,416
Once you meet your dad,

1853
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,333
you'll realize

1854
02:00:00,791 --> 02:00:02,875
that he's unlike any other dads out there.

1855
02:00:03,333 --> 02:00:06,333
Get to know
your dad's many unusual merits.

1856
02:00:06,416 --> 02:00:09,083
When you grow up,
let's take care of him together.

1857
02:00:09,250 --> 02:00:11,375
We'll take care of your very special dad,

1858
02:00:12,125 --> 02:00:13,500
your forgetful dad.

1859
02:00:16,541 --> 02:00:18,000
Did you just kick me?

1860
02:00:19,416 --> 02:00:21,208
Why? You don't want your dad?

1861
02:00:22,541 --> 02:00:23,875
You can't do that.

1862
02:00:23,958 --> 02:00:26,333
You must love your dad.

1863
02:00:26,416 --> 02:00:28,000
Accept him the way he is.

1864
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:29,458
When you grow up,

1865
02:00:29,791 --> 02:00:33,166
I want us to look after your dad together.

1866
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:34,208
Okay?

1867
02:00:35,416 --> 02:00:37,833
I hope we can always be together

1868
02:00:38,375 --> 02:00:40,166
and be happy every day.

1869
02:00:40,666 --> 02:00:42,333
The three of us

1870
02:00:42,416 --> 02:00:43,750
will grow together

1871
02:00:44,083 --> 02:00:46,291
as one happy family.

1872
02:00:46,833 --> 02:00:48,041
That's my only wish.

1873
02:00:49,250 --> 02:00:52,458
How many looks of willfulness

1874
02:00:52,541 --> 02:00:56,041
How many sounds of discord

1875
02:00:56,125 --> 02:01:00,166
How many shared secrets

1876
02:01:00,250 --> 02:01:02,791
Before we become you and I

1877
02:01:02,875 --> 02:01:06,083
How sensitive are your actions

1878
02:01:06,166 --> 02:01:11,041
How relentless is your courage

1879
02:01:11,666 --> 02:01:14,333
That made you the memory

1880
02:01:14,416 --> 02:01:17,125
That can never be erased

1881
02:01:18,458 --> 02:01:25,166
Even if the clock turns back,
I will not forget

1882
02:01:30,291 --> 02:01:36,958
I will say I do 10,000 times

1883
02:02:23,375 --> 02:02:27,583
I'm your son, feed me.

1884
02:02:28,291 --> 02:02:30,041
The child next to you is your son, Lu Jun

1885
02:02:30,125 --> 02:02:31,791
Three-month-old,
Six-month-old, One-year-old

1886
02:02:36,125 --> 02:02:37,625
Look, it's me and your mom.

1887
02:02:38,541 --> 02:02:40,291
I'm proposing. Do you see that?

1888
02:02:42,333 --> 02:02:44,500
It's a yes!

1889
02:02:46,250 --> 02:02:47,333
You've got your cheesecake.

1890
02:02:47,416 --> 02:02:50,250
We'll eat it after dinner, okay?

1891
02:02:50,708 --> 02:02:52,625
Promise me, okay?

1892
02:02:57,541 --> 02:02:59,916
Look, it's your mom.

1893
02:03:00,916 --> 02:03:02,625
They finally published
her poetry collection.

1894
02:03:05,625 --> 02:03:07,125
Let's go inside.

1895
02:03:07,208 --> 02:03:08,291
Come on.

1896
02:03:08,375 --> 02:03:09,833
Let's go.

1897
02:03:11,166 --> 02:03:12,083
You can't eat these.

1898
02:03:12,166 --> 02:03:13,541
Let's get three copies, okay?

1899
02:03:14,375 --> 02:03:15,208
We want three.
