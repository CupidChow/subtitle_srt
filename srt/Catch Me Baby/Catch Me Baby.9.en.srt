5
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:23,827
Hello, you...

6
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,067
I think we need to talk.

7
00:00:30,995 --> 00:00:32,100
About last night.

8
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:36,471
Hey, you should not avoid me.

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,205
Answer me.

10
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:41,271
You...

11
00:00:41,795 --> 00:00:43,375
What will happen next between us?

12
00:00:47,368 --> 00:00:48,377
So annoying.

13
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:49,720
I'll just mute it.

14
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:59,787
Don't call me anymore.
Stop being persistent.

15
00:00:59,898 --> 00:01:01,595
Your food has now been delivered.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,901
Okay, I will pick it up.

17
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:16,575
I'll pay with my credit card.

18
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:29,510
It's you!

19
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:30,719
Why are you here?

20
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,679
Because you did not reply
any of my messages on Line.

21
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:34,360
So, I had to use this trick.

22
00:01:45,144 --> 00:01:45,870
Thank you so much.

23
00:01:47,116 --> 00:01:48,199
Good luck with your girlfriend.

24
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:55,958
You...

25
00:01:56,129 --> 00:01:56,861
Where are you going?

26
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,023
Talk to me, please.

27
00:01:58,997 --> 00:02:00,070
We have nothing to talk.

28
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:01,419
It's wasting my time.

29
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:03,594
Wait!

30
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,764
You already did that to me.

31
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:11,095
Don't you need to
take any responsibility?

32
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,362
Me?

33
00:02:12,928 --> 00:02:13,990
What did I do to you?

34
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:15,163
Well...

35
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,900
We did...

36
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,093
We already kissed.

37
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:24,160
I gave you my heart.

38
00:02:25,708 --> 00:02:26,646
Don't you want to start
a relationship with me?

39
00:02:29,798 --> 00:02:30,395
Well...

40
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:32,606
There is no relationship.

41
00:02:33,749 --> 00:02:34,426
Just...

42
00:02:34,971 --> 00:02:36,192
A vulnerable girl

43
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:38,100
and an opportunist.

44
00:02:39,573 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes...

45
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:41,848
But I am a vulnerable guy,

46
00:02:42,742 --> 00:02:44,029
and you are the opportunist.

47
00:02:45,162 --> 00:02:45,957
You're just fooling around.

48
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:47,534
Wait, Cher.

49
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,809
I am serious, Cher.

50
00:02:56,794 --> 00:02:57,959
If you think
I took advantage of you,

51
00:02:58,564 --> 00:02:59,287
I am sorry.

52
00:03:00,758 --> 00:03:01,273
Then...

53
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,558
I will wait until
you give me a chance.

54
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:06,796
Will you allow me to do that?

55
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,357
Good.

56
00:03:15,316 --> 00:03:16,493
Keep waiting then.

57
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,403
I will go to eat now. I am hungry.

58
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:19,866
Hey, wait!

59
00:03:20,144 --> 00:03:21,320
I didn't eat anything either.

60
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:23,255
There are two lunch boxes.
You can share them with me.

61
00:03:24,076 --> 00:03:24,549
Cher.

62
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:29,628
=Catch Me Baby=

63
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:52,795
Hey.

64
00:03:53,557 --> 00:03:56,297
Are you planning to stay here 24-7?

65
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,259
You like Cher. Is that right?

66
00:04:07,345 --> 00:04:07,941
I like her.

67
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,579
She can't take you for who you are.

68
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,615
You two are so different.

69
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:23,447
If it was me,

70
00:04:23,838 --> 00:04:25,732
I could take you
for whoever you are.

71
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,389
Can't I be that person?

72
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,805
It is impossible, Pink.

73
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,119
Well...

74
00:04:49,963 --> 00:04:51,208
You are my sister.

75
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:53,909
I feel like you are my real sister.

76
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:55,968
We are family.

77
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,676
I can't look at you that way.

78
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:03,675
Pink...

79
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:05,162
Believe me.

80
00:05:05,684 --> 00:05:06,765
Some day,

81
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:08,762
you will find someone
that you love more than me.

82
00:05:09,347 --> 00:05:10,217
Someone who is
more suitable for you than me.

83
00:05:11,131 --> 00:05:11,788
For me...

84
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,837
I can only be your brother.

85
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:16,413
Can you understand me?

86
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:21,100
All right. Don't talk about this.

87
00:05:21,314 --> 00:05:22,457
Let's eat.

88
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:24,141
I bought a lot of food.

89
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:28,001
Pink.

90
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:35,996
Beauty...

91
00:05:36,489 --> 00:05:37,665
Tell Foei that

92
00:05:37,726 --> 00:05:39,666
I sent UI reference through Line.

93
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,271
Ask him

94
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,496
if he likes it.

95
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:43,966
Beauty...

96
00:05:44,547 --> 00:05:46,053
Tell Tan that

97
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,112
he should send it via email.

98
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,547
I don't use Line.

99
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,184
Then,

100
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:53,865
you tell Foei that

101
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:54,940
he is too bossy.

102
00:05:57,158 --> 00:05:57,883
Beauty...

103
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,079
Tell Tan that

104
00:06:00,825 --> 00:06:01,745
he is unprofessional.

105
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:06,290
We're sitting together. Why don't
you two just talk with each other?

106
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,009
I don't know what's wrong with Foei.

107
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:09,574
I've already
confessed my feelings to him.

108
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:13,091
Your feelings?

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,653
I'm choked.

110
00:06:18,146 --> 00:06:18,967
Anyway,

111
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:20,580
what's wrong with you?

112
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:23,783
You look sad since you sat here.

113
00:06:24,544 --> 00:06:25,655
Well... Yes.

114
00:06:25,748 --> 00:06:26,242
What's wrong?

115
00:06:28,934 --> 00:06:31,768
Actually, I need a favor from you guys.

116
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:38,570
Can you please

117
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:41,321
listen to her problem?

118
00:06:47,016 --> 00:06:48,792
Well, normally

119
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,680
I don't take a case

120
00:06:50,829 --> 00:06:52,758
from a daughter who wants
to spy on her parents.

121
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,753
But since you came here,

122
00:06:58,154 --> 00:06:59,330
you can tell me what happened.

123
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:02,032
Thank you.

124
00:07:02,954 --> 00:07:03,434
Beauty,

125
00:07:03,962 --> 00:07:04,576
go ahead.

126
00:07:05,335 --> 00:07:07,380
My father's name is Nopphon.

127
00:07:07,739 --> 00:07:09,492
He is a physical therapist.

128
00:07:11,577 --> 00:07:14,342
He has a regular client.
Her name is Pilai.

129
00:07:14,342 --> 00:07:15,119
Okay.

130
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:16,789
I will massage your feet first.

131
00:07:17,034 --> 00:07:19,124
She's been his client

132
00:07:19,124 --> 00:07:20,338
for a long time.

133
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:21,276
But,

134
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:24,457
she always calls my father
to give her a massage at home.

135
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:25,943
She does that almost every week.

136
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:28,211
And... Here...

137
00:07:32,393 --> 00:07:34,135
She likes to post photos...

138
00:07:35,287 --> 00:07:38,532
like these.
She even tagged my father

139
00:07:38,877 --> 00:07:40,490
in weird positions.

140
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:43,303
Although my father was not in the frame.

141
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:44,573
Do you think

142
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:47,342
this kind of thing is normal?

143
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,408
But...

144
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:53,073
This cannot be used as evidence.

145
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,569
I knew that.

146
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,838
So I want to hire you

147
00:07:58,838 --> 00:08:00,783
to investigate this.

148
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,543
Can you please help me?

149
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:06,870
Beauty...

150
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:08,024
What if

151
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,180
they turned out to have an affair
after my investigation?

152
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,886
What are you going to do?

153
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:20,273
I...

154
00:08:21,498 --> 00:08:22,865
I don't know yet.

155
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:31,214
I'm suffering if I have to
keep seeking the answer.

156
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,261
And I don't want
to be like this anymore.

157
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:41,270
Okay.

158
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:43,297
Give me a minute.

159
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,227
What's wrong, Sis?

160
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,550
If you have a problem

161
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,092
about the fees,

162
00:08:55,693 --> 00:08:56,761
I can pay you for her.

163
00:08:58,008 --> 00:08:59,211
It's not that.

164
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:00,512
It's not about that at all.

165
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:03,968
Foei, you understand
the nature of our work.

166
00:09:04,824 --> 00:09:06,198
We spy on people
who're having an affair.

167
00:09:07,477 --> 00:09:09,390
Yes, it's all about cheating.

168
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:11,553
But in this case,

169
00:09:12,097 --> 00:09:14,420
a daughter wants to
investigate her father.

170
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,349
Think this way...

171
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:21,595
If she is just a woman who hires me
to spy if her husband's cheating on her,

172
00:09:22,211 --> 00:09:23,366
for 90% of those women,

173
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,764
what are they gonna do?

174
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:26,691
File for divorce.

175
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,203
In this case,

176
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,072
whom will she divorce?

177
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,135
A divorce between a daughter
and her father?

178
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,336
She is just a student.

179
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:37,286
What is she gonna do?

180
00:09:40,092 --> 00:09:40,844
I won't do this.

181
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:42,276
I think...

182
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:43,853
I will reject her.

183
00:09:44,737 --> 00:09:45,835
Sis.

184
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,560
Beauty.

185
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,291
I think...

186
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:20,876
I will give you a discount
as you're a student.

187
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,221
Really, Cher?

188
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:23,833
Thank you.

189
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,035
Thank you so much.

190
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:26,318
Really. Thank you.

191
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,044
You dressed up prettily today.

192
00:10:41,299 --> 00:10:42,085
Where are you going?

193
00:10:43,652 --> 00:10:45,316
I will meet up with my friends.

194
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,176
So, I don't want to look plain.

195
00:10:49,909 --> 00:10:50,902
May I come with you?

196
00:10:51,027 --> 00:10:52,198
So we can go home together.

197
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:53,865
Today... I think

198
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:55,186
I am not busy at work.

199
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:55,853
Okay?

200
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,112
It's okay. No need for you to go.

201
00:11:04,447 --> 00:11:05,127
What's wrong?

202
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,270
No, it's just...

203
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:11,115
Usually, you would try to ask me
to join you and your friends.

204
00:11:13,816 --> 00:11:15,336
You don't know this group of friends.

205
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:17,193
You might

206
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:20,040
get bored while listening
to us chatting.

207
00:11:21,637 --> 00:11:23,113
I will not come home late.

208
00:11:27,598 --> 00:11:28,465
New perfume?

209
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:33,493
Go now, or you're gonna be late.

210
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,930
All right.

211
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:35,838
I will leave now.

212
00:12:05,152 --> 00:12:06,838
(Phat)

213
00:12:14,175 --> 00:12:14,925
Excuse me.

214
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:19,132
What are you doing here?

215
00:12:20,382 --> 00:12:21,755
Hello.

216
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,188
I came for gardening.

217
00:12:25,255 --> 00:12:27,340
Can I park my car here?

218
00:12:27,951 --> 00:12:29,769
I don't know if you come for service.

219
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:31,315
The Housing Estate Juristic Person
didn't inform me.

220
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,493
Actually,

221
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:36,767
the security at the gate

222
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,797
told me to come inside the village.

223
00:12:38,867 --> 00:12:39,975
Besides,

224
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:43,060
I had an appointment with
the house's owner for gardening.

225
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,932
They've already paid me.

226
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,157
Please give me permission.

227
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:51,487
It won't take long for gardening.

228
00:12:56,413 --> 00:12:57,825
The Housing Estate Juristic Person
did not tell me about this.

229
00:12:58,117 --> 00:12:59,825
Let me ask them by radio.

230
00:12:59,887 --> 00:13:00,724
Just a second.

231
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:02,987
Honey...

232
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:07,792
Why are you working alone?

233
00:13:09,662 --> 00:13:10,291
Honey, look...

234
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,564
you're having black eyes.

235
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,361
You don't have enough sleep.

236
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:15,889
Our kids are still young.

237
00:13:16,013 --> 00:13:17,995
Why didn't you tell me about this job?

238
00:13:22,462 --> 00:13:23,180
I'm here to help you.

239
00:13:23,391 --> 00:13:24,260
Just play along with me.

240
00:13:24,727 --> 00:13:25,091
Go on!

241
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,251
Honey...

242
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:31,212
Why do you have to work so hard?

243
00:13:32,762 --> 00:13:33,756
Mister...

244
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:35,800
Please be kind to us.

245
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,773
We need money
for two kids' school fees.

246
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,724
She is also pregnant.

247
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,717
Even couples of hundred Baht

248
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,730
would help our family.

249
00:13:45,006 --> 00:13:45,845
Please.

250
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:47,472
You!

251
00:13:48,615 --> 00:13:49,377
Oh...

252
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:50,365
All right.

253
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:54,069
Please help us.
Our kids are too young.

254
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:57,857
Yes, they almost
don't have milk to drink.

255
00:14:00,599 --> 00:14:01,543
Who are you looking for?

256
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,826
I come to meet Pilai.

257
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:04,974
We have scheduled for gardening.

258
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,309
Wait a minute, please.

259
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,388
I will go and inform my Madam.

260
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:09,154
Look...

261
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,098
Your Madam booked us
just for a short period.

262
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:12,543
We don't have much time.

263
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:14,968
If we don't finish on time,
we have to charge Baht 1,000 per hour.

264
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:16,666
Minutes are rounded up to hours.

265
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,343
Will you be responsible for that?

266
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:24,055
There are plenty of trees.

267
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:26,187
I will start trimming at...

268
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:27,230
Where do we start?

269
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,840
How about this tree?

270
00:14:30,374 --> 00:14:32,112
Okay.

271
00:14:33,063 --> 00:14:34,389
Let's do it now.

272
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:36,618
Give me a shovel.

273
00:14:36,618 --> 00:14:37,129
Here you go.

274
00:14:38,274 --> 00:14:40,263
Oh, this looks messy.

275
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:43,328
I will dig up the dirt now.

276
00:14:46,714 --> 00:14:47,136
Hey...

277
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:48,278
What's next?

278
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:54,758
You!

279
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,373
She left me again.

280
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:06,353
Keep quiet!

281
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:15,926
Oh, my god!

282
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,121
I can't see anything.

283
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:33,713
What?

284
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,550
Who are you spying on today?

285
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:36,900
You haven't told me yet.

286
00:15:38,641 --> 00:15:40,975
You also did not tell me
what you are doing here.

287
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,029
'Cause you did not answer
my phone at all.

288
00:15:44,282 --> 00:15:45,046
So I...

289
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:48,803
I miss you.

290
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,421
It's really bad timing.

291
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,696
You.

292
00:16:04,893 --> 00:16:05,483
Climb up here.

293
00:16:06,244 --> 00:16:07,280
Come on.

294
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:08,642
Are you sure?

295
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:10,838
Okay.

296
00:16:11,979 --> 00:16:12,909
Just get on my shoulder.

297
00:16:13,065 --> 00:16:13,994
Ouch!

298
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,096
You!

299
00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:16,946
- Ouch!
- You!

300
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:18,146
All right.

301
00:16:18,627 --> 00:16:19,381
You're light.

302
00:16:19,863 --> 00:16:20,879
Get up. Get up.

303
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:22,737
Slowly.

304
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:23,904
Okay.

305
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,260
Can you see it?

306
00:16:29,424 --> 00:16:30,078
Hey, you...

307
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:30,990
Move to the left.

308
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:31,856
Okay, left.

309
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:33,630
No, no, go to the right.

310
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,434
Right side.

311
00:16:35,709 --> 00:16:36,649
Stand still.

312
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,419
Stand still, and don't move.

313
00:16:41,186 --> 00:16:42,053
Okay now.

314
00:16:46,732 --> 00:16:47,968
Give me your phone.

315
00:16:50,268 --> 00:16:51,810
Stand still. Don't let me fall.

316
00:16:58,573 --> 00:16:59,556
It will be a little bit tense.

317
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:01,333
Just relax.

318
00:17:02,224 --> 00:17:03,349
Tell me if you are hurt.

319
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:04,029
Yes.

320
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:08,607
One more.

321
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:10,250
Okay.

322
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,112
This is not the case.

323
00:17:11,693 --> 00:17:12,427
I'll fix your knee.

324
00:17:12,427 --> 00:17:14,162
This is not seductive at all.

325
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:16,605
I will move up to your arms.

326
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:17,224
Yes.

327
00:17:17,521 --> 00:17:18,161
All right.

328
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,496
Just relax.

329
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,083
I will press this area.

330
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,231
According to what you told me,

331
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:33,620
Mr. Nopphon was just doing his job.

332
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:34,737
Pilai was overreacting.

333
00:17:35,837 --> 00:17:36,575
Thank you.

334
00:17:40,103 --> 00:17:41,159
My job

335
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:44,944
is not a success
when I catch who is cheating.

336
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,955
It is a success when

337
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:54,898
I tell the good news to my client

338
00:17:56,111 --> 00:17:57,646
that no one is cheating.

339
00:18:06,103 --> 00:18:07,398
I like you because of that.

340
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:19,568
Hey, you!

341
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,192
Look at that!

342
00:18:46,075 --> 00:18:47,262
I think you are right.

343
00:18:47,489 --> 00:18:48,137
All right.

344
00:18:49,989 --> 00:18:51,062
Is this one?

345
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:51,921
This one is good.

346
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:53,605
This is the one I like.

347
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,904
How do you know?

348
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:56,927
I remember everything you like.

349
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:59,044
You remember? You are so good.

350
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,235
How is it?

351
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,735
It's done.

352
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:05,568
Has it been done yet?

353
00:19:05,613 --> 00:19:06,057
Yes.

354
00:19:06,261 --> 00:19:08,074
Do you want to eat now?

355
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:09,706
What do you mean by "done"?

356
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,695
Can we all just be "done"?

357
00:19:11,695 --> 00:19:12,632
Just eat it.

358
00:19:12,632 --> 00:19:13,358
Let's eat.

359
00:19:13,398 --> 00:19:13,925
Okay.

360
00:19:13,925 --> 00:19:14,587
We eat now.

361
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:15,185
Hey, you!

362
00:19:16,226 --> 00:19:17,447
Take out your phone to take photos.

363
00:19:17,797 --> 00:19:18,457
What are you waiting for?

364
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:20,251
Take a photo, then we leave.

365
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,989
Mosquitoes are biting me.

366
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:23,918
There are too many of them.

367
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:25,981
Here it is.

368
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:33,689
It looks yummy.

369
00:19:43,912 --> 00:19:46,774
=Catch Me Baby=

370
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:49,754
=Catch Me Baby=

371
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:05,354
I'll go and check.

372
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:25,255
Some stray cats.

373
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:28,628
Let's eat.

374
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:29,881
Hey!

375
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:30,731
What are you guys doing?

376
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:32,041
Come on. Let's eat.

377
00:20:32,188 --> 00:20:32,819
Okay.

378
00:20:35,587 --> 00:20:38,083
(Be Brave Coffee)

379
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:52,188
Are you really drinking Tiger Herbal?

380
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:54,995
It's green tea.

381
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,016
Are you going to tell her the truth?

382
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:10,619
Honestly...

383
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,755
I still don't know what to do.

384
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:18,340
This case...

385
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:20,320
This is not a normal cheating case.

386
00:21:21,023 --> 00:21:22,548
It involves three people.

387
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:26,034
I think...

388
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:28,540
You should tell her the truth.

389
00:21:31,303 --> 00:21:33,438
Because it's her purpose
in the first place.

390
00:21:34,202 --> 00:21:36,462
In the end, we wouldn't know
what is gonna happen.

391
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,503
Whether she can accept it or not,

392
00:21:39,555 --> 00:21:41,466
it was she who chose to know the truth.

393
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,647
You once told me that

394
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,125
our work is different.

395
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:49,419
My work

396
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:50,827
is keeping secrets.

397
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,890
Your work

398
00:21:54,506 --> 00:21:55,448
is digging up the truth.

399
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:57,804
Wow!

400
00:21:58,788 --> 00:21:59,944
You surprise me.

401
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:03,336
This is the first time that
you don't oppose me.

402
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:04,611
Normally,

403
00:22:04,816 --> 00:22:06,604
you oppose me on everything.

404
00:22:07,352 --> 00:22:07,999
Don't pick on me.

405
00:22:08,513 --> 00:22:09,105
It's true!

406
00:22:10,338 --> 00:22:11,426
It's your chance now.

407
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:37,089
(Facts are stubborn things.)

408
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:50,802
Really, Cher?

409
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:54,452
My father isn't having an affair?

410
00:22:56,362 --> 00:22:56,899
Yes.

411
00:22:58,133 --> 00:22:59,316
He just went to do

412
00:22:59,424 --> 00:23:00,989
a physical therapy session.

413
00:23:01,543 --> 00:23:03,308
Only Pilai was

414
00:23:03,499 --> 00:23:04,976
a little flirty.

415
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:06,144
But there is nothing at all.

416
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:08,700
Thank you, Cher.

417
00:23:09,168 --> 00:23:10,872
I can have good sleep now.

418
00:23:13,179 --> 00:23:16,406
If my father and Pilai
really have an affair,

419
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,350
I don't know how I could tell my mother.

420
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:19,801
Everything

421
00:23:19,952 --> 00:23:21,248
would end up badly.

422
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:27,166
Wait a minute.

423
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:29,574
Oh, no.

424
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:30,576
It's okay.

425
00:23:31,469 --> 00:23:33,203
This is an easy task.

426
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:34,740
I think

427
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:36,161
you should save your money,

428
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:38,687
and pay my brother for being your tutor.

429
00:23:39,282 --> 00:23:40,542
So he doesn't have to ask me for money.

430
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:43,165
So...

431
00:23:43,761 --> 00:23:45,556
Thank you again.

432
00:23:46,017 --> 00:23:47,622
If you hadn't helped me,
I would still feel very bad.

433
00:23:48,555 --> 00:23:50,946
I will excuse myself now.

434
00:23:50,946 --> 00:23:51,627
My mom will be worried about me.

435
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:53,202
Thank you.

436
00:24:10,974 --> 00:24:11,962
Sis, are you sure

437
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:14,875
about not telling her the truth?

438
00:24:16,171 --> 00:24:18,320
I want her to know it from her parents.

439
00:24:22,211 --> 00:24:23,254
You are right.

440
00:24:26,024 --> 00:24:27,448
This is the first time

441
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,829
that I intended
to make this case unsuccessful.

442
00:24:31,447 --> 00:24:32,799
And you lied to your client
for the first time.

443
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:34,168
Hey!

444
00:24:34,465 --> 00:24:35,791
If you keep fixating on this like that,

445
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:36,934
I'll go home now.

446
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,487
Wait. I am just joking.

447
00:24:39,748 --> 00:24:40,836
I just want to say

448
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:44,303
if you need advice from a good liar,

449
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:45,706
you can ask me.

450
00:24:47,508 --> 00:24:49,424
Well, should I be happy about it?

451
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:53,526
A guy like you is worried
about me like this.

452
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:58,294
So...

453
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,811
I will talk to you about our things.

454
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:10,358
I...

455
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:13,631
I lied.

456
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,211
About what?

457
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,482
I lied when I told you that

458
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:22,228
we are different.

459
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:24,905
Actually,

460
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:26,901
we are too similar.

461
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:32,938
You are competitive.

462
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:36,575
So am I.

463
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:40,011
You want to win.

464
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:43,073
I don't want to lose.

465
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:46,110
You love your family.

466
00:25:48,226 --> 00:25:49,763
So do I.

467
00:25:52,273 --> 00:25:53,545
I believe in love.

468
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:55,700
At this moment,

469
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:57,609
I believe that

470
00:25:58,591 --> 00:25:59,879
you also believe in love.

471
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,110
But it is a different kind of love.

472
00:26:04,285 --> 00:26:05,099
But...

473
00:26:06,964 --> 00:26:08,631
We are still different.

474
00:26:11,262 --> 00:26:12,596
I don't believe

475
00:26:17,021 --> 00:26:18,118
that I can love someone.

476
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:22,802
You always protect others
in the name of love.

477
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:25,166
But you are telling me

478
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:28,756
that you don't know how to love someone?

479
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,601
Yes.

480
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:34,296
It's strange, right?

481
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:37,463
Yes, it's strange.

482
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:40,239
Just a little bit strange.

483
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,025
Just forget about it.

484
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,592
Let's say...

485
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:47,944
Now you understand

486
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:49,349
why...

487
00:26:49,732 --> 00:26:51,509
I rejected you that night.

488
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:55,547
Cher.

489
00:26:56,622 --> 00:26:57,431
Listen to me.

490
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:01,411
You can lie to anyone

491
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:02,746
about anything.

492
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:06,259
You can lie in your whole life
just like I did.

493
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:10,253
But there is one thing
that I have never lied.

494
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:12,571
I have never lied to myself.

495
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:20,166
You should not lie to yourself

496
00:27:21,236 --> 00:27:22,148
that you didn't fall in love

497
00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:24,596
at that night.

498
00:27:29,489 --> 00:27:29,979
If...

499
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,098
You really like me.

500
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,199
Will you wait for me?

501
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:39,877
Wait until...

502
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:43,273
I...

503
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:44,450
know...

504
00:27:45,197 --> 00:27:46,166
how to love someone.

505
00:27:49,453 --> 00:27:50,321
I will wait for you.

506
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:52,953
Don't rush me.

507
00:27:54,028 --> 00:27:54,458
Okay.

508
00:27:54,824 --> 00:27:55,711
Don't bother me, too.

509
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,405
I know that.

510
00:28:01,272 --> 00:28:02,206
I'll give you 10 seconds.

511
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:04,156
Ten... Nine...

512
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,647
- Eight...
- Are you crazy? That's too fast.

513
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:08,019
Too fast, then...

514
00:28:19,346 --> 00:28:20,082
Tan, sir.

515
00:28:20,886 --> 00:28:22,260
Why don't you play
computer games at your house?

516
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:24,176
How long are you gonna use my room?

517
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:25,877
If I stay in my room alone,

518
00:28:26,783 --> 00:28:28,068
I'll be just like
noodles soup without noodles.

519
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:30,055
Wise words!

520
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:32,212
What's wrong with you anyway?

521
00:28:33,017 --> 00:28:33,523
I...

522
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,313
I can be anything.

523
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,635
But I cannot be

524
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:41,770
your friend.

525
00:28:45,355 --> 00:28:45,802
Hey!

526
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,949
Are you talking to me?

527
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:50,010
If he wants to talk,

528
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,260
he can still call me

529
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,486
even though his phone
runs out of battery.

530
00:28:56,742 --> 00:28:57,520
Phat!

531
00:28:59,034 --> 00:29:01,025
I helped you get close to him.

532
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,171
I guess it did not work then.

533
00:29:05,825 --> 00:29:06,679
It's just...

534
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,227
Whatever I did, it was wrong.

535
00:29:11,141 --> 00:29:12,322
I confessed my feelings.

536
00:29:13,512 --> 00:29:14,657
I even changed myself.

537
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,197
But...

538
00:29:18,948 --> 00:29:20,916
I'm the only one who's trying.

539
00:29:27,416 --> 00:29:28,625
Tan...

540
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,631
If he built a high wall,

541
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:32,060
you can build the stairs.

542
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:36,005
If it is too high,

543
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:38,556
you can make a long set of stairs.

544
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:39,143
Keep going.

545
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,427
Until you climb across the wall.

546
00:29:41,189 --> 00:29:42,325
If you really do like him,

547
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:44,291
it doesn't matter
whether it is a wall or a river.

548
00:29:44,603 --> 00:29:46,163
You will find a way to overcome it.

549
00:29:46,903 --> 00:29:47,661
Unless...

550
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:50,028
you aren't trying it hard enough.

551
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:54,529
Give it a try.

552
00:29:57,498 --> 00:29:58,569
Phat!

553
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,359
You are right.

554
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,593
Thank you so much.

555
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:05,956
You are my idol!

556
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,483
Why did I even come here?

557
00:30:09,981 --> 00:30:10,862
This is ridiculous.

558
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:12,187
I'll go home now.

559
00:30:12,335 --> 00:30:12,823
Please.

560
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,279
Thank you.

561
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,278
Do I have to tidy up your room?

562
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:18,615
I was about to say that.

563
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,737
I am heartbroken.

564
00:30:21,034 --> 00:30:21,708
Another one!

565
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:23,116
Bottom-up!

566
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:25,191
Stop now, Pink.

567
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:27,137
No.

568
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:29,071
I won't stop.

569
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,356
Trust me.

570
00:30:33,692 --> 00:30:35,216
It's not good for your health.

571
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:38,038
Who are you?

572
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,546
You have no right to lecture me.

573
00:30:41,034 --> 00:30:42,058
Take your hands off me.

574
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:43,655
I will drink anyway.

575
00:30:43,987 --> 00:30:45,657
I am another you.

576
00:31:05,701 --> 00:31:06,309
Pink!

577
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,514
You are another me!

578
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:10,703
Yes.

579
00:31:10,982 --> 00:31:12,456
I am another you.

580
00:31:12,886 --> 00:31:14,257
You should quit now.

581
00:31:14,557 --> 00:31:15,511
Depression...

582
00:31:15,737 --> 00:31:17,114
is not good for your health.

583
00:31:21,563 --> 00:31:22,773
You'd better quit being sad.

584
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,836
Just be happy.

585
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:51,097
Pink!

586
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:53,880
Jim!

587
00:31:53,965 --> 00:31:54,868
Come on! Dance with me.

588
00:31:56,903 --> 00:31:58,094
You are heartbroken again.

589
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:02,164
Is that right?

590
00:32:07,983 --> 00:32:08,748
Hey!

591
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:10,276
You...

592
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:13,841
Pink, what's wrong?

593
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:14,859
What happened?

594
00:32:15,223 --> 00:32:16,164
Don't cry.

595
00:32:16,692 --> 00:32:17,646
Stop crying!

596
00:32:19,965 --> 00:32:21,299
Let's go.

597
00:32:21,426 --> 00:32:22,965
Come on. Stop drinking.

598
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,245
I will come back and pay the bill later.

599
00:32:24,245 --> 00:32:24,943
I will be back soon.

600
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,799
Come on.

601
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:26,702
Don't!

602
00:32:26,812 --> 00:32:27,739
Come here, Pink.

603
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,220
My love for the past 10 years was over.

604
00:33:02,186 --> 00:33:04,866
No matter how hard I have tried,
I can only be his sister.

605
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:11,245
Have you

606
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,948
talked directly with Phat?

607
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:19,573
It's over for good.

608
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:21,981
About that...

609
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:23,979
He honestly rejected me.

610
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,546
So, I won't get any hope.

611
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,364
I don't have to wake up
and fool myself every morning.

612
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,599
I just think...

613
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:36,665
I've lost someone in my life.

614
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:38,392
You are a silly girl.

615
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:40,387
You didn't lose anyone.

616
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:42,712
Phat will always be there for you.

617
00:33:43,915 --> 00:33:45,338
But he will not be your boyfriend.

618
00:33:46,188 --> 00:33:47,596
He will be your brother.

619
00:33:59,699 --> 00:34:00,244
How about that?

620
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,710
Are you okay now?

621
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,634
Where are you going next?

622
00:34:08,539 --> 00:34:09,507
I will go back home.

623
00:34:15,602 --> 00:34:16,895
Do you still eat pumpkin seeds?

624
00:34:21,636 --> 00:34:22,496
Not really.

625
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:23,827
Why?

626
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:27,727
Nothing.

627
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,260
It's good, though.

628
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:33,874
I will go home now.

629
00:34:38,582 --> 00:34:39,391
Jim...

630
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:44,569
If you have some unhappy things
that you need to talk about,

631
00:34:45,752 --> 00:34:47,450
you can call me anytime.

632
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,101
Thanks.

633
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:53,605
I have to go now.

634
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:55,085
Your ice cream is melting.

635
00:34:56,187 --> 00:34:57,499
- I'll eat it all.
- You're acting like a child.

636
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:06,887
Why don't you love me?

637
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:08,826
You don't love me.

638
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,869
Just love me.

639
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:18,899
Why? Why don't you love me?

640
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:25,588
It hurts.

641
00:35:25,815 --> 00:35:26,855
It hurts.

642
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,767
What are you doing here?

643
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:39,801
Doing what?

644
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,327
This is also my house.

645
00:35:41,513 --> 00:35:42,420
I can come here.

646
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:48,706
I called you but you didn't answer,
so I went to your room.

647
00:35:49,122 --> 00:35:50,076
No one was there.

648
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:52,387
So I think...

649
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,176
you probably came here.

650
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:57,121
You...

651
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,329
Are you worried about me?

652
00:36:07,987 --> 00:36:08,604
No need.

653
00:36:09,154 --> 00:36:10,714
You don't have to do that.

654
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:12,542
Stop giving me hope.

655
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:14,152
I'll gradually get over you.

656
00:36:14,282 --> 00:36:16,241
I will get over you.
Do you understand?

657
00:36:25,671 --> 00:36:26,316
What?

658
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:27,748
Come down and sit here.

659
00:36:32,536 --> 00:36:33,004
Here it is.

660
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:35,378
Shrimps are your favourite food.

661
00:36:35,808 --> 00:36:36,582
Don't you want to eat it?

662
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:44,425
No!

663
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:45,565
I am not hungry.

664
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:46,850
I don't feel like eating.

665
00:36:48,082 --> 00:36:49,247
Normally, you'll have all of them.

666
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:52,958
You can get angry with me, and
you can stop talking to me. It's okay.

667
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:54,048
But you need to eat.

668
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,223
What if you get sick?

669
00:36:59,837 --> 00:37:00,982
You'd better take care of yourself.

670
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:10,683
Pink!

671
00:37:13,971 --> 00:37:15,312
I can't be your boyfriend.

672
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,687
But I can be the one
who will always peel shrimp for you.

673
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:46,706
Phat!

674
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:53,930
I thought you would never love me.

675
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:56,996
I do love you.

676
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,124
Whom else do I love then?

677
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:04,416
You go and sit there.

678
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:07,046
My hands are dirty, and
the shrimp might fall onto the floor.

679
00:38:08,736 --> 00:38:10,427
I don't want to clean it up.

680
00:38:13,728 --> 00:38:14,282
Here you go.

681
00:38:14,717 --> 00:38:15,464
Do you need some dipping sauce?

682
00:38:34,363 --> 00:38:35,639
So, you are very hungry.

683
00:38:39,095 --> 00:38:39,697
Try this tiny bit.

684
00:38:54,132 --> 00:38:54,850
Phat.

685
00:39:02,201 --> 00:39:02,901
What is it?

686
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:07,921
A ring.

687
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:10,941
A ring?

688
00:39:14,768 --> 00:39:15,441
What ring?

689
00:39:17,663 --> 00:39:19,470
I pulled it off Cher's finger.

690
00:39:28,384 --> 00:39:29,722
Please return it to her for me.

691
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,123
Okay.

692
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:57,459
Now, let's see.

693
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,921
How to use the file "My star"?

694
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:01,496
This is the beta version.

695
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:03,796
First, you need to fill out a form

696
00:40:03,885 --> 00:40:05,885
about your name, identity, school year,

697
00:40:05,963 --> 00:40:08,851
your interests and hobbies,
and most importantly,

698
00:40:08,988 --> 00:40:10,597
your type.

699
00:40:10,686 --> 00:40:12,442
Once you've arranged a meeting
with someone,

700
00:40:12,442 --> 00:40:16,581
speed date visual will manage to

701
00:40:16,654 --> 00:40:18,748
arrange a date
via a video call for you two.

702
00:40:18,841 --> 00:40:20,101
You'll have 10 minutes

703
00:40:20,175 --> 00:40:22,884
to talk and get to know each other.

704
00:40:25,301 --> 00:40:26,481
If you really do like him,

705
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,300
it doesn't matter
whether it is a wall or a river.

706
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:30,020
You will find a way to overcome it.

707
00:40:39,551 --> 00:40:41,642
(This is your star, Foei.)
What? What is happening?

708
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,560
What is going on?

709
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:51,695
Foei.

710
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:55,350
The other stars

711
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,136
shine at night.

712
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:00,784
But you...

713
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:02,644
You are the bright star

714
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:04,232
that's shining on me.

715
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,289
Wow!

716
00:41:09,059 --> 00:41:10,531
What is wrong with you, Tan?

717
00:41:15,043 --> 00:41:16,266
In my whole life,

718
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:18,683
whatever I want,

719
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:20,836
I'll have it all.

720
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:23,748
My life goes smoothly.

721
00:41:25,141 --> 00:41:26,150
But all of the sudden,

722
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:28,687
you came into my life.

723
00:41:29,328 --> 00:41:30,774
You are the first splinter

724
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:32,513
that poked me.

725
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,071
Instead of poking at my feet,

726
00:41:37,863 --> 00:41:39,505
you poked into my heart.

727
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,375
Oh, my god.

728
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,108
I like you!

729
00:41:51,894 --> 00:41:52,752
You are crazy, Tan.

730
00:41:53,504 --> 00:41:54,444
This is really bad timing.

731
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:55,391
Stop!

732
00:41:57,878 --> 00:41:58,444
You...

733
00:41:58,924 --> 00:41:59,781
All of you

734
00:42:01,259 --> 00:42:02,498
still have a chance to say yes,

735
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:04,253
if you are on the same page.

736
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,308
System

737
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,911
will send the contact to you.

738
00:42:07,364 --> 00:42:08,942
You can continue
to get to know each other.

739
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,655
If not,

740
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:12,411
you'll then talk to someone else.

741
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:17,789
Let's guess

742
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,594
if my date

743
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:22,298
will press the "Yes" button.

744
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:31,116
Say "Yes". Say "Yes".
Say "Yes". Say "Yes".

745
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:37,116
Say "Yes" now. Say "Yes" now.
Say "Yes" now.

746
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:39,850
Oh no!

747
00:42:41,027 --> 00:42:42,780
Why is Beauty's mom calling
at this moment?

748
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:47,653
Give me a second.

749
00:42:50,258 --> 00:42:50,813
Hello?

750
00:42:50,813 --> 00:42:51,556
Foei?

751
00:42:51,649 --> 00:42:52,947
Is Beauty with you?

752
00:42:55,935 --> 00:42:57,203
No, she isn't.

753
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,024
What's wrong?

754
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:04,132
Beauty didn't come home last night.
None of her friends knew where she was.

755
00:43:07,412 --> 00:43:08,870
Calm down, please.

756
00:43:09,815 --> 00:43:12,391
Why would Beauty disappear?

757
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:15,649
Did she ask you
to help her with her father?

758
00:43:17,571 --> 00:43:19,649
Beauty knew the truth now.

759
00:43:27,186 --> 00:43:27,659
What?

760
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:28,336
Foei?

761
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:31,706
Where are you going?

762
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:32,874
Foei?

763
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:36,963
I will get him back.

764
00:43:37,588 --> 00:43:38,802
Oh, no. Foei!

765
00:43:39,382 --> 00:43:39,958
What the heck!

766
00:43:46,393 --> 00:43:47,058
How is it, Sis?

767
00:43:47,585 --> 00:43:48,228
Did you find her?

768
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,746
I drove and looked for her on campus.
There was no sign of her.

769
00:43:54,202 --> 00:43:55,103
I am sorry, Phat.

770
00:43:55,401 --> 00:43:56,253
I caused you trouble again.

771
00:43:57,662 --> 00:43:58,555
There is no need to apologize.

772
00:43:58,744 --> 00:43:59,846
We will help each other.

773
00:44:01,677 --> 00:44:03,375
What if something bad happens to Beauty?

774
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:05,710
I would never forgive myself.

775
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:07,099
Sis,

776
00:44:07,271 --> 00:44:08,357
don't think in a bad way.

777
00:44:08,836 --> 00:44:10,080
We need to find her soon.

778
00:44:12,252 --> 00:44:12,729
Foei.

779
00:44:12,986 --> 00:44:13,565
We go upstairs.

780
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:18,423
Sis,

781
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:21,494
if you are not okay, just take some rest.

782
00:44:21,899 --> 00:44:22,845
I will keep looking for her.

783
00:44:31,605 --> 00:44:32,010
You...

784
00:44:32,678 --> 00:44:34,005
This is no one's fault.

785
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:35,199
Don't blame yourself.

786
00:44:36,691 --> 00:44:37,459
You sit here.

787
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:38,697
I will go and look for her.

788
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:43,365
Beauty, where are you?

789
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,866
Beauty, where are you?

790
00:44:46,446 --> 00:44:48,189
Beauty.

791
00:44:48,597 --> 00:44:50,097
- Beauty.
- Beauty.

792
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,856
- Did you find her?
- Beauty.

793
00:44:51,937 --> 00:44:52,400
Beauty.

794
00:44:52,505 --> 00:44:53,399
Beauty!

795
00:45:01,749 --> 00:45:02,860
How's it going?

796
00:45:02,967 --> 00:45:03,588
We didn't find her.

797
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:10,922
Foei and I...

798
00:45:11,018 --> 00:45:12,524
Thank you for your help.

799
00:45:12,874 --> 00:45:13,890
But now...

800
00:45:14,085 --> 00:45:14,996
It's getting late.

801
00:45:15,884 --> 00:45:16,894
I don't want to bother you guys anymore.

802
00:45:17,897 --> 00:45:18,676
Thanks again.

803
00:45:19,994 --> 00:45:23,220
I will post this online to find her.

804
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,377
I have already tweeted about this.

805
00:45:26,963 --> 00:45:28,399
I've got 20-30 thousand retweets.

806
00:45:29,425 --> 00:45:30,821
I hope we can find her soon.

807
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:31,844
I really

808
00:45:31,992 --> 00:45:33,324
don't know how to thank you guys.

809
00:45:33,843 --> 00:45:34,697
I am very grateful.

810
00:45:35,046 --> 00:45:35,982
It's okay.

811
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,250
I will go now.

812
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:38,659
Okay.

813
00:45:38,922 --> 00:45:39,578
See you later.

814
00:45:39,578 --> 00:45:40,084
See you.

815
00:45:40,148 --> 00:45:40,766
See you then.

816
00:45:40,766 --> 00:45:41,841
Thanks.

817
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,480
Hope you will find her soon.

818
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,088
Thank you.

819
00:45:44,556 --> 00:45:45,711
Thank you so much.

820
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:46,558
Good luck.

821
00:45:46,558 --> 00:45:47,318
Thank you.

822
00:45:49,456 --> 00:45:49,964
Let's go.

823
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:52,758
Beauty!

824
00:45:54,435 --> 00:45:55,092
Beauty!

825
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:56,115
Beauty!

826
00:45:56,185 --> 00:45:56,920
Beauty!

827
00:45:57,864 --> 00:45:58,916
Where is she?

828
00:45:59,637 --> 00:46:00,390
What should we do?

829
00:46:01,068 --> 00:46:01,937
I don't know.

830
00:46:02,352 --> 00:46:04,305
I remember that
I asked her to meet me here.

831
00:46:04,709 --> 00:46:05,273
Here!

832
00:46:09,875 --> 00:46:10,469
Tan!

833
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:12,699
Do you think it's her?

834
00:46:12,879 --> 00:46:13,519
Over there!

835
00:46:15,558 --> 00:46:16,577
It's Beauty!

836
00:46:16,613 --> 00:46:17,998
Come on now.

837
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:32,670
Beauty.

838
00:46:36,123 --> 00:46:37,577
Don't come close to me.
You are a liar.

839
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:43,407
Beauty.

840
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:45,393
Everyone is worried about you.

841
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:46,468
I don't believe you.

842
00:46:47,533 --> 00:46:48,833
I don't want to
live in that house anymore.

843
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:51,728
Calm down, Beauty.

844
00:46:52,453 --> 00:46:53,178
We can talk

845
00:46:53,499 --> 00:46:54,246
about this later.

846
00:46:54,327 --> 00:46:55,797
Everyone was lying to me.

847
00:46:58,741 --> 00:46:59,811
My father and my mother.

848
00:47:00,038 --> 00:47:01,175
You and Cher.

849
00:47:03,857 --> 00:47:06,568
I knew the truth.
Why did you lie to me?

850
00:47:09,006 --> 00:47:09,682
Beauty.

851
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:12,583
Calm down, please.

852
00:47:13,772 --> 00:47:14,749
Please calm down, so we can talk.

853
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:18,542
Because your mother...

854
00:47:18,801 --> 00:47:19,417
She said...

855
00:47:20,106 --> 00:47:20,979
Beauty!

856
00:47:21,475 --> 00:47:22,170
Beauty!

857
00:47:22,893 --> 00:47:23,838
Beauty! Listen to me.

858
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:25,314
Go away!

859
00:47:32,861 --> 00:47:33,708
Beauty!

860
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:38,420
No!

861
00:47:39,628 --> 00:47:40,386
Wait!

862
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:06,530
Tan!

863
00:48:07,435 --> 00:48:08,073
Tan!

864
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:09,396
Tan!

865
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:11,281
I need help!

866
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:14,140
Please help!

867
