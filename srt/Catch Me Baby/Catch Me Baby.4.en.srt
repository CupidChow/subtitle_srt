5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,180
The day when adolescents
have the opportunity

6
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,470
to hide away from their parent's eyes,

7
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,810
and have a secret meeting at night.

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,220
The delightful occasion

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,300
for a couple

10
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,970
to change their mood.

11
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,650
The festive festival

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,810
for single people to enjoy,

13
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,490
and to meet someone they like.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,700
But Loy Krathong, for some people,

15
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,020
might not always be a special day for love.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:02,940
However, for Loy Krathong this year,

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,780
there's one thing

18
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,960
I'll never forget.

19
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:15,620
=Catch Me Baby=

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,140
Next, we'll reveal the list of freshmen

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,100
who will be in the Krathong Parade.

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,580
Choi, Ui, Yui,

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:34,370
Nan, Pat, Jaem,

24
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,920
Fah, New, Foei,

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,350
and Captain.

26
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:40,120
That's all.

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,140
No offense, guys,

28
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:49,700
but can nine of you do the grunt work?

29
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,460
I'll handle all of the payment.

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,560
I'm gonna be honest with you.

31
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,410
How many times have you done that, Tan?

32
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,450
Not everyone is okay with you
taking care of all of payments.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,710
What?

34
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,330
Typical you, huh?

35
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,120
You always look for
benefits in every relationship.

36
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,130
Well, I pay and the others do the job.

37
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,240
It's a win-win relationship.

38
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,230
You know?

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,970
They don't want to work with you both.

40
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,220
Including me?

41
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,920
You always act like
you are better than anyone.

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,940
Serves you right.

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,860
And you...

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,090
You always use your money to talk,

45
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,170
and see everything as a joke.

46
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,890
But bro...

47
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,760
Shut up and listen.

48
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,740
I've begged them for you.

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,350
It's in the name of our faculty,

50
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,170
so help your friends.

51
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,890
Is it clear?

52
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,380
Yes.

53
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,050
We're done.

54
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,230
You have no friend?

55
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,550
Neither do you.

56
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,780
What are you looking at?

57
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,500
People are saying that...

58
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,590
Please make Krathong this year fabulous.

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,260
Because I am also
Miss Noppamat this year.

60
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,040
Don't ruin our reputation.

61
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,540
- I'll make Krathong this year the best!
- I'll make Krathong this year the best!

62
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:15,700
You guys are funny.

63
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,790
Okay. Do your best!

64
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
- Sure.
- Sure.

65
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,120
Why did you copy me twice?

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,570
What?

67
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,950
You're the one who copied.

68
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,030
I said it first.

69
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,640
Want a piece of me?

70
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,090
What you'll do?

71
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,600
This Loy Krathong will be the first time
when we have to juggle five people.

72
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,940
There's no room for a mistake.

73
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,490
Is it clear, Pink?

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,660
What? Why me?

75
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,200
The one you should concern is Cher.

76
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,480
She' a newcomer.

77
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,030
At least, Cher is punctual.

78
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,370
Also,

79
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,740
she's helped me many times.

80
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,620
This one is yummy.

81
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,380
Bubble tea from M04.

82
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,880
I see, Ms. Yogurt.

83
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,520
Ah-ah!

84
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,400
It's M04.

85
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,330
Don't use their names.

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
M04.

87
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,880
Okay.

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,260
Yeah.

89
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,070
Okay.

90
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,020
I'll brief you

91
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,530
on them and their arrival time.

92
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,200
The only piece of equipment
that I'll allow to record is this.

93
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:33,570
You know already

94
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,200
this info can't be leaked.

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,490
See? See, Phat?

96
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,490
She's not a professional.

97
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,080
Don't talk about me. Shame on you.

98
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,160
Pink.

99
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,440
She doesn't know our operation principle.

100
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,220
Okay, our plan is...

101
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,780

M02 Ann, M03 Eve, M04 Yogurt, M05 Soo-hyun)

(Mr. Wut Case.zip)

104
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,650
Ms. Pum, I have the info about those five.

105
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,960
Really? How?

106
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,250
Tomorrow, we have to
juggle Mr. Wut's five lovers.

107
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:20,450
So I now know all of
their names and their professions.

108
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,570
I think it will be easier
to get more details.

109
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,650
We need only empirical evidence,

110
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,620
such as some photos that confirm

111
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,180
Mr. Wut's infidelity.

112
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,480
Then, our job will be done.

113
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,290
So you'll get those photos tomorrow?

114
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:40,820
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:44,280
Can you send me all the info you have now?

116
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,210
Well, maybe...

117
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,400
Shall we wait for all the evidence?

118
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,310
Cher.

119
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:58,690
You'd understand the feeling of
a person who gets cheated on, right?

120
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,640
Okay, ma'am.

121
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,540
I got it.

122
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,440
You're back?

123
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,080
Mmmh.

124
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:46,800
Honey.

125
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,200
You didn't drink the booster drink?

126
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:54,330
Mmh, I have a headache.
Can I drink that tomorrow?

127
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,290
I see. Okay, I get it.

128
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,420
What about...

129
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,620
I want a baby, honey.

130
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,740
I want to sleep, honey.

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,090
Okay. Sweet dream.

132
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,560
Here!

133
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:54,920
I didn't ask for it.

134
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,370
For us who have no friend.

135
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,070
Take it.

136
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,530
Darn you!

137
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,540
When are you gonna realize?

138
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,980
They don't like you
'cause you behave like this.

139
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,100
Instead of helping me work,

140
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,040
you pull this silly prank.

141
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,140
There, there.

142
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,750
I'm hurting, Foei.

143
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,520
Are you mad at me?

144
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,550
Childish!

145
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,560
Crack a smile please. Come on.

146
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,870
Get away from me.

147
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:48,760
Whether you're here or not,

148
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,030
I'll work alone anyway.

149
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,120
I'm sorry.

150
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,980
I have an extra shirt in my car.

151
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,010
If you don't want to put on,
you can use it as a fan or something.

152
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,870
Did you put Ma Mui to prank me?

153
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,860
I didn't.

154
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,110
You're...

155
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,090
Cause you're not sincere.

156
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,440
What?

157
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,130
I've apologized to you,

158
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,630
and said some nice things.

159
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,390
What else do you want me to do?

Just like work, right?

167
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,430
Work over there.

168
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:02,810
Don't get into my space.

169
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,620
Yeah.

(Carrying on an ancient tradition
With Loy Krathong on a romantic night)

172
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,010
Hey, pretty lady,
do you want a pair of fish sandals?

173
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,410
Buy them for yourself or your loved one.

174
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,350
No, thanks.

175
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,850
Pretty but cheap
and you won't find others like these.

176
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,110
Mr. Wut's type is
professional women or something?

177
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,090
Well, I noticed during the meeting,

178
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,090
each of their profession is extraordinary.

179
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,310
Have you ever heard that

180
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:13,810
politicians give fish,
and king gives fishing rod?

181
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,370
Mr. Wut is being more than a king,

182
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,960
he's not giving just a fishing rod
but also know-how.

183
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,800
He gave them some
business advice, trading advice,

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,080
and also some capital fund.

185
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,890
Mmmh.

186
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,300
Let's have a look from another angle.

187
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,190
If Mr. Wut wasn't rich,

188
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,610
what would it have been?

189
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,600
I think it's always about the money.

190
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,290
People need money, right?

191
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:42,800
Even if they're dating because of money,

192
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:45,010
it doesn't mean their love isn't real.

193
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,400
Hey.

194
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,990
Do you think a relationship
affected by money

195
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,800
is lousy or less sacred?

196
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,720
Stop thinking love is sacred.

197
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,870
Relationship is individual.

198
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,540
Without money, love is useless.

199
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,910
What are you doing?

200
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,340
Oh, hi, the professional, you're late.

201
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,480
Well, Phat.

202
00:13:10,630 --> 00:13:13,100
This is the festival.
There's a traffic jam.

203
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,010
Few minutes late.

204
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,880
Let's rehearse our plan.

205
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,650
(05:00 PM)
It's 17:00 o'clock now.

206
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,640
(Mission Start)
We will cover three spots each.

207
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,130
Mr. Wut will release the Krathong
with everyone in the same spot,

208
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,520
which is the best
strategic spot that I've chosen.

209
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,410
We'll communicate via these.

210
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,370
Get each other back,

211
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,110
and alert each other in case
some train comes at the wrong time.

212
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,420
But in case of emergency,

213
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,170
you'll have my permit to act alone.

214
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:48,930
But,

215
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,690
be cautious. Got it?

216
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,980
Got it.

217
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,380
Remember the schedule?

218
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,150
Repeat it.

219
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,700
(06:00 PM)
Mr. Wut will give 30 minutes to each.

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,800
The first person,

221
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,760
(M03 Eve)
M03,

222
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,720
(Bank employee)
will show up around 18:00 o'clock.

223
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,060
But at 18:30 o'clock,

224
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,680
she needs to trade stock at home.

225
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,700
Look, Eve.

226
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,310
Yes?

227
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,710
Buy this one.

228
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,820
In the long-term,

229
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,820
it will be pretty like you, Eve.

230
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,320
Dang!

231
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,050
You're sweet-talking to me again.

232
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,710
(06:30 PM)
The second one,

233
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:46,820
(M05 Soo-hyun, student and entrepreneur)
M05, she's at the university.

234
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,930
We'll send her the rendezvous

235
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,930
around 18:30 o'clock.

236
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,500
What did you wish for?

237
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,120
I wished to be with you forever.

238
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,930
Can you take a look
at one of my project, Wut?

239
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:06,200
Of course, dear.

240
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,670
Here.

241
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,400
I think blue will be
perfect for this product.

242
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,320
Purple doesn't go with it.

243
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,890
Okay, Big Bro Wut. Thanks, honey.

244
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,380
Sure.

245
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,750
(07:00 PM)
The third one,

246
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,660
(M01 Te, university teacher)
M01,

247
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,000
she'll show up at 19:00 after work.

248
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,870
What did you wish for?

249
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,210
It's a secret.

250
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,960
Don't worry about the project
to start your own school.

251
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,410
My friend owns a building at Sathon.

252
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,620
Take a look at that.

253
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,050
And about the funding,
let me worry about that.

254
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,290
Thank you.

255
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,520
(07:30 PM)
The fourth one.

256
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,130
(M02 Ann, Air hostess)
M02...

257
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,940
She's on duty. I forgot to tell you.

258
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,580
What?

259
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,060
(07:30 PM
Break)

260
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:23,850
Here you go.

261
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,560
Please wait a moment.

262
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,380
Okay.

263
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,780
You know, it took me months
to book this place.

264
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,790
This place is stylish.

265
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,170
Right?

266
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,210
Thanks, honey.

267
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,560
Sure. I could do that for you.

268
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,210
Let's make this meal

269
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:42,500
a redemption that
I didn't have time for you.

270
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,040
It's a secret but Mr. Wut
helped me with the reservation.

271
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,210
Otherwise, we would have
our regular chicken rice.

272
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:50,360
I knew it.

273
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,080
Special occasion.

274
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,810
It's good that you like it.

275
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:55,970
Here.

276
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,760
Phat!

277
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,050
Let's release a Krathong
after the job is done.

278
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,570
Do you want to do that
with me every year?

279
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,440
Yeah, I do.

280
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,390
I'm making a record.

281
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,530
I'll do it with you 'til we're old.

282
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,400
Why?

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,090
Or you want to release it with Cher?

284
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,580
Nonsense.

285
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,500
You're talking nonsense.

286
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,050
Hey, Phat.

287
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,830
Let's be real.

288
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,930
I don't think Cher can be trusted.

289
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,410
I have a feeling because

290
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:38,850
I noticed her pen during our meeting.

291
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,770
It looked very strange.
It's got some light, something like that.

292
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,600
So I looked it up.

293
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,140
It's

294
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,090
a recorder.

295
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,520
Are you sure? Did you recheck it?

296
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,640
Not yet.

297
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,360
Cher is in the bathroom.

298
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,570
Well, I'll ask her immediately.

299
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,150
Pink!

300
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,680
You leave me alone?

301
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,760
Ms. Pum.

302
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,770
There's a problem.

303
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,040
One person cannot make it.
She's on flight duty.

304
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,380
Oh, the one who's an air hostess?

305
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,410
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,110
I'll take her photos on our next mission.

307
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,860
Because right now,

308
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,840
Phat gives me all his trust.

309
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,330
Can you send me the photos now?

310
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,520
Eh?

311
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,830
I have just the photos
of our three targets.

312
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,110
Send them now. I want to see.

313
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,970
Teacher Te, you're still here?

314
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,900
Y-you're Mr. Wut's secretary, right?

315
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,520
Yes, I'm still here.

316
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,470
Are you okay?

317
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,340
Mr. Wut has someone else, right?

318
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:41,220
I saw him released
a Krathong with some girl.

319
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,130
Tell me, please.

320
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,530
Tell me the truth.

321
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:49,600
I'm begging you.
Tell me the truth, please.

322
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,380
Why?

323
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:00,790
Wh-why does he have to do that to me?
Why?

324
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,410
Where are you guys? Return to your post.

325
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,770
The last one's coming.

326
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,010
That's Phat's voice.

327
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:23,100
=Catch me baby=

328
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:26,111
=Catch Me Baby=

329
00:20:28,011 --> 00:20:32,991
Wh-why does he have to do that to me?
Why?

330
00:20:37,881 --> 00:20:39,691
Where are you guys? Return to your post.

331
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:40,891
The last one's coming.

332
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,131
That's Phat's voice.

333
00:20:51,681 --> 00:20:54,061
Wh-what are you all playing?

334
00:20:56,671 --> 00:20:58,051
Teacher Te.

335
00:20:58,681 --> 00:21:00,791
Well, all of this...

336
00:21:01,241 --> 00:21:03,581
I can explain everything.

337
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:06,441
The thing is...

338
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:08,661
(Those shameless mistresses)

339
00:21:18,101 --> 00:21:20,261
(Those shameless mistresses)

340
00:21:26,601 --> 00:21:28,231
I'm also a mistress.

341
00:21:33,951 --> 00:21:34,911
Teacher...

342
00:21:35,471 --> 00:21:37,221
Please don't be reckless.

343
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:39,471
I'll be back.

344
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:46,591
Why did you send my photo
to Teacher Te, Ms. Pum?

345
00:21:46,591 --> 00:21:48,281
Oh, my. You're so quick.

346
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,241
I also sent it to the other four.

347
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,041
But that action

348
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:55,511
will ruin our long-term plan, ma'am.

349
00:21:55,511 --> 00:21:57,551
But I want to see his downfall.

350
00:21:58,011 --> 00:22:00,331
Give me the final report.

351
00:22:06,821 --> 00:22:08,391
Cher!

352
00:22:10,141 --> 00:22:10,991
May I have a look at you p...

353
00:22:10,991 --> 00:22:11,911
Let's go, Pink.

354
00:22:12,771 --> 00:22:13,451
(08:30 PM
M04 Yogurt, a bubble tea shop owner)

355
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,611
(08:30 PM
M01 M02 M03 M04 M05)

356
00:22:20,071 --> 00:22:22,961
Turn the car back to
the university immediately.

357
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:32,891
(Soo-hyun)

358
00:22:35,641 --> 00:22:36,771
Don't answer that.

359
00:22:40,161 --> 00:22:41,011
What's the rush now?

360
00:22:41,271 --> 00:22:42,431
You're both just chilling earlier.

361
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,591
Wait, Phat. Listen to me.

362
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:47,751
Look! The issue is M0...

363
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:48,991
Nope! Not that.

364
00:22:49,491 --> 00:22:51,361
The issue is Every M

365
00:22:51,361 --> 00:22:52,741
is coming for Mr. Wut.

366
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:56,461
- Right here, and right now!
- Huh?

367
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,171
Every M?

368
00:22:59,041 --> 00:23:00,921
And--where is Mr. Wut?

369
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:03,851
He's with Ms. Yogurt over there.

370
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:06,861
Darn us!

371
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:08,841
That means Ms. Yogurt

372
00:23:09,041 --> 00:23:11,681
doesn't check her phone yet. Oh, boy.

373
00:23:11,941 --> 00:23:13,561
- Darn!
- You need to calm down.

374
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,171
And tell me what happens.

375
00:23:18,071 --> 00:23:21,081
The thing is I ran into Teacher Te.

376
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:25,261
She told me that someone sent her
a photo of Mr. Wut and his mistresses.

377
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:26,771
I think it might be...

378
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,771
his anonymous enemy's work.

379
00:23:31,941 --> 00:23:32,551
You two

380
00:23:33,091 --> 00:23:34,971
hold them as long as you can.

381
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:36,671
I'll manage this one.

382
00:23:37,091 --> 00:23:37,671
Yeah.

383
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:38,491
Okay.

384
00:23:43,151 --> 00:23:44,631
And then, Tui,

385
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,721
hid his mistress in the closet.

386
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:48,451
- Really?
- Like in a movie.

387
00:23:48,451 --> 00:23:50,851
But in the end, his wife found out anyway.

388
00:23:51,581 --> 00:23:53,731
- Poor Tui.
- It was a waste. Darn Tui.

389
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:56,471
My face hurts from laughing.

390
00:23:56,871 --> 00:23:59,021
How long haven't I been laughing this hard?

391
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,381
Right?

392
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:04,161
I think we both
have been working so hard lately.

393
00:24:05,391 --> 00:24:06,791
And how does it end?

394
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:10,401
His wife asked for a divorce.

395
00:24:10,631 --> 00:24:12,591
But ultimately, they didn't.

396
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:13,671
How so?

397
00:24:14,561 --> 00:24:15,541
Because of their children.

398
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:18,221
Even though you were so mad
at each other,

399
00:24:18,601 --> 00:24:19,991
but once you see the kids,
you'll know kids are the most important.

400
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:23,651
And Tui tried so hard to change
himself until Jib can trust him again.

401
00:24:28,361 --> 00:24:30,471
Having kid is a good thing,
don't you think?

402
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:33,501
At least, it'll set a goal
for your marriage life.

403
00:24:38,801 --> 00:24:39,551
Honey.

404
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:41,811
May I ask you something?

405
00:24:43,191 --> 00:24:44,171
Sure. Shoot.

406
00:24:46,161 --> 00:24:47,661
What if I don't want kids?

407
00:24:49,061 --> 00:24:50,111
Are you okay with that?

408
00:25:02,941 --> 00:25:06,061
That's why you didn't take
the Chinese booster?

409
00:25:08,221 --> 00:25:10,411
But we've never discussed

410
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,361
whether we want kids or not.

411
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,911
But if we have kids,

412
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:17,861
we'll be a complete family.

413
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,251
But we don't have one,

414
00:25:20,971 --> 00:25:23,021
so we're not a complete family.

415
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:37,311
That's not what I m...

416
00:25:41,601 --> 00:25:43,871
Well, that's not what I mean.

417
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,001
It doesn't mean...

418
00:25:48,791 --> 00:25:50,991
Take it. It might be urgent.

419
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:59,391
Phat, I can't talk. I'm with Fah.

420
00:26:26,361 --> 00:26:27,811
Excuse me, have you seen him?

421
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:29,241
Uh, no.

422
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:31,151
Excuse me, have you seen him?

423
00:26:33,451 --> 00:26:34,501
Where is he?

424
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:39,471
I like that spot.
It's near the lecture building.

425
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,761
After the lunch break, students
can buy some milk tea before a lecture.

426
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,231
You're right, Mr. Wut.

427
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:47,921
You might want to
take a photo, Ms. Yogurt.

428
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:48,921
Huh?

429
00:26:49,351 --> 00:26:52,031
Take a photo of that spot
before you forget, ma'am.

430
00:26:52,491 --> 00:26:54,291
Right? You can look at it after.

431
00:27:03,701 --> 00:27:05,661
Mr. Wut, look at it.

432
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:07,701
(Those shameless mistresses.)
It's a nice photo, isn't it?

433
00:27:09,151 --> 00:27:11,111
Ms. Yogurt has a good point.

434
00:27:11,521 --> 00:27:12,141
Right?

435
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:14,291
It even makes you shocked?

436
00:27:14,661 --> 00:27:16,391
- Yes, it is.
- (Delete)

437
00:27:16,391 --> 00:27:17,671
It's an amazing photo.

438
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:19,111
It's really amazing.

439
00:27:19,111 --> 00:27:21,051
Look at it. It's really good.

440
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:23,991
Here it is, Ms. Yogurt.

441
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:27,331
Oh, I'm very sorry.

442
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,731
It's time for Mr. Wut to bathe
in holy water under the full moon.

443
00:27:30,611 --> 00:27:32,761
The crew changed
the schedule one hour earlier.

444
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,891
Let's go, Mr. Wut or we'll be late.

445
00:27:35,141 --> 00:27:37,931
Right! I forgot to tell you.
I'm so sorry.

446
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:40,301
But we just met, Wut.

447
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:42,071
- I'm so sorry.
- Can you stay... Wut!

448
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:47,731
(08:30 PM, M04 Yogurt,
a bubble tea shop owner Completed)

449
00:27:52,551 --> 00:27:53,311
Hurry up, sir.

450
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,921
Wait! Wait! Wait!

451
00:27:57,971 --> 00:27:59,581
I can't go on. I'm exhausted.

452
00:28:00,331 --> 00:28:01,031
Mr. Wut.

453
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:03,981
An anonymous person
sent that photo to every lover of yours.

454
00:28:05,161 --> 00:28:06,071
Who is it?

455
00:28:06,371 --> 00:28:07,111
I don't know.

456
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,181
Worst-case scenario, the rest three

457
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:11,671
could look for you now.

458
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:12,921
Don't be nervous.

459
00:28:12,921 --> 00:28:14,191
My team and I will buy you some time.

460
00:28:14,531 --> 00:28:16,941
Now you need to run
behind the building's route.

461
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,821
Run! Everyone, run!

462
00:28:20,771 --> 00:28:22,131
Is that Mr. Wut?

463
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:27,561
Excuse me.
Do you know where the restroom is?

464
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:28,501
- Please get out of my way.
- Ouch!

465
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:31,981
Oh, I'm sorry. What should I do?

466
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,261
What should I do?

467
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:34,351
Wut?

468
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:36,391
Wait for me, Wut.

469
00:28:36,391 --> 00:28:37,081
Wut.

470
00:28:47,591 --> 00:28:49,631
This Krathong is so tight.
I've done a good job?

471
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,861
My butt!
All you did is hitting the nails.

472
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:53,311
Are you saying
hitting the nails isn't a job?

473
00:28:53,671 --> 00:28:54,701
I can't even...

474
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,971
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Excuse me! Excuse me!

475
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:00,291
- Excuse me! Excuse me!
- This Krathong is lovely.

476
00:29:00,431 --> 00:29:01,171
Because of me.

477
00:29:04,801 --> 00:29:05,551
Wut!

478
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:06,321
Are you okay, Tan?

479
00:29:06,321 --> 00:29:07,081
I'm hurting.

480
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:08,541
- Ow!
- Wut?

481
00:29:11,361 --> 00:29:12,991
- Come to me, Wut.
- Darn.

482
00:29:14,621 --> 00:29:15,431
- Shoot!
- What the heck?

483
00:29:17,681 --> 00:29:18,411
Tan!

484
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:21,331
What? Who is it?

485
00:29:25,511 --> 00:29:27,671
Why do you have to run?
Your dad never...

486
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:28,511
Dad!

487
00:29:29,491 --> 00:29:30,351
You dad?

488
00:29:30,371 --> 00:29:31,691
Yes, he is.

489
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,391
Stop talking.
Help me find a place to hide.

490
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,291
Tan! Oh, My Krathong! Darn!

491
00:29:38,351 --> 00:29:40,511
- Nothing to see here. Please disperse...
- Stop talking.

492
00:29:40,511 --> 00:29:42,201
- Tan!
- I'm counting on you, Foei.

493
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:43,591
But it's our Krathong.

494
00:29:44,651 --> 00:29:45,511
What the heck?

495
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,271
My Krathong!

496
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,231
Can you get yourself up?

497
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:53,731
My leg's hurt.

498
00:29:55,131 --> 00:29:57,231
Don't worry about me. Follow Mr. Wut.

499
00:29:57,231 --> 00:29:57,991
But you're...

500
00:29:58,471 --> 00:29:59,461
It's alright.

501
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:01,881
Phat.

502
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:03,821
Soo-hyun?

503
00:30:06,691 --> 00:30:07,561
Where is Mr. Wut?

504
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,541
Mr. Wut is bathing in
the holy water at the temple.

505
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:15,601
As his schedule says.

506
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:18,711
Really? So you can answer me this.

507
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:22,091
Who is this person?

508
00:30:30,481 --> 00:30:31,341
Who is she?

509
00:30:35,191 --> 00:30:35,751
Huh?

510
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:38,621
It was me.

511
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:45,111
Jim?

512
00:30:45,531 --> 00:30:46,051
Yes.

513
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,191
Mr. Wut said
this is today's lucky color.

514
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:51,191
So I copied him.

515
00:30:51,691 --> 00:30:53,001
And what about the woman next to you?

516
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:55,031
Well, she's my girl.

517
00:30:55,651 --> 00:30:56,531
Your girl?

518
00:30:57,111 --> 00:30:58,071
Where's the proof?

519
00:30:59,171 --> 00:30:59,591
Here it is.

520
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:03,321
Jim doesn't like to take a couple photo.

521
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:04,401
So I took it for him.

522
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,001
They don't like to do PDA.

523
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:10,051
I really don't.

524
00:31:12,141 --> 00:31:12,831
Oh, my.

525
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,141
It's really you.

526
00:31:16,461 --> 00:31:18,871
I have to apologize
for the trouble I cause, Jim.

527
00:31:19,231 --> 00:31:20,051
It's alright.

528
00:31:20,281 --> 00:31:21,631
Well...

529
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,911
Who sent those photos to me?

530
00:31:25,431 --> 00:31:26,071
Soo-hyun.

531
00:31:26,571 --> 00:31:28,401
Do you remember what
we were talking about at the resort?

532
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:30,881
Really?

533
00:31:30,881 --> 00:31:31,251
Yes.

534
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:35,711
The competitor's trying
to undermine his personal credibility.

535
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,791
So he doesn't have any trustworthiness.

536
00:31:38,401 --> 00:31:40,081
If you really love Mr. Wut...

537
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:41,031
Don't say a thing.

538
00:31:42,011 --> 00:31:43,071
I won't, Phat.

539
00:31:43,511 --> 00:31:46,351
Why are they doing this to him?

540
00:31:48,361 --> 00:31:51,371
I have to apologize
for the trouble I cause for you guys.

541
00:31:52,151 --> 00:31:52,991
It's okay.

542
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:56,181
You'd better leave now, Ms. Soo-hyun.

543
00:31:56,721 --> 00:31:57,661
Okay.

544
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:01,231
- Oh.
- My phone?

545
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:02,151
I'm sorry.

546
00:32:02,151 --> 00:32:02,791
Okay.

547
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,131
Again, I'm so sorry.

548
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:05,851
It's okay.

549
00:32:13,621 --> 00:32:16,211
By the way, why do you have photos

550
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:18,211
of Jim and Teacher Te?

551
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,791
Well, well, well.

552
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:22,761
Phat has photoshopped
me with every lover of Mr. Wut.

553
00:32:22,861 --> 00:32:25,101
In a case like this.

554
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:31,851
(08:30 PM, M05 Soo-hyun,
student and entrepreneur Completed)

555
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:37,331
Thank you, Jim.

556
00:32:39,451 --> 00:32:42,571
(08:30 PM, M03 Eve, Bank employee
Completed)

557
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:44,891
(Faculty of Engineering)

558
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:50,251
Hey!

559
00:32:51,191 --> 00:32:52,371
There's still time for us.

560
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:54,141
Wow.

561
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,721
How can you be this confident?

562
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:05,301
Hi.

563
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:07,611
What the heck?

564
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:07,961
What?

565
00:33:07,961 --> 00:33:08,861
She said hi to me.

566
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:09,211
To me.

567
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:09,801
What?

568
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:10,391
Not you.

569
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:31,071
You knew it'd be a rough job.

570
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:32,461
Why didn't you wear sneakers?

571
00:33:35,061 --> 00:33:35,801
Thanks.

572
00:33:36,351 --> 00:33:38,191
But these wouldn't be any better.

573
00:33:38,901 --> 00:33:40,641
It's a quick solution.

574
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,071
So, will you take it or not?

575
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:57,901
I don't think
there will be more problems.

576
00:33:58,321 --> 00:34:01,111
Jim and Pinky might
work all things out by now.

577
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:02,611
Mmmh.

578
00:34:03,221 --> 00:34:05,891
And I've talked things
through with Teacher Te.

579
00:34:06,471 --> 00:34:09,101
So, let's close the deal.

580
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:12,421
High five.

581
00:34:13,771 --> 00:34:14,351
Yeah!

582
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,331
By the way,

583
00:34:21,121 --> 00:34:23,931
how did those photos come?
Who took them?

584
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,951
And what are you gonna do next?

585
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:43,101
Go back home

586
00:34:44,361 --> 00:34:44,901
or have a Loy Krathong...date?

587
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:02,991
I hate this festival.

588
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:17,841
Hello, honey.

589
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:19,831
I'll pick you up at the restaurant.
Let's release a Krathong together.

590
00:35:20,281 --> 00:35:21,571
I'm going to bed.

591
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,191
I'm at my friend's apartment.

592
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:27,141
Let's talk later. Have a safe trip.

593
00:35:28,441 --> 00:35:29,311
Okay.

594
00:35:29,591 --> 00:35:30,651
Good night.

595
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,301
Jim.

596
00:36:03,781 --> 00:36:05,221
Have you seen Phat?

597
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:08,611
I want to release a Krathong with him
but he doesn't pick up his phone.

598
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:10,281
Jim.

599
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,721
Star.

600
00:36:26,541 --> 00:36:27,391
Darn you.

601
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:31,681
Why do you have to date a senior?

602
00:36:36,811 --> 00:36:37,821
What's wrong with me?

603
00:36:39,041 --> 00:36:39,531
Huh?

604
00:36:41,121 --> 00:36:41,991
I'm handsome,

605
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:44,171
and rich.

606
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,291
You are drunk. You're a light drinker?

607
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,191
What?

608
00:36:55,541 --> 00:36:56,941
How did you come here?

609
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,821
You invited me here.

610
00:37:00,741 --> 00:37:01,231
Me?

611
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:02,251
Yes.

612
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:05,421
Darn!

613
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:07,771
What?

614
00:37:09,781 --> 00:37:10,231
Here.

615
00:37:12,321 --> 00:37:12,931
Come on.

616
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:25,991
Foei.

617
00:37:27,301 --> 00:37:28,241
You know?

618
00:37:29,171 --> 00:37:30,951
Why are girls always attracted to me?

619
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:32,631
Because girls

620
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:35,801
have a taste for my lips.

621
00:37:38,211 --> 00:37:39,841
Star will never know

622
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:42,221
what a great kisser I am.

623
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:45,791
Serves her right!

624
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:50,571
You're a great kisser?

625
00:37:51,781 --> 00:37:53,001
You're just bragging.

626
00:37:53,621 --> 00:37:54,271
Hey.

627
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,981
Do you think I'm bragging?

628
00:37:58,501 --> 00:38:03,521
Look! Girls prefer lips like mine.

629
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:14,431
Star...

630
00:38:16,231 --> 00:38:17,511
Kiss me.

631
00:38:19,571 --> 00:38:20,791
Star...

632
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:42,611
Your family open a spirit medium house?

633
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:46,181
Well, not very spiritual.

634
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,971
He's just tricking people.

635
00:38:48,311 --> 00:38:49,801
So are you.

636
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,951
But he raised me
to be a grown-up man from that.

637
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:58,371
So I've learned that

638
00:38:58,841 --> 00:39:00,621
there isn't right or wrong
when it comes to money.

639
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:02,951
Because you can't see the difference.

640
00:39:03,991 --> 00:39:04,951
Okay.

641
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:13,781
I told you my story.

642
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:16,591
May I ask you something?

643
00:39:20,351 --> 00:39:21,631
It's about you've said earlier.

644
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,111
What does it mean?

645
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,811
My mom left my dad

646
00:39:42,641 --> 00:39:44,511
for a richer guy

647
00:39:45,311 --> 00:39:46,301
on the Loy Krathong day.

648
00:39:51,031 --> 00:39:51,631
Here.

649
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:54,571
Her bracelet.

650
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,841
The one and only heritage
she left for me.

651
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:11,871
I'm sorry for asking.

652
00:40:15,691 --> 00:40:16,761
Thank you.

653
00:40:19,231 --> 00:40:20,661
I had a lot of fun today.

654
00:40:24,861 --> 00:40:26,431
I'm the one who should thank you.

655
00:40:27,051 --> 00:40:28,061
Next mission.

656
00:40:28,481 --> 00:40:30,091
I book you in advance.

657
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:07,591
Have you ever thought

658
00:41:09,361 --> 00:41:11,501
about stopping being a relationship juggler?

659
00:41:13,381 --> 00:41:15,971
Uh, what did you say?

660
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,031
Nothing.

661
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:24,191
I gotta go.

662
00:41:26,561 --> 00:41:27,581
I'm okay now.

663
00:41:28,951 --> 00:41:29,831
See you tomorrow.

664
00:41:53,751 --> 00:41:55,891
The day when adolescents
have the opportunity

665
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:58,741
to hide away from their parent's eyes,

666
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:00,901
and have a secret meeting at night.

667
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:04,471
The delightful occasion for a couple

668
00:42:04,721 --> 00:42:06,081
to change their mood.

669
00:42:09,851 --> 00:42:14,681
The festive festival
for single people to enjoy,

670
00:42:15,281 --> 00:42:17,921
and to meet someone they like.

671
00:42:31,691 --> 00:42:33,871
Wow, working so hard so early?

672
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:36,551
New earrings?

673
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:45,351
Is Cher...

674
00:42:47,951 --> 00:42:50,231
But for some people, Loy Krathong

675
00:42:50,511 --> 00:42:52,561
might not always be a special day for love.

676
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:56,991
Mr. Wut! Cher...

677
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:23,571
You're here, Phat?

678
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,111
No.

679
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:31,241
I should call you
a relationship juggler, right?

680
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:38,351
However, for Loy Krathong this year,

681
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:41,561
