It's nine o'clock.

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:32,990
Everyone

8
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:33,980
ready?

9
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:35,390
Hey, copy that, bro.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,790
Thank you.

11
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:40,780
Thank you, sir.

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:42,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:43,830
When the job's done,

14
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,040
I can call it a day, right?

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,090
Yes, a van will come to pick you
up at noon, at the back of the hotel.

16
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,300
Have you even read the group chat?

17
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,590
It's time, guys.

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,520
You can go inside now, and,

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,600
as I gave you a briefing, don't cluster.

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,120
Please.

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,270
They're instructed.

22
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,200
Great.

23
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,040
Get in here after five minutes.

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,050
Okay, got it, bro.

25
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,030
What about Jim?

26
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,200
I'm more than ready.

27
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,940
But not your little sister, Phat.

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,100
She has gone to get changed
for almost ten minutes.

29
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,010
Be quick, please.

30
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:15,170
It's almost time.

31
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,460
Okay.

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,010
Pink.

33
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,100
Hey, Pink.

34
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,880
Are you done?

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,940
Let's go.

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,210
Are you wearing makeup?

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,270
But why?

38
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,880
You're gonna be a waitress.

39
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,770
You don't need it.

40
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,060
I'm done, all right? Stop nagging.

41
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,330
It's a waste of time.

42
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,660
Don't be so cranky.

43

(Welcome to the wedding of
Wut and Yogurt)

44
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,020
- Hello.
- Hi.

45
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
(09:05 AM)

46
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,520
Please, gather up for the camera.

47
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:54,720
Everyone,

48
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:55,920
get in your position.

49
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,960
Roger!

50
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,960
- Thank you.
- Sure.

51
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,050
Looking good.

52
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:14,800
All right.

53
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,360
- Then...
- What's up, dude?

54
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,760
Do you remember me?

55
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,730
No, I don't.

56
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,150
But I do, Phat.

57
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,880
You've done me good.

58
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,530
You made a fool of me.

59
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,100
What do people call you again?

60
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,020
Something Juggler, right? Huh?

61
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,250
I'm just a secretary.

62
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,910
Are you sure?

63
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,490
Is there any problem, sir?

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,770
I suspect a wedding crasher.

65
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,300
So,

66
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,880
please identify him.

67
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,650
Can I see your invitation, sir?

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,340
Come with me, sir.

69
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,760
It will be 09:09 AM in one minute.

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,890
Jump on the stage with two feet, Wut.

71
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:08,490
I might look like an ordinary secretary,

72
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,840
doing paperwork,

73
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,960
organizing schedules,

74
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,060
or arranging meetings,
something like that.

75
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,100
But...

76
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,400
it's my disguise.

77
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,620
The fact is that,

78
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,120
my real profession is...

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,450
relationship juggler.

80
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,680
(Catch Me Baby)

81
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,630
My name is Phat.

82
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,210
I'm a master of transform,

83

(Master of transform)

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,860
a master of mind,

86
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,320
and a master of escape.

(Uncatchable)

88
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,600
And what does
"relationship juggler" mean?

89
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,030
I'll tell you later.

90
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
(09:09 AM)

91
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,460
Are you ready?

92
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,260
I am.

93
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:51,960
Haha.

94
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,630
Here they come,

95
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,590
Wut and our sweet Yogurt.

96
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,300
Please give a round of applause for
the bride and the groom.

97
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,310
Everyone,

98
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,110
have you ever heard
the story about the sunflower,

99
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,090
and the sun?

100
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,180
The day

101
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,240
when the sunflower meets the sun,

102
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,350
- it looks nowhere else.
- it looks nowhere else.

103
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,970
Because the sunflower now knows

104
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,970
the warmest light.

105
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,740
I'm that sunflower

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,860
- who looks nowhere else.
- who looks nowhere else.

107
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,370
- Yogurt,
- Yogurt,

108
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,790
- you're the first and the last love,
- you're the first and the last love,

109
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,350
you're my sun.

110
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,640
Thanks for choosing me
to take care of you.

Ben,

113
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,450
alert M03 team immediately.

114
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,070
We're going to take the next step.

115
00:04:58,350 --> 00:04:58,960
Roger that.

116
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,420
It's time, Mr. Wut.

117
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,590
Is there something more to do?

118
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,030
Please wait for a big surprise.

119
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,150
A call from Mr. Wut.

120
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,700
Look at the sky, babe.

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,200
(You are my sunshine)

122
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,840
Awesome.

123
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,020
Bravo! Bravo!

124
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,110
You know how much it costs?

125
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,290
Ready, sir?

126
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:50,430
This way, sir.

127
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,600
(2nd wedding
Start)

128
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,980
Hang on, Mr. Wut.

129
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,240
May I?

130
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,620
While I'm on it,

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,430
let's get into the details again.

132
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,380
Your dad is Somsak,

133
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,530
your mom is Janya.

134
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,310
Wait a second.

135
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,740
I have parents now?

136
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,220
Don't you remember?

137
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,260
When you approached Miss Eve,

138
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,350
you lied to her

139
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,250
that you have parents.

140
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,170
Oh, right. My bad.

141
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,290
One more time. What are their names?

142
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
Your dad is Somsak,

143
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,700
your mom is Janya.

144
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,050
Somsak and Janya.

145
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,080
I don't know what would I do
without you, Phat.

146
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,650
We can call it's successful
because of you.

147
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,150
Can I decline the compliment,

148
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,840
and take a bonus instead?

149
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,520
That's what I like about you.

150
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:38,680
Ready?

151
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:40,710
It's time.

152
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,780
Please, sir.

153
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,790
Can you still follow

154
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,190
what's happening right now?

155
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,630
If you can't,

156
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,010
let me explain it to you.

157
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,660
(Three days earlier)

158
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,450
What? It's...

159
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,230
These two girls got
the same auspicious wedding date.

160
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,680
They need to get married
on the same day.

161
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,560
So that you'll be blessed,

162
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,540
and your luck will be compatible.

163
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,570
Nonsense.

164
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,470
So do you want to do as he said?

165
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,450
I don't want to, Phat.

166
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,630
I need to.

167
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,070
Have you ever heard
the story about the sunflower,

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,310
and the sun?

169
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,530
- The day

170
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,210
- when the sunflower meets the sun,
- when the sunflower meets the sun,

171

- it looks nowhere else.

172

00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,830
- the warmest light.
- the warmest light.

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,240
(2nd wedding
Completed)

175
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,730
Talk to me.

176
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,070
There's a darn big problem here, Phat.

177
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,020
Ben spotted M05
at the hotel lobby in my area.

178
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,640
What to do?

179
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,080
(1st wedding)

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,280
(M05 Soo-hyun)

181
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,470
I don't care about your darn policy
to not reveal customers' information.

182
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:13,990
I only care about Mr. Chanwut.

183
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,750
Mr. Wut,

184
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,740
or Big Bro Wut.

185
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,000
Where is my boyfriend?

186
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,350
Please calm down, ma'am.

187
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,190
Look at this.

188
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,240
What is it?

189
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,040
And this.

190
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,660
The color,

191
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,620
the message,

192
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,550
the font,

193
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,290
even the sunflower emoji,
they're all the same.

194
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,020
How could it not be from Wut?

195
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,220
Where is he?

196
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,150
I know where he is.

197
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,640
(M03 Eve.
2nd wedding)

198
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,640
I can't find Wut again.

199
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,270
Come on.

200
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm sure he won't be gone so long.

201
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,060
A 'video confencefer'

202
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,810
normally won't take more than one hour.

203
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,320
It's video conference.

204
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,610
Please excuse us.

205
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,450
Wut always does this.

206
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,930
Everything's alright?

207
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:15,710
Hey,

208
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,510
do you really know where he is?

209
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,570
You've been driving in circles.

210
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,340
Hey! Wait!

211
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,030
Stop the car! Stop!

212
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,670
The road is clear. Thank you very much.

213
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,890
Have a nice day.

214
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,540
What a surprise, Soo-hyun.

215
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,090
What are you doing here?

216
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,340
I'm the one who should ask.
Why don't you answer your phone?

217
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,810
I think I already told you about
the CSR activity at Pattaya branch.

218
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,880
I'm the road safety volunteer.

219
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,400
But your girl...

220
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:52,870
Who are you?

221
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,540
You're not my Wut.

222
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,050
My boyfriend's name is Wuttisak.

223
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,370
What?

224
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,530
Oh my.

225
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,410
I don't dare to cheat on you, Soo-hyun.

226
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,540
Well, uh, Wut, I'm sorry.

227
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,500
I just saw a girl's photo with the text

228
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,020
"You are my sunshine",
like the one you gave me.

229
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,320
It must be a hotel service.

230
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,520
Everyone has access to that.

231
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
You know, right?

232
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,100
I have been busy with my business.

233
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,960
Not to mention astrology
consultation at the temple,

234
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,470
I can't even find time
to get a good sleep.

235
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,280
Look.

236
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,030
For better or for worse, you
will always be my sunshine, Soo-hyun.

237
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,700
Oh, Wut. I'm so sorry, babe.

238
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,140
Come on, don't cry.

239
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,750
Hey, be careful!

240
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,410
(Mission Completed)
Cheers.

241
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,300
You know

242
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,430
big beer after an ice-cold job done

243
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,730
is really sweet.

244
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,580
You mean ice-cold beer
after a big job done?

245
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,830
Already drunk, man?

246
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,250
I'm exhausted.

247
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,700
Let me tell you this.

248
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,200
If it wasn't for Pinky's acting...

249
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,040
I mean M05 case,

250
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,020
even Phat would crash it.

251
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,170
Am I right, Pinky?

252
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,750
Darn right.

253
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,060
Did you forget

254
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,980
that I was at the top
of the acting class?

255
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,330
Really?

256
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,850
If I don't need to
work for my brother, Phat,

257
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,050
I would have got acting
auditions in South Korea by now.

258
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,480
Come here.

259
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,050
Don't get lost.

260
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,640
Let me reveal the secret.

261
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,160
There's a darn big problem here, Phat.

262
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,040
Ben spotted M05
at the hotel lobby in my area.

263
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,660
What to do?

264
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,680
I don't care about your darn policy
to not reveal customers' information.

265
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,300
Fortunately, I came prepared

266
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,990
for an unpredictable event like this.

267
00:11:58,690 --> 00:11:59,430
Keep that in mind.

268
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,080
Every woman, from
a beautiful young girl to an old lady,

269
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,400
who asks for Big Bro Wut,
Mr. Wut or Chanwut,

270
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,950
something like that.

271
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,600
Tell them nothing.

272
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,300
Pinky. Plan B.

273
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,200
Come again?

274
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,210
Plan B.

275
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,100
Plan B?

276
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:15,850
Roger that.

277
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,440
Sorry. Can you hold that for me?

278
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,190
This too.

279
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,190
Serve them,

280
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,530
or drink them yourself, I don't care.

281
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,530
I'm ready.

282
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,500
Give me the instruction.

283
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,970
Your boyfriend's name is Wuttisak.

284
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,280
But you mistake Mr. Wut
for your boyfriend.

285
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,350
Your only mission is...

286
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,380
bring Soo-hyun to the accident scene.

287
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,060
I'll send you the location.

288
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,450
Got it.

289
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,520
Roger that.

290
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,780
I know where he is.

291
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,960
This is how the plan works.

292
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,970
You did a good job, my little sister.

293
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:56,090
That's enough.

294
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,180
My hair is messy now.

295
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,270
Don't toot your own horn.

296
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,020
I paid all of your tuition.

297
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,590
If you couldn't act in this small event,

298
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,590
I'll send you to Uncle Teong in Pattaya.

299
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:07,500
- I agree with that idea.
- No! Don't do that.

300
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,570
I don't want to work with him.

301
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,140
Let's eat.

302
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,090
It's a shame.

303
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,210
That someone quit our team before Pink.

304
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:17,310
Hey, bro.

305
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,850
I know it's sudden,

306
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:21,590
but you'll do fine without me.

307
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,100
Of course we will, right?

308
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,340
My brother.

309
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,350
Won't you at least stop me?

310
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,110
- I'm kidding, my brother.
- Darn.

311
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,390
But you're right.

312
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:31,440
We have no reason to stop you.

313
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,350
You'll get 70,000 baht from the new place.

314
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,430
- Yeah.
- We should be happy for you.

315
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,220
That you can escape this awful cycle,

316
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,990
and get a fresh start
with a Japanese boss.

317
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,560
- He's right.
- Oh, God.

318
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,900
Darn, bro.

319
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,430
Don't be emotional.

320
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,720
What the heck?

321
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,610
I give you this piece of meat.
It's good, believe me.

322
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,430
What about the soiree, Phat?

323
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,530
What did you do?

324
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,900
Piece of cake.

325
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,150
Use this.

326
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,520
I paid the staff

327
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,550
to get everyone drunk.

328
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,240
M03, M04,

329
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,370
or even their parents.

330
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,530
They all blacked out,

331
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,940
didn't remember a thing.

332
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,470
Amazing.

333
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,370
How did you come up with that?

334
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,540
You're good.

335
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:23,010
By the way,

336
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,330
are you serious about this?

337
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,360
What?

338
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,520
Are you talking to me?

339
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,510
I am.

340
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,190
I noticed that you've been sober.

341
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,240
Fah is ready, isn't she?

342
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,810
I don't know about Fah,

343
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,800
but I need to be ready.

344
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,650
It is one of my dreams.

345
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,290
Are you...

346
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:49,910
trying to lose weight?

347
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,050
Darn you, Pink!

348
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:54,070
If I was trying to lose weight,

349
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,090
I wouldn't order soda.

350
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,290
I'm trying to have a kid. Read my lips.

351
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,170
- To have a kid!
- I see.

352
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:00,780
You fool.

353
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,080
Sorry, I misheard.

354
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,960
Trying to have a kid, okay.

355
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,290
It's all right.

356
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,790
But since we're talking about our future,

357
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,930
I have something to ask you.

358
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,350
How long will you work
as a relationship juggler?

359
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,750
I understand

360
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:21,030
that you and Pinky

361
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,330
have got into debt.

362
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,020
But don't you want to find another job?

363
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,070
Why would I?

364
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,140
Big pay, exciting job.

365
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,480
I can keep doing this.

366
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,680
Look.

367
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,910
I know

368
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,020
what's your view on my job.

369
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,140
But...

370
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:48,400
I just need to do my best on my part.

371
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:49,980
And about...

372
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,640
who's good, or who's bad,

373
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,780
I have no right to judge them.

374
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,070
And about Mr. Wut,

375
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:57,650
if I can say something,

376
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,540
he has so much love to give,

377
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,750
but not much to get.

378
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,950
A simple explanation,

379
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,630
he loves everyone equally.

380
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,230
And he doesn't have just 100,

381
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,410
and give 16.66 to each one.

382
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,750
He has 600,

383
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,110
and gives each one

384
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,710
100, equally.

385
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,540
Got it?

386
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,670
Can you imagine that, Ben?

387
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,530
Maybe if it's on the paper,

388
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,230
- You're right.
- it might be easier to understand.

389
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,740
And Mr. Wut supports
all of his girlfriends,

390
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,700
helps with their career.

391
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,460
And when they have jobs to do,

392
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,380
the economy will grow.

393
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,570
The nation

394
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,470
will prosper.

395
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,040
This part is making sense to you?

396
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,990
That part, I'm kidding.

397
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,130
- I knew it.
- Whoa! See?

398
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,550
It is really you.

399
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:45,070
Only you can come up with that idea.

400
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,380
- Great!
- I'm begging you, Phat.

401
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Don't get yourself a girlfriend.

402
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,270
Nobody can stand you.

403
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,350
Want to order something?

404
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,170
No, it's...

405
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,430
- Get a waiter.
- Please.

406
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:58,080
No, it's not that. I'm
talking about his future girlfriend.

407
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,850
See?

408
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:02,040
- It's me, Pink.
- Okay, Pink.

409
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,450
I've heard this a thousand times.

410
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,460
Hi, Tan. What's up?

411
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,790
You're not eating that piece I gave you.

412
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,590
Give it to me, then.

413
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,070
(Prachachuen Police Station)

414
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,320
Hey, Phat.

415
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,490
You have to help me.

416
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,280
Give him the hardest as you can.

417
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,610
He started the fight.

418
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,270
What I did was nothing.

419
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,260
Nothing my butt.

420
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,720
You sleep around,

421
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,740
and had some nerve
trying to get my friend.

422
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,920
You deserved that.

423
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,780
You hit me,

424
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,980
just because of this small reason?

425
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,360
Or are you jealous?

426
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,110
Want some more?

427
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,440
- Come and get me!
- That's enough.

428
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,640
- I do the talking.
- I do the talking.

429
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,490
Hey!

430
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,950
How did you raise your brother?

431
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,000
Why do you let him
cause troubles around town?

432
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,390
Have you ever taught him
to respect women,

433
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,540
or emphasize with others?

434
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,010
So that's why
your brother assaulted my brother.

435
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,760
That means

436
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,360
you allow him

437
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,030
to continue to treat others like nothing.

438
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,630
Well, they're other people.

439
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:06,880
Look at him.

440
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,540
See?

441
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,880
Your brother assaulted my brother.

442
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,480
How are you gonna pay?

443
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,510
Anyway,

444
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,470
my brother committed
a crime against law 391.

445
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,810
- But your brother...
- Yes.

446
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:18,970
It's criminal law.

447
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,480
There's no dispute resolution.

448
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,450
The fine is five-figures.

449
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:24,440
Mmmh.

450
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:26,580
He committed a crime.

451
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,870
I acknowledge that.

452
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,350
I'll give him an earful at home.

453
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,490
But I pity your brother,

454
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,040
who got spoiled

455
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,630
by some adult like you.

456
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,040
I'm not spoiling him.

457
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,270
It's the teenager's hormones.

458
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,960
They're passionate.

459
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,490
Just think of them as
a child who just reached pub...

460
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:48,620
I mean puberty.

461
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,680
Because there's always someone
like you who spoils their kids.

462
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:54,820
Let's say,

463
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,070
you turn a blind eye to his behavior.

464
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,410
But someday,

465
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,970
you and your brother

466
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,180
will regret playing
with people's feelings.

467
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,190
If you don't see how big his problem is,

468
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,810
you'll get hurt ten times
worse than getting a punch.

469
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,660
You're just talking about law 391.

470
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,360
And now you're stomping on my feet?

471
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,090
Please stop.

472
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,740
This is a public space.

473
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,410
You all can be charged.

474
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,140
But...

475
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,440
Foei, let's go.

476
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,630
On your left.

477
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,830
I'm okay.

478
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,860
Why did you look for a fight?

479
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,580
Phat.

480
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,470
Thank you very much.

481
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:45,250
You're not only helping
my father about his love life.

482
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,200
You're also taking care of me.

483
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,140
That woman is so fierce, don't you think?

484
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,180
Tan.

485
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,050
Listen to me,

486
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,220
a girl like her is a walking bomb.

487
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,290
See her on your left, run to your right.

488
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,330
Left, right.

489
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,240
Right. But if she's coming straight,

490
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,390
make a quick U-turn.

491
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,170
A U-turn.

492
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,130
Stay away from these people.

493
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,890
What's he talking about?

494
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,310
Left, right,

495
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,690
U-turn.

496
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,630
Hey.

497
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,050
I don't get it.

498
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:20,640
Wait.

499
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,930
(Catch Me Baby)

500
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:27,219
(Catch Me Baby)

501
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,379
A daily routine

502
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:31,919
for a relationship juggler

503
00:20:32,399 --> 00:20:33,379
like me?

504
00:20:34,469 --> 00:20:36,109
I never reveal this easily.

505
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:38,989
Confidentiality is
my professional conduct.

506
00:20:39,349 --> 00:20:40,269
That's why

507
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,399
the secretary position

508
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:44,009
is a perfect disguise for me.

509
00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:47,019
Working as a personal
life assistant for Mr. Wut,

510
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,009
you have to be punctual,

511
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:50,959
(Lucky Color to Wear
Mon Tues Wed Thur Fri Sat Sun)

512
00:20:50,959 --> 00:20:52,609
and learn what to wear each day.

513
00:20:54,479 --> 00:20:56,269
Timing is essential
for a relationship juggler.

514
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,529
Because of that,

515
00:20:57,999 --> 00:20:59,809
you can't afford
to miss even one second.

516
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:06,089
You might wonder why I chose this job.

517
00:21:07,959 --> 00:21:08,589
Well...

518
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,119
As long as the world

519
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:11,409
revolves around love,

520
00:21:11,989 --> 00:21:14,249
greed, anger, and lust,

521
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:17,109
I can make a fortune out of this job.

522
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,129
Believe me.

523
00:21:20,609 --> 00:21:21,359
This world

524
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,569
is run by sins.

525
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,489
My job

526
00:21:25,489 --> 00:21:26,769
is a necessity.

527
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:28,709
For people who need so much love,

528
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:30,379
or are never satisfied with one love,

529
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,539
they hire people like me,

530
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:33,629
who juggles

531
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,019
their relationship

532
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:36,919
or their love affair.

533
00:21:37,499 --> 00:21:38,579
The world is in peace

534
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,439
because of people like me.

535
00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:45,849
Don't work too hard.

536
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,159
Did you change your hairstyle, Noon?

537
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:55,079
You're so attentive, Phat.

538
00:21:56,139 --> 00:21:56,909
Thanks.

539
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:57,939
My pleasure.

540
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,179
People ask me

541
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:05,939
how long I can do this job.

542
00:22:06,609 --> 00:22:08,219
There's no secret in the world.

543
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:10,629
But please excuse me,

544
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:12,259
I know the way

545
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:14,509
to the space.

546
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:17,499
Here you go.

547
00:22:17,949 --> 00:22:19,389
The candidates for Ben's position.

548
00:22:20,729 --> 00:22:22,799
Have you read any of these resumes?

549
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:25,869
Why should I do that?

550
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:26,899
It's Ben's job.

551
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,069
He knows what type of people to choose.

552
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:31,289
But you need to read it anyway.

553
00:22:31,289 --> 00:22:32,949
So that you can give him
some of your suggestions.

554
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:34,679
One more thing,

555
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:37,089
Mr. Wut trusts you, not us.

556
00:22:39,019 --> 00:22:39,699
You know?

557
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,029
In the end,

558
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:43,119
Mr. Wut trusts the astrologer the most.

559
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:44,999
You're darn right.

560
00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:49,389
Those two weddings last week
were the astrologer's doing. Darn you.

561
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:51,019
I can't even...

562
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:53,289
Oh, Phat.

563
00:22:53,649 --> 00:22:55,759
I just walked past the interview room.

564
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,939
There's one good-looking candidate.

565
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:00,669
I'm afraid that Mr. Wut
will give her another position.

566
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:01,989
Jim.

567
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,289
You already know

568
00:23:03,289 --> 00:23:05,189
that Mr. Wut doesn't
mix pleasure with business.

569
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:06,139
You're right.

570
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:12,229
- Maybe I can give it a try.
- That's right.

571
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:16,149
She's stunning, I guarantee you.

572
00:23:17,209 --> 00:23:19,389
She's a world-class. Just have a look.

573
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:23,019
(Application for Employment)

574
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:25,009
(Chananthida Samart)

575
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:26,689
See? See?

576
00:23:27,189 --> 00:23:29,959
My hawk eyes never miss a single thing.

577
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:47,499
Leave the room, I'll do the interview.

578
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:01,939
Hey.

579
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,069
You work here?

580
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:10,449
Well...

581
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,319
Was it hurt?

582
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:13,969
Your foot.

583
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:17,239
Do you think you stomped hard?

584
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:21,759
I don't want to make excuses for myself.

585
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,029
But the other day,

586
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,369
I lost control of myself.

587
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:27,049
But in the work environment,

588
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:28,549
I'm a professional.

589
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:30,079
You can see in my resume that...

590
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:30,829
I don't read resumes.

591
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,309
90% of the candidates always exaggerate.

592
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:36,539
So,

593
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:37,769
it's not reliable.

594
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:41,149
- But...
- But I trust our HR team.

595
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:44,469
You got into the interview round,
that means you have a solid background.

596
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:46,409
You're suitable for the job
and you have the competence,

597
00:24:46,629 --> 00:24:47,469
which I like about that.

598
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,259
But it doesn't mean
you're perfect for the job.

599
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:51,969
So,

600
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:55,139
what quality you'll be considering?

601
00:24:58,619 --> 00:24:59,779
Attitude.

602
00:25:02,299 --> 00:25:05,119
One thing a secretary has to
deal with is unpredictable events.

603
00:25:05,419 --> 00:25:08,329
How confident you are
in your emotional control skill?

604
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,049
Please,

605
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:12,389
convince me to believe you.

606
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,269
I have a various set of experiences,

607
00:25:17,269 --> 00:25:18,359
as I stated in my resume.

608
00:25:19,219 --> 00:25:19,849
But it's okay.

609
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,869
You didn't read it.

610
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:23,949
But I can assure you that...

611
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:25,849
I have questions.

612
00:25:26,729 --> 00:25:29,299
If you realize that your boss
did something wrong,

613
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:32,759
but you can cover that up
for the company's sake,

614
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:33,759
what would you do?

615
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:37,339
This question is...

616
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:49,529
If this case really happened,

617
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,269
I can't give you an accurate answer,

618
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:55,169
because you need to consider
all of the factors.

619
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:56,909
But if you really want an answer,

620
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:58,709
covering my boss's wrongdoing

621
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:00,959
for the benefit of the company

622
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:02,949
might be a better choice.

623
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:06,579
Because it is also
for everyone's benefit,

624
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:07,839
not for your own sake.

625
00:26:07,989 --> 00:26:10,149
That act can be considered

626
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:11,119
as...

627
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:12,509
a selfish act

628
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,559
or a bravery, it depends on

629
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,009
your point of view.

630
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:21,579
What if you just found out
that your bother is a player,

631
00:26:21,829 --> 00:26:22,469
a womanizer,

632
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:23,679
and a two-timer?

633
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,599
And you're

634
00:26:24,719 --> 00:26:26,339
against that.

635
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:28,059
What would you do?

636
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:30,009
I'm sorry.

637
00:26:30,939 --> 00:26:32,409
I don't think

638
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:34,959
this should be a job interview question.

639
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:38,239
Because family matter is sensitive.

640
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:40,349
It's so variable.

641
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,349
It's not just about right or wrong.

642
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,029
Let's go to the last question.

643
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,239
Can we be in love with more
than one person at the same time?

644
00:26:53,639 --> 00:26:54,379
Johnny Depp

645
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:55,679
once said,

646
00:26:56,069 --> 00:26:58,319
if you love two people at the same time,

647
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:00,129
choose the second one,

648
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,759
because if you really
loved the first one...

649
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:04,509
You wouldn't have fallen for the second.

650
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:10,089
But I think a couple can
set the rule for their relationship.

651
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,449
If one wants to have a second lover,

652
00:27:12,629 --> 00:27:13,339
third lover,

653
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,419
- or even fourth...
- Sure.

654
00:27:14,619 --> 00:27:16,429
They can set the relationship rule.

655
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:19,259
But it has to be fair for both sides.

656
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,589
You can't force that rule on the other,

657
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,259
and use love

658
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:24,349
to justify that.

659
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:32,219
Well, have a good day.

660
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,829
I'm fortunate

661
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:06,849
to be part of Mr. Wut's team

662
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:09,079
in one of the world's top companies.

663
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:12,479
Anyway,

664
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,549
let me thank you one more time

665
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:16,829
for giving me this opportunity,

666
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,929
and seeing the potential in me.

667
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:20,919
Ben.

668
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:22,069
Yes, sir.

669
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,509
Make yourself available to train Miss...

670
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,179
It's Cher.

671
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:27,789
Cher.

672
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:33,499
I'm counting on you.

673
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:37,259
Yes, Big Bro...

674
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,439
Mr. Wut.

675
00:28:38,869 --> 00:28:39,509
Okay.

676
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,379
What's happening?

677
00:28:50,469 --> 00:28:51,559
This lady

678
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,529
has the dragon face.

679
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:56,529
We haven't seen one in a decade.

680
00:28:57,019 --> 00:28:58,299
She has broad forehead,

681
00:28:58,649 --> 00:29:01,469
bow-shaped eyebrows
and the perfect shape of nose.

682
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:04,709
Whoever takes her under their wings,

683
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,299
he will be prosperous,

684
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:08,049
more and more.

685
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:11,139
But...

686
00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:12,249
this girl

687
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:13,919
can't be your lover, sir.

688
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,349
Your astrology

689
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:16,839
are not compatible.

690
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:19,469
Your astrology signs
are against each other.

691
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:24,589
However, assign her
to be your left of right wing,

692
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,469
or a subordinate.

693
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,279
she'll bring you

694
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,089
great prosperity.

695
00:29:30,089 --> 00:29:31,239
In case,

696
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:33,359
she's in your company,

697
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,619
and there will be a great change.

698
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:37,839
Guaranteed!

699
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:39,699
Please reconsider it, Mr. Wut.

700
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:41,859
My instinct tells me it won't work.

701
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:44,309
But the dragon face
always works out well, Phat.

702
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,579
She's one of the thousand.

703
00:29:48,729 --> 00:29:49,839
I won't change my mind.

704
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,899
It's the right decision, sir.

705
00:30:01,459 --> 00:30:03,649
You're right about one thing, though.

706
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:04,799
In the end,

707
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:06,749
the final decision
is up to the astrologer.

708
00:30:07,879 --> 00:30:09,279
Anyway, I can't trust that...

709
00:30:10,289 --> 00:30:10,849
It's Cher.

710
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:14,749
That bow-shaped eyebrows
and dragon forehead.

711
00:30:17,699 --> 00:30:18,299
Let's go.

712
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,109
(Relationship Juggler)
Relationship Juggler is a noun.

713
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:38,179
The definition is

714
00:30:38,529 --> 00:30:39,993
(Noun. The organizing
expert who helps clients)

715
00:30:40,017 --> 00:30:41,839
the expert who arranges one's agenda

716
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,827
(out of the complicated
situation from lovers)

717
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:43,839
in order to prevent one lover

718
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,439
from seeing the second lover.

719
00:30:55,689 --> 00:30:56,299
Hello.

720
00:30:56,299 --> 00:30:56,769
Phat.

721
00:30:57,179 --> 00:30:58,399
Can you come to work early?

722
00:30:58,739 --> 00:30:59,739
I need your help.

723
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:06,779
My job is to keep the secret.

724
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,469
Let me repeat my story,

725
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:09,759
My name is Phat.

726
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:11,859
I work as a secretary as a disguise.

727
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:13,709
But I am...

728
00:31:14,959 --> 00:31:16,169
a relationship juggler.

729
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,819
(Catch Me Baby)

730
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:30,029
I found neither digital footprint,

731
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:31,949
nor biological evidence.

732
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:34,179
I suspect

733
00:31:34,179 --> 00:31:35,749
it's done by a specialist.

734
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:44,839
Thank you.

735
00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:48,299
I'll do everything to expose Mr. Wut.

736
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,569
