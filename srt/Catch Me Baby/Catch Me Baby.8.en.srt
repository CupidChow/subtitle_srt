5
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:29,665
Cher.

6
00:00:32,064 --> 00:00:33,154
I really like you.

7
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:38,523
Will you be my girlfriend?

8
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:52,424
I am confused now.

9
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:55,439
You made a joke like this.

10
00:00:56,142 --> 00:00:58,112
I don't know how to play along with it.

11
00:00:59,025 --> 00:00:59,698
You are...

12
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:00,856
I am not joking.

13
00:01:01,197 --> 00:01:02,297
I am totally serious.

14
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:03,355
I am...

15
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:03,978
Phat.

16
00:01:05,836 --> 00:01:06,673
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:08,211 --> 00:01:09,563
And why do you look so weird?

18
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,184
I am fine.

19
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:13,676
He just wanted to be spoiled.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,916
I didn't want you to spoil me.

21
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,142
You spilled the soup on my hand.

22
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,416
How come you're complaining about me?

23
00:01:24,312 --> 00:01:24,884
What about you?

24
00:01:25,494 --> 00:01:26,270
What are you doing here?

25
00:01:27,691 --> 00:01:28,891
He came to see me.

26
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:36,566
Then... Shall we go now?

27
00:01:36,948 --> 00:01:38,163
I parked my car over there.

28
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:40,195
Let's go. Foei must be waiting.

29
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,374
Wait, wait.

30
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:44,997
Where are you going?

31
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:49,696
We are dating.

32
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,298
Dating?

33
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,314
How... So late?

34
00:01:56,854 --> 00:01:58,402
But she is older than you.

35
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,288
You are back, Sis.

36
00:02:11,346 --> 00:02:12,691
I am so hungry.

37
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,222
What's up?

38
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:16,631
Darn it.

39
00:02:19,788 --> 00:02:20,705
How come?

40
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:23,513
What?

41
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,439
You two...

42
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:27,605
You did not meet up for
the group assignment.

43
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:30,056
I asked him for a video call.

44
00:02:30,056 --> 00:02:32,423
Foei asked Cher
for the lawyer's fee.

45
00:02:32,782 --> 00:02:33,796
That's what you told me.

46
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:35,237
But I think

47
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:36,730
we can talk face to face.

48
00:02:36,996 --> 00:02:37,692
It'll be easier.

49
00:02:43,303 --> 00:02:44,138
Sis, come here.

50
00:02:44,866 --> 00:02:46,254
What is it?

51
00:02:47,171 --> 00:02:48,850
He is another team's spy.

52
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:50,956
How could you take him home?

53
00:02:51,275 --> 00:02:53,135
Calm down. I'll talk to him.

54
00:02:58,605 --> 00:02:59,519
Oh, my god!

55
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:01,113
Croissants!

56
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,662
This shop has the best croissants.

57
00:03:03,994 --> 00:03:04,513
Here...

58
00:03:04,761 --> 00:03:06,066
I bought them in every flavor for you.

59
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:07,299
You must try them.

60
00:03:11,363 --> 00:03:13,934
This is so good.

61
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,862
You have a good manner.
You even brought gifts for me.

62
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,472
You are so sweet.

63
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,190
Please take it as my apology

64
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,835
for what I have done to you.

65
00:03:22,697 --> 00:03:24,181
From now on,

66
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:25,490
I and Foei

67
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,048
will meet...

68
00:03:28,064 --> 00:03:29,538
and discuss work more often.

69
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,431
Please take care of me.

70
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:35,936
All right.

71
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,009
Okay?

72
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,915
Make yourself at home.

73
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,985
I will leave you two now.

74
00:03:40,064 --> 00:03:40,697
All right.

75
00:03:40,697 --> 00:03:41,315
Sis!

76
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:44,128
Oh, my god!

77
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,595
What the heck!

78
00:03:53,078 --> 00:03:53,480
Do you want some?

79
00:03:54,023 --> 00:03:54,618
I have another box.

80
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,460
You eat it then!

81
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:57,757
Come on.

82
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,503
It's delicious.

83
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:02,286
Stop messing with me.

84
00:04:07,112 --> 00:04:07,991
Do you think this photo is good?

85
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:18,929
Do you like it?

86
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:20,387
At "The Night Out".

87
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,148
I am the one who should ask you.

88
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:31,963
Why did you try to mess up with me?

89
00:04:33,777 --> 00:04:34,858
I am not your toy.

90
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,108
You think you can do
whatever you want to me.

91
00:04:39,097 --> 00:04:40,011
Hold on.

92
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:41,805
I was talking about our job.

93
00:04:42,512 --> 00:04:44,439
I'm talking about the data
we got from "The Night Out".

94
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:47,677
You are fine, right?

95
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,330
You jerk!

96
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,244
I won't talk to you.

97
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,197
Foei, I have never thought
you are my toy.

98
00:04:56,283 --> 00:04:57,202
I am just...

99
00:04:57,699 --> 00:04:58,483
What?

100
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:02,672
I want to know it clearly in my heart.

101
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:05,715
And I am clear now.

102
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:07,860
Really?

103
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,552
I am clear, too.

104
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,662
I know I hate you.

105
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,102
All right.

106
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,803
Are you free on Saturday?

107
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:24,766
We must investigate further.

108
00:05:27,213 --> 00:05:28,001
This Saturday?

109
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:28,955
Yes.

110
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,424
It's the anniversary of Cher's
father's death.

111
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,135
I will go and pay respect
with her at Ayutthaya.

112
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,056
I am sorry to hear that.

113
00:05:43,721 --> 00:05:44,439
When did he die?

114
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,021
It was a long time ago.

115
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:48,838
Since she was in secondary school.

116
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:51,828
How do you plan to go there?

117
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:53,432
I will grab a taxi.

118
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:56,014
Cher's car is in a repair shop.

119
00:05:58,869 --> 00:05:59,688
How about I drive you there?

120
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:01,336
I have a car.

121
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,017
Who told you that we will bring you along?

122
00:06:05,015 --> 00:06:06,045
I've already come to pick you up.

123
00:06:06,584 --> 00:06:07,658
It's free.

124
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,451
Besides,

125
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,101
I also brought you some gifts.

126
00:06:16,672 --> 00:06:18,381
It's too bad...

127
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,832
If you don't eat them.

128
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,156
It would be such a waste.

129
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:24,677
You bribed my Sis with croissants.

130
00:06:25,499 --> 00:06:26,285
Same old trick.

131
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,453
It won't work with her.

132
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,562
Is that right, Sis?

133
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:33,574
Foei!

134
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:35,897
What are you waiting for?

135
00:06:36,226 --> 00:06:37,504
What? Sis!

136
00:06:38,325 --> 00:06:39,914
Captain, shall we go?

137
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,767
Yes, Sis.

138
00:06:51,656 --> 00:06:53,332
All right. Where will we go?

139
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:54,481
What?

140
00:06:55,705 --> 00:06:56,609
Phat!

141
00:06:56,677 --> 00:06:57,343
How come? How did you get here?

142
00:06:57,343 --> 00:06:58,044
Why are you here?

143
00:06:58,044 --> 00:06:58,763
What for?

144
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:02,049
Thanks for asking.

145
00:07:03,661 --> 00:07:05,154
I thought you all would go to Ayutthaya.

146
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:06,386
And...

147
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:08,110
I want to eat grilled giant river prawns.

148
00:07:10,427 --> 00:07:11,247
How did you know

149
00:07:11,357 --> 00:07:12,400
that we would go there?

150
00:07:13,114 --> 00:07:14,336
I did not tell anyone.

151
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:16,208
It's true, Cher.

152
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,112
Tan, Sir.

153
00:07:18,424 --> 00:07:20,126
Since the day at BBQ Pork restaurant,

154
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,427
I have been following you
for two to three days,

155
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:23,921
so I knew everything.

156
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:24,942
What the heck...

157
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:26,628
Are you stalking me?

158
00:07:28,098 --> 00:07:29,413
What I suspect the most is...

159
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:32,856
Why are you coming too, Pink?

160
00:07:34,593 --> 00:07:37,116
Oh, I knew you are going
to eat grilled giant river prawns.

161
00:07:37,264 --> 00:07:39,493
So, I want to join you.

162
00:07:40,472 --> 00:07:42,462
Besides,

163
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:44,055
wherever you are, I will be with you.

164
00:07:46,354 --> 00:07:47,406
What?

165
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:49,295
What kind of family is that?

166
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,630
I think

167
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:53,025
we should not waste any time.

168
00:07:54,042 --> 00:07:56,251
Shall we go now?

169
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:57,951
Whatever will happen,

170
00:07:58,767 --> 00:07:59,775
just let it go.

171
00:07:59,968 --> 00:08:01,176
It's hot in here.

172
00:08:01,843 --> 00:08:02,748
Turn on the air-conditioner now.

173
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:07,590
=Catch Me Baby=

174
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:13,604
We are here.

175
00:08:15,431 --> 00:08:16,192
Is it the right place, Sis?

176
00:08:16,947 --> 00:08:17,970
You did tell me
you don't know the temple.

177
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,806
I have never been here before.

178
00:08:20,287 --> 00:08:21,404
I'll park the car here.

179
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,040
Okay.

180
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,099
Seriously?

181
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,064
Why did you choose...

182
00:08:26,795 --> 00:08:27,502
This temple...

183
00:08:27,502 --> 00:08:28,145
All right.

184
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:29,561
Let's go, everyone.

185
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:36,601
- Oh!
- Sorry.

186
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:38,986
Okay.

187
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:43,141
Let me help you.

188
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,018
Only two offerings from five people?

189
00:08:46,219 --> 00:08:47,248
Is that enough?

190
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,033
We wanted just two of us to come here
in the first place.

191
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:52,197
After giving the offerings,
we'll go home immediately.

192
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:54,658
Okay. Pink was very talkative.
So annoying.

193
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:56,738
Oh...

194
00:08:56,738 --> 00:08:57,761
I forgot the umbrella.

195
00:08:57,761 --> 00:08:58,885
- I'll go.
- I'll go.

196
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:01,339
I...

197
00:09:01,713 --> 00:09:02,424
I will get it for you.

198
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,577
I'll go with you.

199
00:09:09,078 --> 00:09:09,924
There is no need.

200
00:09:10,423 --> 00:09:12,523
You just go and buy me some flowers.

201
00:09:13,635 --> 00:09:14,218
Go now.

202
00:09:21,913 --> 00:09:22,591
And you...

203
00:09:23,095 --> 00:09:23,753
Come with me.

204
00:09:24,868 --> 00:09:25,893
- No!
- I will be right back.

205
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:26,849
Just go.

206
00:09:27,028 --> 00:09:28,505
- What? Phat.
- Let's go.

207
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,038
Let's go!

208
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,037
Why did they come here anyway?

209
00:09:33,765 --> 00:09:34,343
Hmm...

210
00:09:34,953 --> 00:09:35,940
It's too hot.

211
00:09:42,009 --> 00:09:42,434
Hold on.

212
00:09:45,392 --> 00:09:46,208
What did you plan to do?

213
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:47,988
Hmm...

214
00:09:48,782 --> 00:09:49,513
I did nothing.

215
00:09:50,568 --> 00:09:52,085
Why are you looking so serious today?

216
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:56,633
Just tell me the truth.

217
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:58,539
Why are you following Cher everywhere?

218
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,243
Why did you laugh?

219
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:05,691
Phat.

220
00:10:06,602 --> 00:10:08,184
I'm not following Cher.

221
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:10,822
I'm following her brother.

222
00:10:10,822 --> 00:10:11,497
You...

223
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,522
and her brother?

224
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:21,808
What do you mean?

225
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:24,630
I mean Cher's brother.

226
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:25,831
Foei.

227
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,633
I'm hanging around with him.

228
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,759
Are you serious about this?

229
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,987
I've already told him that I like him.

230
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:43,471
But he doesn't believe me.

231
00:10:43,997 --> 00:10:45,089
So, I followed him here.

232
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:48,612
I followed Cher,

233
00:10:50,014 --> 00:10:51,327
because I need her support.

234
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,960
Otherwise, Foei would not talk to me.

235
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:58,532
About Cher...

236
00:10:59,898 --> 00:11:00,958
I would never compete with you.

237
00:11:07,426 --> 00:11:08,358
Anyway...

238
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,893
Now you know everything.

239
00:11:12,518 --> 00:11:13,538
You have to help me.

240
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:15,151
Please.

241
00:11:16,628 --> 00:11:17,361
All right.

242
00:11:20,256 --> 00:11:21,514
Just get that umbrella.

243
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:22,942
Are you shy?

244
00:11:23,951 --> 00:11:24,847
Hurry. It's hot.

245
00:11:25,335 --> 00:11:26,132
Why are you shy?

246
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,943
I'm not shy. Come on!

247
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:32,366
May I be free from enmity and danger.

248
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:34,867
May I be free from mental suffering.

249
00:11:35,091 --> 00:11:38,911
May I be free from
physical suffering and danger.

250
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,271
Sis.

251
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:47,736
What if...

252
00:11:48,835 --> 00:11:49,671
Just, what if...

253
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,748
Someone who hates you,

254
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:53,186
always picks a fight with you,

255
00:11:53,692 --> 00:11:54,870
and bullies you,

256
00:11:55,623 --> 00:11:57,218
suddenly told you that he likes you?

257
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,553
If this happens to you,

258
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,164
what would you do?

259
00:12:01,823 --> 00:12:03,376
You... Who is that guy?

260
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,453
Did you hear something?

261
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,141
Uh...

262
00:12:08,873 --> 00:12:10,283
My friend...

263
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,688
It's my friend's friend, not me.

264
00:12:14,087 --> 00:12:15,144
It's your friend's friend.

265
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,756
All right. Let me tell you.

266
00:12:20,316 --> 00:12:21,563
It's not that difficult.

267
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,999
He is just toying with you.

268
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:27,433
He thought you were a stupid clown.

269
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:29,415
He will laugh about this later.

270
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:30,962
Is it true, Sis?

271
00:12:32,977 --> 00:12:34,062
Oh, no.

272
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:36,128
Okay, Foei.

273
00:12:36,336 --> 00:12:38,402
You have to warn your friend's friend.

274
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:41,149
Don't let the guard down.
Put up the high wall.

275
00:12:41,258 --> 00:12:43,550
Don't ever let him get you.

276
00:12:44,394 --> 00:12:46,000
Are you finished?

277
00:12:46,111 --> 00:12:47,335
Not yet. I am not finished yet.

278
00:12:48,313 --> 00:12:50,749
I mean that offering.

279
00:12:50,865 --> 00:12:51,979
Are you done?

280
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:54,651
There are many people waiting.

281
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:57,558
Yes, Sir.

282
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,172
We are done.

283
00:12:59,172 --> 00:13:01,728
We're leaving now.

284
00:13:02,254 --> 00:13:02,929
Let's go.

285
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,997
I am so sorry for my Sis.

286
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:13,937
I am sorry.

287
00:13:14,049 --> 00:13:15,755
Come closer.

288
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,996
Oh! Someone's calling me.

289
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,242
I've got to get this.

290
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,703
Wait around here.

291
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:21,746
I will call you later.

292
00:13:22,805 --> 00:13:23,404
Yes.

293
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,508
You can go now.
I will pour the water for you.

294
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:25,629
Hello?

295
00:13:27,294 --> 00:13:29,215
It's gonna be a long talk for sure.

296
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:31,275
She is all about work.

297
00:13:32,956 --> 00:13:33,925
Put it here.

298
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,677
It's all right.

299
00:13:39,548 --> 00:13:40,439
Thank you.

300
00:13:41,684 --> 00:13:42,333
Phat!

301
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:46,760
Ow!

302
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,292
Where was he?

303
00:13:51,853 --> 00:13:53,469
Oh! He left me again.

304
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:11,184
I never know about this, Doctor.

305
00:14:11,647 --> 00:14:13,595
I don't know my daughter-in-law
feels this way.

306
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:16,023
This is totally my fault.

307
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,740
It's no one's fault.

308
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:23,499
I understand that you all love
and care about each other.

309
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:24,900
It's just a problem

310
00:14:25,213 --> 00:14:26,244
that needs to communicate

311
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:29,868
and understand each other.

312
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:31,853
But at least,

313
00:14:32,244 --> 00:14:34,501
when everyone opens up and talks,

314
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:38,171
it's a good sign
to start solving the problem.

315
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,468
Believe me.

316
00:14:45,422 --> 00:14:46,962
We will overcome this problem.

317
00:14:48,787 --> 00:14:50,763
I am so sorry, Fah.

318
00:14:51,852 --> 00:14:54,942
I will do whatever
Doctor tells me to do.

319
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:57,748
I am fine, Mom.

320
00:15:01,995 --> 00:15:03,327
This is so good.

321
00:15:04,011 --> 00:15:04,922
Anyway,

322
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:06,359
I will make the appointment

323
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:08,699
for Mom, Khun Jim and Fah

324
00:15:08,789 --> 00:15:10,513
to have a session of therapy with me.

325
00:15:10,818 --> 00:15:11,991
I will follow up on your case.

326
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:13,146
You can go

327
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,489
and ask the nurse
to make an appointment.

328
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:23,212
Let's go.

329
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:24,220
All right.

330
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:25,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

331
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,221
You're welcome.

332
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:32,817
Pinky,

333
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,826
a 21-year-old young girl,

334
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:39,691
has fallen in love with
a guy for a very long time.

335
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:42,967
He was heartbroken before.

336
00:15:44,128 --> 00:15:46,705
She needs him to be happy,

337
00:15:48,235 --> 00:15:49,167
even though

338
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:52,138
she must sacrifice something

339
00:15:54,993 --> 00:15:56,268
for the sake of his happiness.

340
00:16:00,813 --> 00:16:01,542
I will do that.

341
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,099
It's okay.

342
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,441
I meant to ask you this...

343
00:16:07,971 --> 00:16:08,629
Is Cher...

344
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,262
short for Sherlock Holmes?

345
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:12,332
I have to go now.

346
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:16,341
You eavesdropped me
when I was on the phone.

347
00:16:16,722 --> 00:16:17,624
Do you plan to go against me?

348
00:16:18,161 --> 00:16:18,819
You...

349
00:16:19,962 --> 00:16:21,918
Stop looking at me as if I am a devil.

350
00:16:24,714 --> 00:16:26,147
All this time,

351
00:16:26,264 --> 00:16:28,732
did you do anything good for me?

352
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:34,920
I really want to ask.

353
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:36,718
Why are you here?

354
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,440
I want

355
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:42,528
to get the answer from that night.

356
00:16:49,524 --> 00:16:51,310
I know you now think

357
00:16:52,003 --> 00:16:53,881
we are totally different.

358
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:55,602
You know what?

359
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,225
I don't care about our differences.

360
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:00,329
It's like...

361
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,996
The more I am different from you,

362
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,660
the more I like you.

363
00:17:14,466 --> 00:17:15,129
Hmm...

364
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,691
So, you knew the reason.

365
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,537
I don't have to give you
the answer anymore.

366
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:23,367
Mr. Shuffling.

367
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:25,105
You not giving me the answer

368
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:27,673
means you don't reject me, too.

369
00:17:28,196 --> 00:17:30,027
Come on! What are you?

370
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,509
I'll go and meet Foei.

371
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:32,318
Wait.

372
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,041
Do you know about Foei and Tan?

373
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:37,811
What about it?

374
00:17:44,716 --> 00:17:45,908
Where is my Sis?

375
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,943
She has gone too long.

376
00:17:49,448 --> 00:17:50,405
Darn it!

377
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:52,192
Shall we go?

378
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:53,689
Where?

379
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,823
Oh, we have to do some research.

380
00:17:59,451 --> 00:17:59,985
No.

381
00:18:01,027 --> 00:18:02,159
It's you who wants to do it.

382
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:03,930
I'm not working on it.

383
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:06,657
Have you been slacking off lately?

384
00:18:07,593 --> 00:18:09,819
I'm deliberately helping you with this.

385
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:13,051
Deliberately?

386
00:18:14,065 --> 00:18:16,364
Yes, you are so noble.

387
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:18,527
Deliberately helping me with my report.

388
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:20,200
You talk too much.

389
00:18:21,075 --> 00:18:22,014
I want that coconut water.

390
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:23,271
What?

391
00:18:23,497 --> 00:18:24,557
I want some.

392
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:25,635
Go and buy it yourself.

393
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,494
I am thirsty. Give it to me.

394
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,232
Stop hassling with me.
You are so annoying.

395
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:39,683
Let's go.

396
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:41,021
I've already talked with Cher.

397
00:18:41,815 --> 00:18:42,997
She is okay with it.

398
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,499
Are you lying to me?

399
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:47,081
Hey!

400
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:49,949
Come on.

401
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:51,704
- Where?
- Come on.

402
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:52,612
Get up.

403
00:18:52,945 --> 00:18:53,503
Let's go.

404
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:54,846
Wait!

405
00:18:55,138 --> 00:18:55,870
Will you say it again?

406
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,249
Your brother and my brother?

407
00:18:59,157 --> 00:18:59,686
Yes.

408
00:19:00,256 --> 00:19:00,845
So,

409
00:19:01,212 --> 00:19:03,811
we need to give them
some private time.

410
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:05,439
Tan begged me for that.

411
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,351
Hey, are you and your brother

412
00:19:10,968 --> 00:19:12,545
conspiring to do something?

413
00:19:14,927 --> 00:19:17,015
No... No one's conspiring anything.

414
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:20,567
Neither Tan nor I.

415
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,318
I...

416
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:26,591
will go to buy silver and gold papers.

417
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,264
Fortune stick No. 8

418
00:19:38,593 --> 00:19:39,678
asked about true love.

419
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:41,357
It says you will meet
the right person

420
00:19:41,851 --> 00:19:42,875
who is your close friend

421
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:44,205
or colleague.

422
00:19:45,947 --> 00:19:46,711
What do you think?

423
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:49,009
Do you think...

424
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,358
I should believe
the holy thing or not.

425
00:19:58,157 --> 00:19:58,940
Let's do this.

426
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,194
If these carapaces face up...

427
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,562
You do what pleases you.

428
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,018
Whatever you want to do, just do it.

429
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,340
What if it does not face up?

430
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:12,722
You stop bugging me.

431
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:16,096
The holy things
will be a witness for us.

432
00:20:16,704 --> 00:20:20,140
- Okay?
- Okay.

433
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:24,290
Face up. Face up.

434
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:27,400
God bless me.

435
00:20:27,778 --> 00:20:28,473
Just throw it.

436
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:32,347
I will try again.

437
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,194
No, no.

438
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,370
You can't cheat.

439
00:20:34,528 --> 00:20:36,519
The holy things have given the answer.

440
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,475
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

441
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,266
I am sick of it.

442
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,099
Wait for me.

443
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:52,241
You're running away from me so quickly.

444
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:18,937
Please grant my wish.

445
00:21:30,698 --> 00:21:31,107
Tan,

446
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:33,555
will you please stop fooling around?

447
00:21:34,886 --> 00:21:35,740
For both the project

448
00:21:37,158 --> 00:21:38,429
and my feelings.

449
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:41,888
Foei,

450
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:43,643
I am not fooling around.

451
00:21:44,313 --> 00:21:45,185
I am serious.

452
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,619
I am trying to show my sincerity.

453
00:21:49,033 --> 00:21:49,893
I like you.

454
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,174
The same way that you like me.

455
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:55,638
I truly understand now

456
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,230
that when I like someone,

457
00:21:59,204 --> 00:21:59,955
how I would feel.

458
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,039
It would be impossible.

459
00:22:02,924 --> 00:22:04,293
You can stop trying.

460
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:05,906
Oh,

461
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:08,214
you told me you like me.

462
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:11,035
And I have feelings for you.

463
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:13,877
What is the problem?

464
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:15,821
Hmm?

465
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:19,413
Yes...

466
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:21,568
I like you.

467
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:23,408
I like you so much

468
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,992
that I think about you all the time,

469
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:30,105
even when I wake up
and when I'm sleeping.

470
00:22:32,111 --> 00:22:33,292
You want to know what is the problem?

471
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:36,569
Because you are being you.

472
00:22:40,822 --> 00:22:41,543
Being me?

473
00:22:44,301 --> 00:22:45,164
What is it about?

474
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:47,600
All right.

475
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:50,217
I will tell you now.

476
00:22:51,926 --> 00:22:53,175
You are selfish.

477
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:57,073
You never take anything seriously.

478
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,896
Do you remember
the day you kissed me?

479
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,344
Whether it was at home

480
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,046
or at "The Night Out".

481
00:23:06,822 --> 00:23:08,209
You did whatever pleased you.

482
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:12,958
You told me that
you wanted to understand your feelings.

483
00:23:15,672 --> 00:23:16,837
How could you say that?

484
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,629
Have you ever thought
about my feelings?

485
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,668
After you kissed me
because of your lust,

486
00:23:23,995 --> 00:23:26,001
you have never once asked about me.

487
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:30,309
You've never once
asked about how I felt.

488
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:33,997
I am not your toy.

489
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:34,641
You jerk!

490
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,227
=Catch Me Baby=

491
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:45,099
=Catch Me Baby=

492
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:49,070
Do you remember
the day you kissed me?

493
00:23:49,855 --> 00:23:50,673
Whether it was at home

494
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,257
or at "The Night Out".

495
00:23:54,148 --> 00:23:55,440
You did whatever pleased you.

496
00:23:57,999 --> 00:24:00,275
You told me that
you wanted to understand your feelings.

497
00:24:02,963 --> 00:24:04,169
How could you say that?

498
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:06,830
Have you ever thought
about my feelings?

499
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:09,862
After you kissed me
because of your lust,

500
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:13,296
you have never once asked about me.

501
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,619
You've never once asked about
how I felt.

502
00:24:19,716 --> 00:24:21,212
I am not your toy.

503
00:24:21,243 --> 00:24:21,951
You jerk!

504
00:24:26,295 --> 00:24:27,793
I will change for you, Foei.

505
00:24:29,055 --> 00:24:30,028
I will prove

506
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:32,046
that I will be a better person.

507
00:24:34,053 --> 00:24:34,811
You can stop trying.

508
00:24:38,444 --> 00:24:38,980
Why?

509
00:24:40,256 --> 00:24:41,406
Because I know it in my heart

510
00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:45,066
that you would never change.

511
00:24:45,975 --> 00:24:46,721
You know what?

512
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,853
What is the worst part of this?

513
00:24:52,243 --> 00:24:54,125
I really like a jerk like you.

514
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,813
But I can't be with you.

515
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:02,119
Do you understand
how hurtful that is to me?

516
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,889
Because I don't know
if there's a formula that can tell me

517
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:11,579
whether we can make it or not.

518
00:25:20,277 --> 00:25:20,842
Wait, Foei.

519
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,161
Who's that?

520
00:25:59,251 --> 00:26:00,689
Mom. Hello.

521
00:26:02,054 --> 00:26:03,056
Is Jim home?

522
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:06,124
No, he had an urgent meeting.

523
00:26:32,316 --> 00:26:33,852
The room is a little bit dirty.

524
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:36,306
Next time,
please call me before you visit.

525
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:37,906
I will tidy up the room.

526
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:39,407
So, it'll not be dirty like this.

527
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:44,174
Jim and I can't live together

528
00:26:44,674 --> 00:26:46,483
because of you.

529
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:48,381
If you are a good daughter-in-law,

530
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:50,813
you should not cause a rift
in the family.

531
00:26:51,605 --> 00:26:53,254
You have separated my son from me.

532
00:26:55,629 --> 00:26:57,653
I am sorry.
That's not my intention.

533
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:00,759
I had the best intentions for you,

534
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:03,236
but you thought they were bad.

535
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:06,784
Our family needs an heir.

536
00:27:06,887 --> 00:27:09,352
This is your duty.

537
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:12,845
Did you think I am
a psycho mother-in-law?

538
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:15,546
That's why you dragged me
to see that psychologist.

539
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:21,150
Remember,

540
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,518
this is your own problem.

541
00:27:24,311 --> 00:27:25,109
You've gone so far,

542
00:27:25,565 --> 00:27:26,917
and you're selfish.

543
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,044
I won't see that psychologist anymore.

544
00:27:30,903 --> 00:27:33,403
I won't let him disrespect me again.

545
00:28:10,194 --> 00:28:10,672
Sis.

546
00:28:12,074 --> 00:28:13,174
Someone paid respect before us.

547
00:28:22,122 --> 00:28:22,672
It could be...

548
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,256
your mother?

549
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,854
This pot is still hot.

550
00:28:34,064 --> 00:28:35,412
Your mother might not go very far.

551
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:37,828
It's useless for her to come.

552
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:40,894
Sis...

553
00:28:43,882 --> 00:28:44,476
Sis.

554
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,530
It might turn out bad.

555
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:52,408
Come on.

556
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,061
Sis.

557
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:56,602
Cher.

558
00:28:59,385 --> 00:29:00,009
Cher.

559
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,559
Sis.

560
00:29:23,623 --> 00:29:24,024
Cher.

561
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:36,300
Please calm down.

562
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:49,038
It was too late.

563
00:29:58,083 --> 00:29:58,567
Are you okay?

564
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:21,655
Cher,

565
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:23,569
stop drinking.

566
00:30:24,034 --> 00:30:24,957
You've drunk too many beers already.

567
00:30:33,071 --> 00:30:33,532
Here...

568
00:30:34,381 --> 00:30:35,204
Try this.

569
00:30:35,526 --> 00:30:36,384
Don't let your stomach be empty.

570
00:30:40,157 --> 00:30:40,972
I'll go to the restroom.

571
00:30:53,621 --> 00:30:54,937
If Cher does not want to eat,

572
00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:56,511
I will eat it then.

573
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:06,985
Bad timing.

574
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:13,800
When Cher was in secondary school,

575
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:15,726
her mother had an affair

576
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:17,545
with a rich guy.

577
00:31:18,665 --> 00:31:19,872
She even ran away with him.

578
00:31:21,397 --> 00:31:22,785
That rich guy was a widower.

579
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,678
They met at school,

580
00:31:24,767 --> 00:31:25,803
when she picked up Cher from school.

581
00:31:27,783 --> 00:31:29,284
Cher took it very hard.

582
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:32,892
Her relatives and friends
at school blamed her.

583
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,451
She ended up quitting the school
and moved out of the house.

584
00:31:36,656 --> 00:31:38,199
And her father

585
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,625
changed to a different person.

586
00:31:43,003 --> 00:31:44,531
After a couple of years,

587
00:31:45,648 --> 00:31:46,950
her father was terminally sick and died.

588
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:49,850
The whole circumstance made her

589
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:51,512
hate cheating to the core.

590
00:31:53,571 --> 00:31:54,796
But the funny part was

591
00:31:55,612 --> 00:31:56,693
her mother had some influence on her.

592
00:31:57,861 --> 00:31:59,121
Her mother liked reading

593
00:31:59,642 --> 00:32:01,611
detective novels.

594
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,320
So, Cher read them too.

595
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:07,920
Finally, she became a private detective.

596
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:10,659
Almost every case

597
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,217
that she investigated

598
00:32:13,412 --> 00:32:14,058
is like...

599
00:32:14,982 --> 00:32:15,812
It's like
that she had caught the person

600
00:32:16,232 --> 00:32:17,113
who cheated like her own mother.

601
00:32:28,297 --> 00:32:28,965
Hey, you.

602
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:30,986
What took you so long?

603
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:32,340
I thought you disappeared.

604
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:38,594
I am sorry.

605
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:42,149
I want to be alone.

606
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:47,428
I am

607
00:32:48,393 --> 00:32:49,363
alone, too.

608
00:32:51,021 --> 00:32:51,723
Sitting with you alone.

609
00:33:14,736 --> 00:33:16,044
My name is Cher,

610
00:33:18,175 --> 00:33:19,528
from Sherlock Holmes.

611
00:33:22,206 --> 00:33:24,132
My mother liked detective novels.

612
00:33:30,617 --> 00:33:32,500
In every novel,

613
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,005
it doesn't matter
if the cases are difficult.

614
00:33:37,264 --> 00:33:38,088
In the end,

615
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:40,328
all puzzles would be solved.

616
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:42,783
The bad guys in the book
would come to light.

617
00:33:44,446 --> 00:33:45,548
Readers would know
why they did what they did.

618
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:51,696
If my mother's life
was based on a novel,

619
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:57,501
I would love to read that book.

620
00:34:00,505 --> 00:34:01,630
I want to know the ending.

621
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:06,466
I want to know how it would end.

622
00:34:07,495 --> 00:34:08,900
So, I can move on to the next book.

623
00:34:23,197 --> 00:34:24,064
I am sorry

624
00:34:25,362 --> 00:34:26,199
for what happened in the past.

625
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,970
It's okay.

626
00:34:34,499 --> 00:34:36,246
I did some bad things to you, too.

627
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:39,014
Have I ever said sorry to you?

628
00:34:42,037 --> 00:34:43,841
You mean when you disguised yourself
to fool me.

629
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:45,833
It's all right.

630
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,135
I don't remember it.

631
00:34:52,568 --> 00:34:53,160
Thank you.

632
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,154
So,

633
00:35:00,178 --> 00:35:01,185
where will we go next?

634
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:05,816
You...

635
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:07,886
You just go home.

636
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,365
I don't know where to go.

637
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:25,793
Oh, my god!

638
00:35:26,347 --> 00:35:26,938
So cool!

639
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:30,175
Go now.

640
00:35:30,175 --> 00:35:30,960
Come on.

641
00:35:31,384 --> 00:35:31,768
Please go.

642
00:35:33,185 --> 00:35:33,696
Tan.

643
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:34,602
Okay.

644
00:35:34,773 --> 00:35:36,116
Throw it to me.

645
00:35:40,712 --> 00:35:42,396
This is like in the movie.

646
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:45,805
Like when we had a problem,
we would come to play here.

647
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:47,542
Just like what teenagers would do.

648
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:49,490
You are a wild child.

649
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,677
You did it often, right?

650
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:52,114
This is my first time.

651
00:35:52,384 --> 00:35:52,956
What?

652
00:35:53,805 --> 00:35:54,288
Let's go. Come on.

653
00:35:57,556 --> 00:35:58,040
Phat.

654
00:35:59,736 --> 00:36:01,407
You catch it.

655
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:03,183
Throw it to me.

656
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:04,144
Come on.

657
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:09,878
Phat.

658
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:12,194
One more time.

659
00:36:35,553 --> 00:36:37,016
What's up with you?

660
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,573
Why don't you play with them?

661
00:36:39,209 --> 00:36:39,995
No, it's enough.

662
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:41,808
I feel like I am an aunty.

663
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:44,370
I'm exhausted.

664
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:47,475
If you were an aunty,

665
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:49,522
then I would be an uncle.

666
00:36:51,837 --> 00:36:52,957
What?

667
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:55,555
What's what?

668
00:36:56,626 --> 00:36:58,272
Pink, what's up?

669
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,844
Come and play with us.

670
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:01,861
Let's go.

671
00:37:01,994 --> 00:37:02,408
Let's have a race.

672
00:37:02,713 --> 00:37:03,586
Go!

673
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:04,221
Come here.

674
00:37:04,221 --> 00:37:04,869
Let's have a race.

675
00:37:05,033 --> 00:37:06,318
Come here! Quick!

676
00:37:06,588 --> 00:37:07,517
Hey, what are you guys doing?
How did you get inside?

677
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,073
Security!

678
00:37:08,073 --> 00:37:09,018
Get up now!

679
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:09,665
Get up, quick!

680
00:37:09,665 --> 00:37:11,041
We might get caught!

681
00:37:12,604 --> 00:37:13,373
Where did you go?

682
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:14,488
Pink, come on.

683
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,440
Why did you move?

684
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,066
Wait, wait for Phat.

685
00:37:17,147 --> 00:37:19,110
Come on.

686
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:20,337
Don't run.

687
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:20,678
I will catch you.

688
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:21,202
Pink, come on.

689
00:37:21,202 --> 00:37:21,840
This way.

690
00:37:22,245 --> 00:37:23,099
Get through here.

691
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:24,633
Careful!

692
00:37:25,437 --> 00:37:25,919
Run!

693
00:37:26,288 --> 00:37:26,787
Come on!

694
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:28,168
Go!

695
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:30,058
Run, Pink!

696
00:37:30,171 --> 00:37:30,822
Come on!

697
00:37:33,656 --> 00:37:34,783
Lay low.

698
00:37:38,234 --> 00:37:39,685
Just lay low,
so the security won't see us.

699
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:41,489
He did not see us.

700
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:50,386
Oh!

701
00:37:50,808 --> 00:37:51,352
Pink!

702
00:37:52,332 --> 00:37:53,118
Pink!

703
00:37:53,741 --> 00:37:54,435
Come on!

704
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:56,752
Pink.

705
00:37:58,858 --> 00:37:59,457
Pink.

706
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,924
What's wrong with you?

707
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,180
Phat did not
unwrap shrimps for me today.

708
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:23,103
It is not only today.

709
00:38:25,765 --> 00:38:26,700
He might not do it forever.

710
00:38:29,563 --> 00:38:30,717
I am so sorry.

711
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:32,986
But I have to say that.

712
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:35,986
Maybe it's time...

713
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:39,611
that you should let him go.

714
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,430
Hey.

715
00:38:43,791 --> 00:38:45,197
I think we can

716
00:38:45,572 --> 00:38:46,288
go out soon.

717
00:38:46,367 --> 00:38:47,543
They will wait for us in the car.

718
00:38:55,211 --> 00:38:56,277
I really like you, Cher.

719
00:38:58,476 --> 00:38:59,841
Can you tell me now

720
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,129
how you feel about me?

721
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:05,940
Come on.

722
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:07,476
This is not a good time.

723
00:39:08,662 --> 00:39:09,132
Let's go.

724
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,901
You...

725
00:39:12,302 --> 00:39:14,473
The more I stay close to you,
the more I cannot control myself.

726
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:17,268
I just want to know the answer.

727
00:39:18,766 --> 00:39:19,909
So, I will know what is my next move.

728
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:25,725
All right, then.

729
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:29,282
I don't believe
that you like me for real.

730
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,003
And I don't trust you.

731
00:39:32,767 --> 00:39:33,471
You don't believe me

732
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,020
and you don't trust me?

733
00:39:36,723 --> 00:39:37,129
Yes.

734
00:39:37,832 --> 00:39:38,255
You can put yourself

735
00:39:38,893 --> 00:39:40,080
in my shoes.

736
00:39:40,972 --> 00:39:42,736
I have been working with you
for some time now.

737
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:45,945
The cases of Mr. Wut, Moei,
Coach Joy, Ryan and Chai.

738
00:39:46,629 --> 00:39:48,298
How many times did you lie
in those cases?

739
00:39:48,417 --> 00:39:49,970
How many backup plans were there?

740
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,799
Your work is bad enough,

741
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:53,853
let alone your private life.

742
00:39:56,534 --> 00:39:57,984
I might tell lies because it's my job.

743
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,756
But I have never once told you a lie.

744
00:40:00,217 --> 00:40:01,905
You were the one who lied to me,

745
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:03,247
manipulated me and took advantage
of my feelings.

746
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,085
I had to quit my safe job
with a good income

747
00:40:05,196 --> 00:40:07,116
because of you.

748
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,998
I used to control everything in my life

749
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,396
until you messed it up.

750
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,392
Is that right?

751
00:40:15,321 --> 00:40:15,929
You see?

752
00:40:16,126 --> 00:40:18,065
And you said you like me?

753
00:40:18,164 --> 00:40:19,183
I liked you already.

754
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:22,727
Are you crazy?

755
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,630
A life with you by my side

756
00:40:27,379 --> 00:40:29,938
is so good that
I'd forgotten my life before that.

757
00:40:32,826 --> 00:40:34,086
I can't live without you, Cher.

758
00:40:37,713 --> 00:40:39,082
Can you come to pick a fight
with me every day?

759
00:40:54,139 --> 00:40:55,060
Do you know

760
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:57,520
today, when I was in the temple,

761
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,092
what I prayed for?

762
00:41:25,002 --> 00:41:25,823
I am...

763
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:27,560
your sworn enemy.

764
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:31,227
We've hurt each other many times.

765
00:41:33,464 --> 00:41:34,390
Haven't you ever heard...

766
00:41:35,507 --> 00:41:37,234
that keep your friends close,

767
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:39,998
but keep your enemies closer.

768
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,004
I prayed...

769
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,982
for Phat to be happy forever.
