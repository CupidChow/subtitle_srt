5
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,250
You go ahead. I'll sleep later.

6
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:55,430
Jim.

7
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,090
I think we need a break.

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,780
Because of my mom?

9
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,600
I can't even...

10
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,030
It's not just about the baby.

11
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,060
It's also about us.

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,410
I don't think we're living together

13
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,740
as a couple.

14
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,760
Have you ever known how I've been feeling?

15
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,590
But I don't want to take a break.

16
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,720
I love you.

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,040
I'll talk to my mom.

18
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,110
Don't leave me.

19
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,930
=Catch Me Baby=

20
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,800
（The Night Out）

21
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,520
Is it the swing dance you told me about?

22
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,680
Why did you bring me here?

23
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,770
I'm doing a project that required
research on dating places.

24
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,550
But my group

25
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,290
don't like

26
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,120
something

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,700
cliche like Siam, sis.

28
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,470
So I chose a less well-known place.

29
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,690
There's one more thing.

30
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,710
You're not having any gigs now.

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:55,640
Right?

32
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,380
Right.

33
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,060
But wait.

34
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,340
Group project?

35
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:01,670
Where are your friends?

36
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,290
Oh, my friend...

37
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,500
Hello, Cher!

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,470
is here, sis.

39
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,550
He's in my group.

40
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:09,750
Okay.

41
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,710
Uh...

42
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,400
Are you looking for Phat?

43
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,750
He's not here.

44
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:16,900
Today,

45
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,840
I'll be working with Foei.

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:21,990
Okay.

47
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,990
So, I'll let you work.

48
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,010
Call me when you're done.

49
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,560
Yes.

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,920
I'd like some...

51
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,230
Two glasses of pennywort drink, please.

52
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,460
I'm sorry, sir.

53
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,690
We don't serve pennywort drinks.

54
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,880
Really?

55
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,320
I need to heal my bruise.

56
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,010
So, can I have some water, please?

57
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,860
Me, too.

58
00:03:58,990 --> 00:03:59,650
Of course.

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,180
Thanks.

60
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,700
Thanks.

61
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,900
Are you here for a juggling job?

62
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,430
How about you?

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,460
Are you here to catch an affair?

64
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,670
No, I'm here with Foei.

65
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,100
The captain is here, too.

66
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,280
Tan is here?

67
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,430
Well.

68
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,090
You really are here for juggling.

69
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:37,740
You know what?

70
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,400
A job without you

71
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,970
bores me to death.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,110
Are you new?

73
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,210
I've never seen you here before.

74
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,520
Yes.

75
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,650
I'm Ryan.

76
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,340
A dance instructor here.

77
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,850
Feel free to take a lesson
when you're available.

78
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,220
We teach on Thursdays and Saturdays.

79
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,910
I'm also new here.

80
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,630
Sorry, I didn't introduce myself to you.

81
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,600
Are you interested in a dance lesson?

82
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,530
No, thanks.

83
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,750
I can't do that.

84
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,260
Excuse me.

85
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,510
Cher!

86
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,380
Oh, my god!

87
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,180
Why are you here, Noi?

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,540
It's Noinah.

89
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,440
Noi is my dead name.

90
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,410
I'm here for a dancing date.

91
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,040
They said this place

92
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,290
is full of cute boys.

93
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,500
Okay! You'll like him then.

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,260
That tall dance instructor.

95
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,930
That one?

96
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,640
You mean Ryan?

97
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:01,720
Darn!

98
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,330
He's married, girl.

99
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,430
There's another thing.

100
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,350
I don't eat leftovers.

101
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,400
How about you?

102
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,230
Do you still keep
your name Cher, the celibate?

103
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,260
You had been single for four years
during your college.

104
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,250
Darn you.

105
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,610
I miss this nickname.

106
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,100
I haven't heard it for ages.

107
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,620
We haven't seen each other for that long?

108
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,770
Is it since Jang and his husband's case?

109
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,430
You were a lawyer in that case.

110
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,490
How long has it been?

111
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,330
Years, I guess.

112
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,190
About four or five years.

113
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,520
But I'm not a lawyer now.

114
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Eh? Why?

115
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,640
It was exhausting
and I don't like jobs like that.

116
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,910
Thai laws. You get it, right?

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,040
You're right.

118
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,840
So I changed my career
to a love affair detective.

119
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,060
Keep fighting.

120
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,400
Mmm.

121
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,190
I'm gonna use the restroom.

122
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
I need to hurry to my class.

123
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,730
And you need to erase
the name Cher, the celibate.

124
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,360
Get married at once.

125
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,560
- I want to go to a wedding.
- Okay, fine.

126
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,180
- Just go.
- Bye.

127
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,860
Hey.

128
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,530
I overheard that you
work as a love affair detective.

129
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,790
My name is Ju.

130
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:29,580
I'm the owner of this place.

131
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,430
I have a job for you.

132
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,650
Mr. Ryan?

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,310
In the past months,

134
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,460
I came across the fact

135
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,080
that he has cheated

136
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,920
at least seven times.

137
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,930
These long ears

138
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,400
can't even learn new tricks.

139
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,500
Long ears?

140
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,220
What is it?

141
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,070
I mean dogs.

142
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,880
These days,

143
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,900
we don't call them that?

144
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,560
Oh, yes, we do.

145
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,650
We do.

146
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:06,540
Are you suspecting someone
in particular, Ms. Ju?

147
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,940
Most of them

148
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,910
are the ones that dance.

149
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,040
But I don't have any evidence.

150
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,010
Every time we fight,

151
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,400
he always calls me paranoid.

152
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,900
He always says I don't trust him,

153
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,700
or I am overthinking.

154
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,950
There isn't such a thing as overthinking.

155
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,060
For couples that have been married
for a long time,

156
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,470
just a change of perfume

157
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,700
is already something worthy of suspicion.

158
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,120
And I have to be worried every night

159
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:33,070
whether he's somewhere with someone.

160
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:34,470
When I go and get him,

161
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,730
he'll give me that upset look.

162
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,570
It's torturing me, you know.

163
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:42,060
And all of my friends

164
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,100
encourage me to break up with him.

165
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,420
But in the end,

166
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,590
I don't have the courage.

167
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,330
But this time,

168
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,780
I have to be firm.

169
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,540
When I have the evidence,

170
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,810
I'm gonna file for divorce.

171
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,200
So he can disappear from my heart.

172
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,160
Ms. Ju,

173
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,370
you can trust me.

174
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,850
Because truth

175
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,600
never dies.

176
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,310
Smells so good.

177
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,640
Bitter gourd soup?

178
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,130
Mmm. Do you wanna try some?

179
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,390
- How is it?
- It's good.

180
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,700
Is it my mom's recipe?

181
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,740
No, it's my recipe.

182
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,840
It's as good as my mom's.

183
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,490
And...

184
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,730
How was your meeting
with your mom today?

185
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,310
Have you talked?

186
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,050
Well, we've talked.

187
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,310
She said it was nothing.

188
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,170
Thanks.

189
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,990
Mmm.

190
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,090
Oh, right.

191
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,230
I have an appointment
with a psychologist.

192
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,320
This Saturday.

193
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,900
Do I have to come?

194
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,360
Can I say no to this?

195
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,260
Eh? You can't do that.

196
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,440
We made an appointment.

197
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,520
There's one more thing.

198
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,880
I don't want to make the same mistakes,

199
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,080
and tried to solve them by ourselves.

200
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,030
I don't think it's good for us.

201
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,140
And I don't want to make you

202
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,720
sad again.

203
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,300
But...

204
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,870
The shrink wants me
to take my mom with us.

205
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,390
Are you okay?

206
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:44,910
Okay.

207
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,610
Do you want to eat now?

208
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,619
Of course! I'm so hungry.

209
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,520
It looks fun, Foei.

210
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,030
Mmm.

211
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,270
Teach me how to dance.

212
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,620
You said that

213
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,280
you just wanted to see the ambiance.

214
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,130
I thought just old people
are dancing here.

215
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,060
Please.

216
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,970
Beauty,

217
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,570
you can dance with Tan.

218
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,060
Because I have to

219
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,570
interview people for my report.

220
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,210
- Okay.
- Okay?

221
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,460
Let's go, Tan.

222
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,420
Teach me how to dance.

223
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,780
But I can only teach you
how to begin a dance.

224
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,940
Okay, let's go.

225
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,650
Please, don't be shy.

226
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,240
What should I do?

227
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:32,940
Uh...

228
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,090
Uh?

229
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,140
Begin from your right.

230
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,660
Right.

231
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,650
- Right.
- Then left.

232
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:40,740
Ryan has a class.

233
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,890
I'll keep an eye on Ryan.

234
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,440
And you'll watch Bella.

235
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,000
As long as you see an opportunity,

236
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,530
ask her to teach you.

237
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,910
Use your cute face for some benefit.

238
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,000
You'll be looking for some clues,

239
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,130
like where he goes and what he does.

240
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,840
Okay?

241
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,340
Okay.

242
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,570
See you.

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,130
Shall we dance?

244
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,520
I'm here for business, not for dancing.

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,390
Or you're a wuss?

246
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,960
What are you doing here?

247
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,010
Don't tell me you're here
to take a dance lesson.

248
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,300
What I'm doing here

249
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,220
depends on what you're doing here.

250
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,990
How is that related to me?

251
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:42,160
If you're here for investigating,

252
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,630
I'll be here for juggling.

253
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,320
If you're not hungry,

254
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,720
I'll invite you to dinner.

255
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:48,490
If you don't want to dance,

256
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,770
I'll invite you to dance.

257
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:54,410
How long are you going to follow me?

258
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,100
What are you doing?

259
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,230
Who is your target this time?

260
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,530
Why should I tell you?

261
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:13,110
Just curious.

262
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,650
Maybe I can help.

263
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,500
If you really want to help me,

264
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,610
stop dancing.

265
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:22,760
Don't you see?

266
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,970
What a perfect match we are!

267
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,160
No matter what I do,

268
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,290
you'll be able to catch up smoothly.

269
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
Like a match made in heaven.

270
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,910
More like sworn enemies.

271
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,570
Or Bobbsey Twins?

272
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,170
I'm out of your league.

273
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,890
I don't know what you're trying to do.

274
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,950
But I want you to know that

275
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,780
we're so different,
and we have nothing in common.

276
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,190
I hope

277
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,790
you understand.

278
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:14,630
Hey, hey.

279
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,880
Foei.

280
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,240
How's Bella doing?

281
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,360
Ryan just walked by.

282
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,320
Did he and Bella...

283
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,750
Is it fun?

284
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,330
As you saw,

285
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,290
Ryan was in the men's room.

286
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,030
I don't think they could
bang each other via Bluetooth.

287
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,630
How could you say that word, Foei?

288
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,680
Or,

289
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,850
did you get that from Tan?

290
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,970
You're being rude.

291
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,810
I was joking.

292
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,940
I see.

293
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,160
Don't be so loud.

294
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,490
You can ask Bella for a dance,

295
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,750
and get as much info as you can.

296
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,940
I'll be right with you.

297
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,860
Okay.

298
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,750
Get ready.

299
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,450
Bella will have an afterparty.

300
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,240
She also invited me.

301
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,760
Don't show off.

302
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:12,410
A pretty boy can have some light,

303
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,290
can't he?

304
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,270
He can.

305
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,430
By the end of today,

306
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,880
I've got to get my answer.

307
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,760
Okay, sis.

308
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,800
Hey, sis.

309
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,980
Is it

310
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,310
an orgy?

311
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,470
Hey.

312
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,230
You're talking nonsense.

313
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,620
Wait and see.

314
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,310
We'll see

315
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,110
if it's a sex party

316
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,410
or just for those two.

317
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,300
What a bad joke.

318
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,340
It's not funny?

319
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,730
What the heck?

320
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,870
Hey.

321
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,820
How are you, dancer?

322
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,400
- Oh, hi, Tan.
- Hi.

323
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,860
Uh, where's Foei?

324
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,790
He just left with a girl.

325
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,100
Really?

326
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,610
But he told me to do a project here.

327
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,790
Why did he do that?

328
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:33,930
And...

329
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,880
Did you see her face, Beauty?

330
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm not sure, but I know one thing.
She's so beautiful.

331
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:43,530
She looks so rich and delicate,
and a perfect match to Foei.

332
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,410
I don't understand why
you're acting so boring.

333
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,960
What am I doing?

334
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,120
They said you're a player.

335
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,960
You act cool and chase after girls.

336
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,700
But if you're still
playing hard to get like this,

337
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,990
I think

338
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,540
you'd better let Foei go.

339
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,950
Well, Beauty...

340
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,250
- I...
- Say it out loud

341
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,630
that you don't like Foei.

342
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,850
Hey!

343
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,040
You're early.

344
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,870
You freaking shocked me.

345
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,060
What's wrong?

346
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,300
What time is our meeting?

347
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,850
Just a few minutes late.

348
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:21,500
Come on.

349
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,450
Let's finalize our project

350
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,180
so that we'll be home earlier.

351
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,560
Let's see.

352
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,630
- What?
- Sit down.

353
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,540
Is something on my face?

354
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,170
Nothing.

355
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,950
A motel?

356
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,970
We can't be sure.

357
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:56,480
It may be Phat's decoy.

358
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,760
Oh, my.

359
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:02,630
Hello.

360
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,340
H... Hello.

361
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,370
D... Do you h... have

362
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,750
a r... reservation?

363
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,890
No.

364
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,210
Do you have a vacancy?

365
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,600
I… do

366
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,580
have o… one room left.

367
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,200
B… but you need to

368
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,190
p… park

369
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,980
your car

370
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,820
a… a little farther.

371
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,010
Okay. Can you take us there quickly?

372
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,460
Th… this way, please.

373
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,760
It's too hard.

374
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,280
G... go ahead.

375
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,710
P... please.

376
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,010
- Shoot!
- Wrong again?

377
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,210
- Ah!
- What?

378
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,760
Why are you being so jumpy?

379
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:33,750
I think

380
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,690
we've been fooled again.

381
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,320
=Catch Me Baby=

382
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,321
=Catch Me Baby=

383
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:46,441
- Shoot!
- Wrong again?

384
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,411
What?

385
00:19:50,251 --> 00:19:51,231
Why are you being jumpy?

386
00:19:57,511 --> 00:19:58,231
I think

387
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:00,151
we've been fooled again.

388
00:20:11,651 --> 00:20:12,491
Ms. Ju.

389
00:20:13,491 --> 00:20:15,171
What is it?

390
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,441
I want to hire you

391
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:18,871
to investigate my husband.

392
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:31,641
Don't worry.

393
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:34,281
Mr. Ryan will be safe under my watch.

394
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:37,161
Yeah, he's very good at his job.

395
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:39,351
So you don't need to be worried
when you're being naughty.

396
00:20:39,851 --> 00:20:41,061
Thank you very much, Phat.

397
00:20:41,451 --> 00:20:43,811
I'm so lucky
that Bella is one of your clients.

398
00:20:44,331 --> 00:20:45,041
My pleasure.

399
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:45,621
Sure.

400
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,171
Be careful.

401
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:53,441
The detective is about to come.

402
00:20:59,421 --> 00:21:00,311
Our target is here.

403
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:01,421
Get ready.

404
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:02,641
Dang.

405
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:04,151
Buy their time as much as possible.

406
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,301
Copy that.

407
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:12,031
Do... do you have...

408
00:21:33,791 --> 00:21:34,611
Our target is gone.

409
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:36,761
Please enjoy.

410
00:21:53,971 --> 00:21:54,541
Hey, sis.

411
00:21:56,021 --> 00:21:57,171
It's that gray car.

412
00:21:57,821 --> 00:21:58,471
Are we going to follow him?

413
00:21:58,631 --> 00:21:59,301
Wait.

414
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,561
I have two options.

415
00:22:02,941 --> 00:22:03,481
First,

416
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:06,111
follow that gray car.

417
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:07,301
Second,

418
00:22:07,771 --> 00:22:09,021
get back to that motel

419
00:22:09,671 --> 00:22:12,331
in case the lovers are still there.

420
00:22:12,701 --> 00:22:13,431
But...

421
00:22:13,481 --> 00:22:14,501
But

422
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:18,021
if this is Phat's plan,

423
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,121
even that gray car really is Ryan's,

424
00:22:20,691 --> 00:22:22,121
he's giving us a misleading signal.

425
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:24,031
He wants to mislead us

426
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:26,681
till we miss something.

427
00:22:30,601 --> 00:22:32,571
You know him very well.

428
00:22:45,651 --> 00:22:46,141
Phat.

429
00:22:47,571 --> 00:22:48,121
What?

430
00:22:48,651 --> 00:22:50,451
I love your dress.

431
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,241
When you're close to someone you like,

432
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:54,531
how do you feel?

433
00:22:55,991 --> 00:22:57,391
What makes you ask that?

434
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,161
Just answer me.

435
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:03,461
Well,

436
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:06,941
when we want to be with them,

437
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:10,101
our heart is racing.

438
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,691
When they're not in front of us,

439
00:23:15,411 --> 00:23:16,371
we'll miss them.

440
00:23:18,361 --> 00:23:20,871
And when you see them
get close to someone else,

441
00:23:22,341 --> 00:23:23,201
you'll get upset.

442
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:25,771
Mmm.

443
00:23:26,391 --> 00:23:27,531
It surely is upsetting.

444
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:29,251
But

445
00:23:30,641 --> 00:23:31,981
we don't know what to do.

446
00:23:32,971 --> 00:23:33,681
Yes.

447
00:23:35,821 --> 00:23:37,201
But when you see them smile,

448
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:40,341
we'll smile as well.

449
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:44,881
And then you'll realize

450
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:47,641
that you're falling
head over heels for them.

451
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:51,101
Phat.

452
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:52,641
And

453
00:23:54,361 --> 00:23:55,541
how can we be sure?

454
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:56,431
How can we be sure that

455
00:23:56,661 --> 00:23:57,521
all of this

456
00:23:58,011 --> 00:23:58,921
means we like them.

457
00:24:00,381 --> 00:24:02,371
Oh, kiddo.

458
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:04,971
If you're not sure,
you should just tell them how you feel.

459
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:06,931
And at the moment you do that,

460
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:08,121
you'll realize

461
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:09,141
whether you like them

462
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,071
or not.

463
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:19,731
They said they have baby faces.

464
00:24:20,021 --> 00:24:21,611
Baby faces.

465
00:24:31,961 --> 00:24:33,141
How many times have you done that?

466
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:34,721
Well, just a few times.

467
00:24:54,371 --> 00:24:54,871
Tan.

468
00:24:55,751 --> 00:24:56,671
I'll do my job.

469
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:03,641
(If you're not sure,
you should just tell them how you feel.)

470
00:25:05,061 --> 00:25:06,841
(And at the moment you do that,)

471
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:08,081
(you'll realize)

472
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:09,061
(whether you like them)

473
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:11,901
(or not.)

474
00:25:40,061 --> 00:25:40,461
Foei.

475
00:25:42,051 --> 00:25:42,841
I like you.

476
00:26:23,011 --> 00:26:24,141
Oh, my god.

477
00:26:24,601 --> 00:26:25,501
What are you doing?

478
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,351
Quiet!

479
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,481
They all will be here.

480
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:29,301
Give it back to me.

481
00:26:31,031 --> 00:26:31,461
Hey.

482
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,691
Don't stop me from working.

483
00:26:33,751 --> 00:26:34,411
Cher.

484
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:35,531
- What?
- Listen to me.

485
00:26:36,071 --> 00:26:37,401
It's not what you saw.

486
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:40,461
Are you crazy?

487
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:42,051
Not what I saw?

488
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,611
Didn't you see what they're doing?

489
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:44,831
I saw it.

490
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:46,611
And I know what will happen next.

491
00:26:47,321 --> 00:26:48,341
I'm doing this

492
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:50,111
for Ms. Noinah,

493
00:26:50,211 --> 00:26:50,821
Ms. Ju,

494
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:53,191
and you.

495
00:26:55,101 --> 00:26:56,521
You're even more insane.

496
00:26:56,861 --> 00:26:57,901
For everybody?

497
00:26:58,161 --> 00:26:59,321
What you're doing?

498
00:26:59,901 --> 00:27:01,881
Supporting love affairs?

499
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:06,211
Noinah's breaking up with Ryan.

500
00:27:11,031 --> 00:27:12,911
From the day I've juggled for Ryan,

501
00:27:13,811 --> 00:27:15,781
I felt that Noinah's acting weird.

502
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:18,221
So I followed them.

503
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:20,661
And I knew the truth.

504
00:27:22,001 --> 00:27:23,411
I knew that Noinah
wanted to end their relationship.

505
00:27:26,181 --> 00:27:28,331
If you tell Ms. Ju,

506
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:31,301
things might be worse.

507
00:27:33,441 --> 00:27:34,981
Everybody will be upset.

508
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:37,111
You have told me

509
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:39,101
truth never dies.

510
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,751
But if the truth will hurt someone,

511
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:47,301
do you still want to reveal the truth?

512
00:27:52,661 --> 00:27:53,581
I believe

513
00:27:55,251 --> 00:27:57,151
this will also hurt

514
00:27:58,201 --> 00:27:59,171
you.

515
00:28:04,811 --> 00:28:05,721
I'm sorry.

516
00:28:07,001 --> 00:28:07,721
It's okay.

517
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,691
You

518
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:10,281
have nothing to apologize for.

519
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:19,331
Really.

520
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:20,641
It's okay.

521
00:28:25,741 --> 00:28:28,021
You are a freaking liar.

522
00:28:41,151 --> 00:28:41,961
Ju.

523
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:47,441
Honey, please.

524
00:28:48,231 --> 00:28:49,141
Relax.

525
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:50,691
Relax, Ryan?

526
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,921
I've been relaxing for too long.

527
00:28:55,821 --> 00:28:57,961
You should be paying for your affair.

528
00:28:59,561 --> 00:29:01,181
You've been deceiving me for too long.

529
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:05,771
Ju.

530
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:08,491
I'm sorry.

531
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,961
I regret what I've done.

532
00:29:12,101 --> 00:29:14,621
You can call me anything you want.

533
00:29:16,761 --> 00:29:19,781
We just said goodbye for the last time.

534
00:29:20,391 --> 00:29:21,851
I won't let lovers like you two

535
00:29:22,631 --> 00:29:24,261
end things peacefully.

536
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:25,411
It's my fault.

537
00:29:25,911 --> 00:29:26,781
Ms. Ju.

538
00:29:31,861 --> 00:29:33,971
I've known about this for a while.

539
00:29:34,711 --> 00:29:35,741
It was Noinah.

540
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:40,081
Foei.

541
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:43,151
Wait in the car.

542
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:46,951
Yes.

543
00:29:51,451 --> 00:29:51,971
Noinah.

544
00:29:58,411 --> 00:29:59,821
Why are you doing this?

545
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:02,401
You know he's married.

546
00:30:03,591 --> 00:30:04,361
Cher.

547
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,071
I...

548
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,441
I never think

549
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:11,081
that one day

550
00:30:11,271 --> 00:30:12,811
I have to catch my friend.

551
00:30:13,581 --> 00:30:14,311
Cher.

552
00:30:15,101 --> 00:30:16,461
Listen to me.

553
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:19,381
I don't have any excuses.

554
00:30:19,521 --> 00:30:20,501
I did something wrong.

555
00:30:21,811 --> 00:30:23,601
But can you not tell Ju?

556
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:26,751
Please, Cher.

557
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,061
At least for our friendship.

558
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:31,841
Can you, Cher?

559
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:36,091
Cher.

560
00:30:37,781 --> 00:30:39,921
But I just didn't tell you.

561
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:43,331
If you need someone
to take responsibility,

562
00:30:44,391 --> 00:30:45,631
I will be the one.

563
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:46,631
Cher.

564
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:48,331
What are you doing?

565
00:30:50,361 --> 00:30:52,401
Are you also protecting her?

566
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:54,821
Do you take me as a fool?

567
00:30:58,831 --> 00:31:00,951
You're a victim in this, Ms. Ju.

568
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:03,801
Your husband got stolen.

569
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:06,841
You've been betrayed by your husband.

570
00:31:07,651 --> 00:31:10,741
You have the right
to lash out at anyone here.

571
00:31:12,321 --> 00:31:13,391
But at least

572
00:31:14,181 --> 00:31:15,891
I want you to know

573
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,391
that Noinah

574
00:31:19,941 --> 00:31:21,631
regrets everything she's done.

575
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:24,951
And she tried to fix this.

576
00:31:26,931 --> 00:31:27,591
But

577
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:29,461
it's me

578
00:31:30,871 --> 00:31:32,501
who's been lying to you.

579
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,321
Punish me.

580
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,171
Don't punish

581
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,801
someone who's trying to fix things.

582
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:52,741
Remember what happened today.

583
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:55,691
Your selfishness

584
00:31:56,951 --> 00:31:59,131
got everyone in trouble.

585
00:32:02,131 --> 00:32:04,581
This is the last touch between us.

586
00:32:17,381 --> 00:32:18,031
Cher.

587
00:32:18,721 --> 00:32:20,451
Thank you very much

588
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,341
for protecting me.

589
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:24,111
Even I

590
00:32:25,361 --> 00:32:27,681
have been doing the bad thing.

591
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:31,371
Cher, the celibate,

592
00:32:31,641 --> 00:32:33,811
I didn't get that name by luck.

593
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:34,631
And by what?

594
00:32:35,311 --> 00:32:36,821
By peace?

595
00:32:41,921 --> 00:32:42,531
Girl,

596
00:32:43,411 --> 00:32:46,151
I want you to remember today
as your lesson.

597
00:32:46,941 --> 00:32:48,691
Remember that you made people suffer.

598
00:32:49,541 --> 00:32:50,681
Including yourself.

599
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:52,411
Mmm.

600
00:32:52,621 --> 00:32:54,311
I'll remember this lesson

601
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:55,811
till the day

602
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:57,391
I die.

603
00:32:58,371 --> 00:32:59,091
I promise.

604
00:33:01,571 --> 00:33:02,081
Mmm.

605
00:33:03,571 --> 00:33:04,301
I'm leaving.

606
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:06,791
Mmm.

607
00:33:07,431 --> 00:33:09,181
Thanks again.

608
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,821
What have I done?

609
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,001
The right thing.

610
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:30,101
Ew!

611
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:32,081
Sounds like an internet quote.

612
00:33:32,681 --> 00:33:33,331
But would you give a like?

613
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:34,671
Nope.

614
00:33:35,051 --> 00:33:35,861
I'd give an angry emoji.

615
00:33:36,071 --> 00:33:36,551
Ah!

616
00:33:37,841 --> 00:33:39,131
Can't you give a love emoji instead?

617
00:33:39,631 --> 00:33:40,521
I don't want to.

618
00:33:44,361 --> 00:33:46,331
Ju. Ju, honey.

619
00:33:46,331 --> 00:33:48,121
Ju. I'm sorry, honey.

620
00:33:48,231 --> 00:33:49,061
I'm sorry.

621
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:50,251
Ju.

622
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:51,751
Forgive me for once.

623
00:33:52,011 --> 00:33:53,111
I won't do it again.

624
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,351
This will be the last time.

625
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:55,101
Whoa!

626
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:56,831
Those classical words.

627
00:33:57,631 --> 00:33:58,691
Give me 20, if they hold hands.

628
00:33:58,781 --> 00:33:59,811
Give me 100, if they hug each other.

629
00:34:00,241 --> 00:34:01,311
But if they kiss,

630
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:02,651
you'll buy me Mu-Kratha.

631
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,481
No way.

632
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:06,741
Ms. Ju won't forgive him that easily.

633
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:09,291
Please, Ju.

634
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:10,881
Forgive me.

635
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:11,511
Please.

636
00:34:24,401 --> 00:34:24,991
Eh...

637
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:26,671
Hey,

638
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:28,961
does that Mu-Kratha place

639
00:34:29,051 --> 00:34:30,441
have any discounts?

640
00:34:56,611 --> 00:34:58,241
What should I do with you, Foei?

641
00:35:09,211 --> 00:35:10,821
Maybe I can get to him
through his sister.

642
00:35:15,641 --> 00:35:16,351
Hmm.

643
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:24,091
Thanks.

644
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:29,591
Give me one.

645
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,451
Take it easy.

646
00:35:33,661 --> 00:35:34,991
I don't want to carry you home.

647
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:39,181
You don't get me.

648
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:41,831
My work is to uncover affairs.

649
00:35:42,191 --> 00:35:44,801
And your work is to hide them.

650
00:35:46,131 --> 00:35:47,441
But when I uncover one,

651
00:35:47,951 --> 00:35:48,581
how will it end up?

652
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:51,411
Ryan just has to beg for a while,

653
00:35:51,591 --> 00:35:52,781
and then they're back together.

654
00:35:56,151 --> 00:35:59,411
People don't always have
rational reasons in relationships.

655
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,451
Some are like that.

656
00:36:02,181 --> 00:36:03,391
So I think

657
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,551
maybe it's better if they
don't know about the affair.

658
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:08,571
Maybe it's the best.

659
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:09,871
Because

660
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,161
they still love each other

661
00:36:11,201 --> 00:36:12,241
and they won't break up.

662
00:36:12,941 --> 00:36:13,971
As long as they don't want to get hurt

663
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:15,981
because of this,

664
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:18,171
my work will always be needed.

665
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,191
Are you proud of yourself?

666
00:36:22,711 --> 00:36:24,741
You're encouraging people to cheat.

667
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:27,361
I'll tell you this one more time.

668
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,301
I don't support them.

669
00:36:29,561 --> 00:36:30,861
I just don't judge them.

670
00:36:30,971 --> 00:36:32,741
Those two are different.

671
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:34,101
- It's the same thing!
- Ow!

672
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:39,781
Are you hurt?

673
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:41,701
There, there.

674
00:36:42,051 --> 00:36:43,511
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:43,961 --> 00:36:44,461
Well,

676
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:47,251
you said something I don't like.

677
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:52,191
It doesn't hurt that much.

678
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:54,301
But when you ignore me,

679
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:55,911
it's more hurtful.

680
00:36:57,341 --> 00:36:58,301
Why is that hurtful?

681
00:36:58,921 --> 00:37:00,271
If I yell at you,

682
00:37:00,341 --> 00:37:01,321
that should be when you get hurt.

683
00:37:02,411 --> 00:37:03,861
I don't care when you yell at me.

684
00:37:03,981 --> 00:37:05,311
We can have different points of view.

685
00:37:05,881 --> 00:37:07,921
But I can't stand it

686
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:09,591
when a rival ignores me.

687
00:37:10,191 --> 00:37:11,161
Because then I don't know

688
00:37:11,561 --> 00:37:12,871
what I need competition for.

689
00:37:16,831 --> 00:37:18,151
Sometimes

690
00:37:18,401 --> 00:37:19,561
I forgot

691
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,261
that we're not on the same side.

692
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,311
But it's strange that

693
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:27,941
even though we're competing
with each other,

694
00:37:28,201 --> 00:37:29,571
we have nothing in common,

695
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:31,561
and we keep fighting all the time,

696
00:37:31,621 --> 00:37:33,411
I never hate you.

697
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:37,011
I never really hate you.

698
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:39,851
Right?

699
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:43,231
It's my only pleasure when I'm working.

700
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:44,871
Competing with you.

701
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:48,101
Are you a war fanatic?

702
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:49,881
Are you a troubled child?

703
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:54,061
Maybe.

704
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:00,471
Hey.

705
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:01,941
I'm sorry

706
00:38:02,991 --> 00:38:04,161
that I said bad things

707
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:05,941
about your parents.

708
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:06,981
Hey, you.

709
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,471
Aren't you overthinking?

710
00:38:08,681 --> 00:38:09,931
I wasn't mad at all.

711
00:38:11,231 --> 00:38:12,331
You've drunk too much.

712
00:38:27,441 --> 00:38:27,951
Cher.

713
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:34,231
I freaking like you.

714
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:40,061
