5
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,120
My boyfriend came to your house
the other day, didn't he?

6
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,680
I saw your boyfriend
walking with some girl at lunch.

7
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,960
I'll DM you.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,900
Please, look after each other.

9
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,790
Please be a union.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,430
Don't 100% believe what he told us.

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,120
(Miao invited Cher to the group.)

12
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,400
(Cher joined the group.)

13
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,670
This is Cher.
We paid her to investigate Chai.

14
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,610
You can update any info here, Cher.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,220
Hello, everyone.

16
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,670
Truth never dies.

17
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,520
LOL.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,480
(Chai's office)

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,120
(06:17)

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,080
Hello.

21
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,280
Sure. I'll tell them to send it to you.

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,050
Sure. Okay, sir.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
(Case No.61:
Investigate Mr. Chai's behavior.)

24
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:18,150
Don't you go home, pretty?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,310
Oh, Cherry?

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,720
Won't you go home?

27
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,600
I forgot my stuff.

28
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,220
I see. So I'll go back home.

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,750
Yes.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,160
Here you are.

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,520
My baby girl. How are you?

32
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,880
Oh, honey.

33
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:47,800
Today,

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,190
I'm gonna be late.

35
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,040
I want to clear everything here.

36
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,960
Again?

37
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:52,970
This weekend,

38
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,460
we'd watch a movie comfortably.

39
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
Right, I heard that

40
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,760
a 6-7 months fetus

41
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,240
knows things already.

42
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,570
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,440
- Can you see your dad?
- Hi.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
I miss you.

45
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,790
I have to go now.

46
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,710
Bye-bye.

47
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,850
How can he do that?

48
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,960
Nothing's wrong on the third day.

49
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,910
Hey.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:23,540
Hey.

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,070
The maid is gone?

52
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,660
She's not a maid.

53
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,560
But she's gone.

54
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,470
Now,

55
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,050
can you tell me

56
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,540
why is someone following me?

57
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,360
Sorry.

58
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,560
I forgot to introduce myself.

59
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,530
My name is Phat.

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,160
A relationship juggler.

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,910
(Secret is the most powerful tool.)
Your wife is getting suspicious.

62
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,610
So she paid a detective to follow you.

63
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,310
Huh?

64
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,150
Miao did that?

65
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,700
Yes.

66
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,380
But don't worry.

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,320
Because your secret

68
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,800
will stay a secret forever.

69
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,210
Yes.

70
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,030
See you.

71
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,240
Every time I kiss a girl,

72
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,040
I always see your face.

73
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,870
I hate myself for liking someone like you.

74
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,450
You're selfish,

75
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,870
and you toy with people.

76
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,170
Darn you!

77
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,120
Get out of my head already.

78
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,990
Hello, sis.

79
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:40,180
I've been watching him for days.

80
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,610
His behavior is normal.

81
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,840
There's no obvious evidence.

82
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,230
No sign of unusual digital footprints.

83
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,760
So you're gonna fail again?

84
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,630
And what did he say, sis?

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
The same old love affair story.

86
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,310
He claims that he has to
work overtime every day.

87
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,770
The real O.T.?

88
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,710
He did work during these past 3-4 days.

89
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,590
So, I'll have to watch him
from the parking lot instead.

90
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,570
That's good.

91
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,230
So, we'll end our case faster.

92
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,750
Yes, it's good.

93
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,680
But his girlfriend won't be at ease.

94
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,650
Oh, sis.

95
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,570
How far does it have to go

96
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,110
so that you'd call it a love affair?

97
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,790
What?

98
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,320
Well.

99
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,240
Okay. Having a mistress
is an affair for sure.

100
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,330
But what about

101
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,120
hanging out,

102
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,040
drinking, patronizing prostitutes,

103
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,510
or

104
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,930
just talking

105
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,110
but having no sex?

106
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,920
How far does it have to go

107
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,930
so that you'd call it a love affair?

108
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,570
It depends on the client's perspective.

109
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,560
Regardless of
what their husband is doing,

110
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,460
be it patronizing prostitutes
or just talking without sex,

111
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,020
our job is to report that.

112
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,710
Yes. That's for the client.

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,480
But I mean...

114
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:56,460
for you.

115
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,630
For me,

116
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,560
they can't even talk.

117
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,190
Whether it's talking or having sex,
cheating is still cheating.

118
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,570
You're too tough. You know that, sis?

119
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:10,900
Huh?

120
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,620
What's wrong, sis?

121
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,070
We need a back-up

122
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,130
for this job.

123
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,880
=Catch Me Baby=

124
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
(Thong Leaung)

125
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,900
My old good Phat is back!

126
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,010
I'm gonna cry.

127
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,970
She deserved it!

128
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:51,790
Tan.

129
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,770
Hmm?

130
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,150
Did you tell Pink?

131
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,360
Oh, Phat.

132
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,850
I thought we were on the same team.

133
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,360
- Right?
- Who?

134
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,410
Who's on your team?

135
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,630
Eh? That day

136
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,710
you brought me to your mission.

137
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,220
If it wasn't for me,

138
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,780
you wouldn't have won.

139
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:15,270
This is my turf. Don't cross the line.

140
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,700
Look, bro.

141
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,560
For Mu-Kratha,

142
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,660
you need to steal the food

143
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,480
so that it's yummy.

144
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,630
Don't be primitive.

145
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,960
For Mu-Kratha,

146
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,870
you need to be patient,

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,930
and be careful about the cooking.

148
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,010
So you can enjoy it.

149
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,180
Oh, right.

150
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,650
A player like you

151
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,480
won't understand this.

152
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,490
What? There's no need to say that.

153
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:44,480
You're working for players, aren't you?

154
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,100
Because there are players,

155
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,110
so I have my job.

156
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:49,600
What?

157
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,410
Oh. Okay. Okay.

158
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,540
There's no need to argue.

159
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,130
He's a newbie.

160
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,220
He might not know our tradition.

161
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,980
He'll get it.

162
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,480
Oh, speaking of Cher...

163
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,630
It's a forbidden word!

164
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,980
Don't say Cher...

165
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:07,750
Why?

166
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,260
What's wrong with me, Pinky?

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,810
The soccer match yesterday was fun, Tan.

168
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,670
But the home team isn't careful.

169
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:30,850
So they lost.

170
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,140
1-0.

171
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,050
Right?

172
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,360
Yes, bro.

173
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,460
Soccer

174
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,440
isn't decided in one match, Foei.

175
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,470
You'll have to watch the whole season.

176
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,040
And then you'll decide

177
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,120
who's the lead

178
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,410
and who's at the bottom.

179
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,170
Yes, sis.

180
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:53,790
But I wanna know

181
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,880
what the coach's thinking.

182
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,580
Do you think the home team

183
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,770
will win or lose the next match

184
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,220
in their home?

185
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,210
Wanna bet?

186
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,470
From now on,
no matter which team you support,

187
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,790
I'm gonna bet against you.

188
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,560
Where are you going, Pink?

189
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,120
How can I stay?

190
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,430
She's the one who's got you fired.

191
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,540
How can you tolerate her?

192
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,380
Tan.

193
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,220
Let's talk outside.

194
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,210
I need to talk to you.

195
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,350
What's your plan?

196
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:57,990
What plan?

197
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,370
No.

198
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,720
My brother

199
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,260
loves to improvise.

200
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,350
You know what

201
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,630
you and your bro

202
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,150
did to my sis lately?

203
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,120
Foei,

204
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,630
I really don't know.

205
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,670
Can you relax?

206
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,150
I thought

207
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,510
you wanted to talk about us.

208
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,220
About us?

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,500
I thought I said it all.

210
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,400
But I haven't said

211
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,660
what I feel about you.

212
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,840
Well...

213
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,640
I've slept on it.

214
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,270
You and I...

215
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,860
Can we still be friends?

216
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,410
After what happened,

217
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:56,070
how the heck can you say
that we can still be friends?

218
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,330
Hey!

219
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,510
Where are you going?

220
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
If you don't want to be my friend,

221
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,320
be my boyfriend then.

222
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,350
Huh?

223
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,890
How can I help you?

224
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,000
Thanks. But I can do it myself.

225
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,630
It's okay.

226
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,080
It's nothing.

227
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,400
I always wash my dishes at home.

228
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,070
Let me help you.

229
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,950
How's the food today, Mom?

230
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,510
I did it

231
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,160
by the recipe you told me.

232
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:41,400
Mmm.

233
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,550
As for the bitter gourd soup,

234
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,330
did you rinse the pot
after the first boil?

235
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:51,500
I must've forgotten.

236
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,490
I knew it.

237
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:54,880
It was too bitter.

238
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:57,960
I've told you many times

239
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,020
that when you cook the bitter gourd soup,

240
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,460
you have to rinse the pot
after the first boil.

241
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:04,190
So the soup won't be too bitter.

242
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,170
What is it?

243
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,690
How can you forget something like this?

244
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,250
I'm sorry.

245
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,590
And drink the herbal drink

246
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,120
that Grandma made for you.

247
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,340
So you'll be more fertile like Auntie Gim.

248
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,940
And Jim will have a baby soon.

249
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,080
Sure.

250
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,690
Aoei, come to Grandma.

251
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,430
Oh, good girl.

252
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,920
Be careful, Jim.

253
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,100
Honey.

254
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,480
Are you tired?

255
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,390
Don't get mad at my mom.

256
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,440
She always visits us
without telling us first.

257
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,590
Did you tell your mom
that I didn't drink it?

258
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,430
Did you tell her that I don't want a baby?

259
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,370
I didn't.

260
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,330
Why don't you?

261
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,900
Haven't we talked about it?

262
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,530
I think you'd better calm down.

263
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,030
Did you listen to me?

264
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,020
I can't stay like this.

265
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,800
I can't even!

266
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,560
Jim!

267
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,210
Here.

268
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:59,880
Phat told me to bring it to you.

269
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,590
When he cleared out his office,

270
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,780
he accidentally took it.

271
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,340
Hey, are you okay?

272
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,280
Same old story.

273
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
The first time Fah told me,

274
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,010
I thought she was just stressed out.

275
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,780
I thought as life goes on,

276
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,610
she would change her mind.

277
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,480
Sorry.

278
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm venting on you.

279
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,760
Come on, bro.

280
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:32,680
You two will figure it out.

281
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,160
You two are

282
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,770
my ideal couple.

283
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,430
Even more...

284
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,980
more than...

285
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:40,520
uh...

286
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,040
the weaver princess and the cowherd,

287
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,170
or...

288
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,020
Princess Leia and Han Solo.

289
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,840
Did you train with Coach Joy?

290
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,550
Huh?

291
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,210
Do you know about Coach Joy?

292
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,780
It was Phat's doing, wasn't it?

293
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,140
Typical him.

294
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,470
Awesome.

295
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,960
You like it, don't you?

296
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,210
So you feel better now?

297
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,420
Then I'm leaving.

298
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,050
If you're still upset...

299
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,040
Crack these.

300
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,520
Why? Pumpkin seed can reduce stress?

301
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,970
It's hard to crack. It'll upset you.

302
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,300
And why do you recommend this to me?

303
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,900
So...

304
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,380
you'll be upset about
cracking pumpkin seed instead.

305
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,390
And you'll forget what's bothering you.

306
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:39,980
I'm leaving.

307
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,320
Crack all of these.

308
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,980
It's really hard.

309
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,120
After my wife got pregnant,

310
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,890
she's so paranoid,

311
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,430
and more cranky.

312
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:18,170
But for me,

313
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,450
I don't have any secrets.

314
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,580
It's just that tomorrow

315
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,190
my high-school friends

316
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,050
will play soccer together.

317
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
And...

318
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,170
there will be...

319
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,540
a Santa Clause

320
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,590
to bring us gifts.

321
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,990
But I

322
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,730
don't want the wives to know.

323
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,410
Because they're

324
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,270
so close that they have a group chat.

325
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,730
They report

326
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,310
and check out for each other.

327
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,760
A friend of mine

328
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,130
got caught because he had
an affair with his colleague.

329
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:47,680
Now

330
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,900
they're separated.

331
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:53,400
They're more cooperative than the CIA.

332
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,480
But there's nothing wrong with me.

333
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,900
I've never cheated.

334
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,910
But some of my friends

335
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,730
can't stop their old habit.

336
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,860
And my wife

337
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,770
told me to stop hanging out with them.

338
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,090
I totally understand you.

339
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:16,650
Before talking about our plan,

340
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,730
I want you to be honest
and tell your wife, Chai,

341
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,400
that you're gonna
play soccer with friends.

342
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:22,550
Is that okay?

343
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,440
But you only tell her

344
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,720
the half of it.

345
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,300
Don't tell her about Santa.

346
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:32,250
Miao, I want to play soccer
with my friends tomorrow.

347
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,900
I won't be late. Don't worry.

348
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,180
Where will you play?

349
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,370
Boat told me it'd be at the usual place.

350
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,970
(Mission - Juggler for Chai)
When you told her the truth,

351
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:42,650
her group will surely
report this to each other.

352
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,970
And the other team will send
their best detective to follow you.

353
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,610
If we run into Cher near the field,

354
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,120
what would you do?

355
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,530
Do you think they'll wait for Chai
at the field?

356
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,160
Here he comes.

357
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,720
For a detailed worker like Cher,

358
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,690
(Car Parking, 07:18 PM)
she'll wait for Chai at the office,

359
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,900
and follow him to the field.

360
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,070
At that moment,

361
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:02,330
we'll misdirect the best detective.

362
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,170
How?

363
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,950
Oh, Cherry.

364
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,150
Long time no see.

365
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,720
You've moved to another branch?

366
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,660
Oh, that's right.

367
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,230
Who is it?

368
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,280
Are you a sugar mama?

369
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,390
Nope.

370
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,860
He's my little brother.

371
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,130
Say hi to her.

372
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:23,330
Hello, ma'am.

373
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,540
I'm Cher's broth...

374
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,080
Oh, Cherry's brother.

375
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,420
I see.

376
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,260
I have to go. See you next time.

377
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,320
Bye.

378
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,440
Bye.

379
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,620
Is it okay, Phat?

380
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,420
Well done.

381
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,640
The other team won't know

382
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,190
that we'll use a decoy

383
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,020
to lead them to the wrong place.

384
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,120
We're okay now, aren't we?

385
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,520
It's just the beginning.

386
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,290
How is it?

387
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,780
They're following me.

388
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,030
You can relax.

389
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,390
I'll hold them off for two hours.

390
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,210
Foei.

391
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:04,380
Report to the group chat

392
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,640
that we're following Chai.

393
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,810
Sure, sis.

394
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,780
But when you're there,

395
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,360
if they realize
they're following the wrong person,

396
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,490
they'll go to the right place anyway.

397
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:13,660
That's the point.

398
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,930
We don't juggle a relationship.

399
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,650
But this mission

400
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,820
is for buying time.

401
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,030
So that detective

402
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,160
(Mission - Juggler for Chai
Mission - Lure for Chai)

403
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,980
won't see our Santa.

404
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,270
(Football field)

405
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:30,730
For today, guys.

406
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,600
It's Christmas but we're playing soccer.

407
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:36,890
We're healthy boys. See you later.

408
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,490
Phat.

409
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,640
I don't understand.

410
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,470
It's just a soccer match

411
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:43,870
with the Santa bringing gifts to them.

412
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,840
Why do you have to hide it?

413
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,570
Guys.

414
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,040
Turn it off.

415
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,980
Half time.

416
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,730
Here comes Santa!

417
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,260
Wait.

418
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,320
It's not Santa.

419
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,220
It's Santie.

420
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,330
If it's just Santa,

421
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,350
why would it be a secret? Right?

422
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,440
- Wow.
- Make some room for me.

423
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,050
Can't you wait?

424
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,390
Look, look.

425
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,930
Chai, bro. Come on.

426
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,910
It's alright.

427
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,460
Usually, you don't get a chance
like this very much.

428
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:33,980
No, thanks.

429
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:34,760
Hey, girl.

430
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,450
After massaging me,

431
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:36,940
you do him, okay?

432
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,100
His wife often doesn't let him go out.

433
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,410
But do me first.

434
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:42,940
(Football field, 08:45 PM)
Can I have some?

435
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,050
No. You keep an eye on the clock.

436
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,400
You set an alarm
for five minutes after Chai.

437
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,700
So I have to wait after him?

438
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,330
What?

439
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,670
The party nearly ends.

440
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,310
Pink.

441
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,030
Tell those Santies.

442
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,120
I'll standby here

443
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:55,710
waiting for Tan

444
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:57,200
in case I need to be up against

445
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,150
the detective.

446
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Roger!

447
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:11,780
Please.

448
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,000
It's time already.

449
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,700
Hello, Tan.

450
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,480
- Fan out.
- Where did you tell the detective to go?

451
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,460
Well.

452
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,210
I was gonna call you.

453
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,370
Where's him?

454
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,160
Ow!

455
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,130
Let me go, Foei.

456
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,070
Stay still.

457
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,400
Don't move.

458
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,960
=Catch Me Baby=

459
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,926
=Catch Me Baby=

460
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:40,406
Let me go, Foei.

461
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,306
Stay still.

462
00:20:41,886 --> 00:20:42,646
Don't move.

463
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:45,816
Ow!

464
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,676
Husbands are meeting
just for a soccer match.

465
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:54,296
If you didn't investigate him,

466
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,086
I wouldn't get involved.

467
00:20:56,246 --> 00:20:57,596
If they did nothing wrong,

468
00:20:58,246 --> 00:20:59,436
what are you afraid of?

469
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:00,486
I'm not afraid.

470
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,346
I just can't let you win.

471
00:21:03,866 --> 00:21:05,686
You used someone else

472
00:21:05,966 --> 00:21:06,686
to just...

473
00:21:06,736 --> 00:21:08,216
to win.

474
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:09,166
Yes.

475
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,706
I'll be your nightmare.

476
00:21:12,406 --> 00:21:13,486
So you'll never forget about me

477
00:21:13,486 --> 00:21:14,686
in your whole life.

478
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:27,846
Hey!

479
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:30,236
Massage me here, girl.

480
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:31,416
Hmm, you did a good job.

481
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,056
Uh...

482
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:34,106
Excuse me.

483
00:21:34,256 --> 00:21:35,916
It's time.

484
00:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,136
Guys.

485
00:21:37,206 --> 00:21:39,226
Please don't do that to me.

486
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:41,996
What is it?

487
00:21:42,486 --> 00:21:43,616
It's time.

488
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:46,076
I just extended it by half an hour.

489
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,336
See?

490
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:48,226
My friends

491
00:21:48,226 --> 00:21:50,176
haven't done with the girls yet.

492
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,166
Look at Chai.

493
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:52,706
He can't get away
from his wife very often.

494
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:54,336
Boat, I'm okay with it.

495
00:21:54,636 --> 00:21:56,556
I think we should let the girls go.

496
00:21:56,776 --> 00:21:58,456
But I extended the session.

497
00:21:58,456 --> 00:21:59,666
You told me
you hired a professional team.

498
00:22:00,446 --> 00:22:01,216
How can they be like this?

499
00:22:01,996 --> 00:22:02,926
Go to be with your wife.

500
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:04,496
Let's go, guys.

501
00:22:04,496 --> 00:22:05,196
Go, go.

502
00:22:05,196 --> 00:22:06,496
Let him go.

503
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:07,906
What are we gonna do, bro?

504
00:22:09,616 --> 00:22:11,126
It's the worst situation.

505
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:13,156
I don't know where Cher is.

506
00:22:13,336 --> 00:22:14,766
And Tan is captured.

507
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,766
Wait. Will Cher be here?

508
00:22:22,526 --> 00:22:23,216
Look, Pink.

509
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:24,536
Listen to me carefully.

510
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,626
You take Chai away.

511
00:22:27,066 --> 00:22:28,686
We'll help him at least.

512
00:22:29,526 --> 00:22:30,686
I'll look for Cher.

513
00:22:31,006 --> 00:22:31,536
Do that.

514
00:22:31,536 --> 00:22:32,496
Okay.

515
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:34,786
Chai, come with me.

516
00:22:44,166 --> 00:22:45,086
Stop trying.

517
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,216
Get out of my way, Foei.

518
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:49,786
I'll help my brother.

519
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:53,066
I'll never let you go.

520
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,316
You won't get out of the way, will you?

521
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:00,436
Never.

522
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:13,626
What you're doing?

523
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:27,326
You've...

524
00:23:28,656 --> 00:23:29,516
never changed.

525
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:08,596
Playing soccer, huh?

526
00:24:09,096 --> 00:24:11,216
I'll get more than one photo now.

527
00:24:25,386 --> 00:24:26,406
Let's see.

528
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:31,286
Truth never d...

529
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:33,736
Where is Tan?

530
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:36,986
Ow!

531
00:24:37,906 --> 00:24:38,666
Phat!

532
00:24:40,536 --> 00:24:41,376
Bro.

533
00:24:41,456 --> 00:24:42,426
I'm sorry.

534
00:24:43,726 --> 00:24:45,176
Are you taking my brother hostage?

535
00:24:45,626 --> 00:24:46,496
It's a crime.

536
00:24:47,226 --> 00:24:48,586
You've done the same.

537
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,646
What you're doing
is also against the law.

538
00:24:50,766 --> 00:24:52,406
You might destroy some families.

539
00:24:52,636 --> 00:24:53,706
Give me the phone.

540
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:55,316
Give it to me.

541
00:24:55,316 --> 00:24:56,936
- No.
- Hey!

542
00:24:56,936 --> 00:24:57,886
What are you doing?

543
00:24:57,886 --> 00:24:59,096
Give it to me now!

544
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:01,076
What are you doing...Ow!

545
00:25:16,656 --> 00:25:18,016
Foei, get him.

546
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,496
- What?
- Hey!

547
00:25:19,496 --> 00:25:21,206
Foei!

548
00:25:21,446 --> 00:25:22,836
Ouch!

549
00:25:22,836 --> 00:25:23,576
What are you doing?

550
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:24,646
Stop!

551
00:25:24,646 --> 00:25:25,246
Hurry up, sis.

552
00:25:25,246 --> 00:25:26,396
It won't turn on. Wait!

553
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:27,556
It must have run out of power.

554
00:25:27,556 --> 00:25:28,206
Stop!

555
00:25:28,206 --> 00:25:30,076
Just hold him down.

556
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,186
He's coming.

557
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:36,226
Take him! Take him!

558
00:25:36,356 --> 00:25:37,086
Stop!

559
00:25:37,346 --> 00:25:39,546
No!

560
00:25:39,546 --> 00:25:40,566
Hey!

561
00:25:40,566 --> 00:25:44,406
Let me go! Stop!

562
00:25:48,156 --> 00:25:49,126
I won.

563
00:25:49,596 --> 00:25:50,366
Don't.

564
00:25:52,836 --> 00:25:53,366
Okay.

565
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,026
I'm begging you.

566
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:56,826
Please drop this.

567
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:58,796
It's ridiculous.

568
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:00,656
Ridiculous?

569
00:26:00,996 --> 00:26:03,056
Why are you doing this ridiculous job?

570
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:05,056
The husbands are just gathering for fun.

571
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:06,886
They're just having fun
during the weekend.

572
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:10,666
They might just want to release
some stress given by society.

573
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:12,736
Nobody takes this seriously.

574
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:16,016
Why do you have to make
a dramatic scene in their family?

575
00:26:17,736 --> 00:26:19,476
Releasing some stress?

576
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:21,546
Having fun?

577
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:23,726
Do you really see that?

578
00:26:24,886 --> 00:26:25,516
Do you know

579
00:26:25,656 --> 00:26:27,326
that every case I've worked on

580
00:26:27,446 --> 00:26:29,706
has started from these small things?

581
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,016
They would tell themselves

582
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,806
everything is under control,
and there's nothing serious about it.

583
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,506
I see no one could do what they've said.

584
00:26:36,806 --> 00:26:37,946
And there's one more thing.

585
00:26:38,336 --> 00:26:39,916
If you want to release some stress,

586
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,946
why don't you run, play golf
or eat some Japanese food?

587
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:45,016
Why do you have to relax
in this perverted way?

588
00:26:45,106 --> 00:26:47,166
Why is everything so bad for you?

589
00:26:48,726 --> 00:26:50,846
They just want a short break.

590
00:26:51,196 --> 00:26:51,836
Okay.

591
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:53,386
They might be off the track.

592
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,826
But in the end, they can still
become a good father

593
00:26:55,936 --> 00:26:57,616
and a good husband for their family.

594
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:58,916
For you,

595
00:26:59,486 --> 00:27:00,996
is this a big sin?

596
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,466
How do you know

597
00:27:03,816 --> 00:27:05,026
that they are a good father

598
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:06,406
or a good husband?

599
00:27:06,506 --> 00:27:07,456
Did you hide under their bed?

600
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:08,686
I don't know.

601
00:27:08,876 --> 00:27:10,416
That's exactly why
I don't judge them like you.

602
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:12,816
What you're doing

603
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,906
is judging someone

604
00:27:14,996 --> 00:27:16,046
by your own standard.

605
00:27:16,246 --> 00:27:17,626
And that's a big sin.

606
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:20,686
Maybe

607
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:22,576
some families have agreed on that.

608
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:26,066
Are you stupid?

609
00:27:26,376 --> 00:27:27,406
You don't know.

610
00:27:27,466 --> 00:27:28,426
Neither do I.

611
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:29,956
That's why we need to investigate,

612
00:27:30,006 --> 00:27:31,776
and let them decide
after knowing the truth.

613
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:33,846
Whether they will be okay
about this or not

614
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:34,936
is their business.

615
00:27:35,096 --> 00:27:37,236
You and I don't make this call.

616
00:27:37,236 --> 00:27:38,316
Don't you understand?

617
00:27:39,746 --> 00:27:40,546
What if the truth

618
00:27:41,586 --> 00:27:42,556
hurts someone?

619
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,006
Can you take it?

620
00:27:47,746 --> 00:27:48,506
I'm sorry.

621
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,796
It might sound selfish.

622
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:53,696
But my job is to report the truth,

623
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:55,946
and the truth

624
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:57,926
never dies.

625
00:27:58,286 --> 00:27:58,876
Sis!

626
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:02,316
What if Phat was right?

627
00:28:03,886 --> 00:28:05,216
Can we take the responsibility?

628
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:06,276
Foei!

629
00:28:06,276 --> 00:28:07,506
Are you taking their side?

630
00:28:07,506 --> 00:28:08,066
Hey! Wait!

631
00:28:08,066 --> 00:28:09,296
- What?
- No!

632
00:28:09,616 --> 00:28:10,416
Tan, help me.

633
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,316
Give it to me.

634
00:28:11,866 --> 00:28:12,596
I'm sorry.

635
00:28:13,246 --> 00:28:14,866
I can't let you win this battle.

636
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:26,256
Don't touch me.

637
00:28:28,576 --> 00:28:30,296
Let's take a photo.

638
00:28:32,906 --> 00:28:34,066
Let me put my glasses on.

639
00:28:39,226 --> 00:28:40,676
One, two, three.

640
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:41,806
Okay.

641
00:28:53,236 --> 00:28:54,986
My boyfriend sent me a photo.

642
00:28:55,136 --> 00:28:56,796
There's nothing wrong today, is there?

643
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:59,526
Yeah, they were really
just playing soccer, I guess.

644
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:01,996
Good night, everyone.
We need to work in the early morning.

645
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:03,496
Good night.

646
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:20,676
Wait.

647
00:29:37,536 --> 00:29:43,006
（Miao has left the group.）

648
00:29:43,006 --> 00:29:46,086
（Rich）

649
00:29:48,096 --> 00:29:49,286
Pour some soup in.

650
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:51,596
What do you want, Tan?

651
00:29:51,596 --> 00:29:52,306
Can I take this?

652
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:58,606
- More bacon.
- Oh, hi, Cher. You can take this table.

653
00:29:58,906 --> 00:29:59,796
It's okay.

654
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,406
I can sit there.

655
00:30:01,926 --> 00:30:02,766
Cher.

656
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,566
Of course.

657
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,216
Hey, bring utensil sets for table four.

658
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:34,116
As I promised.

659
00:30:34,636 --> 00:30:35,446
I lost.

660
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:58,796
Are you going to the buffet?

661
00:31:00,016 --> 00:31:00,736
I'll come with you.

662
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:15,786
Hey, you.

663
00:31:16,596 --> 00:31:17,686
Won't you talk to me?

664
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,756
Someone once said

665
00:31:21,386 --> 00:31:23,486
the winner shouldn't comfort the loser.

666
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:24,396
I've never heard of this.

667
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:27,536
You've just won a game.

668
00:31:28,076 --> 00:31:29,016
But in real life,

669
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:31,056
you and I need to compete
against each other more often.

670
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:32,786
What?

671
00:31:33,006 --> 00:31:34,316
Aren't you bored?

672
00:31:34,916 --> 00:31:35,456
Nope.

673
00:31:36,036 --> 00:31:37,266
It was fun competing with you.

674
00:31:37,836 --> 00:31:39,386
Since I was born, only you

675
00:31:39,556 --> 00:31:40,606
can catch me at every move.

676
00:31:44,476 --> 00:31:45,176
Phat.

677
00:31:46,026 --> 00:31:48,856
I don't think you should compete with her.

678
00:31:49,486 --> 00:31:51,336
You just lost to her, didn't you?

679
00:31:52,916 --> 00:31:54,636
Listen to your sister.

680
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:56,846
I'm tired of you in every job.

681
00:31:58,006 --> 00:31:59,036
What are you saying, Pink?

682
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:00,776
Just this game

683
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:01,996
I won't give up.

684
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:05,776
Ah!

685
00:32:06,346 --> 00:32:07,606
This is Phat's territory.

686
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:09,016
Yours is over there.

687
00:32:11,636 --> 00:32:12,206
Move!

688
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:17,786
Fine.

689
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:19,446
If you want it.

690
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:20,516
And...

691
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:22,416
Do you want some vegetables?

692
00:32:22,636 --> 00:32:23,466
Eat all of them.

693
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,316
You love me this much?

694
00:32:28,396 --> 00:32:28,896
Yes.

695
00:32:29,636 --> 00:32:30,256
Huh?

696
00:32:31,046 --> 00:32:32,686
What did you say?

697
00:32:34,066 --> 00:32:34,666
What?

698
00:32:35,886 --> 00:32:36,396
Well...

699
00:32:36,846 --> 00:32:38,826
She asked me if I hate her this much.

700
00:32:39,226 --> 00:32:40,106
So I said yes.

701
00:32:41,056 --> 00:32:42,106
Why so jumpy?

702
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:52,356
Pink.

703
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:53,716
Where are you going?

704
00:32:54,416 --> 00:32:54,956
Hey!

705
00:32:55,486 --> 00:32:56,746
There's no more pork belly.

706
00:32:57,066 --> 00:32:58,066
Bring me some.

707
00:32:59,286 --> 00:33:00,166
Did you listen to me?

708
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,206
Thank you for everything, Phat.

709
00:33:12,786 --> 00:33:14,066
No need to thank me.

710
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:16,166
I failed you, Chai.

711
00:33:33,336 --> 00:33:33,846
Hey.

712
00:33:34,506 --> 00:33:35,106
What's wrong?

713
00:33:54,256 --> 00:33:56,466
Go ahead. I'll go to sleep later.

714
00:34:04,516 --> 00:34:05,106
Jim.

715
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:10,816
I think we need to take a break.

716
00:34:22,996 --> 00:34:23,496
Hey.

717
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:24,776
What's wrong?

718
00:34:26,506 --> 00:34:28,546
Are you that shocked
because I took all of your meat?

719
00:34:34,456 --> 00:34:35,646
Chai and his wife

720
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:37,206
