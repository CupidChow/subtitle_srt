00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,480
(Bangkok 09:00 PM)
Let me drink.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,530
I love it.

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,840
(The act of infidelity, Case No.58:
Boss Ton of Bangrak)

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,140
The drink that you pour, Cherry,

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:32,900
is sweeter than ever.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,680
And it smells so good.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,580
What about mine?

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,340
Fahsai.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,060
Yours is cute.

14
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,070
He-he.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,100
It's done.

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,660
Your turn, Foei.

17
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:51,840
Go get it.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,390
What do you say?

19
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,550
My room

20
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,100
is still available.

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,880
Luck is on my side.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,230
It blacked out.

23
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,520
Honey?

24
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,680
How come you're here?

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,210
You old dog.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,910
Go die!

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,780
Go to hell.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,230
- Die!
- It hurts!

29
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,240
- Greasy old dog!
- Ow!

30
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,840
So?

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,110
Can you manage to get all the photos?

32
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,330
Have you ever seen me fail?

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,380
(The act of infidelity, Case No.58:
Boss Ton of Bangrak)

34
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,120
Sir?

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,760
(Completed)

36
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,380
Are you sure this one can be trusted?

37
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,240
You can rest assured, Ms. Pum.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,360
Noohng. Did you call for...

39
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,720
Cher.

40
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,310
This is Ms. Pum.

41
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,500
She was my boss.

42
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:48,940
Ms. Pum.

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,130
This girl

44
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,570
is who I told you about.

45
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,720
Good morning.

46
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,650
I'll let you two discuss the detail.

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,940
Please excuse me.

48
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:19,280
You have prosperous facial features.

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,210
No doubt that you're Capricorn.

50
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,490
My husband might choose you.

51
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,350
I beg your pardon.

52
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,730
Let's get to the point.

53
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,000
I want you to investigate
how many other girls my husband has.

54
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,690
And I want the full bio

55
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,720
of each one.

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,200
Send me the summary.

57
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,900
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,080
I'm not following you.

59
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,280
- Could you...
- You need to apply for that secretary job.

60
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,330
You have to get
an interview like other candidates.

61
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,030
If you don't get that job,

62
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,120
I'll compensate you.

63
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,760
But if you do,

64
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,820
you need to quit this job
and work for my husband.

65
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,340
Nope.

66
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,560
Work for me.

67
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,710
This is half of the payment,

68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,010
if you must know.

69
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,280
(Two million)

70
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,980
Noohng claimed that you're number one.

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,140
And I think you'll understand

72
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,490
how does it feel to be cheated on.

73
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,770
Those selfish people

74
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,960
take us for granted.

75
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,870
If you accept this job,

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,600
call me tomorrow.

77
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,870
The post will be opened
in the next two days.

78
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,100
I'll prepare all the paperwork for you.

79
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,690
I'm looking forward to
working together with you.

80
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,830
I have to apply for the secretary post,

81
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,950
maybe in the past,

82
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,750
you found nothing from the outside.

83
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,060
Boss.

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
=Catch Me Baby=

85
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,140
(LISA, businesswoman, Mr. Wut's first love
but they lost touch for a long time)

86
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:44,700
Yes.

87
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,230
This is Lisa.

88
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,030
She really is his type.

89
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,380
I'm not surprised

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,710
that we had been finding nothing.

91
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,860
Because he has
a secretary for his personal life,

92
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,750
managing everything for him.

93
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,330
Well done, Cher.

94
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,680
Collect every bit of information.

95
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,640
Make him suffer.

96
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,250
Make him realize

97
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,270
that the price of adultery

98
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,320
is more expensive

99
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,800
than his life.

100
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:15,660
Tan.

101
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,140
Are you done eating?

102
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,090
I have a meeting about my project.

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,310
Tan.

104
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,370
Forget something, honey?

105
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,850
Love you, Mom.

106
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,421
I read the report this morning.

107
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,950
Did you lose the project
to our competition?

108
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,810
Well, that company

109
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,470
has more connections.

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:06,900
How strange.

111
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,100
You rarely lose the project.

112
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,430
Has there been something

113
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,820
distracting you?

114
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,050
I've been swamped with work.

115
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,950
Have you really

116
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,560
been swamped

117
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:21,970
with work?

118
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,570
I almost forgot.

119
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,840
This morning,

120
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,740
Jim called me.

121
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,350
I gotta go to work now.

122
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:49,860
Love you.

123
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,170
Why don't you pick up?

124
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,740
(Foei)

125
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,130
Is it good?

126
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,400
It is.

127
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,500
Phat.

128
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,790
I have a hunch

129
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,020
that Pum has suspected something.

130
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,250
I can feel it.

131
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,530
You said the same thing last year, sir.

132
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,070
It's nothing.

133
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,040
Or else she'd show
the evidence and fire me.

134
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,960
Anyhow,

135
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,420
we'll be more careful.

136
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,480
Buy her trust,

137
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:56,270
and refrain from
jumping around for a few weeks.

138
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,760
Focus on the company.

139
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,230
About the rest,

140
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,480
I'll take care of it.

141
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:07,950
Another thing,

142
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,710
I suspect a mole.

143
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,740
A mole?

144
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,310
But don't be alarmed.

145
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,060
Because I've

146
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,260
never lost.

147
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,840
Checkmate.

148
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,490
The Black Pearl concert VVIP ticket.

149
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,280
(Cher)

150
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,660
If you want the employee's info,

151
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,920
you better get it from HR.

152
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,710
Hey.

153
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,360
If I only want the employee's biography,

154
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,570
why would I come to you?

155
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,940
Next time, just say you want inside info.

156
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,250
Throw it out for me, please.

157
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,850
(M01: Te, teacher)

158
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:25,800
This time

159
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,550
where will Mr. Wut be?

160
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:28,880
China.

161
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,550
These are apology gifts from Mr. Wut.

162
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,560
If you want something,
you can leave it to me.

163
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,590
Sure.

164
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,760
Send my thanks to Mr. Wut.

165
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,970
Of course.

166
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,220
(M02: Ann, stewardess)
Thank you, Phat.

167
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,140
Sure.

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,160
(M03: Eve, salaried employee)

(M05: Soo-hyun, college student)

171
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,960
Thank you, Phat.

172
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,860
Sure.

173
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,010
What's up, Jeon?

174
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,020
About what you asked,

175
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,640
there's nothing fishy.

176
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,930
Good background.

177
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,380
Law degree,

178
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,180
good grades, clean digital footprint.

179
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,250
Law degree?

180
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,170
And her email was never used

181
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,100
for porn sites or dating apps.

182
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,720
Not even dramatic posts.

183
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:21,710
Wait.

184
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,090
Are you doing this because
you're trying to approach her?

185
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, I am. Bye now.

186
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,850
I give up.

187
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,100
For tonight,

188
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:42,580
three is my limit.

189
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,900
I want my boys to be strong.

190
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,440
- Hey!
- Huh?

191
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,990
What, Jim?

192
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,900
This is my welcoming party.

193
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,160
But you're gonna limit yourself?

194
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,660
Let me take a sip.

195
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,090
- See?
- You may not.

196
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,060
Bottoms up!

197
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,680
But my boys can be short-tailed.

198
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,350
- They need to be strong.
- What?

199
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,090
Let's party with the side dish.
Here, a peanut.

200
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:04,290
What the heck?

201
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,460
Sorry.

202
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,340
Mr. Wut's call.

203
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,740
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

204
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,250
Hey.

205
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,280
Huh?

206
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,510
Let's play Tell the Truth.

207
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,490
Who doesn't tell,

208
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,340
bottoms up.

209
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,790
Do you often use this trick

210
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,220
to get girls drunk?

211
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,520
Only girls I have my eye on.

212
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,960
I go first.

213
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,150
Hey, wait.

214
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,350
What?

215
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,430
I haven't agreed with that.

216
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,620
Are you afraid?

217
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:47,850
Shoot.

218
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,960
Which sex you had
impressed you the most?

219
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,650
And also where?

220
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,390
Is it the hazing ritual?

221
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:55,930
Is it

222
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,650
sexual harassment?

223
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,420
If you won't tell,

224
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,130
drink.

225
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:05,700
None.

226
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,660
Hey.

227
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,940
This game is called Tell the Truth.

228
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,950
What is none?

229
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,850
Just say it.

230
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,180
My answer is none.

231
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,940
My turn now!

232
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,510
Same question.

233
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,230
It must be...

234
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:24,040
my third time, I guess.

235
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,240
In a car.

236
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,800
You remind me,

237
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,750
don't get in your car.

238
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,810
Not my car.

239
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,450
A girl's car.

240
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,690
My turn.

241
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,870
Have you ever cheated on someone?

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,370
I haven't.

243
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,040
My turn.

244
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,770
Your juggling work for Mr. Wut,

245
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,220
which one is the hardest?

246
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,050
I must say Soo-hyun,

247
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,900
and Ann,

248
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,830
the stewardess.

249
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,580
Why?

250
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,520
Do not cheat, it's my turn.

251
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,010
When you catch your boyfriend cheating,

252
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,810
will you slap him or cut ties?

253
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,390
I won't do either of those.

254
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,130
I'll ghost him,

255
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,850
no way to be found.

256
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:23,910
And you?

257
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,510
I'll cheat on her to get even.

258
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:28,870
Horrible.

259
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,080
What I want to say is,

260
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll set the rule.

261
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,410
But in the end,

262
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,880
it depends on

263
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,870
the girl I date.

264
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,560
If you'll set this rule,

265
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,520
why bother to begin the relationship?

266
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,170
There are different types of love.

267
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,690
Love is love.

268
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,940
It's just that the type of person
being loved is different.

269
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,860
Are they self-serving?

270
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,840
Or

271
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,080
a scumbag

272
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,100
who uses love

273
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,510
for self benefits.

274
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,750
Sorry.

275
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:03,610
My turn.

276
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,510
Have you ever

277
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,310
failed

278
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,400
at your juggling for Mr. Wut?

279
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,250
And

280
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,350
why?

281
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:16,810
I have. Because...

282
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,340
I took half of the glass.

283
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,270
I gave half the answer.

284
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,710
What's with you?

285
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,690
Either tell the truth or drink.

286
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,270
Set your own rule,

287
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,440
can you do that?

288
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:36,020
You have a law degree.

289
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,940
Why did you choose to be a secretary?

290
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,200
And why are you working
as the secretary,

291
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,930
but moonlighting as
a relationship juggler?

292
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,210
We have the same answer.

293
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,400
Wait.

294
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,280
How do you know we have the same answer?

295
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,680
So let's say it together.

296
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:58,150
- It's the money.
- It's the money.

297
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,350
By the way,

298
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:10,150
this is the first time

299
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,200
I see you laugh this hard.

300
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,690
I'm a human being.

301
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,820
But...

302
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,200
Honestly,

303
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,770
how did you know

304
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,320
I'd have the same answer?

305
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,750
I didn't.

306
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,010
Even we didn't have the same answer,

307
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,350
it's okay, isn't it?

308
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,500
I was just scaring you.

309
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:37,980
Cher.

310
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,360
Can I think of you more than a friend?

311
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,210
Is this

312
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,010
part of the game?

313
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,990
Half of the glass,

314
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,490
can it be my answer?

315
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,120
Hey, Phat.

316
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,020
Mr. Wut has an urgent job tomorrow.

317
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,250
You should come with me.

318
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:39,900
Sure.

319
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,180
Your ice is melting,

320
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,930
put some more.

321
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:48,070
I've got enough, Jim.

322
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,720
Just a little bit more, Cher.

323
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,960
You too.

324
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,610
Nothing better than ice cold drinks.

325
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,570
Here we go.

326
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,200
Let's have a toast.

327
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:59,630
To our new young and pretty employee.

328
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,070
Hello, Ms. Pum.

329
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,780
Talk to me.

330
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,760
I think a secretary of his

331
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,500
totally fell into my trap,

332
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,340
because he tries to woo me.

333
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,680
You're talking about Phat?

334
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,440
Interesting.

335
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,460
What should I do?

336
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,780
Follow Plan D's instruction.

337
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,570
Make yourself disappear for a while.

338
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,830
So Mr. Wut and his secretaries

339
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,220
will get relaxed.

340
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,880
And he will go play around as he likes.

341
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,000
Will your friend send you the file soon?

342
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,090
Do it or don't. We're waiting.

343
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,390
- Just give up.
- I don't want to wait anymore.

344
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,370
- I won't miss my presentation for you.
- Hey, relax, guys.

345
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:00,390
It's worth the wait.

346
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,570
Are you pranking me, Foei?

347
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,060
(Files sent
Taking a personal leave today)

348
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,050
Darn you!

349
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,990
Foei, you jerk.

350
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,190
I got the file, Professor.

351
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:19,710
I'll do the presentation.

352
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,920
Guys!

353
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:27,810
For this project,

354
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,140
my team and I

355
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,750
have been saying

356
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,090
this project will be great.

357
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,480
And I hope...

358
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,060
(- Hey, bee!
- What?)

359
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,100
(Be my girlfriend please.)
(*Homophonic puns)

360
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:36,930
Hey!

361
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,830
What?

362
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,070
Behind you, Tan.

363
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,730
- Oh, my God.
- Look at those.

364
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,600
- Flirting messages?
- There are plenty.

365
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,710
Not the same girl?

366
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,910
(You just occupied 4 chambers of my heart)
I can't believe it.

367
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,580
I thought he went after Star.

368
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,340
You're two-timing Star?

369
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,600
Darn you, Foei!

370
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,890
What about Star?

371
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,320
- Hey.
- Listen.

372
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,170
Those chats aren't mine.

373
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,060
- Nope.
- Really?

374
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,280
- I'm sure it's yours.
- Star...

375
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,750
Those aren't mine.

376
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,140
They are Foei's.

377
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,970
You all know it, right?

378
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:06,450
Foei has it in for me.

379
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,160
It's definitely yours.

380
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,500
I don't believe you.

381
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,280
Don't! Don't take photos. Stop!

382
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,530
What are you doing?

383
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,490
It's not me.

384
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,760
Foei set me up.

385
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,350
A juggling job?

386
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:21,760
Yes.

387
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,280
I'm dating three guys,

388
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:26,040
I can't make up my mind

389
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,550
on who to choose.

390
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,400
But those three want to come to
the grand opening ceremony, same day,

391
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:35,190
same location. Am I right?

392
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,250
Yes.

393
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,900
They are not in the same town,

394
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,990
but they insist to fly here
for the event.

395
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,800
Is it hard for you?

396
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,540
=Catch Me Baby=

397
00:20:04,898 --> 00:20:07,548
=Catch Me Baby=

398
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:09,408
(Tongla, big shot businessman)
First boyfriend, Tongla,

399
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,678
a quiet type of guy.

400
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:12,078
The owner of resorts in Rachaburi.

401
00:20:12,388 --> 00:20:13,318
Second boyfriend,

402
00:20:13,468 --> 00:20:15,548
(Egg, youngblood lawyer)
Egg, the fun lawyer from Hat Yai,

403
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:16,388
doing a fanpage,

404
00:20:16,388 --> 00:20:17,428
"Stress Relief Law".

405
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:18,838
And the last one,

406
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:21,088
(Doctor Yong, promising doctor)
Doctor Yong, one of the "Hot Doctors",

407
00:20:21,368 --> 00:20:22,798
a promising doctor from Chiang Mai.

408
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:24,468
Tongla and Egg

409
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:25,798
will show up at the regular time,

410
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:27,338
which you, Pinky and Jim...

411
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:28,728
Who's it?

412
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:29,688
Dunno.

413
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:31,348
Are you expecting someone?

414
00:20:34,678 --> 00:20:35,618
Excuse me.

415
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,458
Jim needs to sign this document,

416
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:39,568
so I brought it here.

417
00:20:39,568 --> 00:20:40,018
Hey.

418
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:41,788
- This room is for...
- Phat.

419
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:42,668
It's okay.

420
00:20:42,828 --> 00:20:44,478
I told her to bring it here.

421
00:20:50,068 --> 00:20:51,498
Oh, I'm sorry.

422
00:20:51,578 --> 00:20:54,178
Is this a juggling job for Mr. Wut?

423
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:55,478
I can give you a hand.

424
00:20:56,078 --> 00:20:56,538
No.

425
00:20:57,098 --> 00:20:59,008
We're talking about an event
for one of Mr. Wut's relatives.

426
00:21:00,078 --> 00:21:02,868
Okay, so I can be in the meeting then.

427
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:03,478
Right?

428
00:21:07,128 --> 00:21:09,378
Whoa! Jim.

429
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:12,398
This room hasn't been cleaned lately?

430
00:21:12,488 --> 00:21:13,788
It's so dusty.

431
00:21:14,258 --> 00:21:15,038
Yes, so dusty.

432
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:18,318
You better leave the room, Cher.

433
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:20,148
I'll sign this document later.
Don't worry.

434
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:20,458
Okay.

435
00:21:26,228 --> 00:21:27,348
Oh, right. I...

436
00:21:36,038 --> 00:21:37,628
- It really is dusty.
- Sorry, man.

437
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:39,938
"It's so dusty".

438
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,078
- Hey!
- That's enough.

439
00:21:43,528 --> 00:21:44,738
Let's continue with our plan.

440
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:46,378
The three of us

441
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,618
will rotate and follow
these three closely.

442
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:49,678
You two

443
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:50,688
are ready?

444
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:52,248
- Yes.
- Yes.

445
00:21:55,518 --> 00:21:58,368
Thank you very much
for coming to my opening event.

446
00:21:58,708 --> 00:21:59,568
It's okay, Moei.

447
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:01,838
It's your most important day...

448
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:02,878
Egg the lawyer is with Ms. Moei.

449
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:03,568
I can't miss it.

450
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,668
Tongla's coming.

451
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:05,938
Pinky, you're with Tongla.

452
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:06,968
Roger that.

453
00:22:09,558 --> 00:22:10,218
Uh...

454
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:11,898
Excuse me.

455
00:22:12,398 --> 00:22:13,798
Are you Mr. Tongla?

456
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:14,218
Yes, I am.

457
00:22:15,078 --> 00:22:16,548
You're really him!

458
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:18,568
I'm following your page.

459
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,498
I've watched "Make a Wish with SME."

460
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:21,368
Let me tell you this.

461
00:22:21,458 --> 00:22:24,028
I love your hotel business concept.

462
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:25,868
My dad's going to

463
00:22:25,868 --> 00:22:27,178
open a resort.

464
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:28,478
Egg's walking towards the buffet.

465
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,588
Let Tongla go.

466
00:22:30,328 --> 00:22:31,058
Roger that!

467
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:31,768
What are you saying?

468
00:22:33,358 --> 00:22:34,008
I mean...

469
00:22:34,158 --> 00:22:36,298
I need to take this call.

470
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,468
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

471
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:39,688
Hello, what's up?

472
00:22:42,538 --> 00:22:43,538
Tongla.

473
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,708
Hi.

474
00:22:44,708 --> 00:22:45,748
How long have you been here?

475
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:46,058
Not long.

476
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:47,408
I'm so glad.

477
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,508
- She's with Tongla now.
- I'm fine...

478
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:50,868
- Jim, go.
- Thank you.

479
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:56,798
Excuse me.

480
00:22:57,588 --> 00:23:00,298
Are you Mr. Egg
from "Stress Relief Law?"

481
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:01,308
Yes, I am.

482
00:23:01,308 --> 00:23:02,548
What a coincidence.

483
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,988
I just want to ask you
about that case on your page,

484
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:06,268
the uncle who shot a teenager.

485
00:23:06,638 --> 00:23:09,728
It was self-defense, but
why did the judge come up with this?

486
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:12,538
The engineering guy's case?

487
00:23:12,678 --> 00:23:13,568
Yes, it is.

488
00:23:14,258 --> 00:23:15,218
Why is it?

489
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:17,458
Shoot!

490
00:23:17,658 --> 00:23:18,638
Doctor Yong is early.

491
00:23:20,468 --> 00:23:24,958
(Doctor Yong)

492
00:23:25,968 --> 00:23:28,228
I'm so glad. It's been a long time.

493
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:33,928
My treat.

494
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:36,908
Be my guest.

495
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,348
This is my restaurant.

496
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:40,348
You have flown all over here.

497
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:47,728
Excuse me.

498
00:23:48,348 --> 00:23:48,718
Yes.

499
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:49,708
Are you...

500
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:50,908
Peng?

501
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:51,938
No, I'm Yong.

502
00:23:52,728 --> 00:23:53,618
You got the wrong guy.

503
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,758
Doctor Yong?

504
00:23:57,218 --> 00:23:59,218
I was your patient, Doctor.

505
00:23:59,308 --> 00:24:00,368
Do you remember me?

506
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:01,788
Oh, I do.

507
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:03,788
I'm happy to run into you.

508
00:24:04,348 --> 00:24:05,988
I'd like to thank you all,

509
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,318
my important friends,

510
00:24:08,828 --> 00:24:10,218
who have been supporting

511
00:24:10,418 --> 00:24:11,458
and encouraging me,

512
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,778
so that I can open this restaurant.

513
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:17,428
I hope you enjoy eating our food.

514
00:24:17,828 --> 00:24:19,628
What are you doing?

515
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:21,078
How come you're here?

516
00:24:21,158 --> 00:24:22,238
And how come you know about this?

517
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:26,048
Jim wanted me to help
with the law aspect.

518
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,448
I actually still have no idea.

519
00:24:29,298 --> 00:24:30,628
But I did help you out.

520
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:32,918
Jim.

521
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:35,098
Explain to me at once.

522
00:24:41,508 --> 00:24:42,348
At all costs,

523
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:43,538
you needed to alert me

524
00:24:43,628 --> 00:24:44,628
before letting the outsider...

525
00:24:47,368 --> 00:24:48,508
working with us.

526
00:24:52,258 --> 00:24:55,038
Jim invited you here
for emergent law consultation.

527
00:24:55,408 --> 00:24:57,778
But he just spilled all of our plans.
Am I right?

528
00:24:59,288 --> 00:24:59,878
Why?

529
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:00,868
Are you a policeman?

530
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:03,188
What if you're a mole?

531
00:25:03,588 --> 00:25:04,578
Come on.

532
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:06,178
If I were a mole,

533
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:08,338
your cover would be
blown up since the resort.

534
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:12,408
You're right.

535
00:25:13,668 --> 00:25:14,228
Okay.

536
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:16,078
I give you my trust,

537
00:25:17,778 --> 00:25:18,488
half trust.

538
00:25:20,688 --> 00:25:21,318
Well,

539
00:25:21,528 --> 00:25:22,828
what is the next plan?

540
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:27,498
Ms. Moei might have finished
her speech by now.

541
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:29,178
Pinky's staying with Tongla.

542
00:25:29,268 --> 00:25:30,728
Jim's still with Egg.

543
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:32,008
And Doctor Yong...

544
00:25:34,598 --> 00:25:35,778
I need to be with him!

545
00:25:37,198 --> 00:25:38,338
Hey, wait.

546
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:39,718
Wait up.

547
00:25:58,698 --> 00:25:59,608
Fudge!

548
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:00,958
He's going to propose.

549
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,358
It's gonna grab all the attention.

550
00:26:05,488 --> 00:26:06,518
What's going on?

551
00:26:15,058 --> 00:26:15,708
Moei.

552
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,068
Yong.

553
00:26:20,138 --> 00:26:21,068
My dear Moei.

554
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:23,948
Will you...

555
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:25,118
Marry me?

556
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:33,428
What the heck are you doing?

557
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:34,878
Just go with it.

558
00:26:35,408 --> 00:26:35,998
Come on.

559
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:37,368
Uh...

560
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,078
I will.

561
00:26:50,858 --> 00:26:51,978
Come on.

562
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:04,738
Check him.

563
00:27:05,508 --> 00:27:06,358
Does he change his mind?

564
00:27:06,548 --> 00:27:07,658
We've stolen his moment.

565
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:09,758
Uh, just check it yourself.

566
00:27:12,788 --> 00:27:13,328
Moei.

567
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:15,978
Yes, Yong.

568
00:27:16,858 --> 00:27:17,508
Hey...

569
00:27:18,098 --> 00:27:19,318
Why would you want it this bad?

570
00:27:20,358 --> 00:27:21,018
I...

571
00:27:24,078 --> 00:27:24,988
What to do?

572
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:31,998
I'd like...

573
00:27:36,038 --> 00:27:37,288
Help! A girl's fainting.

574
00:27:37,728 --> 00:27:38,218
Hey!

575
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:40,918
Please help. Someone just fainted.

576
00:27:40,918 --> 00:27:41,498
Moei.

577
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:43,618
- I'd like you to mar...
- Please check on her.

578
00:27:43,688 --> 00:27:46,138
- Will you marry...
- You're a doctor. She needs your help.

579
00:27:46,258 --> 00:27:47,158
Oh, okay.

580
00:27:49,098 --> 00:27:50,418
Maybe she's sick.

581
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:57,058
Excuse me.

582
00:27:57,128 --> 00:27:58,078
I'm a doctor.

583
00:27:58,788 --> 00:27:59,508
How are you, miss?

584
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,068
Oh, my, Pink!

585
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,868
Did you really faint
because Phat proposed to Cher?

586
00:28:12,578 --> 00:28:13,468
Jim.

587
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:15,018
Stop teasing her.

588
00:28:15,118 --> 00:28:16,488
She's crying.

589
00:28:16,548 --> 00:28:17,478
- Come on.
- Pink.

590
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:18,688
It was part of the plan.

591
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,478
If I really want to marry someone,

592
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,408
you'll be the first to know.

593
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:25,058
Who would have known?

594
00:28:25,218 --> 00:28:28,468
I thought that proposal was for real.

595
00:28:30,738 --> 00:28:32,368
Don't cry.

596
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:34,328
Comfort her, Phat.

597
00:28:35,758 --> 00:28:37,098
- Come on.
- Darn.

598
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:38,138
- Stop.
- Don't push your luck.

599
00:28:38,268 --> 00:28:39,258
Just sit tight.

600
00:28:44,358 --> 00:28:45,478
Luckily,

601
00:28:45,648 --> 00:28:46,918
Jim and Pinky

602
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,148
can carpool.

603
00:28:48,148 --> 00:28:50,368
So Pink will get comfort on the way.

604
00:28:50,908 --> 00:28:51,568
True dat!

605
00:28:51,848 --> 00:28:53,438
She may look tough,

606
00:28:53,568 --> 00:28:55,098
but she's actually delicate.

607
00:28:55,218 --> 00:28:56,248
Really?

608
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:59,098
Your sister is so funny.

609
00:28:59,668 --> 00:29:02,858
The mission was completed due to Pinky.

610
00:29:03,118 --> 00:29:05,738
She ruined Doctor's Yong proposal.

611
00:29:06,488 --> 00:29:07,268
True dat again!

612
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:11,938
Hey.

613
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:13,908
Can you trust me now?

614
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:18,228
It depends on your behavior,

615
00:29:18,828 --> 00:29:20,828
when I can trust you.

616
00:29:22,578 --> 00:29:23,638
What?

617
00:29:23,638 --> 00:29:25,178
I went this far for you.

618
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:26,338
Like Ms. Moei,

619
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,788
she takes time to consider

620
00:29:28,918 --> 00:29:30,758
before giving her trust to just one guy.

621
00:29:31,198 --> 00:29:33,428
She needs the best option for her life.

622
00:29:33,998 --> 00:29:34,798
So do I.

623
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:47,988
So...

624
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,138
I'll leave you here.

625
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:57,898
You know?

626
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:00,768
If those three find out

627
00:30:00,888 --> 00:30:02,188
that Ms. Moei dates multiples guys,

628
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:03,528
will they be sad?

629
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,568
I tell you one thing.

630
00:30:07,678 --> 00:30:09,628
Those three already know

631
00:30:09,938 --> 00:30:11,258
that Ms. Moei dates multiples guys.

632
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:13,678
For real?

633
00:30:15,358 --> 00:30:16,988
But they don't know each other.

634
00:30:17,328 --> 00:30:19,598
That's why Doctor Yong

635
00:30:19,598 --> 00:30:21,158
wanted to propose.

636
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:22,908
So that he will be the last choice.

637
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:24,528
But it's just my guess.

638
00:30:32,008 --> 00:30:32,658
See you.

639
00:30:35,948 --> 00:30:36,448
Bye.

640
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:49,228
This one

641
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:50,748
was the test for social subject,

642
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:52,228
from 2015.

643
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:53,838
Give it a try.

644
00:30:54,768 --> 00:30:55,698
Mock test again?

645
00:30:57,848 --> 00:30:58,528
But okay.

646
00:30:58,668 --> 00:31:01,468
Because you're so cute.

647
00:31:03,698 --> 00:31:04,448
This page?

648
00:31:04,578 --> 00:31:05,318
Yes.

649
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:07,358
Over here.

650
00:31:08,028 --> 00:31:08,868
I emphasized it for you.

651
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:09,958
Foei.

652
00:31:10,998 --> 00:31:11,808
I want to know something.

653
00:31:12,568 --> 00:31:13,888
Is there anyone approaching you?

654
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:17,158
Why?

655
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:20,668
I look like someone
who's got no girl approaching?

656
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:22,058
I didn't mean that.

657
00:31:22,148 --> 00:31:23,268
I mean...

658
00:31:23,638 --> 00:31:24,268
Some boy?

659
00:31:27,158 --> 00:31:28,478
Boy?

660
00:31:29,698 --> 00:31:30,588
You're talking nonsense.

661
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:31,548
Do the test.

662
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:32,788
You're being silly.

663
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:33,608
Foei.

664
00:31:34,298 --> 00:31:35,198
Stand up.

665
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:37,418
Come on.

666
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:38,788
What?

667
00:31:40,328 --> 00:31:41,068
Excuse me.

668
00:31:43,018 --> 00:31:43,878
What's up, man?

669
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:45,598
Do you know

670
00:31:45,888 --> 00:31:46,958
what you've done?

671
00:31:48,148 --> 00:31:49,518
Star won't talk to me now.

672
00:31:51,568 --> 00:31:52,658
Because you really are a jerk.

673
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,988
You've been doing nothing

674
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,928
but following girls.

675
00:31:57,428 --> 00:31:58,348
Served you right.

676
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:00,228
Now she knows

677
00:32:00,368 --> 00:32:01,608
the real you.

678
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:02,708
Darn you.

679
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,848
Are you jealous of me?

680
00:32:05,718 --> 00:32:07,048
Star's closer to me than to you.

681
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:09,338
Jealous?

682
00:32:09,878 --> 00:32:11,168
Are you high, Tan?

683
00:32:12,638 --> 00:32:13,818
Let me enlighten you.

684
00:32:14,088 --> 00:32:15,638
You'll never be with Star.

685
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:17,928
How are you so sure?

686
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,518
Because she'll be my girlfriend.

687
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:24,028
Your girlfriend?

688
00:32:25,218 --> 00:32:26,108
Let's wager.

689
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:27,968
This year at Loy Krathong Festival,

690
00:32:28,728 --> 00:32:29,678
we'll see the outcome

691
00:32:30,218 --> 00:32:31,318
of who will she choose to be with.

692
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:34,658
Between you and me.

693
00:32:35,758 --> 00:32:36,568
Do you dare?

694
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:38,778
Let's do it.

695
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:42,218
You're done here?

696
00:32:47,408 --> 00:32:48,108
How is the test going?

697
00:32:51,898 --> 00:32:52,998
Still on the first page.

698
00:32:54,298 --> 00:32:56,738
I can't believe it!

699
00:32:56,968 --> 00:32:58,008
What to do?

700
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,858
It's always like this.

701
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:02,378
My head's spinning.

702
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:03,188
Jim.

703
00:33:04,288 --> 00:33:05,348
What's wrong?

704
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,868
Can I trust you, Cher?

705
00:33:14,998 --> 00:33:16,818
Yes, of course.

706
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:18,978
Although,

707
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:21,338
Phat doesn't give me 100% trust.

708
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:24,408
Okay.

709
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:27,988
After I tell you this,

710
00:33:28,328 --> 00:33:30,338
don't tell a soul.

711
00:33:30,498 --> 00:33:31,158
I won't.

712
00:33:31,158 --> 00:33:31,858
You sure?

713
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:34,828
Phat just told me

714
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,838
that Mr. Wut has a new girl.

715
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:39,368
One more girl?

716
00:33:39,638 --> 00:33:41,098
Keep it down, will you?

717
00:33:41,098 --> 00:33:42,118
He has one more girl?

718
00:33:42,118 --> 00:33:42,998
Yes, he does.

719
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,538
Right now,

720
00:33:44,538 --> 00:33:46,168
Phat is standing by at the scene.

721
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:49,618
Well...

722
00:33:50,108 --> 00:33:51,018
Where is it?

723
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:56,408
The regular cafe.

724
00:33:57,278 --> 00:33:58,618
Don't let this info get out.

725
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:01,018
Seal your lips.

726
00:34:02,438 --> 00:34:03,118
Shoot!

727
00:34:03,118 --> 00:34:04,078
I'm stressed out now.

728
00:34:09,778 --> 00:34:10,768
Want some more bites?

729
00:34:11,088 --> 00:34:12,008
- Yes.
- Have you tried this?

730
00:34:16,018 --> 00:34:17,888
It tastes better when you feed me.

731
00:34:18,768 --> 00:34:19,958
Does it?

732
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,398
We look so real, Jim.

733
00:34:21,438 --> 00:34:22,378
Is it working?

734
00:34:22,738 --> 00:34:24,088
I don't want you to get fat, Pinky.

735
00:34:27,118 --> 00:34:28,098
I saw this coming.

736
00:34:28,778 --> 00:34:30,168
I should have...

737
00:34:30,388 --> 00:34:30,968
never...

738
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:32,158
trusted you.

739
00:34:36,298 --> 00:34:38,518
Jeon-jeon's been contacting Madame Pum.

740
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,138
She's the mole.

741
00:34:44,928 --> 00:34:45,828
Do you have something to say?

742
00:34:47,568 --> 00:34:48,438
No, sir.

743
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,268
I'm working with Ms. Pum for so long.

744
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:51,348
I won't betray her.

745
00:34:51,348 --> 00:34:53,778
But you have betrayed me, spied on me.

746
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:55,908
I love Pum.

747
00:34:56,218 --> 00:34:57,458
I've never betrayed her.

748
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,268
I've never had an affair.

749
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:06,348
I can't trust an employee
who betrayed her boss.

750
00:35:07,328 --> 00:35:07,978
Ms. Jeon.

751
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,908
I'll transfer you to one of our branches.

752
00:35:12,058 --> 00:35:14,948
But you need to tell Pum
that you volunteered to do this.

753
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:16,238
I won't sue you.

754
00:35:18,248 --> 00:35:19,058
Pack your things.

755
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,148
Thank you, Mr. Wut.

756
00:35:30,978 --> 00:35:31,858
I deleted everything.

757
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,248
Before you leave,

758
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:36,358
may I ask you this?

759
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:40,358
How did you know we were at that cafe?

760
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,198
People who knew about this

761
00:35:42,578 --> 00:35:43,458
were me,

762
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:45,008
Jim,

763
00:35:45,408 --> 00:35:46,388
and Cher...

764
00:35:58,738 --> 00:36:00,728
I've bugged Cher's desk.

765
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:02,648
That's why I know.

766
00:36:07,888 --> 00:36:08,768
Can I take my leave?

767
00:36:18,258 --> 00:36:19,268
So from the beginning,

768
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:21,538
you all were tricking me?

769
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:23,168
You thought I was a mole?

770
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:25,978
Really?

771
00:36:26,098 --> 00:36:27,788
You will woo Cher?

772
00:36:28,388 --> 00:36:30,048
I suspect she's a mole.

773
00:36:30,348 --> 00:36:31,678
So I pretend to get close to her

774
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:33,098
to win her trust.

775
00:36:33,878 --> 00:36:34,768
But meanwhile,

776
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:36,848
I want you to act,

777
00:36:37,188 --> 00:36:38,368
leaking the information.

778
00:36:38,558 --> 00:36:40,008
And from that leak,

779
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:41,588
we'll know who's the mole.

780
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:44,708
Okay.

781
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:46,668
I'm sorry.

782
00:36:47,318 --> 00:36:49,868
I've never thought that
Jeon-jeon was a mole.

783
00:36:51,308 --> 00:36:52,748
So, for Ms. Moei's event,

784
00:36:52,748 --> 00:36:55,178
you gave me the misleading info, right?

785
00:36:56,438 --> 00:36:56,908
Yes.

786
00:36:57,498 --> 00:36:58,608
It was part of the plan.

787
00:36:59,298 --> 00:37:00,158
I'm sorry.

788
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:01,658
Sorry.

789
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:04,108
So your flirting was also a plan.

790
00:37:10,838 --> 00:37:11,438
Half.

791
00:37:15,798 --> 00:37:16,758
What?

792
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:19,038
I don't know about this bit.

793
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,008
Come on, let's eat.

794
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:24,468
What is it?

795
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:28,198
What?

796
00:37:28,778 --> 00:37:29,768
What the heck?

797
00:37:30,298 --> 00:37:31,078
Cher.

798
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:32,558
Give me your hand.

799
00:37:41,378 --> 00:37:43,438
Are all kids from drama school like this?

800
00:37:44,668 --> 00:37:46,318
I took the ring out of your finger.

801
00:37:46,318 --> 00:37:47,698
So your engagement

802
00:37:48,108 --> 00:37:49,118
is canceled.

803
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:52,298
Whoa.

804
00:37:52,678 --> 00:37:54,468
What? There's a pouch?

805
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:00,988
Sign this!

806
00:38:04,458 --> 00:38:05,268
What is it?

807
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:06,788
A divorce agreement.

808
00:38:11,718 --> 00:38:12,938
Okay. I'll sign.

809
00:38:13,488 --> 00:38:15,328
This is the method of acting!

810
00:38:15,458 --> 00:38:17,318
You fully commit to the story, don't you?

811
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:20,198
It's so extreme.

812
00:38:21,598 --> 00:38:22,598
You too, Phat.

813
00:38:22,838 --> 00:38:23,598
Sign this.

814
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:25,268
Really?

815
00:38:27,738 --> 00:38:28,448
No, I won't.

816
00:38:29,788 --> 00:38:30,788
Do it.

817
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:32,458
I told you no.

818
00:38:32,648 --> 00:38:34,818
After you both sign this,

819
00:38:34,818 --> 00:38:37,278
everything that happened will be annulled.

820
00:38:37,438 --> 00:38:38,198
Come on.

821
00:38:38,198 --> 00:38:39,958
I have a commercial gig to do.

822
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:41,788
So go! I told you no.

823
00:38:42,188 --> 00:38:43,888
- Come on.
- I won't.

824
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:44,928
Wait.

825
00:38:45,218 --> 00:38:48,648
You sneaked out
of the set for something like this?

826
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:49,688
Are you insane?

827
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,368
She's working so hard.

828
00:38:52,368 --> 00:38:53,478
She's about to knock out at any second.

829
00:38:54,078 --> 00:38:54,978
Get back to your work.

830
00:38:55,548 --> 00:38:57,748
No, don't get back to work,
get back to the asylum.

831
00:38:58,138 --> 00:38:59,138
What's with you?

832
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:15,508
Hey!

833
00:39:18,468 --> 00:39:19,058
It's your home.

834
00:39:32,908 --> 00:39:34,258
Thank you

835
00:39:34,518 --> 00:39:35,548
for the ride.

836
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:44,208
I'm sorry

837
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:46,108
for...

838
00:39:46,978 --> 00:39:48,418
not trusting you.

839
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,018
It's okay. Don't worry.

840
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:56,548
If I were you,

841
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:58,168
I'd do the same.

842
00:40:00,788 --> 00:40:01,458
I'm off.

843
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,588
Bye.

844
00:40:40,598 --> 00:40:41,858
Hello, Ms. Pum.

845
00:40:42,548 --> 00:40:43,198
Talk.

846
00:40:44,638 --> 00:40:46,978
Everything is going as our plan.

847
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:48,618
They all trust me.

848
00:40:50,538 --> 00:40:52,088
You're really an expert.

849
00:40:53,198 --> 00:40:55,228
But someone is better than me.

850
00:40:55,988 --> 00:40:57,118
It's you, Ms. Pum.

851
00:40:57,738 --> 00:41:00,608
You sacrificed Jeon-jeon,
one of your spies.

852
00:41:03,438 --> 00:41:04,148
Hi, Jeon.

853
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:05,698
Listen carefully.

854
00:41:06,568 --> 00:41:08,228
I need your help.

855
00:41:09,788 --> 00:41:11,998
It will change the whole game.

856
00:41:12,478 --> 00:41:13,758
If you can do that,

857
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:18,448
I will be the one who takes the last move.
