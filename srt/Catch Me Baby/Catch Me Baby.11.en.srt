5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:28,840
I was wrong.

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,890
Come down, Jim.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,700
Fah chose you, Jim.

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:44,640
Please come down.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,620
Give me a chance to explain everything.

10
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,670
Please.

11
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,620
Darn you!

12
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,140
Why the heck did you lie to me, Phat?

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,320
I don't believe you.

14
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:04,140
Not just you.

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,250
I'll believe no one!

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,260
Don't do it!

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,330
Jim.

18
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,090
Let's get back together, please.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,660
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,160
Don't leave me.

21
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,940
How could I live without you?

22
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,620
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,380
I...

24
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,030
Sorry.

25
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,580
It was my fault, Fah.

26
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,190
It was my fault.

27
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,780
=Catch Me Baby=

28
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,780
(Ton of Khae Rai
What about our juggling job, Phat?)

29
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,770
What the heck are you doing?

30
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,100
Are you preparing to bury yourself?

31
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,410
Oh, man. What is it?

32
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,640
How can you live like that?

33
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,130
Darn!

34
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,030
I'm sorry.

35
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,960
I thought it was Pink.

36
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,120
It's kind of messy.

37
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,340
I noticed.

38
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,750
Speaking of Pink, she told me
you've disappeared for a week.

39
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,610
She's this close
to cutting ties with you.

40
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,450
I know

41
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,700
you still feel guilty

42
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,270
to me.

43
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,830
Let's be honest.

44
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,920
I have the same feelings as you do.

45
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,570
Everyone was in trouble

46
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,190
because of me.

47
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,180
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,750
It was my fault.

49
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:25,080
Again?

50
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,670
You've said sorry a hundred times,
I guess.

51
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,970
Enough! I'm okay now.

52
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,500
But look at you now.

53
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,160
You look worse than me.

54
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,330
Phat.

55
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,000
You know?

56
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,590
The moment I prepared to leave,

57
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:55,620
I felt like

58
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,180
my old self was dead.

59
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,380
When I woke up the next day,

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,620
my head was clear,

61
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,020
and I felt like I was freaking reborn.

62
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,330
The vision I've never had

63
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,990
suddenly appeared.

64
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,220
The thing

65
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,390
I've never got a grasp of

66
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,000
suddenly touched me.

67
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,290
- Honey.
- Huh?

68
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,950
Are you happy?

69
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,680
I am.

70
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,860
Why did you ask me that?

71
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,540
I want you to be happy.

72
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,180
Do you remember

73
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,640
what I said

74
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,830
when I proposed to you?

75
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,430
"I want you to be the happiest girl."

76
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,810
My mom's soup that you had to make

77
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,700
was really good.

78
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:38,090
But you must be very tired.

79
00:07:58,910 --> 00:07:59,660
I'm sorry.

80
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,210
I couldn't keep that promise.

81
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,230
I left you to deal with problems alone.

82
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,160
I am such a loser.

83
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,740
No, you're not.

84
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,610
It was me.

85
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,720
I couldn't be happy with you.

86
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,130
I'm the one who ruined it.

87
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,260
The more I love you,

88
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,040
the more I realize

89
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,090
that I need to let you go.

90
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,620
Let you be happy,

91
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,820
as I promised you.

92
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,580
Fah and I are separated.

93
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,270
I know

94
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,750
that you wanted to help people

95
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,140
as you always do, Phat.

96
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,730
- It just...
- All this time,

97
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,610
have I really been helping people?

98
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:15,850
Yeah.

99
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,900
However, from now on,

100
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,480
you need to consider

101
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,080
what kind of people you need to help.

102
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,030
Forgive yourself already, Phat.

103
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,240
Jim!

104
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,770
Jim!

105
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,990
Oh, hi, Pink.

106
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,780
What's up?

107
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,090
I thought you would be worse.

108
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,170
I thought you would be bony,

109
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,730
and have a long beard like a castaway.

110
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,030
Good. So, sail your boat to pick me up.

111
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,090
Are you done with your joke?

112
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:36,850
I'm okay.

113
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,320
And I don't need the pumpkin seed.

114
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:48,980
And...

115
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,760
what

116
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,890
are you going to do?

117
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,790
I think

118
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,970
I'll begin with small steps,

119
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:57,880
as what I'm doing now.

120
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,600
Okay.

121
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll do it too.

122
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,140
- Good.
- Right. Get some exercise.

123
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,000
Wow, Jim.

124
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,590
You're such a great man.

125
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,400
And if I take a quick look,

126
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,420
you look kind of like
half Wang Yibo and half Gong Yoo.

127
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,830
You'll find someone nice. Believe me.

128
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,010
Thanks.

129
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,990
If you're okay now...

130
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:24,060
No, he might not be.

131
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:26,010
Let's say

132
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,460
whether you're okay or not,

133
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,810
keep fighting.

134
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,190
See you then.

135
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,940
Okay. I'll get back to my jogging.

136
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,450
See you.

137
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,900
Sorry. I'll go this way...

138
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,420
Allow me.

139
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,430
You go ahead.

140
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:43,450
I'm going this way. Bye.

141
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,130
Hello. You must be Phat.

142
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,050
I am.

143
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
Hello, Chan.

144
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,900
I've looked at your work.

145
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,290
I love them.

146
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,100
There are some good ideas
about interior design.

147
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,730
Where have you been hiding?

148
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,890
It's not that good, I guess.

149
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:14,280
I've been

150
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,830
working in another field
after graduating.

151
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,380
So,

152
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,730
I don't want to waste time.

153
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,860
You'll get the salary that
you requested in the email.

154
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,580
When can you start?

155
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,470
Tomorrow?

156
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,810
It means...

157
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,140
Thank you.

158
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,090
Thanks.

159
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:37,090
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:38,530
I've

161
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,160
disappeared for a long time.

162
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,720
Are you here

163
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:46,710
because you're worried about me?

164
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,450
You said

165
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,200
helping Fah was your last job.

166
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,950
But I didn't know

167
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,260
that you would act like

168
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,810
it was our last time too.

169
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,260
What am I to you?

170
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,870
I was just

171
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,530
hiding away to think.

172
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,070
Have you really quit the job?

173
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:27,830
Sure.

174
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,370
And I got a new job.

175
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,690
What?

176
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,670
Really? What job? Where?

177
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:34,810
Well.

178
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,260
I'll inherit my family business

179
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,650
and be a fake fortune-teller.

180
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,870
It's well-paid.

181
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,560
Earth, water...

182
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,290
- That's enough.
- Wind...

183
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,680
You're being funny.

184
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,740
It's also a scam.

185
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,850
How is it different from juggling?

186
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,390
Well...

187
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,570
Tell me now. I'm dying to know.

188
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,100
What's your job?

189
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,550
Stay with me tonight.

190
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,450
And I'll tell you.

191
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:24,860
You told me

192
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,170
you don't know how to love someone.

193
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:30,960
But

194
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,580
it doesn't mean

195
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,200
I don't know how to do things.

196
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,750
Hello, Uncle Teong.

197
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,920
You're calling me so early.
Do you need something?

198
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,250
Why doesn't he pick up?

199
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,540
It's my first day at work.

200
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,800
I don't want to be late,
so I didn't wake you.

201
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,090
If you're still hungry,

202
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,470
feel free to enjoy the breakfast.

203
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,110
You crazy man.

204
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:04,700
Ouch!

205
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,690
Take an easy step.

206
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,940
I'm begging you.

207
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,100
Don't tell Pinky about this.

208
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,330
I don't want to hear her nagging.

209
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,860
There's a new

210
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,290
competition in this area.

211
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,200
Darn!

212
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,070
They got a two-digit number
on the lottery right

213
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,480
every time.

214
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,780
That's why I can't pay my bills.

215
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,350
So I need to take out a loan...

216
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,480
How much do you owe?

217
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,420
Forty thousand.

218
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,270
Forty thousand?

219
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,150
Why did you have to borrow so much?

220
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,180
How about the money I gave you?

221
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,370
Where does it go?

222
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,740
Where can it go?
The debt collector's pocket.

223
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,450
It's...

224
00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,080
The interest rate has been multiplied.

225
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,650
It isn't going anywhere.

226
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,950
Well,

227
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,970
I've saved some

228
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,290
to expand our shrine.

229
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,000
Normal temperature.

230
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,010
Come in, please.

231
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:11,350
Is he

232
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,860
that medium's nephew?

233
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:14,980
Yes, Big Sis.

234
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,060
You came to my place.

235
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,110
That means you have
something to offer, right?

236
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:35,060
I'm here to give you my tribute.

237
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,300
From now on,

238
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,660
Uncle Teong's debt will be mine.

239
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,320
Actually,

240
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,650
I've checked your background.

241
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,690
Your job

242
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,520
is interesting.

243
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,080
Yes?

244
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,370
I've got a job for you.

245
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,550
If you get it done,

246
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,690
you'll pay off this debt for your uncle.

247
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,240
Are you interested?

248
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,800
Dame Pedkeaw

249
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,220
is a big competitor of mine
in the concession auction.

250
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,980
Every bidder

251
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,540
needs to send their number

252
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,720
and fill in all the info
via email on the same day.

253
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,890
I need you to open her email.

254
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,050
Look how much she bid.

255
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,870
And tell me before midnight.

256
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,510
How can I get close to her?

257
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,440
By her hobby.

258
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,680
N... N...

259
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,950
No, thanks.

260
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,560
I wouldn't do it, even if I died.

261
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,970
Why?

262
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:07,020
Scamming people.

263
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:09,110
Is it your thing?

264
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,540
Wait, Big Sis.

265
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm not a scammer.

266
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,650
How is your old job

267
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:17,140
different than this one?

268
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,330
Think about it.

269
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:25,150
You can either pay off his debt
bit by bit until you're old

270
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:27,360
or just work for me

271
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,330
and be back to your normal life in time.

272
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:38,520
I'm sorry that I took the liberty
of cleaning your room.

273
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,310
You're home, I guess.

274
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,400
You're a true detective.

275
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,110
So?

276
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,470
How is your first day?

277
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:48,240
Are you tired?

278
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,680
It's nothing.

279
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,150
I'm not tired yet.

280
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,970
Not tired yet?

281
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,280
Does it mean you will get tired?

282
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,080
Hey.

283
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,300
Thank you

284
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,700
for loving me.

285
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,580
Phat, you're the first one

286
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,090
that I want to be with,
even though I have to take a risk

287
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,910
of trusting you with my heart.

288
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:21,720
Don't let Cher down.

289
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,940
What did you just call yourself?

290
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,240
Cher.

291
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:28,440
Why?

292
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,730
Nothing.

293
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,160
It's cute.

294
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,740
Oh, Phat.

295
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,640
I've gotta go.

296
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,380
My target is here.

297
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,130
Bye.

298
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,440
Okay, bye.

299
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,750
Phat.

300
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,940
Are you okay?

301
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,150
I can't get in touch with you.

302
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:51,470
I thought we agreed
to begin your work today.

303
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:05,270
Tan.

304
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:06,420
Are you free?

305
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:07,920
I need your help.

306
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:32,450
Hello.

307
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,710
Don't you have any newcomers?

308
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,930
Today we have

309
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,070
five people, ma'am.

310
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,870
Wow.

311
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,620
Is she the same person as in the photo?

312
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,180
You said it was an easy job, Phat.

313
00:24:59,010 --> 00:24:59,510
Come on.

314
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,950
Our plan is

315
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,590
to do whatever is needed to make
Dame Pedkeaw ask for us.

316
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,320
I'll do the rest.

317
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:09,810
What are you doing?

318
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,290
Keep Foei updated.

319
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,270
No, you can't do that.

320
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:15,150
- Why?
- Well...

321
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,570
I didn't tell Cher

322
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:21,070
about me doing this job.

323
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,510
And what does that have to do
with my Foei?

324
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,480
Your Foei?

325
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,070
Yes, my Foei.

326
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,060
- How come?
- Not yours.

327
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,820
I know.

328
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,300
When the brother knows,
the sister will know for sure.

329
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,700
Come on, Tan.

330
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,670
Don't tell Foei.

331
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,650
Look.

332
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,490
After this job is done,

333
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,890
I'll pay you a fortune.

334
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:46,240
Fine.

335
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,640
But...

336
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,320
You're so nervous.

337
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:51,770
Can you manage it?

338
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:54,840
I don't know.

339
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,370
I've never done this.

340
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,700
Welcome, all the honored guests,

341
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,800
to the heaven of pleasure

342
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,650
that you can't find
at any other place on earth.

343
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:06,700
That's right.

344
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,600
That place is

345
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,160
the Heaven!

346
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,840
Let's welcome our newcomers' show

347
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,930
that will please

348
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,030
and entertain you all tonight.

349
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,230
Let's not waste time.

350
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,190
Please welcome our first newcomer.
Let's roll, D.J.

351
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,550
=Catch Me Baby=

352
00:28:11,086 --> 00:28:11,626
Darn, Phat.

353
00:28:29,646 --> 00:28:30,726
You told me you've never done this.

354
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:13,236
Dame Pedkeaw chose you.

355
00:29:13,896 --> 00:29:14,806
Prepare the role play.

356
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:18,176
And...

357
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:20,376
What's the role play?

358
00:29:21,816 --> 00:29:22,656
The role play is...

359
00:29:23,956 --> 00:29:24,376
That's it.

360
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:33,776
Can I take my brother with me?

361
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:36,526
Me?

362
00:29:37,316 --> 00:29:37,886
It's a good thing.

363
00:29:38,016 --> 00:29:39,346
It can be a complimentary gift.

364
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:40,556
Go and prepare.

365
00:29:40,636 --> 00:29:41,206
- Go.
- Yes.

366
00:29:43,316 --> 00:29:45,506
How are our newcomers?

367
00:29:45,506 --> 00:29:47,556
Do you like them all?

368
00:29:47,646 --> 00:29:50,436
Give them some applause, please.

369
00:29:50,806 --> 00:29:51,896
The one you like...

370
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:10,456
I won't tell you,

371
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:12,116
even if you kill me.

372
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:20,366
You won't?

373
00:30:23,366 --> 00:30:24,786
What can I do to you?

374
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:26,126
Agent...

375
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,266
Roger.

376
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:33,556
When I get out,

377
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,346
I'll follow you,

378
00:30:37,156 --> 00:30:38,206
until you get a nightmare.

379
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:46,936
Hurry up, Tan.

380
00:30:47,576 --> 00:30:48,886
It'll be midnight in ten minutes.

381
00:30:49,046 --> 00:30:49,826
Big Sis is waiting.

382
00:30:53,486 --> 00:30:55,526
I might need a new approach

383
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:57,416
to deal with you.

384
00:30:59,686 --> 00:31:00,416
How?

385
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,896
Why didn't I pay attention
at my scout class?

386
00:31:10,726 --> 00:31:12,036
Mommy...

387
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:21,446
Hey!

388
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,936
Oh, my!

389
00:31:25,876 --> 00:31:27,266
Why did you tie me up?

390
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:28,336
What are you doing?

391
00:31:28,416 --> 00:31:29,546
Release me, Roger.

392
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:30,646
Stay still, ma'am.

393
00:31:30,646 --> 00:31:32,226
What is it? Help!

394
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:34,576
Do you want to see my missile?

395
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:41,876
I'll destroy your base to nothing.

396
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:43,616
No.

397
00:31:44,776 --> 00:31:46,246
Be prepared, Agent Kiel.

398
00:31:55,566 --> 00:31:56,306
But first,

399
00:31:57,326 --> 00:31:59,266
let's play a game, shall we?

400
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:01,426
What game?

401
00:32:02,996 --> 00:32:03,636
I like it.

402
00:32:05,796 --> 00:32:06,546
Close your eyes.

403
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:09,196
Promise me.

404
00:32:10,836 --> 00:32:12,376
Whatever happens,

405
00:32:13,476 --> 00:32:14,916
don't open your eyes.

406
00:32:17,676 --> 00:32:18,546
Agent Kiel.

407
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:20,516
Prepare the missile.

408
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:23,666
What's the missile?

409
00:32:27,786 --> 00:32:29,146
I'm not that easy.

410
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:31,486
Or maybe...

411
00:32:32,246 --> 00:32:33,376
I think

412
00:32:34,196 --> 00:32:36,366
I'll sneak you the missile.

413
00:32:38,626 --> 00:32:39,776
Open it, Agent Kiel.

414
00:32:40,746 --> 00:32:41,366
- Who would it be?
- Open what?

415
00:32:44,636 --> 00:32:45,916
Where's the missile?

416
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:48,006
Ready?

417
00:32:49,716 --> 00:32:50,736
We'll open it.

418
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:00,306
What was it?

419
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:01,936
How is it?

420
00:33:02,266 --> 00:33:03,816
Can you see the missile's nose?

421
00:33:04,776 --> 00:33:06,726
I caught a glimpse
but I want to see the whole missile.

422
00:33:07,806 --> 00:33:08,886
Okay, ma'am.

423
00:33:09,276 --> 00:33:11,696
Let Agent Kiel prepare his missile.

424
00:33:11,976 --> 00:33:13,936
We'll launch our whole missile at you.

425
00:33:14,616 --> 00:33:16,016
How's it going, Agent Kiel?

426
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:17,656
I'm nervous.

427
00:33:17,856 --> 00:33:18,916
Ready?

428
00:33:20,386 --> 00:33:21,326
Are you ready, ma'am?

429
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,306
Yes.

430
00:33:25,956 --> 00:33:29,586
Here it is! You're too slow.
I couldn't wait any longer.

431
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:31,626
Hey!

432
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:33,166
Our mission is completed.

433
00:33:33,166 --> 00:33:34,056
Agent Roger.

434
00:33:34,056 --> 00:33:34,886
Retreat!

435
00:33:35,586 --> 00:33:36,976
See you next time, ma'am.

436
00:33:37,736 --> 00:33:38,346
What?

437
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,376
Can I open my eyes?

438
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:42,126
Agent Roger!

439
00:33:42,686 --> 00:33:43,726
Roger!

440
00:33:43,726 --> 00:33:44,966
It was fun.

441
00:33:45,076 --> 00:33:46,546
Invite me next time.

442
00:33:47,756 --> 00:33:48,386
Sure.

443
00:33:48,966 --> 00:33:49,546
Oh!

444
00:33:49,966 --> 00:33:51,526
I sent the message to Sis Ning.

445
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:52,386
But

446
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,916
we'd better hurry
before the guards come for us.

447
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:56,676
You know?

448
00:33:56,676 --> 00:33:58,796
If Foei knows what I have been doing,

449
00:33:59,016 --> 00:34:00,546
it will be a big mess...

450
00:34:07,256 --> 00:34:07,736
Hey!

451
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:09,616
Foei, listen to me.

452
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,216
It's not what you think.

453
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:20,016
Have you ever thought about
telling me this?

454
00:34:24,276 --> 00:34:24,796
Well...

455
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:28,166
It's not what you think, Cher.

456
00:34:28,416 --> 00:34:29,136
- It's...
- I've known everything.

457
00:34:31,346 --> 00:34:33,036
It's not that hard to investigate you.

458
00:34:37,156 --> 00:34:38,456
You have to do this job

459
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,346
because you want to
pay off your uncle's debt.

460
00:34:43,896 --> 00:34:44,486
Yes.

461
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:45,456
So,

462
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,136
you get me, right?

463
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:48,176
Well,

464
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,306
I didn't want to trouble you.

465
00:34:50,406 --> 00:34:52,506
That's why I got it done so fast
behind your back.

466
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:53,326
Here's another thing.

467
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:54,746
This is not
a relationship juggling job...

468
00:34:54,746 --> 00:34:55,576
I'm not mad

469
00:34:56,366 --> 00:34:57,666
that you took this job.

470
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:00,786
But I'm mad

471
00:35:01,906 --> 00:35:02,906
because you lied.

472
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:07,366
I want you to share everything with me,

473
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:10,826
whether it's your suffering

474
00:35:12,296 --> 00:35:12,906
or your happiness.

475
00:35:16,186 --> 00:35:18,336
If you have something to hide from me,

476
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:21,826
even it's

477
00:35:22,726 --> 00:35:24,746
something that will trouble me,

478
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,356
that will not make us a couple.

479
00:35:29,906 --> 00:35:30,496
Cher.

480
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:37,426
I'm sorry.

481
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,176
Do you know

482
00:35:42,836 --> 00:35:43,666
that you

483
00:35:45,256 --> 00:35:47,606
are still Phat the Relationship Juggler?

484
00:35:50,176 --> 00:35:50,936
What makes you think

485
00:35:51,556 --> 00:35:53,806
that you can solve a problem
by covering it up?

486
00:35:56,956 --> 00:35:57,516
It's just...

487
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:02,286
Instead of hiding some love affair,

488
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:08,456
you are hiding the truth from me.

489
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:13,096
I'm not a perfect woman.

490
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,836
But I expect

491
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:23,196
you to trust me.

492
00:36:25,556 --> 00:36:26,586
Do not lie to me,

493
00:36:28,966 --> 00:36:30,636
no matter what it is.

494
00:36:36,266 --> 00:36:37,206
Honestly,

495
00:36:40,506 --> 00:36:41,616
I can't stand it.

496
00:37:00,026 --> 00:37:01,186
You liar!

497
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,296
Why did you do that?

498
00:37:06,836 --> 00:37:07,386
Pink.

499
00:37:07,996 --> 00:37:08,896
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:09,496 --> 00:37:10,896
I won't do that again.

501
00:37:13,246 --> 00:37:14,456
Jim!

502
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,496
What?

503
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:17,316
Her name is not Pink.

504
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,246
Why can't you remember
such an easy line?

505
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:24,556
Pink, I'm not a professional actor
like you.

506
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,546
I'm sorry. Let's do it one more time.

507
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:27,356
Please.

508
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:29,256
It's been the fifth time.

509
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,196
Come on.

510
00:37:30,686 --> 00:37:31,726
One more time. Let's go.

511
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,306
Come on. Let's do it.

512
00:37:33,696 --> 00:37:35,026
Your hair is messy.

513
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,436
Come on. I'm ready. Let's do it.

514
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:42,616
Hah!

515
00:37:44,636 --> 00:37:45,896
- Come on.
- What are you doing?

516
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:47,596
Hah!

517
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:48,826
I'm in the character.

518
00:37:49,296 --> 00:37:51,306
Do you need to do "Hah"
for the character?

519
00:37:51,306 --> 00:37:51,746
Yes.

520
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:53,986
Fine, okay. Let's do it.

521
00:37:54,896 --> 00:37:57,216
- Mmm. H...
- Mmm. Hah!!!!

522
00:37:59,646 --> 00:38:00,806
Did I do it right?

523
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:01,896
I'm in the character.

524
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:03,606
Let's do "being in the character".

525
00:38:04,466 --> 00:38:05,926
I did it already.

526
00:38:06,086 --> 00:38:06,836
Oh, I'll do it again.

527
00:38:07,086 --> 00:38:09,766
Mmm. Hah!!!!

528
00:38:10,886 --> 00:38:12,076
What are you doing?

529
00:38:12,076 --> 00:38:13,116
Gathering my Qi.

530
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:15,706
I'm gathering my Qi, so I'll be ready.

531
00:38:15,906 --> 00:38:18,316
- Mmm. Hah!
- Mmm. Hah!!!!

532
00:38:27,816 --> 00:38:29,436
How did you do your job?

533
00:38:29,556 --> 00:38:30,626
It was a mess.

534
00:38:30,736 --> 00:38:32,466
I'm sorry, boss. I'm so sorry.

535
00:38:33,516 --> 00:38:34,316
Come on, honey.

536
00:38:34,766 --> 00:38:36,836
We can find a new worker.

537
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:41,526
You too!

538
00:38:42,146 --> 00:38:43,976
I can order my man to do anything.

539
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:45,976
It's none of your business.

540
00:38:57,236 --> 00:38:57,786
Get up.

541
00:38:58,006 --> 00:38:58,576
Come.

542
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:07,726
I've already canceled your debt.

543
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:10,886
You really got the job done.

544
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:13,846
You've lived up to your
scammer family reputation.

545
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:16,616
Your family is good at this.

546
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:18,846
So,

547
00:39:19,676 --> 00:39:20,686
it's done, right?

548
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:23,886
If your uncle lays low,

549
00:39:24,156 --> 00:39:25,066
we won't meet again.

550
00:39:31,866 --> 00:39:32,816
Your husband

551
00:39:33,186 --> 00:39:34,196
is quite tough, Big Sis.

552
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:36,676
As you can see,

553
00:39:37,506 --> 00:39:38,836
he would never take no for an answer.

554
00:39:41,316 --> 00:39:42,426
Let's be frank, Big Sis.

555
00:39:43,486 --> 00:39:44,766
Do you have something else to say?

556
00:39:46,276 --> 00:39:46,766
What?

557
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,716
You're sitting here with me

558
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:51,586
without your bodyguards.

559
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,306
You can't fool someone like me.

560
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,206
Actually,

561
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,196
you need help from...

562
00:39:57,196 --> 00:39:58,256
Nothing.

563
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:01,726
You can go now.

564
00:40:14,966 --> 00:40:15,946
I'll do my errand.

565
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:16,996
Why are you still sitting there?

566
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:18,916
Sis.

567
00:40:23,406 --> 00:40:25,066
That half-heart key chain.

568
00:40:26,436 --> 00:40:27,456
Where did you get it?

569
00:40:30,156 --> 00:40:30,926
I made it.

570
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:32,466
Why?

571
00:40:48,136 --> 00:40:48,806
Is this your job?

572
00:40:52,976 --> 00:40:53,566
Is it done?

573
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:57,656
So...

574
00:40:58,986 --> 00:41:00,156
Can I talk to you?

575
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:08,526
Where...

576
00:41:13,396 --> 00:41:14,386
did you get this?

577
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:19,696
It's so sudden. I'm sorry.

578
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:23,306
But it wasn't easy to
talk her into meeting you.

579
00:41:24,146 --> 00:41:25,526
It took some time.

580
00:41:27,706 --> 00:41:28,216
Cher.

581
00:41:29,926 --> 00:41:31,166
If you don't want to meet her,

582
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,366
you can tell me.

583
00:41:34,206 --> 00:41:35,166
I'll tell her to go.

584
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:39,276
Is

585
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:42,186
she around?

586
00:41:55,176 --> 00:41:56,066
I want to see her.

587
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:05,746
I'm ready.

588
00:42:06,566 --> 00:42:07,266
Come in.

589
00:42:13,946 --> 00:42:14,846
I'll wait outside.

590
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:24,176
Can you stay here with me?

591
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:54,786
You have grown up.

592
00:42:59,186 --> 00:42:59,936
You...

593
00:43:03,086 --> 00:43:03,956
How are you?

594
00:43:04,616 --> 00:43:05,826
Is your life okay?

595
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:10,656
I...

596
00:43:12,526 --> 00:43:13,506
I'm okay.

597
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:16,036
And you...

598
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,026
How are you?

599
00:43:25,926 --> 00:43:26,926
Your scar?

600
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:30,526
It hurts,
but I've already been used to it.

601
00:43:35,896 --> 00:43:37,696
You left me and Dad.

602
00:43:38,756 --> 00:43:40,966
You had to have a better life.

603
00:43:46,426 --> 00:43:47,336
Why didn't it become better?

604
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:50,986
He has everything I need.

605
00:43:52,086 --> 00:43:53,196
Money,

606
00:43:53,966 --> 00:43:55,556
and a comfortable life.

607
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:58,936
Is that it?

608
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:01,546
Is that all you want?

609
00:44:04,096 --> 00:44:04,976
Compared to the old one,

610
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,226
it's better.

611
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:17,106
I have a question

612
00:44:19,176 --> 00:44:21,046
that I want to ask you all this time.

613
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:26,256
Why did I leave you?

614
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:29,246
Yes.

615
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,196
Your dad must have told people

616
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:36,886
that I left you
to be with my secret lover.

617
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:40,636
The truth was

618
00:44:42,416 --> 00:44:43,916
he couldn't handle the fact

619
00:44:45,216 --> 00:44:46,076
that he was a loser.

620
00:44:49,326 --> 00:44:50,106
A loser

621
00:44:50,776 --> 00:44:53,116
who couldn't keep his wedding vows.

622
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:57,876
And I realized that love

623
00:44:58,786 --> 00:45:00,676
doesn't make your stomach
full or your eyes shut.

624
00:45:02,876 --> 00:45:04,326
Love is just

625
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:09,066
a lie from a useless person.

626
00:45:14,866 --> 00:45:16,326
And have you ever thought about

627
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,386
staying for me?

628
00:45:31,436 --> 00:45:33,246
I asked him if you could be with me.

629
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:35,366
But your dad didn't agree.

630
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,346
But I can see you've grown up so well.

631
00:45:45,966 --> 00:45:47,116
I'm so glad.

632
00:46:01,006 --> 00:46:01,916
Let's say

633
00:46:06,846 --> 00:46:07,746
we both

634
00:46:08,256 --> 00:46:08,686
have

635
00:46:09,776 --> 00:46:11,386
our own way like before.

636
00:46:16,876 --> 00:46:17,416
Yes.

637
00:46:20,436 --> 00:46:21,726
Let us both

638
00:46:24,596 --> 00:46:26,296
live our own life.

639
00:46:55,796 --> 00:46:57,576
I've imagined

640
00:46:58,446 --> 00:47:00,186
after Mom left us,

641
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,386
she would be happy somewhere else.

642
00:47:04,176 --> 00:47:06,006
But when I saw her condition today...

643
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:07,976
Darn!

644
00:47:10,106 --> 00:47:11,396
Oh, that's human.

645
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:14,796
You can act so cool and cold
when they're around.

646
00:47:15,176 --> 00:47:16,106
But when they aren't around,

647
00:47:16,606 --> 00:47:18,866
you would cry because you're worried.

648
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:22,076
Thanks

649
00:47:23,476 --> 00:47:24,456
for taking her to me.

650
00:47:26,406 --> 00:47:28,626
Now, I don't have anything to do
with Mom.

651
00:47:30,296 --> 00:47:31,206
Are you sure?

652
00:47:33,906 --> 00:47:34,826
What do you mean by that?

653
00:47:36,266 --> 00:47:37,996
I have something
to talk to you about, Sis.

654
00:47:45,266 --> 00:47:47,226
I want to keep on working for you.

655
00:47:51,376 --> 00:47:52,506
I know you're good

656
00:47:53,506 --> 00:47:54,986
as a relationship juggler.

657
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,816
But I don't think

658
00:47:57,026 --> 00:47:58,476
you're capable enough to work for me.

659
00:47:58,606 --> 00:48:00,326
I've never thought it'd be easy.

660
00:48:01,246 --> 00:48:02,076
But I...

661
00:48:03,236 --> 00:48:04,476
will collect a handsome fee.

662
00:48:07,036 --> 00:48:08,336
I'll give you your freedom.

663
00:48:09,896 --> 00:48:10,786
Have you thought it through?

664
00:48:12,576 --> 00:48:15,046
It deserves to be my goodbye mission.

665
00:48:16,056 --> 00:48:17,416
And I'm not a good man.

666
00:48:18,066 --> 00:48:19,136
I just...

667
00:48:22,146 --> 00:48:23,906
can't stand it
when my loved one is miserable.

668
00:48:28,226 --> 00:48:29,866
Don't regret it.

669
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:31,266
Wow.

670
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:33,546
I'll regret nothing.

671
00:48:34,636 --> 00:48:35,776
Don't stop me.

672
00:48:37,366 --> 00:48:38,156
I won't.

673
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:49,266
