5
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,250
How are you, son?

6
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,150
Hungry?

7
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:57,370
I know you are,

8
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,350
the meal is just over there.

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,970
Under the cover.

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,750
Just help yourself.

11
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,730
Okay, son?

12
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,560
Oh, Pinky.

13
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,350
Just in time. Come here.

14
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,820
Get to know each other.

15
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,320
This girl

16
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:16,370
is Pinky.

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,960
She is my daughter.

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,150
Pink.

19
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,470
He's Phat,

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,540
the son of...

21
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,290
From now on,

22
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,100
Pinky,

23
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,060
you take care of him.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,620
Got it?

25
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,070
Yes.

26
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,040
From now on,

27
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,670
he will be staying with us.

28
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,780
Daddy.

29
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,970
Phat will be my future husband,
won't he?

30
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,440
No, he won't.

31
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,560
He's going to be
your big brother, Pinky.

32
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:47,950
Got it?

33
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,950
Call him brother.

34
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,010
Phat. Son...

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,210
I'm hungry.

36
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,600
I see.

37
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:08,760
It's on the table.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,310
Open the cover and help yourself.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,390
I miss these, Uncle Teong.

40
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,400
What are you talking about?

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,580
We just met last week.

42
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,890
Hot steamy rice is ready.

43
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,630
Wow.

44
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,180
I thought you injured your arm.

45
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,720
But from what I see,

46
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
you feel nothing now.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,820
You've become so energetic seeing Phat.

48
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,140
Not like the crying baby
you were yesterday,

49
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,060
screaming "It hurts, it hurts."

50
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,290
What?

51
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,020
Oh, right, I've been in the accident.

52
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,750
My legs are hurt, Phat.

53
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,720
Just stay still,

54
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,290
or your wound won't be healed.

55
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,350
Right.

56
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,530
Let's eat.

57
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,730
Serve the rice.

58
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,900
- Wow.
- I'm hungry.

59
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,890
Phat,

60
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,910
how is your job in Bangkok?

61
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,750
It depends on

62
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,760
if you can pay your debt on time, Uncle.

63
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:08,490
Well.

64
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,860
You and your sassing.

65
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,950
You both

66
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,820
are two peas in a pod.

67
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,540
You've grown into some cheeky people.

68
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:21,080
I miss the good old days
when you were just innocent children,

69
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,260
looking adorable like the shrimp.

70
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,110
Adorable like the shrimp?
Stop playing with your food.

71
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,320
You're the one to talk, Pink.

72
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,750
You're a lady now, be more careful.

73
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,340
When I heard that you had
a motorbike accident, I was...

74
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,370
You were worried about me?

75
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,220
No.

76
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,760
I was worried that no one
would help me if it's short-staffed.

77
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,880
Don't worry about that.

78
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,950
Even if I'm injured,

79
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,410
I can endure it for you.

80
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,130
Just take care of yourself.

81
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,300
Don't worry about me.

82
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,070
I have Jim to help me.

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,080
Oh, about this,

84
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,140
you just got yourself
a secretary, right?

85
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,050
How is his job performance?

86
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,230
No.

87
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,860
My gut tells me

88
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,080
that this girl can't be trusted.

89
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,240
A girl?

90
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,630
And can't be trusted?

91
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,330
What's wrong with her?

92
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,310
What do you mean?

93
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:16,890
I mean,

94
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,740
is she a nerd

95
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,260
who wears glasses?

96
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,990
Or a hidden sexy cat?

97
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,140
Or a cougar who acts naive?

98
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,250
Which one is her?

99
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,590
It is too late.

100
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,890
She's already accepted.

101
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:35,830
What is the point of those questions?

102
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,490
I don't want Phat to get fooled.

103
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,330
You forget what his job is?

104
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,250
He's a relationship juggler.

105
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,980
He's been fooling people

106
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,910
around the world.

107
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:55,470
I wonder who would fool him.

108
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:58,600
Am I right?

109
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,140
And a person who's
dressing up to trick people,

110
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,190
what do you call it?

111
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,750
What I do

112
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,330
is not tricking people.

113
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:06,680
Instead,

114
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,010
I'm doing

115
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,870
spiritual counseling

116
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,340
to cheer people up.

117
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,910
It is what I'm doing.

118
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,800
- It is. Daddy's right.
- Isn't it?

119
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,930
Nevertheless,

120
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,240
you can fool everybody...

121
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,400
- Don't fool yourself.
- Don't fool yourself.

122
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,420
Okay. Let's eat.

123
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,140
So your mouth will be shut.

124
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,660
You told me a hundred times.

125
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,160
I still remember it.

126
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,710
I know. Let's eat.

127
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,630
But you just said that
you've never fooled people.

128
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:40,880
Just eat your food.

129
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,800
(Catch Me Baby)

130
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,610
Answer me.

131
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,040
What?

132
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,700
I asked you

133
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,280
if I can sit with you at lunch.

134
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,390
Since Ben was gone,

135
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,740
I've been eating lunch alone.

136
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:12,510
You all have been avoiding me
during lunch break.

137
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,100
What do you want?

138
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,700
I understand that
you're still mad at me.

139
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,670
But now we're colleagues.

140
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,940
Don't you want to get to know me?

141
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,430
Hello, Mr. Wut.

142
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,870
It's urgent, Phat.

143
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,080
I just realized

144
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,440
that I asked Soo-hyun out the other day.

145
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:39,050
- Then...
- Uh.

146
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,850
Hang on, sir.

147
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,330
I'm ready. Talk to me.

148
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,740
It slipped my mind.

149
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,220
I made a plan with Lisa,

150
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:03,440
my first love.

151
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,190
Miss L.

152
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,080
She'll return to Thailand tomorrow,

153
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:13,180
for the business meeting.
She only has time for me tomorrow.

154
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,410
Tomorrow.

155
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,120
But tomorrow,

156
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,220
I made a plan with Soo-hyun
a long time ago.

157
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,610
Double-booked.

158
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,070
And I can't cancel.

159
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,070
I promised Soo-hyun

160
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,640
that I'll take her for a photo trip,

161
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,520
and spend one night at a resort.

162
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,630
Can't cancel.

163
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,470
Photo trip and resort.

164
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,050
I know it's urgent.

165
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,730
So I'll pay you triple.

166
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,350
Sure.

167
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:36,590
I gotta go.

168
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,540
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

169
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,120
Miss L.

170
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,300
Tomorrow.

171
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,610
Double-booked.

172
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,330
Can't cancel. Photo trip. Resort.

173
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,100
What is it about?

174
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,610
He has a meeting at a resort
with Miss L and it can't be canceled.

175
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,670
Nothing big.

176
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,790
Let's have lunch.

177
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:11,070
You said

178
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,800
you want to have lunch with me.

179
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,190
So do it.

180
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:34,350
Are you there?

181
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:36,790
I'm here.

182
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,760
Can't wait.

183
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,450
You're Phat?

184
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,370
Hello, Miss Lisa.

185
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,580
Mr. Wut will be a little bit late.

186
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,390
Please follow me.

187
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,270
I see you haven't updated
your Vlog lately,

188
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,600
cause you're busy taking care of me.

189
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,240
Now it's time for me
to take care of you.

190
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,040
- Wut, babe.
- Yes, honey.

191
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,020
Thank you so much.

192
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,440
I love it.

193
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,840
But I don't want people to think
that I'm with you because of your money.

194
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,320
Soo-hyun.

195
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,570
So why did you choose me?

196
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:28,460
Because of money.

197
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,370
I'm kidding.

198
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,570
But promise me that you won't complain.

199
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,960
When I do my photography...

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,000
You can do it all day long.

201
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,440
Oh, Wut, baby.

202
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:39,830
So,

203
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,420
let's not waste any time. I'm
gonna check the costume over there.

204
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,030
- Thanks again, Wut.
- Sure.

205
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:48,590
Wow.

206
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,680
This one looks saucy.

207
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,520
Phat.

208
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,320
I sent Mr. Wut on his way.

209
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Thank you.

210
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,720
Meanwhile, let's refresh
our memory about our plan.

211
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,400
Of course.

212
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,070
First train, M05.

213
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,070
The plan is

214
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,250
let her do her photo shoot.

215
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,740
(M05: Soo-hyun)
It takes at least 2 to 3 hours, I guess.

216
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,610
And then?

217
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,730
M09.

218
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,248
(M07: Lisa)
She'll be praying

219
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:22,580
in the shrine with Mr. Wut.

220
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,790
I need to excuse myself.

221
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,110
All the missions here
will finish at 3:00 PM,

222
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,370
and start again
at the resort at 08:00 PM.

223
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,150
After that,

224
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,170
Soo-hyun will be
at the resort with them.

225
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,640
The mission will end
at 06:00 AM tomorrow,

226
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,870
after Miss Lisa's check-out.

227
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,710
What?

228
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,040
Are you crazy?

229
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,890
Will I get the O.T.?

230
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Come on.

231
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,070
I'll give you more than that.

232
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,120
And you can ask for my help anytime.

233
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,270
I own you one.

234
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,310
Bye.

235
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,170
Here you go.

236
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,440
What's wrong, sir?

237
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,410
I feel like I've forgotten something.

238
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,750
Never mind.

239
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,890
Shoot!

240
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,190
Ten posts in just one second?

241
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,640
I'm in danger.

242
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,860
Is she a YouTuber or a ninja?

243
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:00,800
Eh? Cher?

244
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:02,360
Hello.

245
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,270
Jim.

246
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,500
Sorry,

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,860
but I couldn't reach Phat.

248
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,710
Well,

249
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,270
Mr. Wut forgot

250
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,350
his heart medication at his office.

251
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,020
Huh?

252
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,160
But he never leaves it from his side.

253
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,730
If you don't mind,

254
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,440
want me to bring it to you?

255
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:40,070
No star is brighter than my Star.

256
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:41,870
Thank you, Tan.

257
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,930
Where's my gift, Tan?

258
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,530
Why?

259
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,280
You're Star's parent?

260
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,450
He isn't, is he?

261
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,120
I heard

262
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,180
that you presented
your project to Professor Nop,

263
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,010
but it happens to be the same
with Foei's idea.

264
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Well, you both can't do
the same thing. right?

265
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,850
Here are yesterday's lecture notes.

266
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:14,520
I've summarized it for you, Star.

267
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,260
Thank you, Foei.

268
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:16,950
My pleasure.

269
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:17,660
Foei.

270
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,700
May I copy that?

271
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,910
Everyone in this class can copy it.

272
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,270
Except this son of a gun.

273
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,180
Whoa!

274
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,490
Getting fun.

275
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,440
Do you think a brainiac like me

276
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,200
would copy that?

277
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,430
I'm not sure.

278
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,420
My Speed Date project

279
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,780
got copied by you.

280
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,700
What the heck are you talking about?

281
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:40,840
Speed Date project

282
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,890
was my idea from last semester.

283
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,020
You're the one who's the copycat.

284
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:47,630
Don't waste your fricking breath.

285
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,370
Let's wait for Professor,

286
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,800
and ask him

287
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,490
who's gonna carry on
the Speed Date app.

288
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,200
Sure.

289
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,200
And whoever doesn't get picked

290
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,290
stays out of the way.

291
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,990
You'll see.

292
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,690
How about now?

293
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,990
Don't argue, kids.

294
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,770
Didn't you read the guideline?

295
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,720
It's a group project.

296
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,010
- Huh?
- Huh?

297
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:18,900
But...

298
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,670
I don't want to team up with this loser.

299
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,340
He's right.

300
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,140
This perv is not reliable.

301
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,230
I've made my decision.

302
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,470
Do as I say.

303
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,650
Get back to your seats.

304
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,950
- Professor! No!
- Professor!

305
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,710
Don't do that.

306
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,750
- Could it be an individual project?
- Let me do it alone.

307
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,200
I'm begging you.

308
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,450
Hey! Silence!

309
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,820
What are you yelling for?

310
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,210
It was because of you.

311
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,660
- It's both of you.
- Yes.

312
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,540
- Yes, both of you.
- So annoying.

313
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,300
Please.

314
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,620
I'm begging you, Professor.

315
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,170
How am I gonna buy some more time?

316
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,200
Darn me.

317
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,090
It comes to Jackie Chan movies.

318
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,930
Miss Soo-hyun.

319
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,990
Would you like some
photos on the scaffolding?

320
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,910
I guarantee you

321
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,030
they are going to come out marvelous.

322
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,520
No, Jim.

323
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,640
I'm not sure it's stable enough.

324
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,800
And it takes too much time to climb up.

325
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,830
We better take our time.

326
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,220
That's not what I mean.

327
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,620
I'll try it out.

328
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,040
I assure you,

329
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,450
it's certainly safe.

330
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm going up now.

331
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,310
See?

332
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,520
It's safe.

333
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,940
Oh my, Jim!

334
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,620
Do you like it?

335
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,580
You always know what I like.

336
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,050
Look at me.

337
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,530
Soo-hyun just screamed and ran away.

338
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,660
What to do, Phat?

339
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,900
Listen to me.

340
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,230
Go to the hospital.

341
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:11,480
I'll improvise here.

342
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,210
Okay?

343
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,570
How can I do that?
You need people to stay by each side.

344
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,860
Oh, right,

345
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,890
don't worry.

346
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,760
Because

347
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,530
I have a backup for you.

348
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,970
A backup?

349
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,130
Who?

350
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,490
Do you forget that

351
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,390
this is Mr. Wut's personal work?

352
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,780
Listen, Phat.

353
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,750
Eventually, one of our team

354
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,800
will know about this.

355
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,220
- But I've told you we can't risk it.
- Hey.

356
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,950
Mr. Wut's heart medication.

357
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,270
Jim told me to bring it here.

358
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,700
Thanks.

359
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,500
Your job here is done,

360
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,400
so please leave...

361
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:08,950
Since you're here,

362
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,180
help me, will you?

363
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,300
Help you?

364
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:12,780
About what?

365
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,910
He's done a lot of austerity practice.

366
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:21,980
When you get blessed by him,

367
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,650
you'll get prosperity and abundance.

368
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:33,550
You know?

369
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,950
I give this chant for no one.

370
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,530
But for both of you,

371
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,250
it's a special occasion.

372
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,370
Okay?

373
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,040
But you need to sit back-to-back,

374
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,860
and shut your eyes all the time.

375
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,960
During this half an hour

376
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,150
while I'm chanting,

377
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,930
never open your eyes.

378
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,800
Got it?

379
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,330
Om!

380
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,630
(Gibberish chant)

381
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,400
Wut?

382
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,560
Wut?

383
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:25,900
Oh, here you are.

384
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,370
Mr. Wut's waiting for you.

385
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,120
Please follow me.

386
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:30,540
But he's...

387
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,380
He's over there.

388
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,510
There's nothing here.

389
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,230
Please, follow me there.

390
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,180
Please.

391
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,530
This way, please.

392
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,360
(Gibberish chant)

393
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,830
(Gibberish chant)

394
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:48,940
Ahem!

395
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:54,280
(Gibberish chant)

396
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:00,270
(Gibberish chant)

397
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:05,060
(Gibberish chant)

398
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:26,410
Here he is.

399
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:36,900
Drinks for everybody.
Please come and take your drink.

400
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,590
Here you go.

401
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,530
He's so nice.

402
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,620
Wut.

403
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,680
Oh, Soo-hyun.

404
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,590
I just saw

405
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,650
how hot the set was,

406
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,850
so,

407
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:59,740
I got drinks for the crew.

408
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:03,420
Wut, you're being sweet.

409
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,760
Wut.

410
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,590
I'm getting bored.

411
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,180
Can we go to the spa now?

412
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,050
Om...

413
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,220
Hey, keep your eyes shut.

414
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,310
Or I need to repeat the chant.

415
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,790
(Gibberish chant)

416
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:33,150
(Gibberish chant)

417
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:37,100
(Gibberish chant)

418
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,070
Yes?

419
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,900
They rescheduled the meeting
an hour earlier?

420
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,980
I need to rush over there now.

421
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,490
Wut.

422
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:55,380
Wut, dear.

423
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,460
Wut!

424
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,040
Go! Come on!

425
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,290
Wut, is it almost done?

426
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,010
(Gibberish chant)

427
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,950
Wut?

428
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,460
Oh, ugh...

429
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,990
Wut!

430
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,020
It's done.

431
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,620
I have to go to the meeting.

432
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:32,730
What about...

433
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:33,720
Miss Soo-hyun?

434
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,100
Done.

435
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,600
Almost got screwed but done.

436
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,310
Let's go.

437
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,370
Wrap it up, I'm not
going anywhere but a spa.

438
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,780
Actually, I don't need makeup.

439
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,910
No, you do.

440
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:55,600
A lady must be
beautiful in every situation.

441
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,000
(Catch Me Baby)

442
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:05,098
(Catch Me Baby)

443
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:08,258
Okay, Jim.

444
00:22:08,568 --> 00:22:09,748
Say hi to Fah for me.

445
00:22:10,598 --> 00:22:11,378
Of course.

446
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:13,428
Get some rest.

447
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:15,318
You did it well, right?

448
00:22:16,768 --> 00:22:17,378
Okay.

449
00:22:17,648 --> 00:22:18,168
Bye.

450
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,038
Hey.

451
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,558
I know how to keep a secret.

452
00:22:37,748 --> 00:22:38,628
Don't worry.

453
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,108
What?

454
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,738
Trust me.

455
00:22:47,628 --> 00:22:50,038
My ex-boss did this kind of thing, too.

456
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,768
Action speaks louder than words.

457
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:57,018
We'll see.

458
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:00,478
Fine.

459
00:23:03,338 --> 00:23:04,148
By the way,

460
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:05,998
what are we doing here?

461
00:23:06,738 --> 00:23:07,648
Aren't you afraid of getting caught?

462
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:11,298
They both are in a
three-hour spa course, napping.

463
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:13,768
What's the harm of taking
a ten-minute rest?

464
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:22,058
You once said

465
00:23:22,308 --> 00:23:25,298
that the secretary also
manages the boss's personal life.

466
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:27,898
I got it now.

467
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,238
Since the beginning,

468
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,118
you've been doing this all by yourself?

469
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:35,708
Sort of.

470
00:23:40,948 --> 00:23:41,898
What about his wife?

471
00:23:42,448 --> 00:23:43,548
She's never cached him?

472
00:23:45,068 --> 00:23:45,938
If he ever got caught,

473
00:23:46,338 --> 00:23:48,158
we would be fired by now.

474
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,338
- I can't believe him.
- Oh.

475
00:23:58,548 --> 00:23:59,848
- It was a special occasion for us...
- Duck.

476
00:23:59,848 --> 00:24:01,128
- Cover yourself.
- What?

477
00:24:01,128 --> 00:24:01,758
Duck down.

478
00:24:02,678 --> 00:24:03,578
It's Soo-hyun.

479
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:05,598
How could she be here?

480
00:24:08,078 --> 00:24:08,508
It's Soo-hyun.

481
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:12,578
Didn't you say

482
00:24:12,658 --> 00:24:14,158
that they are in a three-hour course?

483
00:24:23,778 --> 00:24:24,528
Excuse me.

484
00:24:25,168 --> 00:24:26,428
I like your purse.

485
00:24:26,868 --> 00:24:28,468
I have one just like it.

486
00:24:31,058 --> 00:24:32,008
It's a gift from my boyfriend.

487
00:24:33,608 --> 00:24:34,298
Is that...

488
00:24:35,228 --> 00:24:35,798
Miss Lisa?

489
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:36,358
Yes.

490
00:24:38,428 --> 00:24:39,498
I'm Soo-hyun.

491
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:41,348
I'm Lisa.

492
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:42,698
Are you on your vacation?

493
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:45,598
On a trip. It's my boyfriend's gift.

494
00:24:45,968 --> 00:24:47,468
What about you?

495
00:24:48,628 --> 00:24:49,688
I'm here for work.

496
00:24:51,248 --> 00:24:52,428
However...

497
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:53,958
I'm also here with my boyfriend.

498
00:24:57,528 --> 00:24:59,998
I also like your hair, Miss Lisa.

499
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:02,088
I think I saw hair like this once.

500
00:25:11,228 --> 00:25:12,258
Are you Miss Lisa?

501
00:25:14,688 --> 00:25:15,918
Villa No. 02, ma'am.

502
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:17,638
Sorry for the waiting, ma'am.

503
00:25:18,028 --> 00:25:18,748
It's okay.

504
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:19,488
Thank you.

505
00:25:25,698 --> 00:25:26,948
Nice to meet you.

506
00:25:27,308 --> 00:25:28,148
Likewise.

507
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:36,898
Duck.

508
00:25:39,908 --> 00:25:40,708
What was that?

509
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:42,928
She just turned around this way.

510
00:25:43,698 --> 00:25:44,468
Oh, my.

511
00:25:56,008 --> 00:25:57,188
They're both gone already.

512
00:26:00,808 --> 00:26:01,228
Hey.

513
00:26:02,518 --> 00:26:03,508
I think we're in trouble.

514
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:05,498
I couldn't agree more.

515
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:06,898
Let me tell you something.

516
00:26:07,268 --> 00:26:09,258
Women never give compliments so easily.

517
00:26:10,578 --> 00:26:11,918
Like "I like your hair."

518
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:12,968
No way.

519
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:14,328
She's up to something.

520
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:15,268
Yes.

521
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,898
Miss Soo-hyun saw Miss Lisa at the temple.

522
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:19,788
See?

523
00:26:20,108 --> 00:26:20,868
I told you.

524
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:40,898
Soo-hyun.

525
00:26:44,538 --> 00:26:46,538
Wut, I have had enough.

526
00:26:49,258 --> 00:26:50,278
Soo-hyun.

527
00:26:50,658 --> 00:26:52,278
No more drinks.

528
00:27:34,848 --> 00:27:35,658
This time,

529
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:38,528
I'll never let you go.

530
00:27:40,848 --> 00:27:41,928
You know

531
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,118
how long I've waited for this moment?

532
00:27:48,268 --> 00:27:49,288
I've seen

533
00:27:49,378 --> 00:27:50,828
that you've waited all day.

534
00:28:07,578 --> 00:28:08,178
Miss!

535
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:09,128
Open it immediately.

536
00:28:09,248 --> 00:28:10,008
I'll take full responsibility.

537
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:12,178
Please wait.

538
00:28:16,908 --> 00:28:17,598
Hey!

539
00:28:17,898 --> 00:28:18,808
Who's there?

540
00:28:18,858 --> 00:28:19,838
Open the door.

541
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,608
Have you found the key?

542
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:22,528
Hang on, miss.

543
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:39,588
You red-haired bit...

544
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:42,048
Phat?

545
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:43,238
Miss Soo-hyun?

546
00:28:43,498 --> 00:28:44,528
Oh, my god!

547
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:51,638
Miss Soo-hyun.

548
00:28:51,998 --> 00:28:53,518
What are you doing here?

549
00:28:55,378 --> 00:28:56,498
Wait a second.

550
00:28:57,048 --> 00:28:57,958
I don't get it.

551
00:28:58,338 --> 00:28:59,078
Phat.

552
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:00,918
You have an affair with a married woman?

553
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:04,928
These are different
types of relationships.

554
00:29:05,658 --> 00:29:06,288
Well...

555
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:08,228
If you want something,

556
00:29:08,888 --> 00:29:09,968
can we talk later?

557
00:29:11,258 --> 00:29:12,308
I'm here for Mr. Wut.

558
00:29:12,508 --> 00:29:13,728
Where is he?

559
00:29:13,828 --> 00:29:15,338
I want an answer to that.

560
00:29:20,548 --> 00:29:21,178
Okay.

561
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:22,708
Well,

562
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:23,868
I'll take you to him.

563
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:33,958
Mr. Wut firmly ordered me

564
00:29:34,368 --> 00:29:36,088
to not tell a single soul

565
00:29:36,338 --> 00:29:37,668
about this international meeting.

566
00:29:38,618 --> 00:29:40,228
It's a top-secret project.

567
00:29:43,458 --> 00:29:44,748
You know, right?

568
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:47,638
How serious he is, about his work.

569
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:52,178
My poor Wut.

570
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:54,958
Why do you have to
keep this a secret from me?

571
00:29:55,678 --> 00:29:57,448
It isn't a small deal, Miss Soo-hyun.

572
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:00,498
If this information leaks,

573
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,608
even to people close to him,

574
00:30:04,658 --> 00:30:06,818
he might be in fatal danger.

575
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:13,208
This industry

576
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:14,708
is the field of mafias.

577
00:30:16,848 --> 00:30:18,088
Look how serious he is.

578
00:30:28,438 --> 00:30:31,228
(Walk around and talk nonsense. Act big!)
I've no energy left to walk.

579
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:33,618
I need to keep my energy.

580
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:35,378
Hmmm!

581
00:30:35,888 --> 00:30:36,828
Darn!

582
00:30:38,348 --> 00:30:39,968
You're right.

583
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,508
Miss Soo-hyun.

584
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,628
Can you promise me one thing?

585
00:30:45,698 --> 00:30:46,938
You mustn't tell anyone.

586
00:30:47,978 --> 00:30:48,648
Because...

587
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:52,088
if Mr. Wut knows that I've told you,

588
00:30:54,658 --> 00:30:55,978
I'll get fired for sure.

589
00:30:56,998 --> 00:30:58,008
Really, Phat?

590
00:30:58,648 --> 00:30:59,218
Really.

591
00:31:01,248 --> 00:31:03,088
I promise you. For Wut.

592
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:06,698
My Wut.

593
00:31:07,588 --> 00:31:08,968
My sweetheart.

594
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:15,638
Also,

595
00:31:16,488 --> 00:31:18,098
he might be here all night.

596
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:18,968
I think

597
00:31:19,858 --> 00:31:21,608
you better get back to your room, miss.

598
00:31:22,658 --> 00:31:23,658
Sure, Phat.

599
00:31:25,818 --> 00:31:27,668
Please take care of him for me.

600
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:30,208
Sure.

601
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:36,158
Phat.

602
00:31:37,268 --> 00:31:38,138
Promise me?

603
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,118
I promise.

604
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:56,148
Mission completed, sir.

605
00:31:56,758 --> 00:31:57,688
Please

606
00:31:57,968 --> 00:32:00,178
return to your sweet time with Miss Lisa.

607
00:32:06,238 --> 00:32:07,488
Your opinion as a woman.

608
00:32:08,878 --> 00:32:09,678
If you were her,

609
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,228
what would you do?

610
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:13,598
I already knew the room number,

611
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,078
so tonight I'd check

612
00:32:16,178 --> 00:32:17,818
if my boyfriend is with another woman.

613
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:26,848
Sorry for changing your room in haste.

614
00:32:27,018 --> 00:32:27,968
The thing is

615
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:31,128
Mr. Wut wants you to be
in the coolest room.

616
00:32:31,998 --> 00:32:32,818
Oh, my.

617
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:34,158
Typical Wut.

618
00:32:36,168 --> 00:32:36,638
Okay.

619
00:32:36,948 --> 00:32:37,948
This way, please.

620
00:32:39,908 --> 00:32:40,828
Please follow me.

621
00:32:46,478 --> 00:32:47,528
I'll ask you one more time.

622
00:32:49,458 --> 00:32:50,518
If you don't want to do this,

623
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:52,348
you can just lie down on your stomach.

624
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,988
I'll walk out of the bathroom.

625
00:32:54,438 --> 00:32:55,048
It'll work.

626
00:32:56,688 --> 00:32:58,438
No, I'm okay.

627
00:32:58,728 --> 00:32:59,638
It's alright.

628
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:03,288
We need to do the best
and make her speechless.

629
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:05,078
So we won't have to answer anything.

630
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:14,948
But

631
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:17,098
when Soo-hyun is here,

632
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:19,588
you can't be frozen up.

633
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:21,828
If that's the case,

634
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:23,558
our plan will be ruined.

635
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:28,638
So,

636
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,428
you just lie down.

637
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:32,778
What are you doing?

638
00:33:33,848 --> 00:33:34,348
Well.

639
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:38,218
Sorry. I said I'm okay, but...

640
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:39,988
I'm nervous.

641
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:41,668
Get down if you're not okay.

642
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:45,078
But I want to practice.

643
00:33:46,478 --> 00:33:47,278
Come on.

644
00:34:01,728 --> 00:34:03,668
Who's there? Open the door.

645
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,888
Hey! Touch my face.

646
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:07,128
Cover my face up.

647
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:08,618
Do it!

648
00:34:18,618 --> 00:34:19,478
Hey...

649
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:21,768
Wh-What are you doing?

650
00:34:23,158 --> 00:34:23,858
Wait.

651
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:25,878
H-Hey...

652
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,588
Hey.

653
00:34:40,298 --> 00:34:41,068
Hey, you.

654
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:43,548
Hey!

655
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,548
What are you doing?

656
00:34:47,318 --> 00:34:48,198
What's wrong with you?

657
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:49,578
Nightmare?

658
00:34:52,778 --> 00:34:53,608
Nightmare?

659
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:31,398
Listen.

660
00:35:31,528 --> 00:35:32,548
Don't go out.

661
00:35:32,918 --> 00:35:33,828
I need to

662
00:35:33,968 --> 00:35:34,658
send Mr. Wut

663
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:35,548
and Miss Lisa off.

664
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:38,438
And?

665
00:35:38,708 --> 00:35:39,638
How was I doing?

666
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,598
Doing what?

667
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:43,998
My work.

668
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:47,688
Not bad.

669
00:35:48,368 --> 00:35:49,238
Come on.

670
00:35:49,768 --> 00:35:51,868
If I did well, just say it, don't say

671
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:52,688
"Not bad."

672
00:35:57,998 --> 00:35:58,528
And

673
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,168
what are you drinking?

674
00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:02,418
This?

675
00:36:02,918 --> 00:36:03,778
Pennywort drink.

676
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:09,418
You have a taste of the old lady.

677
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:12,678
So why did you ask?

678
00:36:12,998 --> 00:36:14,488
It's healthy.

679
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:16,778
Anyway,

680
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:17,808
stay here.

681
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:20,718
Don't go out.

682
00:36:22,718 --> 00:36:24,058
Yes, sir.

683
00:36:56,688 --> 00:36:57,798
I'm so happy.

684
00:36:58,898 --> 00:37:00,008
Thank you.

685
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,488
The second one hasn't woken up yet?

686
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:12,008
Dating a young girl

687
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:13,848
consumes a lot of energy.

688
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:16,658
She looks like a reckless girl.

689
00:37:21,758 --> 00:37:22,428
What are you saying?

690
00:37:22,568 --> 00:37:23,938
I don't get it.

691
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:25,538
Ha-ha.

692
00:37:25,878 --> 00:37:28,338
Next time, don't bother.

693
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:30,528
Just tell me,

694
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:31,788
I'm sensible.

695
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:35,128
I have to keep this trip
a secret from my husband.

696
00:37:36,098 --> 00:37:37,408
Next time,

697
00:37:37,768 --> 00:37:39,078
we'll have fun again.

698
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:43,248
Hmm.

699
00:37:55,568 --> 00:37:56,158
Hey!

700
00:37:57,278 --> 00:37:57,918
Mr. Wut.

701
00:38:00,058 --> 00:38:00,968
Please calm down.

702
00:38:01,778 --> 00:38:02,358
I think

703
00:38:02,688 --> 00:38:03,938
we better get inside.

704
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:07,238
Let's go, sir.

705
00:38:07,528 --> 00:38:08,258
Oh, my.

706
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:09,318
Let's go.

707
00:38:10,298 --> 00:38:11,098
Do you want an inhaler?

708
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,588
I'm buzzed.

709
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:13,918
Where is it?

710
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:15,278
Here.

711
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:17,708
Whoa!

712
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:20,068
Let's go.

713
00:38:20,068 --> 00:38:20,908
This way, sir.

714
00:38:21,078 --> 00:38:21,728
Oh, my God.

715
00:38:36,378 --> 00:38:37,488
Old lady.

716
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:42,258
Spring chicken.

717
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:49,138
Nope.

718
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:57,988
Hey.

719
00:38:58,558 --> 00:38:59,808
May I ask you something serious?

720
00:39:01,748 --> 00:39:02,968
Did you ever think

721
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,758
that your job

722
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,848
is hurting people?

723
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:11,028
Is there someone sad
or crying after this event?

724
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:14,338
There's none.

725
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:15,468
But...

726
00:39:16,798 --> 00:39:17,568
Do you...

727
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:21,978
really want to support adultery?

728
00:39:24,318 --> 00:39:25,088
Don't get it wrong.

729
00:39:25,898 --> 00:39:28,078
I've never supported
nor been against it.

730
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,048
Everyone has a secret.

731
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,408
I've never judged people.

732
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:37,158
Okay, I get it.

733
00:39:38,518 --> 00:39:40,118
I just hope

734
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:42,268
that

735
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:43,958
you're not fooling yourself.

736
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,468
Hello, Mr. Wut.

737
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,278
Hurry up, Jim!

738
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:04,948
Phat!

739
00:40:05,448 --> 00:40:06,858
Quick.

740
00:40:06,958 --> 00:40:07,778
Let's get it.

741
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:09,398
Take them all, Mr. Wut.

742
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,988
Take them here.

743
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:14,158
- Jim.
- Over here, Phat.

744
00:40:15,068 --> 00:40:16,488
Give me more.

745
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:17,998
Darn you.

746
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,608
Here! Here! Here!

747
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:23,478
- I'll go get them over there, Mr. Wut.
- Sure. Do it!

748
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,288
Fire this chauffeur at once.

749
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,618
He doesn't drive smoothly.

750
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:45,118
I couldn't focus on wearing my lipstick.

751
00:40:45,498 --> 00:40:46,248
Yes, ma'am.

752
00:40:53,458 --> 00:40:54,648
Phat, take this.

753
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:56,058
Okay.

754
00:41:12,168 --> 00:41:12,808
Jim.

755
00:41:13,208 --> 00:41:13,708
Phat.

756
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:21,368
Why is the plan...

757
00:41:22,458 --> 00:41:23,358
blurry?

758
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:30,418
Oh, hi.

759
00:41:31,048 --> 00:41:31,938
You're back?

760
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:35,168
Didn't you tell me that
you'd be back next week?

761
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:38,598
I have an urgent matter,

762
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:40,418
at the branch company.

763
00:41:41,078 --> 00:41:43,448
So I want to check something up.

764
00:41:44,548 --> 00:41:45,958
Before firing somebody.

765
00:41:57,188 --> 00:41:57,838
Is she

766
00:41:58,448 --> 00:41:59,848
your new secretary?

767
00:42:10,538 --> 00:42:11,778
You have a good face.

768
00:42:14,138 --> 00:42:15,018
Newcomers

769
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:16,888
must work hard.

770
00:42:19,858 --> 00:42:20,408
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:42:22,178 --> 00:42:23,768

772
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:26,188
