5
00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:32,320
To our friendship.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,510
Cheers!

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,420
Here we go.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,850
Yay!

9
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,010
How is your car business, Heng?

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,420
I heard you made a fortune.

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,490
Not a fortune, Big Bro.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,290
It's not easy to import some super-cars

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,490
like before.

14
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,740
My men told me

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:52,940
that you secretly closed a deal

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,810
with Singaporeans two days ago.

17
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,440
Is that just a rumor?

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,730
What?

19
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,850
I never dare keep something from you.

20
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,600
Heng!

21
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,430
You know

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,230
the consequence,

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,610
if you do something behind us.

24
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,270
And if the police

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,470
can track us down,

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,970
can you take that responsibility?

27
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:27,440
Well, Big Bro...

28
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,590
It's not what you think.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,590
I just

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,440
want to make us greater.

31
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,550
Bro!

32
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,050
Trust me.

33
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,950
It's not what you think.

34
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,060
Bro!

35
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,080
Bro...

36
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,120
Darn it, Heng!

37
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,470
I've done editing.

38
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,200
I've cut out all of your pictures, Boss.

39
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,880
Those who betrayed us

40
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,820
deserve this.

41
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,420
This flash drive

42
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,930
stores confidential video clips

43
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,790
to blackmail business partners.

44
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:15,050
It also stores competitors' secrets,

45
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,450
including

46
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,340
my humiliating photos and videos.

47
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,530
That means

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,940
when we get that flash drive necklace...

49
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,030
We can delete Sis Ning's data

50
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,460
and use those data.

51
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,840
Boss Bird will get caught,

52
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,080
and Sis Ning will be free.

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,990
But how can we get that necklace?

54
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,860
Bird lets no one touch this necklace.

55
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,680
He wears it all the time.

56
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,080
He even wears it in the shower.

57
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,120
You can count on me.

58
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,660
There will always be a way.

59
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,670
Drive safe.

60
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,390
Cher.

61
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,310
A man like Phat

62
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,840
can't be trusted.

63
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,730
I know just by a glimpse

64
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,440
that you two have feelings
for each other.

65
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:20,210
Protect your own heart, just to be safe,

66
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,010
if you want to give it to someone

67
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,630
who lies for a living.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,180
Cher.

69
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,970
Oh, Cher.

70
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,500
You got an awesome mission

71
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,020
but told no one.

72
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,420
I invited them.

73
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,040
Sorry for telling you so late.

74
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,080
Whatever you say,

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,430
in this mission,

76
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,010
you need us, Sis.

77
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,370
I miss the old days.

78
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,650
Please take care of me,

79
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,150
Senior.

80
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,060
Thank you.

81
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,110
Thank you so much.

82
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,060
Let's go.

83
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,880
I'll explain our plan.

84
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,640
- Let me recall what happened.
- Yes.

85
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,560
=Catch Me Baby=

86
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,230
Sure, Boss.

87
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,990
But if you don't transfer money now,

88
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,970
I can't guarantee that you'll get
the Ayutthaya-period lintel.

89
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,970
(Boss Bird)

90
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:20,500
Boss Bird.

91
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,960
(Powerful Leader / Sis Ning's husband)
His hobby is collecting artifacts.

92
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,600
- Every Saturday,
- Excuse me...

93
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,540
he buys something at the store.

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,490
Sorry.

95
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,150
I was focusing on my business call.

96
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,360
I didn't realize I was blocking your way.

97
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,320
(Phattana Wongkawai,
an illegal dealer)

98
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,010
I can use this way to approach him.

99
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,410
You look familiar.

100
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,290
I'm Phat.

101
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,880
Phattana Wongkawai.

102
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,580
And you must be...

103
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,290
Mr. Bird?

104
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,120
I

105
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,940
once worked for Ms. Ning.

106
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,590
Phat?

107
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,550
Why?

108
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,450
Even if I recommended him to you,

109
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,910
can you really trust him?

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,580
Are you in the antique business?

111
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,240
Yes.

112
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,870
I do everything.

113
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,680
I trade in the market or even...

114
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,840
the black one.

115
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:08,260
What if he can't be trusted?

116
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,970
If he betrays me,

117
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,660
or doesn't play fair,

118
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,300
I'll just take him out.

119
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,750
I didn't mean to be rude,

120
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,750
but I overheard you talking about...

121
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,920
Ayutthaya-period lintel.

122
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,920
Oh...

123
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,310
About that,

124
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,700
I have it,

125
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,650
but a client of mine still

126
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:30,190
hesitates to wire the money.

127
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,840
Nice to meet you.

128
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,640
Likewise.

129
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,020
So...

130
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,240
When should we make the exchange?

131
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,240
(Exchange date)

132
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,110
Is it okay?

133
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,480
It's okay.

134
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,370
You're great.

135
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,390
And you

136
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,660
- go all the way.
- Right.

137
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,350
But I'm not sure if the mafia

138
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,990
really eats a lollipop.

139
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:55,190
It replaces a cigarette.

140
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,650
Oh, okay.

141
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,730
There are children around.

142
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,930
Okay.

143
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,090
Here he is.

144
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:03,580
Okay.

145
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:07,680
Let's go.

146
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:08,440
Yeah.

147
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:12,010
Good morning, Boss.

148
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,000
This is Jom,

149
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,090
my assistant.

150
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,590
Good morning, Boss.

151
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:22,560
(Jom,
Phat's right hand)

152
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,820
Is this

153
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,930
the exchange place?

154
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,810
About this business...

155
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,310
The shadier, the better, right?

156
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,690
So to speak.

157
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,220
Please come inside.

158
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:38,740
This way, please.

159
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,040
Please, Boss.

160
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,830
(Three days ago)

161
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,080
What is it?

162
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,680
Will this place

163
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,130
be the exchange place?

164
00:07:59,500 --> 00:07:59,940
Yes.

165
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm going to turn this into

166
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,590
a restaurant.

167
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,160
Huh?

168
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,560
A restaurant?

169
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,580
Wow!

170
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:09,960
It excites me.

171
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,260
Who's gonna renovate

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,910
this old place?

173
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:18,730
I've designed it.

174
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,410
It feels like a spy movie, Jim.

175
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,770
- Awesome.
- Cool.

176
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,420
But this plan won't succeed,

177
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,750
if I don't have your help.

178
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,190
I need you to disguise
yourself as the employees.

179
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,010
Wait.

180
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,710
I'd get your plan
if it was a massage salon.

181
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,800
But if it's a restaurant,

182
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,250
how will you steal the necklace?

183
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,500
A restaurant is the safest place
where theft doesn't happen often,

184
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,200
but it is also the easiest place
for thieves to steal.

185
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,000
Get me the appetizer.

186
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,960
(First dish)

187
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,250
Here comes the appetizer.

188
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,250
Wow.

189
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,120
Maybe after the dessert.

190
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,340
(Ah Lau,
a chef from Hainan)

191
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:39,010
Hello, everyone.

192
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,210
Hello.

193
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,340
I'd like to welcome you all
to Dali Kitchen.

194
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm Chef Lau, and I will
cook delicious dishes for you.

195
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:48,810
You're so young.

196
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,120
Are you a chef already?

197
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,950
Chef Lau went to
a cooking school in Hainan

198
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,040
when she was eight.

199
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,200
She's been back in
Thailand for just two years,

200
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,600
and opened a restaurant herself.

201
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,880
Let me tell you.

202
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,010
She's so experienced, Boss.

203
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,700
Yes.

204
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,710
In front of you

205
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,840
is our appetizer.

206
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,030
It will awaken the sense of your tongue

207
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,300
and your nose.

208
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,140
Please enjoy.

209
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:26,320
Spring roll?

210
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,290
Yes.

211
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,870
Maybe try it first, sir.

212
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,130
Delicious.

213
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,720
It was unexpected.

214
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,200
Was it, Boss?

215
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,780
When I first ate this,

216
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,960
I was thinking
"It's just a spring roll."

217
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,550
But when I took the bite,

218
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:08,990
it was like I'm in Yaowarat...

219
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,830
I mean Hainan, Boss.

220
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,300
Thank you. Thank you very much.

221
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,670
I'll prepare your next dish.

222
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,670
Enjoy your food.

223
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:22,240
Please excuse me.

224
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,880
These Yaowarat spring rolls are so good.

225
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,660
Girl.

226
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:30,930
These are not from Yaowarat.

227
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,130
They're from Hainan.

228
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,680
Hainan spring rolls.

229
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,760
Got it?

230
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,210
Hey!

231
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,200
But my recipe is from Yaowarat.

232
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,290
I've sold these for more than 50 years.

233
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,050
Yes, of course.

234
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,260
After this job,

235
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,980
I'll take everyone to your shop, Uncle.

236
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,890
(Uncle from Yaowarat)
Yes, please. I'm sure they'll love it.

237
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,110
Of course.

238
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,770
But now hurry up, Uncle.
I need to serve them.

239
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:56,810
- Okay.
- Yes.

240
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,530
Cook first, and talk later.

241
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,340
(Second dish)

242
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,560
The next dish is

243
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,290
the Hainanese goat stew.

244
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,010
I got this recipe

245
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,230
when I was observing
all the grandmas and grandpas

246
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,560
cooking this stew

247
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:15,280
for more than 72 hours.

248
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,380
You can call it

249
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,460
my childhood dish.

250
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,320
Please enjoy.

251
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,200
Please, please. Enjoy.

252
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,070
(I thought)

253
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,070
(you went to a cooking school in Hainan.)

254
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,990
(But you were born in Hainan, right?)

255
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,210
Yes?

256
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,860
(In Bangkok,)

257
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:38,140
(there aren't a lot of people
speaking Hainanese.)

258
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,210
(I'm lucky.)

259
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,080
(Are you okay?)

260
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:58,860
(Right.)

261
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,810
(I often meet people)

262
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,420
(speaking either Hokkien or Teochew.)

263
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:07,110
(But in Thailand,)

264
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,660
(I rarely meet)

265
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,240
(people speaking Hainanese.)

266
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,440
(The new generation)

267
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,860
(only )

268
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,220
(speaks Mandarin.)

269
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,640
I barely use it.

270
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,930
The last time I used it was
when my grandparents die.

271
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,790
So, uh, well...

272
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,950
Please enjoy your dish.

273
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,980
Please excuse me.
I'll prepare your next dish.

274
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:34,920
Dang!

275
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,470
Does method acting
involve learning the language?

276
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,960
You're the super-girl.

277
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,910
Excellent.

278
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:41,720
Boss.

279
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,080
Please.

280
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,720
Plan one.

281
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,350
Spilling food on the client
happens a lot in a restaurant.

282
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,820
We can do that

283
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,160
to make him get the necklace off.

284
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,090
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,240
Oh, my. Are you okay?

286
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,270
Are you okay, honey?

287
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,700
Is it hot? Is your skin okay?

288
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,070
You should take off your necklace.

289
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:19,980
I'm okay.

290
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,720
Just give me a new shirt.

291
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,720
You have to look closely...

292
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,800
I said I'm okay.

293
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:25,580
Go and get me a new shirt.

294
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,830
I hope you'll take care of
this waiter appropriately.

295
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:37,670
Sure.

296
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,130
We know what we have to do with him.

297
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,600
I'm sorry, Boss.

298
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,340
Boss. Please.

299
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,040
Boss.

300
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,060
Hey!

301
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,150
Please stop it.

302
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:52,980
Ouch!

303
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:53,950
Please.

304
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,410
Clean that up, please.

305
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,770
(Cher Yu,
Manager of Dali Kitchen)

306
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,820
As the manager,

307
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,740
I'd like to apologize to you.

308
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,210
I'll serve you myself from now on.

309
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,260
I do apologize
for the recent accident.

310
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,120
But let's continue
and have the next dish.

311
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,830
The next is our signature dish.

312
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,080
We have done some researches
and developed this dish

313
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,310
for more than seven years.

314
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,170
This one

315
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,260
is the best, Boss.

316
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,800
I'm in love with it every time.

317
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,630
(Third dish)

318
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,880
This is

319
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,370
the steamed electric eel with soy sauce.

320
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,610
Plan two.

321
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,630
The electric eel.

322
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,550
We imported the eel from Hainan,

323
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,610
when they were fresh

324
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,530
and alive.

325
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,180
And our soy sauce

326
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,530
is made from our secret recipe.

327
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,730
Interesting.

328
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,550
Let's eat.

329
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,880
Hold on, please.

330
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,250
For your safety,

331
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,440
please take your metal accessories off

332
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,680
before you start to enjoy this dish.

333
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,910
Because even if the eel is dead,

334
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,170
the electricity is still in their meat.

335
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,690
Are you crazy?

336
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:21,720
How is it possible?

337
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,810
Who's gonna believe your story
about that electric eel?

338
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,240
You're right, Jim.

339
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,960
Nobody would believe that.

340
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,770
But we're gonna create
a make-believe atmosphere.

341
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,470
And one of the important factors is...

342
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,330
Ms. Ning.

343
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,910
Oh, my!

344
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,440
I suddenly

345
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,040
feel that my throat is burning.

346
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:48,200
Here it is.

347
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,770
You get what I got, Ms. Ning.

348
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,990
Take off your necklace,
or you'll get a scar.

349
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,940
- Ow!
- Please take off your necklace.

350
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,030
I felt burnt just by looking at this.

351
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,790
You should do it, too.

352
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,910
Or, you'll get shocked just like me.

353
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,260
See?

354
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,820
Nothing happened to me.

355
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,810
So, I just missed this new experience.

356
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,670
It's normal.

357
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,040
There are people

358
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,190
who can tolerate it.

359
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,290
Maybe

360
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,270
your body has

361
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,310
more earth element

362
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:43,420
than most people.

363
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,670
Anyway,

364
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,980
enjoy your dish.

365
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,770
Plan three.

366
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,890
The mysterious ingredient.

367
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,110
According to what Ms. Ning told me,

368
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:56,950
we'll pretend that we've put an allergen
into Boss Bird's food.

369
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,430
So, he'll have an allergy.

370
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:04,710
And this is our last savory dish,

371
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:05,900
which is

372
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,400
the Hainanese crab fried rice.

373
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,270
This is made from our improved recipe.

374
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,730
We replaced the rice

375
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:14,660
with

376
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,340
the authentic Thai jasmine rice.

377
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,010
You can get

378
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,320
a smoother texture

379
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,160
and taste more flavors.

380
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,640
So to speak,

381
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,000
please try it.

382
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:46,430
This dish is not bad.

383
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,490
Right?

384
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:51,870
Boss.

385
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,520
Tell no one

386
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,330
about this.

387
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,070
This restaurant

388
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,470
uses a special ingredient.

389
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,310
What is it?

390
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:03,800
If I can recall,

391
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:05,290
it is...

392
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,180
broad bean.

393
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,320
What's going on, Boss?

394
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,170
Bird is allergic to broad beans.

395
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,170
He'll get a severe allergic reaction.

396
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,090
Huh?

397
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,910
How are you?

398
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,670
He's turning red now.

399
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:22,790
Honey?

400
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,340
- Relax, honey.
- Breathe, Boss.

401
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,100
I should take off your necklace.

402
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,610
But if we do that,

403
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,150
Boss Bird can be dead.

404
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,760
I told you that we'd pretend to,
but we wouldn't do it.

405
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:36,690
We'll make him think
that he has eaten it.

406
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,270
And bingo!

407
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,540
That's how we'll get his necklace.

408
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,040
I should take off your necklace.

409
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,410
So you can take a breath.

410
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,120
- Honey.
- Take a deep breath.

411
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,570
Hang on, honey.

412
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,740
Honey.

413
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,140
How are you?

414
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,970
- Are you okay?
- Breathe, Boss.

415
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,010
Relax, Boss.

416
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,590
Is he going to be okay?

417
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,060
- Is Boss Bird allergic to broad beans?
- Yes.

418
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:04,530
We didn't tell you

419
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,990
because we didn't think
you would use it.

420
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,060
We normally put some in the dish,

421
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,040
but there are no broad beans
in this dish.

422
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,280
Eh?

423
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,120
That's a relief, Boss.

424
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,680
Do you want some water, sir?

425
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:02,340
This flash drive

426
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,840
stores confidential video clips

427
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,200
including

428
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,130
my humiliating photos and videos.

429
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,300
And the last step

430
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,400
will be your responsibility.

431
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,370
We don't know
what is in that flash drive.

432
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,940
So, I want you to see it first.

433
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,010
Every dish was delicious.

434
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,900
Thank you, Phat,

435
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,230
for taking me
to such a great restaurant.

436
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,420
My pleasure, Boss.

437
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:49,370
So it's time, right?

438
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,340
May I open it?

439
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,860
And keep this in mind.

440
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,090
After you download every file,

441
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,270
I'll wait for you to get back

442
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,910
and ensure me

443
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,870
that the mission is completed.

444
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,540
Sure.

445
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:19,660
Please, Boss.

446
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,730
Police! The police are here!

447
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:33,650
Hey!

448
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,530
The police are here.

449
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,670
- They're not very far.
- What should we do?

450
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:36,260
I think...

451
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,990
- You should hide in the back.
- Hurry up.

452
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,200
They're coming.

453
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,560
Jom. Take him.

454
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,250
- Jom.
- What?

455
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,870
Jom. Jom!

456
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:46,160
- Oh!
- Take him to the back.

457
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,210
Oh, Jom! It's me, Jom. I'm Jom.

458
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,680
Let's go, Boss.

459
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,060
Hurry up.

460
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,570
- Go! Go! Go!
- Follow me, Boss.

461
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,090
- Go! Go!
- Hurry up!

462
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,010
I'm going!

463
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:56,850
Oh, my god!

464
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,060
Hey.

465
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,010
Are you okay?

466
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,900
This way, please.

467
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,740
What is it now?

468
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:10,900
Get up!

469
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,410
Freeze!

470
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,500
This is the police.

471
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,840
Illegal trading?

472
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,500
Please take Bird, Jom.

473
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,750
You have to leave me here.

474
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,710
Let's go, Boss.

475
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,280
Let's go, sir.

476
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,390
Boss. Go!

477
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,180
Hey!

478
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,740
Hey!

479
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:31,620
Let's go, Boss.

480
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:33,520
This way, sir.

481
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,810
=Catch Me Baby=

482
00:24:44,112 --> 00:24:46,822
=Catch Me Baby=

483
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:48,222
This way, Boss.

484
00:24:55,602 --> 00:24:56,272
Sorry, Boss.

485
00:24:56,692 --> 00:24:57,272
Are you okay?

486
00:24:57,512 --> 00:24:58,262
- Okay.
- Well,

487
00:24:58,402 --> 00:25:00,472
I just lured the police to another way.

488
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:02,672
And I called a taxi for you, Boss.

489
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:03,662
Here it is.

490
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:04,472
Your taxi.

491
00:25:04,472 --> 00:25:05,462
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

492
00:25:05,782 --> 00:25:06,502
Where is my lintel?

493
00:25:06,502 --> 00:25:07,402
Here it is, Boss.

494
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:11,152
My baby.

495
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,332
- Let's go.
- Get in the car, sir.

496
00:25:14,582 --> 00:25:16,212
No time to lose, Boss.

497
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:17,212
Get in the car, please.

498
00:25:22,632 --> 00:25:23,482
And I

499
00:25:23,582 --> 00:25:24,692
will take care of the rest.

500
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:27,812
Here.

501
00:25:28,242 --> 00:25:29,282
You might drop it when we were running.

502
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:30,342
About the payment,

503
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,742
we'll talk later.

504
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:32,672
I trust you

505
00:25:32,982 --> 00:25:33,652
- but...
- Hey!

506
00:25:34,552 --> 00:25:35,172
Go!

507
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:36,672
- Hurry! Go!
- Go! Go! Go!

508
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:55,012
It was exhausting.

509
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:56,582
It was tough.

510
00:25:56,582 --> 00:25:57,962
He believed us, though.

511
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:00,042
What the heck?

512
00:26:00,142 --> 00:26:03,312
- That's what I'm talking about!
- You! That's enough!

513
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:04,372
Right!

514
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:11,332
If you know how to speak Chinese,
just say it out loud.

515
00:26:11,332 --> 00:26:12,322
- Sure.
- I was panicking.

516
00:26:13,582 --> 00:26:15,232
- Dang!
- Alright, guys.

517
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:17,022
Thank you all.

518
00:26:18,972 --> 00:26:19,762
- No problem.
- Sure.

519
00:26:20,262 --> 00:26:21,592
Hello.

520
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:23,952
Now, are you speaking Chinese?

521
00:26:26,642 --> 00:26:28,332
It haunts me now, Jim. Don't tease me.

522
00:26:28,332 --> 00:26:30,152
But you look good in this costume.

523
00:26:43,942 --> 00:26:45,412
Phat had prepared everything for me

524
00:26:45,932 --> 00:26:47,032
before our plan began.

525
00:26:48,372 --> 00:26:50,252
I won't be safe if I stay here.

526
00:26:51,692 --> 00:26:54,122
I'll begin my new life in the U.S.
and won't come back.

527
00:27:01,342 --> 00:27:02,082
Okay.

528
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:05,192
So,

529
00:27:05,562 --> 00:27:06,472
does that mean

530
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:10,622
I will never see you again?

531
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,192
You can fly there,
if you want to see me.

532
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,042
But we'd better not see each other.

533
00:27:22,942 --> 00:27:25,512
Because we both have our life now.

534
00:27:27,932 --> 00:27:29,392
We barely relate.

535
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:36,152
I'm just...

536
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:38,902
a bad mother who left her child.

537
00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:44,312
I know I'm not a good mother.

538
00:27:47,462 --> 00:27:50,032
But seeing you grow up so well

539
00:27:53,252 --> 00:27:54,442
makes me so glad.

540
00:28:00,782 --> 00:28:01,712
So,

541
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:04,702
we'd better

542
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,162
say goodbye.

543
00:28:07,612 --> 00:28:09,232
I hope we don't meet again, Mom.

544
00:28:28,562 --> 00:28:29,082
Right.

545
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:31,542
I hope we don't meet again, my child.

546
00:28:44,482 --> 00:28:45,122
Remember,

547
00:28:46,362 --> 00:28:47,372
in this world,

548
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:49,952
nobody loves us

549
00:28:50,692 --> 00:28:51,582
more than ourselves.

550
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,552
I know.

551
00:28:58,262 --> 00:28:59,802
You taught me

552
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,032
to trust no one.

553
00:29:05,732 --> 00:29:06,292
Good.

554
00:29:48,982 --> 00:29:49,752
Okay.

555
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,582
Did Captain and Foei get home safely?

556
00:29:52,752 --> 00:29:54,952
Okay. Sure. I'll call you later.

557
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:58,282
Hey, you two.

558
00:29:58,432 --> 00:29:59,952
Go and get something to eat,
and clean up later.

559
00:30:00,372 --> 00:30:01,412
- Okay.
- Thank you.

560
00:30:01,412 --> 00:30:01,932
Sure.

561
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:05,752
Hey.

562
00:30:06,602 --> 00:30:08,512
Captain, Foei and Pinky are home

563
00:30:08,572 --> 00:30:09,132
safe and sound.

564
00:30:10,172 --> 00:30:10,962
Thank you, bro.

565
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:13,412
What if

566
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:15,232
Big Boss comes here again?

567
00:30:15,592 --> 00:30:16,452
What would you do?

568
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:18,752
Well, I'd pray

569
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:22,122
that our last plan works.

570
00:30:26,182 --> 00:30:27,232
Okay.

571
00:30:27,332 --> 00:30:28,182
I'll go home.

572
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:29,872
Be careful, Phat.

573
00:30:30,882 --> 00:30:31,352
Okay.

574
00:30:31,792 --> 00:30:32,382
But...

575
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:34,152
Don't worry about me.

576
00:30:35,172 --> 00:30:36,112
Worry about that person.

577
00:30:42,872 --> 00:30:43,952
Take care of each other.

578
00:30:44,232 --> 00:30:44,732
Bye.

579
00:31:06,142 --> 00:31:06,992
Thank you.

580
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:09,852
I don't know

581
00:31:10,722 --> 00:31:12,662
how to repay you, Phat.

582
00:31:13,802 --> 00:31:14,352
Easy.

583
00:31:14,762 --> 00:31:16,092
The fee is only

584
00:31:16,162 --> 00:31:18,282
546,890...

585
00:31:18,282 --> 00:31:18,962
Hey!

586
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:19,832
Enough.

587
00:31:20,182 --> 00:31:21,282
You're stingy.

588
00:31:23,032 --> 00:31:23,582
I'm just kidding.

589
00:31:24,442 --> 00:31:25,172
But...

590
00:31:28,412 --> 00:31:30,242
I'll really need the fees, Cher.

591
00:31:31,502 --> 00:31:32,072
What?

592
00:31:34,472 --> 00:31:35,192
Well...

593
00:31:37,322 --> 00:31:38,762
You need to be my housewife

594
00:31:41,422 --> 00:31:42,372
for 50 years. Okay?

595
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:02,722
Do you need to go this far

596
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,912
just to sell me a fake artifact?

597
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:14,082
It's not about that fake artifact.

598
00:32:15,142 --> 00:32:16,362
It's about the necklace.

599
00:32:17,312 --> 00:32:18,482
I guess it's priceless.

600
00:32:19,592 --> 00:32:20,622
What are you talking about?

601
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,032
I want to know

602
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,442
if everyone knows about the files
in that necklace,

603
00:32:26,782 --> 00:32:28,662
what will happen?

604
00:32:29,292 --> 00:32:30,692
If you release a video clip,

605
00:32:31,142 --> 00:32:32,732
the one who will be hunted

606
00:32:33,262 --> 00:32:34,302
is you.

607
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:37,652
Do you think they'll let you go easily?

608
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,222
Who told you I'll upload
the video clips to the internet?

609
00:32:41,632 --> 00:32:44,212
I just forwarded those files
to your alliance.

610
00:32:44,472 --> 00:32:46,442
So, they would know that in their group,

611
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:48,962
someone is waiting to betray them.

612

Luckily, I was careless,
and I forgot my thing.

616
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:28,322
And Cher...

617
00:33:32,372 --> 00:33:32,992
Hey!

618
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:36,752
How is Cher, Phat?

619
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:40,662
Cher!

620
00:33:51,952 --> 00:33:52,442
Cher.

621
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:54,712
Cher!

622
00:34:01,142 --> 00:34:01,892
Sorry...

623
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:06,242
My heart

624
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:09,632
is quicker than my brain,

625
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,622
as always.

626
00:34:16,382 --> 00:34:16,982
Cher!

627
00:34:19,332 --> 00:34:19,902
- Hey!
- Hello.

628
00:34:20,052 --> 00:34:21,112
I need an ambulance now!

629
00:34:21,402 --> 00:34:22,272
Immediately!

630
00:34:23,422 --> 00:34:24,392
Wake up, Cher.

631
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:25,352
Cher.

632
00:34:26,292 --> 00:34:26,802
Cher.

633
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:29,102
Stay with me. Don't fall asleep. Cher.

634
00:34:29,482 --> 00:34:30,042
Cher.

635
00:34:31,922 --> 00:34:32,612
Jim.

636
00:34:34,142 --> 00:34:35,842
She's bleeding!

637
00:34:38,482 --> 00:34:39,072
Cher...

638
00:34:40,142 --> 00:34:41,062
Cher.

639
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:42,952
Stay with me, Cher.

640
00:34:43,052 --> 00:34:44,822
Don't fall asleep.

641
00:34:45,472 --> 00:34:47,112
Stay with me.

642
00:34:47,992 --> 00:34:49,372
Cher.

643
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:50,952
Stay with me.

(Emergency)

645
00:34:55,942 --> 00:34:59,032
According to the news, Boss Bird
might escape aboard, Uncle.

646
00:35:01,762 --> 00:35:02,472
Anyway,

647
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,872
take care of yourself, Uncle.

648
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,062
Call me at once,

649
00:35:07,232 --> 00:35:08,342
if something happens.

650
00:35:10,092 --> 00:35:10,952
Okay, Uncle.

651
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:41,622
It has been three days, Cher.

652
00:35:43,882 --> 00:35:45,072
You need to wake up.

653
00:35:47,042 --> 00:35:48,972
You are a fighter, aren't you?

654
00:35:54,242 --> 00:35:54,852
And I've

655
00:35:56,432 --> 00:35:58,052
apologized to Chan.

656
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:00,672
Chan doesn't hold a grudge against me.

657
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:03,282
So, I'm working for him now.

658
00:36:09,992 --> 00:36:10,552
Here.

659
00:36:13,312 --> 00:36:14,722
I quit the relationship juggling job

660
00:36:15,392 --> 00:36:16,512
or any other job

661
00:36:17,012 --> 00:36:18,352
that needs to deceive people.

662
00:36:19,272 --> 00:36:20,472
I've done what I promised you.

663
00:36:21,922 --> 00:36:22,292
Here.

664
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:23,902
Look at it, Cher.

665
00:36:24,922 --> 00:36:26,222
I designed them myself.

666
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:31,672
See?

667
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:04,912
Remember.

668
00:37:06,212 --> 00:37:07,222
In this world,

669
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:09,862
nobody loves us

670
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,602
more than ourselves.

671
00:37:14,562 --> 00:37:15,372
I know.

672
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:19,672
You taught me

673
00:37:20,332 --> 00:37:21,792
to trust no one.

674
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:26,182
Good.

675
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,382
Mom.

676
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,022
What if

677
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:41,812
I want to be the giver for a change?

678
00:37:44,972 --> 00:37:46,002
You taught me

679
00:37:46,652 --> 00:37:48,762
that nobody loves us
more than ourselves.

680
00:37:49,672 --> 00:37:51,032
So we should love ourselves.

681
00:37:51,942 --> 00:37:52,662
But,

682
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:55,342
if we love ourselves enough,

683
00:37:56,962 --> 00:37:58,792
and we want to pass on our love

684
00:37:59,272 --> 00:38:00,432
to others,

685
00:38:02,242 --> 00:38:03,002
do you think

686
00:38:04,522 --> 00:38:06,322
they'll give their love back to us?

687
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:10,672
I did that once.

688
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:12,752
And it failed.

689
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,722
I did it with your dad.

690
00:38:49,652 --> 00:38:50,602
I don't know how he is now.

691
00:38:50,602 --> 00:38:51,892
Right, Jim.

692
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:53,962
I heard that he hardly sleeps,

693
00:38:54,092 --> 00:38:55,472
and he takes care of her 24/7.

694
00:38:55,472 --> 00:38:56,462
It has been so many days.

695
00:38:56,462 --> 00:38:58,542
Here he is. Look at his feet.

696
00:38:58,622 --> 00:38:59,902
He might be sleeping.

697
00:39:00,042 --> 00:39:01,532
I knew it. Look at him.

698
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:06,052
He looks like someone
who has never slept for ages.

699
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:09,312
Hey! Phat! Phat!

700
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:12,182
Wow. You sleep so deeply.

701
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:15,152
Hi.

702
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:16,622
- Hello.
- Hello.

703
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:18,132
Have you ever been home?

704
00:39:20,452 --> 00:39:21,362
Look at you.

705
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:28,242
You look like a corpse.

706
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:31,562
Jim. Look at his eyes.

707
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:32,872
- Wow.
- Those eye bags!

708
00:39:33,432 --> 00:39:35,942
Four, five, six! He's got six eye bags.

709
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:37,062
Wow.

710
00:39:37,932 --> 00:39:39,602
I think you should go and get some rest.

711
00:39:39,762 --> 00:39:42,092
Jim and I will take care of Cher.

712
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:44,202
And you can also take a shower. Dang!

713
00:39:44,552 --> 00:39:45,402
You smell.

714
00:39:45,402 --> 00:39:47,272
Just go, Phat. Go.

715
00:39:47,372 --> 00:39:48,692
You don't smell good. Go.

716
00:39:48,932 --> 00:39:49,492
Get a shower.

717
00:39:49,562 --> 00:39:50,482
I'll clean those up.

718
00:39:50,482 --> 00:39:51,582
I guess that blanket doesn't smell good.

719
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:52,282
So,

720
00:39:52,452 --> 00:39:53,202
can I count on you?

721
00:39:53,202 --> 00:39:54,252
Sure. No problem.

722
00:39:54,402 --> 00:39:55,542
Don't worry.

723
00:39:58,122 --> 00:39:59,912
Look at you. You have no energy left.

724
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:01,432
Look at your brother, Pink.

725
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:03,132
Is he all right?

726
00:40:06,552 --> 00:40:07,872
Change the flowers, Jim.

727
00:40:07,952 --> 00:40:08,512
Okay.

728
00:40:12,812 --> 00:40:13,812
They all withered.

729
00:40:14,892 --> 00:40:18,332
Now, I'm putting this bouquet in,
so it will be refreshing.

730
00:40:23,392 --> 00:40:26,492
When Cher wakes up,
she'll enjoy these beautiful flowers.

731
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:37,092
Poor Cher.

732
00:40:38,812 --> 00:40:42,722
Wake up now.
Phat's heart is breaking.

733
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:06,622
Yes, Jim.

734
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:08,612
Phat.

735
00:41:10,172 --> 00:41:11,452
Keep calm and listen to me.

736
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:14,172
The doctor told me

737
00:41:16,612 --> 00:41:17,802
that Cher is worsening.

738
00:41:26,542 --> 00:41:27,182
Phat.

739
00:41:29,162 --> 00:41:30,912
They're preparing the operating room.

740
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:33,612
They'll take Cher there in ten minutes.

741
00:41:36,552 --> 00:41:37,022
Look.

742
00:41:37,952 --> 00:41:39,392
If you have something to say to Cher,

743
00:41:40,402 --> 00:41:41,412
say it to her now.

744
00:42:20,672 --> 00:42:21,412
Cher.

745
00:42:24,112 --> 00:42:25,172
Don't give up.

746
00:42:26,672 --> 00:42:28,352
Fight as if you were fighting with me.

747
00:42:30,852 --> 00:42:32,882
You've been through a lot.

748
00:42:34,122 --> 00:42:36,492
You need to fight this too.

749
00:42:38,812 --> 00:42:40,132
Please, Cher.

750
00:42:42,042 --> 00:42:43,232
Wake up, Cher.

751
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:47,112
I can't live without you.

752
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:50,702
Cher.

753
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:52,582
Wake up, Cher.

754
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:06,372
It's not true, is it?

755
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:09,902
It's not true.

756
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:16,462
If you are not here,

757
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:21,922
I'll go with you.

758
00:43:35,142 --> 00:43:36,912
Surprise!

759
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:40,382
- Yay! Y... Phat?
- Yay! Yay!

760
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:41,052
Phat!

761
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:42,652
- What's wrong?
- Phat!

762
00:43:42,652 --> 00:43:43,762
- Hey! Phat!
- Phat!

763
00:43:43,902 --> 00:43:44,732
Sis?

764
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:46,152
- Get the doctor.
- What should we do?

765
00:43:46,152 --> 00:43:46,822
Doctor!

766
00:43:46,932 --> 00:43:49,312
- Go and get the doctor.
- But he's already gone.

767
00:43:49,312 --> 00:43:51,102
- Oh, man! Phat!
- Are you okay, Phat?

768
00:43:51,412 --> 00:43:52,492
I was just

769
00:43:52,492 --> 00:43:53,742
teasing you.

770
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,122
- Hey! Phat!
- Phat.

771
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:55,922
Is he dead?

772
00:43:55,922 --> 00:43:57,122
- What?
- Hey!

773
00:43:57,122 --> 00:43:58,762
- Phat! Phat! What's going on?
- Easy, Phat.

774
00:44:04,752 --> 00:44:05,842
I was just messing with you all.

775
00:44:09,602 --> 00:44:12,162
- Darn it, Phat!
- Phat! Are you a kid?

776
00:44:12,802 --> 00:44:14,712
What kind of sane person would
stab himself with a knife?

777
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:17,442
And what kind of sane person would
stab himself with a toy?

778
00:44:17,442 --> 00:44:18,592
- Whoa!
- Darn it, Phat!

779
00:44:19,802 --> 00:44:20,512
You!

780
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,202
- What kind of joke is that?
- Right!

781
00:44:22,802 --> 00:44:24,042
I thought it was for real.

782
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:25,382
- Did you panic?
- Don't say that.

783
00:44:28,762 --> 00:44:29,382
Hey!

784
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:32,652
You said you quit deceiving people.

785
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:36,782
Have you heard what I said?

786
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:39,862
Mmm.

787
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:45,282
You have been talking about the same
things by my bed every day.

788
00:44:45,872 --> 00:44:46,462
So,

789
00:44:46,862 --> 00:44:48,092
some of them
might have entered my brain.

790
00:44:52,342 --> 00:44:53,162
But I've never lied to you

791
00:44:54,162 --> 00:44:55,142
about my love for you.

792
00:45:06,392 --> 00:45:06,752
Hey!

793
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,492
We are not some pillows or chairs.

794
00:45:10,492 --> 00:45:11,932
Can't you wait until we leave?

795
00:45:12,102 --> 00:45:12,692
Right?

796
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:14,792
What's the rush?

797
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:16,532
Relationship juggler is a noun,

798
00:45:16,652 --> 00:45:17,252
which means

799
00:45:17,752 --> 00:45:20,622
an expert who arranges one's agenda,

800
00:45:21,072 --> 00:45:22,902
in order to keep a person's secret

801
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:24,532
from that person's lover.

802
00:45:26,072 --> 00:45:28,262
- My job is to keep the secret.
- Kiss her on her cheek!

803
00:45:29,482 --> 00:45:31,362
- Kiss her on her cheek!
- As long as the secret is kept,

804
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:34,542
I can keep my job.

805
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,872
But my new job
isn't about secret-keeping.

806
00:45:39,012 --> 00:45:40,172
Because we need to separate it
for two rooms.

807
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:42,872
The guest room and the kitchen...

808
00:45:42,872 --> 00:45:43,672
I do my new job

809
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:46,382
for the girl I love.

810
00:45:47,942 --> 00:45:48,792
Thank you.

811
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:52,872
I'm lucky

812
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,412
- that I could get a chance to correct
- Wut!

813
00:45:55,962 --> 00:45:57,492
- my mistakes.
- Come here, baby.

814
00:46:03,652 --> 00:46:04,612
But there are only a few people

815
00:46:05,482 --> 00:46:06,462
who can get a chance

816
00:46:07,002 --> 00:46:07,962
to correct their mistakes.

817
00:46:13,822 --> 00:46:15,132
And some relationship

818
00:46:15,832 --> 00:46:17,062
requires no explanation.

819
00:46:18,382 --> 00:46:20,532
But it doesn't mean
they can't be together.

820
00:46:20,582 --> 00:46:21,082
Hey.

821
00:46:21,202 --> 00:46:22,302
Is he here?

822
00:46:32,812 --> 00:46:34,002
Please come inside.

823
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:38,532
All we need is understanding.

824
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:42,122
And then, we can be happy
in our strange way.

825
00:46:45,492 --> 00:46:46,602
And in some relationships,

826
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:48,232
having another option

827
00:46:49,222 --> 00:46:50,302
might not be the worst thing.

828
00:46:51,672 --> 00:46:52,672
As long as

829
00:46:53,122 --> 00:46:54,662
you're not toying with people's hearts.

830
00:46:57,852 --> 00:46:58,902
In the end,

831
00:46:59,422 --> 00:47:00,722
you will find someone

832
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,822
who makes you so sure of your love.

833
00:47:03,332 --> 00:47:04,302
I'll do the laundry.

834
00:47:04,742 --> 00:47:06,032
In some relationships,

835
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:08,182
- they might fight all the time.
- Hey! Take that out.

836
00:47:09,052 --> 00:47:09,532
This one?

837
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:10,962
You can't mix the color.

838
00:47:11,132 --> 00:47:12,012
I'll do it.

839
00:47:12,402 --> 00:47:13,272
But you know what?

840
00:47:13,632 --> 00:47:14,842
The study says

841
00:47:14,972 --> 00:47:15,922
regular fight

842
00:47:16,022 --> 00:47:17,062
makes you love each other more.

843
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:17,812
Where are you going?

844
00:47:17,812 --> 00:47:18,542
Give it to me.

845
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:21,322
But I'm not 100% sure.

846
00:47:22,222 --> 00:47:23,722
I hope you can make up soon.

847
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:25,172
- Trash?
- No, yours is trash.

848
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:27,342
Can I have that?

849
00:47:27,342 --> 00:47:27,862
Sure.

850
00:47:27,862 --> 00:47:28,942
In some relationships,

851
00:47:29,572 --> 00:47:31,042
if one is always a giver,

852
00:47:31,692 --> 00:47:33,722
their love might not last.

853
00:47:38,432 --> 00:47:40,302
If you meet a good giver

854
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:41,932
and you're also a good taker,

855
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:43,842
then

856
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:46,832
your love will be balanced.

857
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:49,662
And it will gradually develop.

858
00:47:54,692 --> 00:47:55,542
Hey, you.

859
00:47:56,682 --> 00:47:58,102
Hurry up. It will be burnt now.

860
00:47:59,012 --> 00:48:00,862
No matter

861
00:48:01,152 --> 00:48:03,042
