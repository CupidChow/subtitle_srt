5
00:00:25,384 --> 00:00:25,944
Tan!

6
00:00:29,587 --> 00:00:30,292
Tan.

7
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:32,747
Don't fall asleep, Tan.

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,318
Tan.

9
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:35,229
Can you hear me?

10
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:39,560
Will Tan be alright?

11
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:41,261
He's not going to die, is he?

12
00:00:41,335 --> 00:00:42,069
Tan.

13
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:42,963
Can you hear me?

14
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,349
Family members stay out
of the emergency room, please.

15
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:46,082
We'll inform you.

16
00:00:46,128 --> 00:00:47,343
Please wait outside.

17
00:00:47,527 --> 00:00:48,229
Tan!

18
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,261
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:52,628 --> 00:00:54,812
I didn't want this to happen.

20
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,827
Don't say something like that.

21
00:00:58,012 --> 00:00:59,704
Nobody blames you.

22
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:01,598
Okay?

23
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:03,301
The good thing is
you're not hurt, Beauty.

24
00:01:03,496 --> 00:01:04,210
I know

25
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,459
that you didn't mean it.

26
00:01:26,946 --> 00:01:27,705
Beauty.

27
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:30,713
I...

28
00:01:31,721 --> 00:01:33,164
have told your parents.

29
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:35,553
They could be here any minute.

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,645
B...

31
00:01:39,407 --> 00:01:39,969
But...

32
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:42,346
It's okay.

33
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,255
I understand.

34
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:46,544
But

35
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,966
we need to tell them about this.

36
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:51,380
We'll talk about the other thing later.

37
00:01:54,576 --> 00:01:56,768
I don't know if I want to see his face.

38
00:01:57,807 --> 00:01:59,351
I don't know how to react.

39
00:02:06,678 --> 00:02:07,386
Beauty.

40
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,574
Can you give your dad a chance?

41
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,390
At least,

42
00:02:17,027 --> 00:02:18,804
give him a chance to explain

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,530
what happened.

44
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:24,562
And...

45
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,163
take your time to think

46
00:02:28,188 --> 00:02:29,321
about what you want to do.

47
00:02:30,322 --> 00:02:31,085
How about that?

48
00:02:39,572 --> 00:02:40,461
Beauty.

49
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,224
- How are you, sweetheart? Are you hurt?
- Don't...

50
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:49,361
Why did you do something like that?

51
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,176
I was so worried. Do you know that?

52
00:02:57,313 --> 00:02:58,005
Why?

53
00:02:59,844 --> 00:03:01,134
Go home.

54
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,090
And we can talk later.

55
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,795
No. I want to talk now.

56
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,655
Why did you have to deceive us?

57
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:11,785
Why do you have to cheat?

58
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,097
When you were doing something like this,

59
00:03:15,243 --> 00:03:16,624
have you ever thought about us?

60
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:17,821
Beauty.

61
00:03:17,922 --> 00:03:19,863
Mom, he's cheating on you

62
00:03:20,694 --> 00:03:22,027
with another man.

63
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:26,745
Beauty.

64
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,214
Go home now.

65
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,303
- And we'll talk later.
- Say something, Dad.

66
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:35,454
- Tell us it isn't true. Say it, Dad.
- Beauty.

67
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:55,845
I have known about this.

68
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:02,292
What did you say?

69
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:08,168
If you want to talk about this now,

70
00:04:10,201 --> 00:04:12,343
I need to tell you that
I have known about this for a long time.

71
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:19,015
Your dad has never deceived me.

72
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:21,053
I don't get it.

73
00:04:28,344 --> 00:04:29,490
What does it mean?

74
00:04:30,205 --> 00:04:31,775
Your dad and I love you

75
00:04:32,124 --> 00:04:33,257
so much.

76
00:04:36,097 --> 00:04:37,089
We love you so much that...

77
00:04:39,504 --> 00:04:43,033
we thought we needed
to wait until you grow up

78
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:48,838
to tell you the truth. We never intended
to keep it a secret from you, Beauty.

79
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,517
I don't get it.

80
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:53,744
But Dad is cheating on you, Mom.
He's cheating.

81
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,527
What about our family?

82
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,926
How can we be a family?

83
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:00,564
Tell me, Mom.

84
00:05:00,693 --> 00:05:02,408
How can we be a family?

85
00:05:03,719 --> 00:05:04,279
Sweetheart.

86
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:07,957
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:12,390
I'm gay.

88
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:16,315
I never wish

89
00:05:16,657 --> 00:05:18,400
that you'd forgive me, Beauty.

90
00:05:21,736 --> 00:05:22,988
I just want you

91
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,167
to know something.

92
00:05:28,088 --> 00:05:29,770
The fact that Mom and Dad love you

93
00:05:31,096 --> 00:05:32,057
is the truth.

94
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,097
Anyway,

95
00:05:39,097 --> 00:05:40,367
no matter what happens,

96
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,530
I still love you, sweetheart.

97
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:48,757
This is the only thing
I've never lied to you about.

98
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:50,243
Okay, sweetheart?

99
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:53,636
Dad.

100
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:56,726
I'm okay with you
being whatever you want.

101
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:59,825
But I'm not okay that
you don't love Mom anymore.

102
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,421
Listen to me, Beauty.

103
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:12,436
It's totally okay, sweetheart. It is.

104
00:06:14,203 --> 00:06:16,699
You don't need to
understand our situation right now.

105
00:06:19,001 --> 00:06:20,634
But we ask you to...

106
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,159
to trust us.

107
00:06:23,373 --> 00:06:25,309
We really love you.

108
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,428
And nothing will change that.

109
00:06:29,955 --> 00:06:32,907
And we will be a family forever,
sweetheart.

110
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:35,270
Trust me.

111

113
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:05,318
Foei.

114
00:07:06,373 --> 00:07:07,599
I'm going out for a meal.

115
00:07:08,003 --> 00:07:08,585
Do you need something?

116
00:07:11,292 --> 00:07:12,111
No, thanks.

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,222
I'm not hungry.

118
00:07:43,727 --> 00:07:44,950
If you can hear me,

119
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,570
wake up at once.

120
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,215
I want to keep fighting with you.

121
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,203
Do you hear me?

122
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,433
Hey...

123
00:08:26,915 --> 00:08:27,428
Tan?

124
00:08:28,646 --> 00:08:29,480
Are you okay?

125
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,561
Are you hurt?

126
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:40,180
Am I hallucinating?

127
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,070
You're worried about me.

128
00:08:46,914 --> 00:08:47,921
Am I dreaming?

129
00:08:49,385 --> 00:08:50,244
Darn you, Tan.

130
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,430
Everyone would
be worried in this situation.

131
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:03,552
If we were in the movie,

132
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:07,293
now it would be the moment

133
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:12,058
that you confess your love to me, right?

134
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,071
Bye.

135
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,153
Wait.

136
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:20,453
You're going to die this time.

137
00:09:21,747 --> 00:09:22,548
Are you okay?

138
00:09:22,802 --> 00:09:23,569
Ouch!

139
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:28,005
Easy.

140
00:09:33,943 --> 00:09:34,468
I...

141
00:09:35,812 --> 00:09:37,014
don't die easily.

142
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:39,551
I haven't gotten what I want.

143
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:43,181
Which is?

144
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:46,918
You.

145
00:09:51,902 --> 00:09:53,060
I really love you.

146
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:56,716
Be my boyfriend.

147
00:10:04,055 --> 00:10:05,313
Tan, you...

148
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,496
It's not the time.

149
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:30,609
Your lips don't need to say anything.

150
00:10:31,836 --> 00:10:33,274
'Cause your heart can't lie.

151
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,609
Mmm.

152
00:10:49,609 --> 00:10:50,341
What does "Mmm" mean?

153
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,199
It means "Mmm."

154
00:10:59,051 --> 00:11:00,032
I'm your boyfriend now.

155
00:11:32,081 --> 00:11:33,375
Is the patient awake?

156
00:11:38,594 --> 00:11:39,447
Please don't play

157
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,576
with that machine.

158
00:11:42,705 --> 00:11:43,426
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:52,598 --> 00:11:54,345
Call me if you need anything.

160
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,758
Yes. Thank you.

161
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:03,505
- What's with the smile?
- Ow!

162
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:05,299
Oh, I'm sorry.

163
00:12:20,971 --> 00:12:21,855
Come on.

164
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,455
Give them some time to think.

165
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:29,767
If we're gonna be a couple,

166
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,004
can I ask you something?

167
00:12:39,615 --> 00:12:41,322
You're gonna ask me to quit my job
as a relationship juggler, right?

168
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,652
I'm serious.

169
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,206
I now know

170
00:12:48,536 --> 00:12:49,754
why people need some agreement

171
00:12:50,219 --> 00:12:53,264
before they get together.

172
00:12:54,385 --> 00:12:56,497
And I can't stand watching you

173
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:58,686
earn money by deceiving people.

174
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:02,518
I understand.

175
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:04,948
And...

176
00:13:06,014 --> 00:13:06,736
what do you say?

177
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:08,874
Why don't you answer me?

178
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,373
Well...

179
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:17,863
Should I quit?

180
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:20,415
Hey.

181
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,555
Are you playing hard to get now?

182
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:23,428
Eh?

183
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:24,518
What about you?

184
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,376
How long have you played hard to get?

185
00:13:27,202 --> 00:13:28,645
Can you give me some of that?

186
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,034
Answer me, otherwise...

187
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:38,556
Fine.

188
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:41,429
I can't hear you.

189
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,615
I said "fine."

190
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,237
I'll quit my job.

191
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:47,100
Really?

192
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:48,503
Don't you trust me?

193
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,230
Yeah. Right.

194
00:13:51,015 --> 00:13:51,920
Can I trust you?

195
00:13:52,654 --> 00:13:53,562
Trust me for once.

196
00:13:56,964 --> 00:13:57,661
Okay, I trust you.

197
00:13:58,597 --> 00:13:59,566
My appetite is back.

198
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:05,895
What?

199
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:07,229
Why are you drinking water?

200
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,925
Have some beer.

201
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:10,298
I'll drive home.

202
00:14:10,648 --> 00:14:11,383
I can't.

203
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:12,370
What?

204
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:24,490
I'm exhausted.

205
00:14:31,108 --> 00:14:32,003
Thank you

206
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:34,109
for staying with me.

207
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:37,207
What's wrong with you?

208
00:14:38,404 --> 00:14:40,060
Every time something troubles you,

209
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,308
you would say this.
Do you realize that?

210
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:50,988
It's just...

211
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,616
We've been through a lot, right?

212
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,508
Every time I'm tired,

213
00:14:58,007 --> 00:15:00,312
whether it's from work
or from anything else,

214
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:03,538
when I'm home and see you,

215
00:15:04,661 --> 00:15:06,503
I feel like I'm so lucky.

216
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:10,271
Likewise.

217
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,213
Do you want to go out tomorrow?

218
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:17,873
Some cafe or some restaurant?

219
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,064
I have an errand to run tomorrow.

220
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:24,449
I'll be home late.

221
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,729
Do you want me to pick you up?

222
00:15:32,786 --> 00:15:34,045
It's okay. Get some rest.

223
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,126
But...

224
00:15:37,738 --> 00:15:38,652
It's okay.

225
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:45,168
Really.

226
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:47,906
I can come home by myself.

227
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,523
Yes?

228
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,631
Yeah, I'm coming up.

229
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,055
Phat?

230
00:16:06,517 --> 00:16:10,594
Earth, Water, Wind, Fire.

231
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:12,293
I'm Phat.

232
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,722
I'll hang up. See you up there.

233
00:16:24,855 --> 00:16:25,605
It's Fah.

234
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:37,554
I give up.

235
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:39,121
Hey, what?

236
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,177
Why did you give up so easily?

237
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:43,296
Before we're a couple,

238
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:45,311
we were rivals.

239
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,170
This is the staring contest

240
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,834
that you used to trick girls with, right?

241
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,185
So what?

242
00:16:55,133 --> 00:16:55,794
So...

243
00:16:56,711 --> 00:16:58,062
Have you ever got one from this game?

244
00:16:58,897 --> 00:16:59,652
About three, I guess.

245
00:17:01,452 --> 00:17:02,160
What are you laughing at?

246
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,006
How about you?

247
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:05,050
How many people?

248
00:17:08,892 --> 00:17:10,212
Darn!

249
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:11,995
Are you kidding me?

250
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,773
Hello! How are you...?

251
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:16,583
Hello.

252
00:17:17,707 --> 00:17:18,790
I'm okay, Pink. It's just...

253
00:17:18,907 --> 00:17:25,155
- Foei, how are you? Are you tired?
- I'm so tired.

254
00:17:25,552 --> 00:17:27,780
My dog gives me less headache than him.

255
00:17:28,874 --> 00:17:30,025
Dog, really?

256
00:17:30,461 --> 00:17:31,202
Give me your chin.

257
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:33,131
- There, there.
- Good boy.

258
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:33,975
And you're not a dog?

259
00:17:34,022 --> 00:17:35,100
Ahem!

260
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:37,935
Has Fah

261
00:17:38,019 --> 00:17:39,541
visited you?

262
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,526
- Who's Fah?
- Who's Fah?

263
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:48,080
Nothing?

264
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,869
No! Not that. I mean...

265
00:17:49,994 --> 00:17:50,971
We've got a problem.

266
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,485
Thank you.

267
00:17:52,597 --> 00:17:55,046
Get well soon, Tan.
I'll leave your gifts here.

268
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:56,470
Bye.

269
00:17:57,148 --> 00:17:58,218
- See you. Darn!
- Hey!

270
00:18:02,814 --> 00:18:03,478
I think

271
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:05,338
they might be friends, Pink.

272
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,141
Not true.

273
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:09,085
My instinct as a woman tells me

274
00:18:09,249 --> 00:18:10,674
that it's her lover.

275
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:11,548
Guarantee.

276
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:12,481
I know what you're saying.

277
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:16,224
But Jim and Fah have been through this
when they first dated each other.

278
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,321
Fah doesn't have many male friends.

279
00:18:18,628 --> 00:18:21,300
So, Jim misunderstood
when she went out with a male friend.

280
00:18:21,676 --> 00:18:22,907
It took quite some time to clear.

281
00:18:23,189 --> 00:18:25,415
- And it was nothing.
- But this time,

282
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,039
I think it's something.

283
00:18:28,183 --> 00:18:31,038
Let me talk to Fah about what happened.

284
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:33,872
Are you going to talk to Fah?

285
00:18:34,395 --> 00:18:36,324
H... How are you going to ask her?

286
00:18:36,868 --> 00:18:37,883
Are you going to say something...

287
00:18:40,372 --> 00:18:41,486
"Excuse me, Fah.

288
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,717
Are you having an affair?"

289
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:44,778
Like this?

290
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,629
Who would tell you?

291
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:49,055
In this situation, I think

292
00:18:49,235 --> 00:18:51,469
- we should tell Jim.
- Jim won't believe you.

293
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:53,863
We don't have any evidence.

294
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,395
But...

295
00:18:56,405 --> 00:18:57,509
What if it's true?

296
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:00,622
If Jim found out that we already knew

297
00:19:00,918 --> 00:19:02,191
but didn't tell him,

298
00:19:03,249 --> 00:19:04,705
wouldn't he be sad?

299
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:11,150
You're suddenly sleepy.

300
00:19:13,404 --> 00:19:15,970
It's you who'll decide
whether you'll do it or not.

301
00:19:16,496 --> 00:19:17,292
But I know

302
00:19:17,443 --> 00:19:18,211
who can help

303
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,791
in this case.

304
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:24,921
(Who killed Areya?)
I've been waiting for your next book.

305
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,930
I love your work.

306
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,774
Can't wait for your next book.

307
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:33,576
Gorb will be leaving now.
I'm sorry, guys.

308
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:36,079
My apology.

309
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,125
I have many book signing events today.

310
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,645
So, I have to leave now.

311
00:19:41,802 --> 00:19:42,457
Lately,

312
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:43,551
I'm hot.

313
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:45,908
Literally.

314
00:19:47,468 --> 00:19:50,512
Mr. Gorb. One more book, please. Wait.

315
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,230
(Who killed Areya?)
Mr. Gorb, one more, please.

316
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:57,606
Thank you.

317
00:19:57,935 --> 00:19:59,414
Since I met you,

318
00:20:00,817 --> 00:20:01,825
I've realized something.

319
00:20:03,144 --> 00:20:03,916
It's over.

320
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:05,073
With your mistress?

321
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,260
With my wife.

322
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,055
Hell

323
00:20:09,432 --> 00:20:09,990
is real.

324
00:20:18,369 --> 00:20:20,619
Hey! Do you know Mr. Gorb?

325
00:20:20,665 --> 00:20:22,642
How do you know him?

326
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,228
And why are you here?

327
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,603
Well, not really.

328
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,880
He was my client.

329
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:32,693
What did you tell me?

330
00:20:33,397 --> 00:20:35,210
You told me that you'd quit
being a relationship juggler.

331
00:20:35,492 --> 00:20:36,303
And what is this?

332
00:20:36,391 --> 00:20:38,600
You're working for my favorite author.

333
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,020
(Dear Phat and his girlfriend from Gorb)

334
00:20:51,095 --> 00:20:51,891
What?

335
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,012
How did you get that?

336
00:20:54,283 --> 00:20:56,673
It was a payment for my work
from Mr. Gorb.

337
00:20:57,224 --> 00:20:57,920
It's for you.

338
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:01,454
Darn it!

339
00:21:02,228 --> 00:21:03,572
Should I be happy?

340
00:21:04,168 --> 00:21:07,549
- Should I thank him? Hold on.
- Take it or leave it.

341
00:21:08,332 --> 00:21:09,291
I'll take it.

342
00:21:10,043 --> 00:21:10,832
I don't

343
00:21:11,131 --> 00:21:14,429
mix business with personal things.

344
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:16,306
I'm professional.

345
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:21,722
- Can't you separate those two for me?
- No. You've got to quit your job.

346
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:22,735
Come on.

347
00:21:23,555 --> 00:21:24,325
Listen.

348
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:26,760
I was really going to quit,

349
00:21:27,462 --> 00:21:27,938
but...

350
00:21:28,516 --> 00:21:30,627
there were some...

351
00:21:35,552 --> 00:21:36,245
three clients left.

352
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:39,376
Come on.

353
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,461
I have bills to pay
before I find a new job.

354
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,820
(Pinky)

355
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:54,481
About that,

356
00:21:54,898 --> 00:21:56,096
we'll come up with a plan.

357
00:21:56,257 --> 00:21:57,137
I need to work now.

358
00:21:57,943 --> 00:21:58,713
Hey, you!

359
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,999
How can you leave me like that?

360
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,164
What's with her?

361
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:13,642
Pinky. Are you sure

362
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:14,700
that you need my help?

363
00:22:15,108 --> 00:22:16,771
I'm more than sure.

364
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:19,437
Cher.

365
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:20,983
Did you forget

366
00:22:21,101 --> 00:22:22,984
that you own me one?

367
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:24,961
I own you?

368
00:22:25,753 --> 00:22:26,373
What is it?

369
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,818
Eh? You own me

370
00:22:28,904 --> 00:22:30,127
because I gave Phat to you.

371
00:22:30,956 --> 00:22:33,225
If I didn't get out of your way,

372
00:22:33,322 --> 00:22:36,495
Phat would never fall for you like that.

373
00:22:46,885 --> 00:22:48,137
Hey! There she is.

374
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:48,599
Where?

375
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:50,896
She's going in.

376
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,176
I think

377
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,497
she might be visiting Tan.

378
00:22:56,882 --> 00:22:57,516
No way.

379
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:58,932
I've asked Tan already.

380
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,731
Excuse me.

381
00:23:09,604 --> 00:23:11,932
Which room does the patient named
Fah Siriwan Banleurut

382
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:13,111
stay in?

383
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:15,121
Wait a moment, please.

384
00:23:16,956 --> 00:23:18,801
Ms. Fah Siriwan Banleurut

385
00:23:19,525 --> 00:23:21,771
is our gastritis patient.

386
00:23:22,123 --> 00:23:23,781
But she isn't admitted to our hospital.

387
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:29,900
Oh, I thought she was. She has been
complaining about her stomachache.

388
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:32,550
Her symptom isn't severe enough
to be admitted.

389
00:23:32,781 --> 00:23:33,935
But right now,

390
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,384
she might be having lunch with Dr. Jue

391
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:37,580
in the cafeteria.

392
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:39,884
Dr. Jue?

393
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:43,275
- Oh, Dr. Jue, Fah's boyfriend.
- No, he's not.

394
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:45,474
They're just friends.

395
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:47,466
Oh, I see.

396
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:48,693
Thank you.

397
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,963
Smile. Okay.

398
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:58,154
- Now change your post. Yes, there it is.
- This way?

399
00:23:58,389 --> 00:23:59,978
Give me the sweetest smile.

400
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,304
Do you want to check your photos?

401
00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:02,956
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

402
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:06,281
Here. Check them out.

403
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:08,210
Hey.

404
00:24:08,645 --> 00:24:09,314
See?

405
00:24:12,856 --> 00:24:13,895
How is this photo?

406
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:17,961
- It's so good, bright and yellow.
- It's okay, isn't it?

407
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,090
Next step.

408
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:33,366
=Catch Me Baby=

409
00:24:33,478 --> 00:24:36,278
=Catch Me Baby=

410
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:43,958
I'll try to press you,

411
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:45,888
and you'll tell me where it hurts. Okay?

412
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:46,718
Okay.

413
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:51,178
But now I feel pain over here,

414
00:24:51,678 --> 00:24:52,898
over there,

415
00:24:53,078 --> 00:24:53,778
and...

416
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:56,328
over here.

417
00:25:01,468 --> 00:25:03,688
Well, uh, you...

418
00:25:04,108 --> 00:25:04,958
Turn around, please.

419
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:07,258
Okay.

420
00:25:12,548 --> 00:25:13,248
Does it hurt here?

421
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:16,308
It is not.

422
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:21,128
You have a very gentle touch, Doctor.

423
00:25:21,328 --> 00:25:24,398
You must be a caring man.

424
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,368
Nowadays, women

425
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,628
prefer caring men like you.

426
00:25:31,598 --> 00:25:32,998
Doctor.

427
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,218
Are you dating someone?

428
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:35,158
I am.

429
00:25:35,818 --> 00:25:36,938
Really?

430
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:40,668
It's a shame that you've been taken.

431
00:25:41,988 --> 00:25:42,668
Well,

432
00:25:42,928 --> 00:25:44,208
your girlfriend.

433
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:46,228
What is she like? How does she look?

434
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:47,338
What is her deal?

435
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:49,418
So, I could get a chance

436
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:51,738
to have a boyfriend like you.

437
00:25:52,748 --> 00:25:53,538
Well,

438
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:55,628
Tall, fair skin,

439
00:25:55,778 --> 00:25:57,098
and neat.

440
00:25:58,888 --> 00:25:59,638
What about hair?

441
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:01,768
Shoulder-length hair?

442
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:03,338
Yes.

443
00:26:03,428 --> 00:26:04,298
Shoulder-length hair.

444
00:26:04,628 --> 00:26:06,348
Black or brown hair?

445
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:08,168
Straight hair?
Is part of her hair in the middle?

446
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:09,828
Straight,

447
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:13,278
and dark brown hair.

448
00:26:13,348 --> 00:26:14,428
Wow.

449
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:16,638
From what I've heard,

450
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:19,558
she seems pretty as me.

451
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:23,478
And what's her name... Ah!

452
00:26:43,088 --> 00:26:44,368
So? Did you get something?

453
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:45,218
I did.

454
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:46,158
What did you get?

455
00:26:46,278 --> 00:26:47,738
I got hurt!

456
00:26:50,688 --> 00:26:54,118
What kind of violent doctor is he?

457
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:57,338
I guess

458
00:26:57,858 --> 00:26:58,918
maybe

459
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:01,498
Fah has done nothing.

460
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,568
Cher.

461
00:27:03,128 --> 00:27:05,508
You too?

462
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:09,088
I thought you'd help me.

463
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:11,668
I'll help you, all right?

464
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:14,058
Fah?

465
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:18,388
Dr. Jue and I?

466
00:27:19,368 --> 00:27:20,888
He was my classmate
during the first two years of college.

467
00:27:25,408 --> 00:27:28,658
We should apologize
for misunderstanding you.

468
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:30,298
It's okay.

469
00:27:30,368 --> 00:27:32,428
This is not the first time.

470
00:27:34,148 --> 00:27:34,938
I see.

471
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:37,198
Phat has told me

472
00:27:37,278 --> 00:27:37,978
that you

473
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:39,348
were popular.

474
00:27:39,418 --> 00:27:41,658
I guess this happens to you often.

475
00:27:43,198 --> 00:27:44,258
I'm so sorry.

476
00:27:44,488 --> 00:27:45,488
It's okay.

477
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:46,638
Actually,

478
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:48,748
we've known each other
since we were students.

479
00:27:48,948 --> 00:27:50,418
But people don't know that.

480
00:27:50,658 --> 00:27:52,228
They often misunderstand us,

481
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:54,208
assuming Dr. Jue and I were a couple.

482
00:27:54,728 --> 00:27:57,248
Like when you saw us
having a meal together, Cher.

483
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,938
Ms. Siriwan Banleurut, please come in.

484
00:28:04,218 --> 00:28:04,978
Yes.

485
00:28:05,328 --> 00:28:06,208
See you later.

486
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:11,978
How

487
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:12,908
does Fah know?

488
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:15,308
Know what?

489
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:19,178
She knows that we were spying on them
when they were having a meal together.

490
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,058
We didn't tell her about that.

491
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:27,778
Maybe she saw us
when we were recording her, Cher.

492
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,698
I don't think so.

493
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:32,218
If she had seen us,
she would have said something.

494
00:28:32,668 --> 00:28:33,908
It's unusual.

495
00:28:36,438 --> 00:28:37,508
Or...?

496
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,758
Wait for me, Cher.

497
00:28:45,908 --> 00:28:46,628
Phat.

498
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:51,108
I knew it.

499
00:28:52,728 --> 00:28:53,838
Fah and Dr. Jue

500
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:54,908
are dating, right?

501
00:28:57,628 --> 00:29:00,178
It's you who'll decide
whether you'll do it or not.

502
00:29:00,728 --> 00:29:01,588
But I know

503
00:29:01,588 --> 00:29:02,508
who can help

504
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:03,908
in this case.

505
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:10,748
Hello, Fah.

506
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,238
Phat, I really don't know.

507
00:29:14,318 --> 00:29:15,468
When

508
00:29:15,568 --> 00:29:16,698
we had a fight,

509
00:29:17,968 --> 00:29:19,808
Dr. Jue just came at the right moment.

510
00:29:22,408 --> 00:29:24,108
Those two won't let this go.

511
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:27,088
They would look into it
until they found something.

512
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,688
You should honestly
break up with him, Fah.

513
00:29:39,458 --> 00:29:40,708
But the one I want to break up with

514
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:43,538
isn't Dr. Jue.

515
00:29:52,468 --> 00:29:53,628
It's a matter of your family.

516
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:55,448
I could not intervene.

517
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:57,988
But when the time comes,

518
00:29:59,858 --> 00:30:00,838
you have to decide.

519
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:07,888
Hey, you!

520
00:30:08,478 --> 00:30:09,418
How can you leave me like that?

521
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:10,698
Fah.

522
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:14,668
Those two might go to
the hospital looking for you.

523
00:30:15,598 --> 00:30:16,668
Listen to me carefully.

524
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:19,698
Do what you always do.

525
00:30:20,538 --> 00:30:22,448
Buy some food and coffee,

526
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:23,818
or goof around.

527
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:26,078
If something goes wrong,

528
00:30:27,098 --> 00:30:27,858
I'll take care of it.

529
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:30,848
What I told you is the truth.

530
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:34,688
I'm just buying her some time
until she can make up her mind.

531
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:37,208
So this time,

532
00:30:38,278 --> 00:30:39,738
can you both back off?

533
00:30:40,668 --> 00:30:41,688
I'm begging you.

534
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:43,658
Phat.

535
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:45,888
Why did you do this?

536
00:30:47,448 --> 00:30:48,288
I'm sorry, Pink.

537
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,928
But Jim is a significant person to me.

538
00:30:51,898 --> 00:30:53,098
So, I want it to end before he knows.

539
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,288
What if Fah keeps postponing?

540
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:56,918
What will you do?

541
00:30:58,068 --> 00:30:59,078
Don't worry about that.

542
00:30:59,588 --> 00:31:01,338
Fah has to make up her mind
by the end of today.

543
00:31:02,108 --> 00:31:02,818
So,

544
00:31:03,398 --> 00:31:04,468
don't do anything rash.

545
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:06,078
I'm begging you.

546
00:31:09,248 --> 00:31:12,028
Can I ask you to do one thing for me?

547
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:14,898
This time,

548
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:19,278
I want it to be your last juggling.

549
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:42,168
I've never thought Fah
would do something like that.

550
00:31:42,968 --> 00:31:44,158
I pity Jim.

551
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:46,518
But,

552
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:47,378
maybe

553
00:31:47,378 --> 00:31:48,948
Fah is

554
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:50,158
struggling too.

555
00:32:01,238 --> 00:32:02,918
I'm sorry to disturb you, Dr. Jue.

556
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:04,398
But...

557
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:06,218
Fah has something to tell you.

558
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:09,468
What is it?

559
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:10,428
And...

560
00:32:10,738 --> 00:32:12,398
- You are...
- Don't mind me.

561
00:32:14,338 --> 00:32:15,218
It's Phat.

562
00:32:15,678 --> 00:32:17,248
He is Jim's colleague.

563
00:32:18,268 --> 00:32:19,108
Have a seat, Jue.

564
00:32:32,478 --> 00:32:33,108
Jue.

565
00:32:37,298 --> 00:32:38,498
I've made up my mind.

566
00:32:44,638 --> 00:32:46,468
I have to choose the righteous path.

567
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:51,558
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:54,118 --> 00:32:55,928
It's all my fault.

569
00:32:58,118 --> 00:32:59,568
Don't feel guilty, Jue.

570
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,578
I let my emotions get the best of me.

571
00:33:12,688 --> 00:33:13,138
Fah.

572
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:17,408
You told me you weren't happy.

573
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:20,558
If you get back to him,

574
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:23,488
you have to live through the same thing,

575
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:27,318
and live through an unhappy marriage.

576
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,818
How long will you endure it, Fah?

577
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:36,168
I'm sorry.

578
00:33:38,118 --> 00:33:39,138
I'm really sorry.

579
00:33:47,628 --> 00:33:48,518
Are you sure?

580
00:34:15,338 --> 00:34:16,068
Hello, Jim.

581
00:34:17,048 --> 00:34:17,748
What's up?

582
00:34:21,858 --> 00:34:22,248
Phat.

583
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:25,318
How long have we known each other?

584
00:34:27,748 --> 00:34:28,868
What's up with you?

585
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,808
Suddenly ask me such a strange question.

586
00:34:32,608 --> 00:34:33,918
I just want to know,

587
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:35,188
all this time,

588
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:37,158
what I've done wrong to you.

589
00:34:38,198 --> 00:34:38,728
Jim.

590
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:41,148
Is it a prank or something?

591
00:34:46,238 --> 00:34:46,928
Hello.

592
00:34:47,478 --> 00:34:48,448
Jim.

593
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:49,958
Are you okay?

594
00:34:50,228 --> 00:34:51,148
Do you want me to come to you?

595
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:55,428
I've never thought that one day,

596
00:34:56,048 --> 00:34:57,678
you'd do something like this to me.

597
00:34:59,228 --> 00:34:59,858
Jim.

598
00:35:00,218 --> 00:35:01,268
Listen to me.

599
00:35:01,868 --> 00:35:03,748
Do you think my marriage

600
00:35:04,388 --> 00:35:06,628
is just another showcase
of your juggling skill?

601
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,848
Huh, Phat?

602
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:09,158
Bro.

603
00:35:09,468 --> 00:35:10,108
Listen to me.

604
00:35:10,678 --> 00:35:11,458
Let me explain.

605
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:13,008
What the heck do you want to explain?

606
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:17,438
I saw it myself that you
helped Fah and that darn doctor.

607
00:35:21,158 --> 00:35:23,188
Or, are you going to tell me
that I misunderstood all this

608
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,998
and show me some fake photos?

609
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,068
Like that time you helped Mr. Wut?

610
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:34,838
Do you think I'm stupid?

611
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:37,848
I know everything.

612
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:41,218
New perfume?

613
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:45,478
Hurry up, or you'll be late.

614
00:35:46,028 --> 00:35:46,898
You're right.

615
00:35:46,898 --> 00:35:48,308
Since the day Fah changed,

616
00:35:49,998 --> 00:35:51,528
I've started to follow her.

617
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:54,848
I wanted to know who she was with

618
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:56,788
and what she was doing.

619
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,138
Do you know how hurtful it is

620
00:36:01,268 --> 00:36:02,758
to see your loved one

621
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:05,418
smiling at another man?

622
00:36:10,748 --> 00:36:12,488
The only thing I can do
is blaming myself.

623
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:16,268
I thought I am not good enough.

624
00:36:16,288 --> 00:36:17,468
I'm exhausted.

625
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:21,838
I couldn't make my wife happy.

626
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:26,738
Do you know what's really funny, Phat?

627
00:36:32,048 --> 00:36:33,758
I believed she still loved me.

628
00:36:36,898 --> 00:36:38,868
I believed she loved me more than him.

629
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,008
But what I can't believe

630
00:36:45,868 --> 00:36:46,798
is what you did.

631
00:36:48,398 --> 00:36:49,958
You used your juggling skill

632
00:36:50,038 --> 00:36:51,128
on me.

633
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,908
Tell Fah for me

634
00:36:57,678 --> 00:36:58,938
that I love her so much.

635
00:36:59,778 --> 00:37:00,228
Jim.

636
00:37:00,998 --> 00:37:01,558
Jim, wait.

637
00:37:02,038 --> 00:37:03,088
Wait.

638
00:37:09,108 --> 00:37:10,128
What's happening?

639
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:14,028
Jim.

640
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:18,048
Are you here, Jim?

641
00:37:18,718 --> 00:37:19,418
Jim.

642
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:21,918
Where are you, Jim?

643
00:37:24,088 --> 00:37:25,238
What's wrong, girl?

644
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,448
Have you seen a man this tall,

645
00:37:27,448 --> 00:37:29,088
skinny, with short hair?

646
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:30,858
No, I haven't.

647
00:37:31,308 --> 00:37:32,398
Okay. Thanks.

648
00:37:32,758 --> 00:37:33,558
Excuse me.

649
00:37:33,988 --> 00:37:36,168
Can you have a missing
person announcement, Tu?

650
00:37:36,218 --> 00:37:36,968
Attention, please.

651
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:39,558
Mr. Jira Banleurut,

652
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,508
aged 35 years old,

653
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,258
about 175 centimeters tall,

654
00:37:43,258 --> 00:37:45,198
skinny, white skin,

655
00:37:45,268 --> 00:37:46,618
an overseas Chinese.

656
00:37:47,038 --> 00:37:49,438
Please contact
the information on the ground floor.

657
00:37:49,998 --> 00:37:50,568
Thank you.

658
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:51,618
What?

659
00:37:54,518 --> 00:37:55,138
Sorry.

660
00:37:55,438 --> 00:37:56,598
- Hey!
- Is that Jim?

661
00:37:56,978 --> 00:37:57,728
Your phone.

662
00:37:57,728 --> 00:37:58,218
Yeah.

663
00:37:59,788 --> 00:38:00,268
Here.

664
00:38:00,808 --> 00:38:01,438
Phat.

665
00:38:01,528 --> 00:38:02,958
Jim's going to the roof.

666
00:38:04,388 --> 00:38:05,178
Thanks, Tan.

667
00:38:05,468 --> 00:38:06,458
You keep looking at the CCTV.

668
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:08,378
Keep me updated if something happens.

669
00:38:09,398 --> 00:38:10,168
Well?

670
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:12,048
Roof.

671
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:13,628
Jim's going to the roof.

672
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:16,078
You take the elevator.

673
00:38:16,448 --> 00:38:17,428
I take the stairs.

674
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:18,198
So, we can make it in time.

675
00:38:18,498 --> 00:38:19,258
See you on the roof.

676
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:19,758
Yeah.

677
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:29,498
Jim!

678
00:38:50,148 --> 00:38:50,878
I was wrong.

679
00:38:52,978 --> 00:38:53,948
Come down, Jim.

680
00:38:56,138 --> 00:38:57,648
Don't do anything crazy.

681
00:38:58,228 --> 00:38:59,008
I'm begging you.

682
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:03,138
Fah chose you!

683
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,648
Fah chose you, Jim.

684
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:20,548
Please come down.

685
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:24,488
Give me a chance to explain everything.

686
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:26,528
Please.

687
00:39:31,658 --> 00:39:32,478
Darn you!

688
00:39:34,048 --> 00:39:36,048
Why the heck did you lie to me, Phat?

689
00:39:37,318 --> 00:39:38,238
I don't believe you.

690
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:40,058
