5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,980
You've hired an additional secretary.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:29,400
I don't think
it's work that's overloaded,

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,750
but mistresses are overloaded.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,910
You're so good, Phat.

9
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,160
You had been managing this job so far.

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,850
If I didn't have

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,860
a master detective like Cher to help me,

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,000
I couldn't catch you in the act.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,710
Thank you for your long-time service

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,440
to my husband, Phat.

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,080
But from now on,

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,370
your service is no longer required.

17
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,270
Hey.

18
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:39,070
Are you okay?

19
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,190
I'm okay.

20
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,450
If you were fired because of this,

21
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,820
I couldn't be more regretful.

22
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,750
What's your next plan?

23
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,470
Hey!

24
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,170
Wait.

25
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,770
I...I'm sorry.

26
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,680
I've been lying to you.

27
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,530
And so good.

28
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,380
I just did my job.

29
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,030
You would understand, wouldn't you?

30
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:31,750
It's alright.

31
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,400
It's business.

32
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,750
Nothing personal.

33
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,350
I understand.

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,950
Phat.

35
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,770
I told you not to trust her!

36
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,990
You can't give in, Phat.

37
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:54,790
I...

38
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,760
I'll get revenge.

39
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,450
For the things she has done to you.

40
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll get her...

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,080
It's like when you help me with my task.

42
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,080
We do whatever the client wants.

43
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,790
Cher just...

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,780
did her job.

45
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,690
Who are you?

46
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,310
When did you possess my brother's body?

47
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,870
Get out of his body!

48
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,700
Get out!

49
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,570
Too much TV?

50
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,790
But Phat.

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,180
I'm just worried for you.

52
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,660
And you're still defending her?

53
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,380
I'm still your good old brother.

54
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,090
Just...

55
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:46,780
be more understanding.

56
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,410
And...

57
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,500
What's your next move?

58
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:59,290
=Catch Me Baby=

59
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,000
Shoot!

60
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,900
- Foei.
- Huh?

61
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,860
Hey! What?

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,770
What?

63
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
What happened last night?

64
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,300
Nothing important, we just...

65
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,920
We've been drinking and...

66
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,370
you fell asleep so I went home.

67
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,490
About your hickey,

68
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,620
is that a mosquito bite?

69
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,550
Really?

70
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:33,930
But why do I have a feeling

71
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,380
that there was something more?

72
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,480
I feel that

73
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,710
you and I

74
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,130
kissed.

75
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,710
Or, was it just a dream?

76
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,480
Yes!

77
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,490
It was a dream.

78
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,240
Darn! Who would want to kiss you?

79
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,580
You had a very strange dream.

80
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,650
What a relief.

81
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,420
Or I would ruin my rating among girls.

82
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,020
I'm relaxed now.

83
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,240
Tan. You asked me out.

84
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,690
It's already late afternoon.

85
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,580
Yes, I'm coming.

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,780
Yeah, yeah.

87
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,410
And don't go after my friend again.

88
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,880
Come on!

89
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,280
Release!

90
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,430
Oh, my God!

91
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:42,250
Please!

92
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,000
Again, please.

93
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,110
More, please.

94
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,160
Again, please.

95
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,500
Here we go!

96
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:55,190
Go get it!

97
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,350
Raise your bank note,
if you want a cure.

98
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:02,450
The more money,
the faster you'll be cured.

99
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,690
I don't believe him.

100
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,680
A medium for Poseidon?

101
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,090
How did he come up with the idea?

102
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,110
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

103
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,380
I taught him myself.

104
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,790
Okay!

105
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,360
After Phat lost his job,

106
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,500
he's never stopped performing
even for a day, Dad.

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,060
He might love it.

108
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,790
Well.

109
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,140
Are you worried about him?

110
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,440
He's just hurt.

111
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,930
He'd better keep himself busy,
so he won't be bored to death.

112
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,900
Plus, after he's back home,

113
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,790
I have more income,

114
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,570
and I don't need to suffer my back.

115
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,610
Dad, hold that thought.

116
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,260
We're talking about Phat.

117
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,200
You always mention the debt.

118
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,190
Can we stop thinking about that?

119
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,090
Okay, sweet heart.

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,850
It's almost done.

121
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,420
Go check if Phat finishes his performing.

122
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,160
So he could eat.

123
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,410
This afternoon,

124
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,580
there will be another group of followers.

125
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,190
Look at you.

126
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:10,130
- Thank you, God.
- May you get better and better.

127
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,960
Please bless me, God.

128
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,470
- Please make me rich, God.
- Thank you, God.

129
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,600
- Please make me rich, God.
- Please let me win a lottery.

130
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,310
Keep begging! Keep begging!

131
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,520
Keep begging...

132
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,720
Huh?

133
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,650
Poseidon just makes himself disappear.

134
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,410
He is a real ideal.

135
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:34,820
Phat...

136
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,320
Where is he?

137
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,600
I said I would treat you a meal.

138
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,260
You've ordered this much.

139
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,210
Don't you have food at home?

140
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,620
Hey, stop nagging me like a grandma.

141
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,750
You made me lose my job.

142
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,870
You won't be broke just for this.

143
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,490
Ms. Pum pays you a lot, right?

144
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,600
Well, she's quite generous actually.

145
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,190
So generous that
I can treat you like this

146
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,750
very often.

147
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,770
Hey.

148
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,620
Can I tell you something serious, now?

149
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:34,760
Say it.

150
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,120
The thing is,

151
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,500
I want to

152
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,510
offer you a job.

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,720
What job?

154
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,020
At your law firm?

155
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:46,760
No, detective.

156
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:51,860
Please.

157
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,570
Can you

158
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,300
pack these for me?

159
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:56,960
And get me another set of these, please.

160
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:57,920
Okay.

161
00:09:58,470 --> 00:09:59,080
Thank you.

162
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:02,670
Wait.

163
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,220
Add another dish of shrimp.

164
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,850
Ready?

165
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,150
Look,

166
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,630
I'll open a detective agency.

167
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,030
Actually, I have opened one,

168
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,470
so I want someone

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,700
who's skilled like you in my team.

170
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,890
I know

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,200
that our work ethics might not be

172
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,470
compatible with each other.

173
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,600
But I

174
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,570
respect your skill.

175
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,330
If you're willing

176
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,640
to work with me.

177
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,160
No.

178
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,180
Hey!

179
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,900
What's the rush?

180
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,510
Why don't you
think about it for a few nights?

181
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,480
What do you want?

182
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,820
Why don't you just say it?

183
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,420
Listen,

184
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,500
we might know each other not for long,

185
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:57,100
but I can see when you're not being honest.

186
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,210
Well, I...

187
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,460
I really want you in my team.

188
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,350
Okay, fine.

189
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,550
I feel guilty.

190
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,870
So I'm trying

191
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,710
to help you.

192
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,790
You lost your job because of me.

193
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:27,600
I knew it.

194
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,610
That's why you go all the way here.

195
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,000
But...

196
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,300
I'm trying to be as honest as I can.

197
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,350
So?

198
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,770
What do you say?

199
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,200
Well,

200
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,870
can I think about it for...

201
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,080
five nights?

202
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:49,940
Really?

203
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
Will you really consider it?

204
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:52,780
Yes.

205
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,400
Let's shake hands.

206
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,280
Thank you.

207
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,360
3,700 baht!

208
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,290
Hey, wait...

209
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,600
Wait.

210
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,050
Are you going now? Wait...

211
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:18,800
Uh...

212
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,630
Can I pay by bank transfer?

213
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,840
Auntie!

214
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,790
Hello.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,770
Have you eaten?

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,430
Don't pay overdue next time, okay?

217
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:41,990
Or you'll get hurt again.

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,330
Let's go.

219
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,370
Easy.

220
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,440
Well,

221
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,520
I just wanted to

222
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,490
expand our shrine.

223
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,220
So I got a loan.

224
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,240
So you got a loan-shark?

225
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,900
Oh, that's what people call it?

226
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:30,200
Dad!

227
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,450
Stop acting innocent.

228
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,340
You always think we could only
cause you headache!

229
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,600
How much, Uncle?

230
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:45,910
50,000?

231
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,070
That's the principal.

232
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,770
Plus 200,000 interest.

233
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,050
Well,

234
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,630
I have some savings.

235
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,110
You can use it for the next due.

236
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,080
Phat.

237
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,500
Phat.

238
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,850
Don't go this far.

239
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,350
I could find another way.

240
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,890
I heard about Ms. Kiang, Chaem's wife.

241
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,860
She's gonna open an investment.

242
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,470
You can invest 10,000
and you'll get 1,000 returns.

243
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,550
Dad!

244
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:26,860
Stop it!

245
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,070
It'll only get worst.

246
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:29,960
Look!

247
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,790
My friend got scammed for 100,000.

248
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,500
You can't get money that easily.

249
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,550
And look!

250
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,780
Look at you.

251
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,690
Phat.

252
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,190
I'll drop out of school,

253
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,100
and help with your work.

254
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,620
- As for my dream...
- You can't.

255
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,690
If you do that,

256
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,320
I won't be able to
send my sister to university.

257
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,210
There's nothing for you to do.

258
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,060
I'll take care of it.

259
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,320
It's nothing,

260
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,930
compared to what you've done for me.

261
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,330
Don't you worry.

262
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:39,730
(Truth never dies)

263
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,660
Oh, hey!

264
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:49,070
How do you know where I live?

265
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,630
If I can't even find your house,

266
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,080
I wouldn't be good enough
to work with you.

267
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,760
Is your house in Nordic style?

268
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,710
Yes.

269
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,530
You have an architecture degree, don't you?

270
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,610
Did you investigate me?

271
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,770
Well,

272
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,170
I am a detective.

273
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,470
You need to pay me in cash.

274
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,470
50,000 baht per month.

275
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,660
But I need three months upfront.

276
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,700
We can begin immediately.

277
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,270
Okay.

278
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,730
I happen to have a job tomorrow.

279
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,210
Be prepared,

280
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,330
Detective.

281
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,050
Talk to me, Boss.

282
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,720
I'm sorry, Sis.

283
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:06,950
Please don't harm me.

284
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,720
Please.

285
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:08,890
Sorry?

286
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,190
How dare you

287
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,460
be my husband's mistress.

288
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,500
You mistress,

289
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,680
have no shame.

290
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,070
Die!

291
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,560
Darn you!

292
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:22,770
Why?

293
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,650
Do you even want to stab me?

294
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,180
A girl like you

295
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,470
should get some punishment.

296
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,430
Why are you crying?

297
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,140
Why?

298
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,330
You should get

299
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,060
some punishment!

300
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,370
Here's some punishment for you!

301
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,280
Why?

302
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,440
Cut! Cut!

303
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,370
- Why? Huh?
- Enough! Cut! Cut!

304
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,410
He's called cut. It's been cut.

305
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,080
Is it okay?

306
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,790
- It ended late, right?
- Yes, it did.

307
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,400
Fuse, take care of her.

308
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,880
- Roll one, scene four, cut three.
- Let's wrap it.

309
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,930
Excuse me.

310
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,150
Hurry up.

311
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,760
Are you okay?

312
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,840
I'm so sorry.

313
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:58,220
I got too deep in the role.

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,310
Yes, I'm okay.

315
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,130
You can take a break, Mew-mew.

316
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,910
Please prepare for the next scene.

317
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:05,790
- Change scene.
- Scene 21, okay?

318
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,330
Art department, let's go.

319
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,140
You slapped me for real.

320
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,930
But when you kicked the table leg,

321
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,840
you screamed so loud.

322
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,480
It's her.

323
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,520
Ms. Mew-mew,

324
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,770
an actress, suspected
to be the director's mistress.

325
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:19,490
She's good at acting.

326
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,770
Got so deep into the character.

327
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,660
I was so excited with her.

328
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,260
Right?

329
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,600
That's why I can't catch anything.

330
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,680
Yes, sis.

331
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,110
She's also very careful.

332
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,200
I've tracked her calling history.

333
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,360
There's nothing wrong.

334
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,630
But they come to the set together
every day.

335
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,810
That's why we are here
at the crime scene?

336
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,670
But from what I saw,

337
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,790
there's nothing suspicious.

338
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:42,690
Let's roll.

339
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,360
Fuse, clear the set.

340
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,770
That's impossible.

341
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,400
My affair radar is never wrong.

342
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,550
There must be something

343
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,170
between this girl and the director.

344
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,710
Okay.

345
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,390
Go!

346
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,920
Focus!

347
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,500
Be more quick!

348
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,290
Don't lose focus.

349
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,590
Go on!

350
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:07,810
Don't stop.

351
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,060
There's no victory for laziness.

352
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,640
For those who go easy,

353
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,020
or skip the set,

354
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,390
you have to practice again!

355
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,310
Who are those three?

356
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,190
This place is restricted. Get out!

357
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:29,550
I've investigated the surroundings

358
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,010
for a few times in advance.

359
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:33,420
I found nothing from Ms. Mew-mew.

360
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,060
I still think that

361
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,130
as long as the sun rises in the morning,

362
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:40,090
Chot will always have another lady.

363
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,330
He doesn't let me touch his phone.

364
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,950
When we eat,
he would put his phone face-down,

365
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,060
because he's afraid
that I may see his texts.

366
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,160
And there's his shirt.

367
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,430
Sometimes he doesn't wear the same shirt

368
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,840
that he wore when he went out.

369
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,110
As an excuse, he would say

370
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,700
it was hot at the set.

371
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,810
I couldn't do anything.

372
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,380
And about the digital footprint.

373
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,490
They rarely talk to each other.

374
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,370
They just leave an emoji

375
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,250
or an emoticon as a comment.
Something like that.

376
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,700
Normally, adulterous activities

377
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,190
have a regular meeting place.

378
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,420
But in this case,

379
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:16,690
he either goes to the set or goes home.

380
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,470
My opinion is

381
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,410
Mew-mew is the one.

382
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,010
You have to catch them in the act.

383
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,100
I'll get them both.

384
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,340
Eh? Hey!

385
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,510
You want to die?

386
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,820
I said "no laid back."

387
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,410
- Do it again from the top.
- Foei.

388
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,000
You said they leave emoticon comments.

389
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,360
Can I see those?

390
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,650
Here you go.

391
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,070
They just leave a comment.

392
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,990
(mmewmew___
Chot replied___...)

393
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,240
Although time always goes forward,

394
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,950
I still come back to be your mistress.

395
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,210
Cut! Cut!

396
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:14,990
Slate, please.

397
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,950
Scene 69, cut one, take one.

398
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Listen,

399
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,240
I want

400
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,850
to explain to you

401
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,320
about the emotional scene,

402
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,140
and what you need to do is to fix it.

403
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,100
Hey.

404
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,140
I've got an idea.

405
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,140
You have said

406
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,010
that adulterous activities

407
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,820
normally have a meeting place.

408
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,840
Yes.

409
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,120
But what if they just have some feelings
and haven't slept together?

410
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,610
It'll be hard.

411
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,940
I want to try one thing.

412
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,490
Come with me.

413
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,290
Sir.

414
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,350
Please,

415
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,700
fix the light for me.

416
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,740
What?

417
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:07,560
Please.

418
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,000
I need to go to the bathroom.

419
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:10,710
I need to pee.

420
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,690
Fine. Just go.

421
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,580
Hurry up.

422
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,180
And you're just a trainee.

423
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:15,680
But...

424
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,380
please don't tell Uncle Job.

425
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,590
I don't want to get in trouble.

426
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,080
Just go. Hurry.

427
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,650
Thank you.

428
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,130
You need to show you emotion.

429
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,600
The eyeline. Fix your gaze.

430
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,890
That's it. This is so good.

431
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,280
Okay.

432
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:36,310
Let's roll.

433
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,710
Ready?

434
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,640
Guys.

435
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,360
One more time, please.
Fuse, go get the mark.

436
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,620
Yes, sir.

437
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:44,820
Hey.

438
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,330
How is it?

439
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,120
Hurry up!

440
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,500
I'm sorry.

441
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,410
I'm...

442
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,040
under the weather.

443
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,240
If you're sick...

444
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,220
Wait. Stop.

445
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,320
Sick?

446
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,050
Yes.

447
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:22,610
Get some rest.

448
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,990
Go. Don't come to work.

449
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,290
I'm so sorry.

450
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,200
I need money for my baby.

451
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,890
Oh, right?

452
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:31,580
Yes.

453
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,250
You're a hard worker.

454
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,850
I'll get back to work.

455
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,360
Sure.

456
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,140
I'm sorry.

457
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,180
I'll get back to work.

458
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,830
Please.

459
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,160
Go.

460
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,900
Shoot!

461
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
You're so cool.

462
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,450
Poor him.

463
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,160
He's too careful. There's
something wrong with him, I guess.

464
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:51,440
Foei.

465
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,560
Do you remember his parking spot?

466
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,500
Sure.

467
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,610
The crew made trainees like me

468
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,540
set the parking area since 05:00 AM.

469
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:00,830
Be careful.

470
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:01,900
Okay.

471
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,270
And you,

472
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,030
follow me in ten seconds.

473
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,310
Don't order me. I know my role.

474
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,220
I practiced my acting.

475
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,380
Don't order me,

476
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,120
I told you not to do that.

477
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,440
Don't.

478
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,690
What?

479
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,670
You scared me.

480
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,090
Come here.

481
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:42,910
Quickly.

482
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,250
Put the gloves on.

483
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:49,770
Help me.

484
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,600
What's wrong with you?

485
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,720
Okay.

486
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,280
Darn you.

487
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,910
What are you doing?

488
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:19,390
Recreate the scene.

489
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,020
Come here.

490
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,250
Have you ever managed to have

491
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,010
an affair in the car?

492
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,620
Yes.

493
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,960
Even on the boat,

494
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:31,840
but

495
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,580
I've never done the plane.

496
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,320
And all of them

497
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:37,340
were having sex?

498
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,900
I think it's about

499
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,850
80%.

500
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,020
What about the remaining 20%?

501
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:42,370
They were just eating?

502
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,400
Let's swap the seat.

503
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
Sis, get out!

504
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:13,330
The director is coming to his car.

505
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,640
=Catch Me Baby=

506
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:36,373
Keep an eye on him.

507
00:26:37,463 --> 00:26:38,023
For what?

508
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:39,043
Just do it.

509
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:07,653
What?

510
00:27:08,763 --> 00:27:09,703
It's not mine.

511
00:27:10,083 --> 00:27:11,153
I'm darn sure.

512
00:27:11,453 --> 00:27:12,973
I bought a cheap one from a supermarket.

513
00:27:13,623 --> 00:27:14,333
Keep watching.

514
00:27:33,533 --> 00:27:34,853
Why did you do that?

515
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:36,713
I want to check something.

516
00:27:37,053 --> 00:27:37,683
What is it?

517
00:27:44,243 --> 00:27:46,773
Okay, it's a wrap. Thank you, guys.

518
00:27:46,803 --> 00:27:47,843
Ms. Mew-mew.

519
00:27:48,553 --> 00:27:49,023
Yes?

520
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:51,333
You look prettier now than you're on TV.

521
00:27:51,443 --> 00:27:52,583
May I take a photo with you?

522
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:53,803
Sure.

523
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:02,013
Wow, you smell so good.

524
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,293
If I'm not mistaken,
it's Miracle by Lancôme, isn't it?

525
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:07,193
Oh, yes.

526
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:08,743
Here you go.

527
00:28:08,743 --> 00:28:09,643
My card.

528
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:11,323
I'm from a modeling agency.

529
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:13,123
If I come across an interesting gig,

530
00:28:13,183 --> 00:28:14,723
I'll contact you, Ms. Mew-mew.

531
00:28:15,993 --> 00:28:16,593
Thank you.

532
00:28:24,243 --> 00:28:26,983
The supermarket branch code
from receipts

533
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:30,003
is the one at the condominium,

534
00:28:30,123 --> 00:28:31,993
the Royalty BTS Phra Khanong.

535
00:28:33,113 --> 00:28:33,713
Guess what?

536
00:28:34,273 --> 00:28:36,703
Where does Mew-mew stay,
according to IG check-in?

537
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,283
The Royalty Phra Khanong, isn't it?

538
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,543
And the perfume that Mew-mew wears

539
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,303
is the same as

540
00:28:44,413 --> 00:28:45,963
what I smelt in the director's car.

541
00:28:47,343 --> 00:28:48,463
So can we conclude

542
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:49,373
that they're having affair?

543
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:52,273
But...

544
00:28:53,203 --> 00:28:54,943
There's still a loophole.

545
00:28:55,573 --> 00:28:56,113
You're right.

546
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:59,033
These things are not solid enough

547
00:28:59,383 --> 00:29:00,753
to prove that they're having sex.

548
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:02,983
Mmmh.

549
00:29:04,313 --> 00:29:06,613
And from Coach Joy's testimony,

550
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,253
she said the director

551
00:29:08,493 --> 00:29:10,663
sleeps at home with her every night.

552
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:12,873
That means Mew-mew's room

553
00:29:13,343 --> 00:29:16,263
might not be the place
for their love affair.

554
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:18,603
Foei.

555
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:19,243
Yes?

556
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:21,633
If you found a girl's underwear
in your car,

557
00:29:21,913 --> 00:29:22,773
would you keep it?

558
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,073
Why would I keep it?

559
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:27,813
It's insane.

560
00:29:29,923 --> 00:29:30,583
But...

561
00:29:31,773 --> 00:29:32,853
the director kept it.

562
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:37,353
We found their place.

563
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:39,623
Guys,

564
00:29:40,003 --> 00:29:40,553
look at it.

565
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:46,663
Doesn't it look familiar to you?

566
00:29:47,523 --> 00:29:48,073
What is it?

567
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:49,563
A thread?

568
00:29:52,403 --> 00:29:53,023
Foei.

569
00:29:56,613 --> 00:29:58,423
A string from a condom wrapping box.

570
00:30:00,073 --> 00:30:01,373
The sizes of these things

571
00:30:01,543 --> 00:30:02,623
are never the same.

572
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:05,343
It always depends on the packaging.

573
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:06,683
But the most important thing is

574
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:08,723
that the red string from the box

575
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,533
always has the same smell

576
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:13,013
as the condom itself.

577
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:14,833
Smell it.

578
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,003
That's why I'm sure

579
00:30:18,123 --> 00:30:19,253
that Mew-mew

580
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,823
and the director prefer orange flavor.

581
00:30:23,813 --> 00:30:24,303
Foei.

582
00:30:24,453 --> 00:30:26,573
Do you remember
Mew-mew's comment on his IG?

583
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,433
(mmewmew___
Replyed to mmewmew___...)

584
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,093
I see.

585
00:30:30,783 --> 00:30:32,033
Condom box.

586
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,833
Now we almost
have all the puzzle pieces.

587
00:30:38,873 --> 00:30:40,713
The director is so careless.

588
00:30:41,113 --> 00:30:43,713
He let his mistress use
different perfume from his wife.

589
00:30:44,083 --> 00:30:45,603
If he has my help,

590
00:30:46,593 --> 00:30:47,713
he won't be caught.

591
00:31:09,403 --> 00:31:11,623
Now I'm pretty sure

592
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,813
that those two are having an affair.

593
00:31:14,723 --> 00:31:15,573
But...

594
00:31:15,863 --> 00:31:17,443
we lack concrete evidence.

595
00:31:18,363 --> 00:31:19,673
You lustful old man.

596
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:23,283
How dare you do this to me?

597
00:31:24,023 --> 00:31:25,783
I bought that car for you.

598
00:31:26,123 --> 00:31:26,903
Darn you!

599
00:31:28,113 --> 00:31:28,663
It hurts.

600
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:31,473
In the case of
lacking concrete evidence,

601
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:33,733
can we use their confession?

602
00:31:35,203 --> 00:31:35,973
We can.

603
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:39,113
Their confession and

604
00:31:39,363 --> 00:31:40,843
the circumstantial evidence

605
00:31:41,793 --> 00:31:43,293
will make their affair more convincing.

606
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,153
I need someone else for this task,

607
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:49,843
because Mew-mew has seen
me and Foei at the set.

608
00:31:50,383 --> 00:31:50,983
Eh?

609
00:31:51,323 --> 00:31:52,603
How would you get the job done?

610
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:57,533
Mistress never easily admits their guilt.

611
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,003
It depends on you, Coach Joy.

612
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:03,663
Me?

613
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:09,273
Well.

614
00:32:09,483 --> 00:32:11,343
We will be auditioning here?

615
00:32:12,813 --> 00:32:13,483
Yes, we will.

616
00:32:13,853 --> 00:32:15,723
I want our audition tape to

617
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:17,303
come out so real.

618
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,643
So I use the real place.

619
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,163
Your script.

620
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,183
No, thanks.

621
00:32:22,183 --> 00:32:23,853
I've done my research.

622
00:32:24,073 --> 00:32:25,093
I'll be a mistress

623
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,963
who got slapped

624
00:32:26,963 --> 00:32:28,553
by his wife who's a volleyball player.

625
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:31,963
And she's a professional.

626
00:32:32,753 --> 00:32:35,923
You know? I don't have any experience
with this kind of thing.

627
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:39,243
Sure.

628
00:32:39,773 --> 00:32:40,343
Good.

629
00:32:41,753 --> 00:32:42,723
Hello, ladies.

630
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:47,193
Are you ready?

631
00:32:49,483 --> 00:32:50,443
This way, please.

632
00:32:54,563 --> 00:32:55,153
Hey.

633
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:57,763
Are you sure it'll work
auditioning here?

634
00:32:58,413 --> 00:32:59,813
And he gets involved in this.

635
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,393
Tan wants to tag along.

636
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:03,443
The reason why we're auditioning here

637
00:33:03,943 --> 00:33:05,313
is to look at the most real thing.

638
00:33:07,253 --> 00:33:07,833
But I...

639
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:08,943
Have a faith in me, boss.

640
00:33:09,673 --> 00:33:10,943
I'll never fail you.

641
00:33:15,823 --> 00:33:16,413
Hello.

642
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:16,873
Hello.

643
00:33:16,873 --> 00:33:17,603
Can I leave my bag here?

644
00:33:17,603 --> 00:33:18,443
Please.

645
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:22,033
And who will read the script with me?

646
00:33:23,263 --> 00:33:24,173
I will.

647
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:31,983
Hello.

648
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:33,113
Please,

649
00:33:33,383 --> 00:33:36,123
don't hold back your energy.

650
00:33:37,153 --> 00:33:37,893
Okay.

651
00:33:38,253 --> 00:33:39,753
I'll pretend to slap you.

652
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:43,403
And you can improvise
according to your feelings, Mew-mew.

653
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:45,403
Yes.

654
00:33:45,703 --> 00:33:46,253
Okay.

655
00:33:46,383 --> 00:33:47,403
The camera is on.

656
00:33:47,753 --> 00:33:49,043
The film "Mistress".

657
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:50,763
Scene "The World Must Know This Shame".

658
00:33:51,013 --> 00:33:51,623
Tape one.

659
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:53,023
Action!

660
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:55,793
I really don't know him.

661
00:33:55,863 --> 00:33:57,603
Please don't do anything to me.

662
00:33:57,723 --> 00:33:58,593
I'm begging you.

663
00:33:58,593 --> 00:33:59,333
Liar!

664
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,673
Come here.

665
00:34:06,183 --> 00:34:09,273
- How dare you?
- I don't know him.

666
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:11,293
Believe me.

667
00:34:11,293 --> 00:34:13,813
- Believe me.
- Are you still lying to me?

668
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:16,373
Hey.

669
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:17,713
I think I need to check on them.

670
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:19,103
How is it?

671
00:34:20,673 --> 00:34:21,783
Messing with my husband

672
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:23,193
is not a good idea.

673
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:25,953
I've done nothing wrong. Believe me.

674
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:27,123
Please stop. It's enough.

675
00:34:27,243 --> 00:34:28,283
No, it isn't!

676
00:34:28,283 --> 00:34:28,893
Hey!

677
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:29,723
My leg.

678
00:34:29,723 --> 00:34:30,463
Darn you!

679
00:34:30,563 --> 00:34:31,393
You'd better get out.

680
00:34:31,493 --> 00:34:32,383
Leave it to me.

681
00:34:32,493 --> 00:34:33,243
Ow!

682
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:34,603
Will you admit it?

683
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:36,263
- No.
- I'll slap you to death.

684
00:34:36,263 --> 00:34:37,253
Please.

685
00:34:37,963 --> 00:34:38,973
- You die!
- Coach Joy.

686
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:42,213
I was going to help her.

687
00:34:43,603 --> 00:34:44,773
But maybe

688
00:34:45,673 --> 00:34:46,963
I miscalculated.

689
00:34:57,103 --> 00:34:57,553
Done.

690
00:34:58,663 --> 00:34:59,423
It's a bit swollen.

691
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:01,163
But it'll go away tomorrow.

692
00:35:01,523 --> 00:35:02,493
You will be okay.

693
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,533
Thanks a lot.

694
00:35:06,453 --> 00:35:08,343
But maybe

695
00:35:08,953 --> 00:35:10,553
you should be more worried
about your face.

696
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:16,933
It's okay.

697
00:35:17,933 --> 00:35:18,943
It'll be healed in a few days.

698
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,533
Some water?

699
00:35:22,943 --> 00:35:24,263
I'll go get it.

700
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,923
I knew there would be a problem.

701
00:35:32,953 --> 00:35:34,973
Mew-mew was being very professional.

702
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,093
She didn't even get out of her act.

703
00:35:37,453 --> 00:35:38,803
What are we gonna do next?

704
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,553
Mew-mew will eventually
find out that she's been tricked.

705
00:35:43,403 --> 00:35:45,883
Coach Joy already paid the rest.

706
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,273
She also said

707
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:48,693
that she feels better now.

708
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:50,083
Really?

709
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:54,443
Or she maybe

710
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:57,283
just wanted to get even.

711
00:36:03,283 --> 00:36:04,353
Anyway,

712
00:36:04,653 --> 00:36:05,553
thank you for today.

713
00:36:13,573 --> 00:36:15,233
I'll get some water for you.

714
00:37:05,483 --> 00:37:06,563
What's wrong, Tan?

715
00:37:08,543 --> 00:37:09,333
Tan.

716
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,313
What's going on, Tan?

717
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:22,943
Thank you.

718
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:28,443
Hey!

719
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:29,753
What the heck!

720
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:31,753
Why did you lie?

721
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:32,903
About what?

722
00:37:33,383 --> 00:37:34,943
I remember that night.

723
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:38,183
How could you let that happen?

724
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:48,423
You know?

725
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,043
I thought

726
00:37:52,793 --> 00:37:53,803
that you and I

727
00:37:54,943 --> 00:37:56,083
could be friends.

728
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:02,673
Let's say

729
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:06,363
we both made a mistake.

730
00:38:08,543 --> 00:38:10,053
You've crossed my line,

731
00:38:11,433 --> 00:38:12,213
and I

732
00:38:13,663 --> 00:38:14,853
didn't stop you.

733
00:38:15,553 --> 00:38:16,603
And it ended up like this.

734
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:19,783
Maybe you can look...

735
00:38:22,703 --> 00:38:23,493
at me...

736
00:38:25,683 --> 00:38:27,563
as another point you've taken.

737
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:29,833
Got it?

738
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:32,453
Yesterday

739
00:38:33,803 --> 00:38:35,323
I took a girl to my place.

740
00:38:37,173 --> 00:38:37,893
You know?

741
00:38:40,703 --> 00:38:42,033
When I kissed her,

742
00:38:44,453 --> 00:38:45,803
I just saw your face.

743
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:49,503
How can you want me

744
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:50,813
to move on with my life?

745
00:38:51,163 --> 00:38:52,773
And you think I've moved on?

746
00:38:55,613 --> 00:38:57,393
After realizing that I like you,

747
00:39:01,003 --> 00:39:02,533
I tried to stop my feelings

748
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:06,443
from going deeper.

749
00:39:12,693 --> 00:39:14,733
Because the more I like you,

750
00:39:16,903 --> 00:39:18,053
the more I hate myself.

751
00:39:21,903 --> 00:39:23,763
I hate myself for liking someone
like you.

752
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:26,803
You're selfish,

753
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:29,303
and you toy with people.

754
00:39:43,753 --> 00:39:44,763
You'll forget me one day.

755
00:40:13,593 --> 00:40:17,173
(Jealousy Coach's hand-slam
goes viral)

756
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:24,643
Fudge!

757
00:40:24,643 --> 00:40:25,773
Come here.

758
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:29,363
Okay, I'll recheck that.

759
00:40:30,113 --> 00:40:33,053
And the costume.
Is it exactly as we talked about?

760
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:35,353
Okay. Uh...

761
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:37,143
I need to go.

762
00:40:40,913 --> 00:40:41,413
Yes?

763
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,453
If you want your romance

764
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:49,183
to be a secret,

765
00:40:52,473 --> 00:40:53,703
I can do that for you.

766
00:40:59,053 --> 00:41:01,733
(Secret is the most powerful tool.)

767
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,663
I knew you'd call.

768
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,253
I thought that

769
00:41:16,263 --> 00:41:17,363
you have changed.

770
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:19,553
Did you plan this from the beginning?

771
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:22,073
Coach Joy got fired.

772
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:24,113
Look, her life is ruined now.

773
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:24,843
Oh, you didn't know.

774
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:26,773
Coach Joy has several cases

775
00:41:26,773 --> 00:41:28,353
of excessive punishment for her players,

776
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:30,583
and also domestic abuse history.

777
00:41:31,103 --> 00:41:32,033
I've looked into this.

778
00:41:32,033 --> 00:41:33,843
If you want to be a hero,

779
00:41:33,963 --> 00:41:35,833
why did it have to be on my case?

780
00:41:35,973 --> 00:41:37,853
How could anyone
still want to hire me now?

781
00:41:37,853 --> 00:41:39,423
I ruined only one of your jobs.

782
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:42,543
But how about you disguising
yourself for months to earn my trust

783
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:44,003
and ruining my whole life?

784
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,393
So that means

785
00:41:47,623 --> 00:41:48,993
you want a revenge.

786
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:50,823
It's not business.

787
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:51,963
It's personal.

788
00:41:53,203 --> 00:41:54,123
I'm back.

789
00:42:07,323 --> 00:42:08,153
I'm Phat.

790
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:10,513
But people call me

791
00:42:11,253 --> 00:42:12,383
the relationship juggler.

792
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:16,413
Be ready, everyone.

793
00:42:17,093 --> 00:42:18,163
Smoke, please.

794
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,073
Hey, where's the smoke?

795
00:42:21,073 --> 00:42:22,033
Smoke?

796
00:42:22,803 --> 00:42:23,773
Where is it?

797
00:42:24,413 --> 00:42:25,723
Yes, I'm coming.

798
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:30,523
Here it is.

799
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:31,903
Hurry up, boy.

800
00:42:33,523 --> 00:42:35,023
