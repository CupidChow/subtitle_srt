1
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:04,958
Jane.

2
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,625
Got you.

3
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,916
Cheater.

4
00:01:16,625 --> 00:01:19,166
You've got ice cream on your shirt, Jane.

5
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,333
Mom's going to nag again.

6
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:28,125
Do you want to swap with me?

7
00:01:28,208 --> 00:01:29,333
Ann. Jane.

8
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,125
Is this all for today?

9
00:01:32,208 --> 00:01:33,250
Yes.

10
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,500
Okay. Then let's go.

11
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:47,958
-Bro. To the police flats.
-60 baht.

12
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:50,208
What? But I go for 50 every day.

13
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:52,708
Then I'm not going. Walk yourself.

14
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:58,500
The police flats.

15
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,583
60 baht.

16
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,750
50 baht.

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,833
I'm not going.

18
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:07,708
Come on, Ann.

19
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,041
It's hot.
If we share, it doesn't cost so much.

20
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,291
No.

21
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:14,000
If we pay 60 today,
we'll have to pay 60 every day.

22
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:38,083
Oh, you're Sgt. Damnern's kid.

23
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:39,166
Uncle, hello.

24
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,666
Hello.

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,000
Are you heading back to the flats?

26
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:43,916
Can I go with you?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,041
-The tuk-tuk is expensive.
-Sure.

28
00:03:30,083 --> 00:03:32,541
There's a car coming. Move over, please.

29
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:41,375
These suspects look familiar.

30
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,875
-Hello.
-Hello.

31
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,333
Let's go.

32
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,583
Sorry.

33
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,375
-Does it hurt?
-Go, go.

34
00:03:58,416 --> 00:03:59,875
Give me your bag, Ann.

35
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,500
-Ann, bye.
-Bye.

36
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:03,791
Jane. Ann.

37
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,416
Hey, Nice.

38
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,583
-Hello, Nice's Dad.
-Hello.

39
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,750
-Nice.
-See you.

40
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:12,125
Hey, wait up.

41
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,208
Ann, see you at the badminton court.

42
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,291
Okay.

43
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,833
Jane, quickly.

44
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,500
Be careful.

45
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:07,000
-Hi.
-Hello, Jane. Did you just get back?

46
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,000
Go ahead and pick one,
they're all good brands.

47
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:14,083
Jane looks so sweet, Nee.

48
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,125
She could be a celeb, you know.

49
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,291
Hey, what kind of celeb?

50
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:21,666
No way.
Celebs only have small bodies and faces.

51
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,541
Look at her butt and face.

52
00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:24,708
So swollen.

53
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:28,833
Come on, Nee. She's naturally cute.

54
00:05:28,916 --> 00:05:30,166
That's right.

55
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:14,708
Is Nice late again?

56
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,375
The clean one's in the bag.

57
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,750
Go ahead and take it.

58
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,708
Here.

59
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,791
When are you going
to throw that racket away?

60
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,708
I told you to take mine.

61
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:50,583
That racket is old,
your wrist will get sore again.

62
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,125
No.

63
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,708
It's yours.
How could I just take it from you?

64
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,250
Like I said, I'm giving it to you.

65
00:06:58,333 --> 00:07:01,041
See? I have another one here.

66
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,375
I don't want it.
I'm fine with borrowing it.

67
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,041
You're damn stubborn.

68
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,083
Ready?

69
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,166
Yes.

70
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,000
Snacks are on the loser.

71
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:13,416
Ready?

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,125
Hey, where are you aiming for?

73
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,041
Jane.

74
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,458
Shit!

75
00:07:32,708 --> 00:07:35,000
You, go get it.

76
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,583
A bit higher.

77
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,333
Let me.

78
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
Jane.

79
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,875
Who hit it?

80
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,333
Must be really strong
to hit it all the way up here.

81
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,583
It must be your doing, right?

82
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:40,166
Do you guys play all the time?

83
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yes.

84
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:46,958
Let's go, Ann.

85
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,250
Thanks.

86
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,541
Building 1, you're so annoying.
You keep following me.

87
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:10,541
I'm going to go hang out at Ann's.
Any problems?

88
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:12,750
-So annoying. Ann, let's run.
-Hey!

89
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,208
-What?
-Hey!

90
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,583
-Hurry!
-I can't keep up!

91
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Ann, bye.

92
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,041
-Bye, tomboy.
-Bye, sissy.

93
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,583
-Bye.
-Bye.

94
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:37,875
Ink!

95
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,750
-Where did you get this from?
-Amy!

96
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,916
Mek, you stole it
from your dad, didn't you?

97
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,708
You're just a kid. Do you think it's cool?

98
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,250
And where's Mom?

99
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:50,750
I don't know.

100
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:52,833
-She just said she'll be back.
-Ink!

101
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,708
I'm going to spank you to death!

102
00:09:54,791 --> 00:09:55,916
Bye.

103
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,208
Never mind.

104
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:06,291
Your mom wants her money today, right?

105
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,833
Let's go to Auntie Daeng's room.

106
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:13,916
It's okay, I'll take care of you.

107
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,291
Ann will be back soon.

108
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,750
It's me, Ann.

109
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,500
Mom, Auntie Nee asked Jane
to come get her money.

110
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:41,916
Jane, please tell your mom
that I'll give it to her tomorrow.

111
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,416
Auntie Nee won't complain, right?

112
00:10:58,833 --> 00:10:59,833
It's fine.

113
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,750
Well, Auntie Oom said
she'll bring it over tomorrow.

114
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,083
It should be fine.

115
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:10,125
Ann's here.

116
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,500
Look at Ann.

117
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,458
Say "Ann."

118
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:16,833
"Ann."

119
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,958
-"Ann."
-"Ann."

120
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,416
"Ann."

121
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,208
"Ann."

122
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,750
Amy, try saying "Jane" instead.

123
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:27,833
"Jane."

124
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:30,333
-"Jane."
-"Jane."

125
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,833
-"Jane."
-"Jane."

126
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,916
"Jane."

127
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,000
You already told Auntie Nee
you're sleeping over, right?

128
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,250
Yes.

129
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,000
Your cheeks look scrumptious.

130
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,625
Your lashes are also long.

131
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:00,916
I'm jealous.

132
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,791
Can I try something?

133
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,333
Sure.

134
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,791
Come here.

135
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,083
Touch my lashes with your lashes.

136
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,541
How?

137
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:29,916
Come closer.

138
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,208
-How do you feel?
-Ticklish.

139
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,750
Your turn.

140
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:54,208
Like this?

141
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,666
Did I do it right?

142
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:11,750
Who taught you to do this?

143
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,083
I won't tell you.

144
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,875
Tell me.

145
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:23,500
-No.
-You have someone, don't you?

146
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,125
I'm always with you.

147
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:29,291
Have you seen me with anyone?

148
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,375
I don't know.

149
00:13:30,458 --> 00:13:33,375
You might be dating someone at school.

150
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,166
I don't have anyone.

151
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,000
I wish I do.

152
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:39,708
I wish you don't.

153
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:51,166
JANE'S

154
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,333
Ink, you'll fall over.

155
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,916
I think you should just
pay me the principal.

156
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,375
You're always late on your payments.
I don't like it.

157
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,083
-I'll bring it over to you on Saturday.
-Which Saturday?

158
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,791
-This Saturday.
-What time?

159
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,666
Around 4 p.m.

160
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,833
You're always like this.

161
00:14:42,416 --> 00:14:45,041
If you have trouble next time,
I won't help you.

162
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,208
This Saturday at 4 p.m.

163
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,000
If you don't bring me the money,
I'll come to your place.

164
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,458
Don't make me be the bad guy, Oom.

165
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,416
Ann.

166
00:15:06,125 --> 00:15:07,583
Don't break your promise.

167
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,291
Here.

168
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,083
I give you 500.

169
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:21,041
Get the kids to move
the plants inside for me.

170
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,333
The new captain just got transferred.
He'll definitely inspect the flats soon.

171
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:29,291
-Maybe after the Guardian's ceremony.
-Thanks, Nee.

172
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,375
Ann, Earng, Ink.

173
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:35,541
Go help Auntie Nee move the plants.
She gave us money.

174
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,750
Earng. Ink. Don't dilly-dally.

175
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,833
Ann.

176
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,625
I'll help you.

177
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,333
Let the kids play.

178
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,625
It's all right, Jane.

179
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,291
Auntie Nee gave my mom money for it.

180
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,250
Earng. Ink. Didn't you hear me?

181
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:25,375
Let me help, Ann.

182
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:26,416
So, it'll be done quicker.

183
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,500
GUARDIAN CHAI MONGKOL SHRINE

184
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,416
Thank you.

185
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,708
Why don't you just come tomorrow?

186
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,666
Ann.

187
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Four.

188
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:31,833
Ann.

189
00:18:31,916 --> 00:18:33,625
I'm going to have ten pieces, okay?

190
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,250
Sure. Here.

191
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:37,500
I'll do it for you.

192
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:41,000
MINCED PORK TOAST - TEN BAHT EACH

193
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,375
Hey, no. Just eat it.

194
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,250
No, Ann. It's what you're selling.

195
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,000
How can I take it for free?

196
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:54,208
Take it.

197
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,833
I can give it to you.
Because I love you, that's why.

198
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,333
You know,

199
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,291
the only thing that beats money for me

200
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,166
is love.

201
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:16,875
I won't take your money.

202
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,916
-You have work tomorrow. Are you sure?
-I'm good, bro.

203
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:38,000
Does your husband never smile for photos?

204
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,416
Phong is always like this.

205
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,416
He doesn't like to have his photos taken.

206
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:50,750
Whenever he takes a photo,
he hardly ever smiles.

207
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,000
Phong, are you going home yet?

208
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,708
Go on ahead first.

209
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:05,041
But we have to go house hunting
early in the morning.

210
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,041
I can get up.

211
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,208
Do you already have a house?

212
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,541
We haven't bought one yet, Colonel.
We're just looking.

213
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Houses are really expensive now.

214
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,916
I don't think it'll affect you much.

215
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,625
I've heard the people in the flat say

216
00:20:26,708 --> 00:20:29,791
Senior Sgt. Somphong and Madam Nee
must be the richest in the flat.

217
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,250
How would I have all that money, sir?

218
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm just a senior sergeant.

219
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:40,208
Exactly.

220
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,833
I wonder why as well.

221
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:07,166
-Nice, what the hell are you doing?
-Shush!

222
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,583
-Help me carry this.
-I'm on the lookout.

223
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,541
Got it.

224
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:15,916
Pick it up.

225
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,500
There's only one left.

226
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,416
Let's share it.

227
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:46,458
Do you think
the room's owner ever gets suspicious?

228
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:48,833
His cigarettes and booze keep missing.

229
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:51,666
Right.

230
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:55,291
What will happen
if he installs a security camera?

231
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,375
We'll be in deep shit.

232
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:08,958
So beautiful.

233
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,958
Where else could we watch fireworks
from the balcony like this?

234
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,541
Right? This is the best place ever.

235
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,250
True.

236
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:21,500
How long are we still allowed
to stay at the flat?

237
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,208
How many years left
until our dads' retirement?

238
00:22:28,791 --> 00:22:30,125
Another 12 years, I guess?

239
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,416
Twelve years.

240
00:22:33,291 --> 00:22:34,833
We'll be almost 30 then.

241
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,666
Do you think

242
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,416
we'll still be here or move out?

243
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,291
I think I'll stay until the very end.

244
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,500
I don't want to move.

245
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:49,375
Ditto.

246
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,583
Then you should be a police officer.
So you can continue staying here.

247
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:53,708
Oh, my!

248
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,208
You want me to be a cop?

249
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,166
Finding a husband who's a cop
is much easier.

250
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,250
I have no desire to live here forever.

251
00:23:07,041 --> 00:23:08,916
I'm more afraid of
not being able to leave.

252
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:14,791
Take a look at Gail.

253
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,000
It's as if her life

254
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:20,291
has just stopped right here.

255
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,208
It seems not long ago that we were talking

256
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,750
about we'd go study at a uni far away
and stay in a dorm together.

257
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,333
And now?

258
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,333
She won't even come out
for a game of badminton.

259
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,125
Shit!

260
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:42,833
Get up. Climb over to that room.

261
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,250
What about this stuff?

262
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,333
Just leave it.

263
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:47,208
We're screwed.

264
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,083
Scoot over.

265
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:50,833
Hurry.

266
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,125
Let's go.

267
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:04,875
Hey.

268
00:24:04,958 --> 00:24:06,875
Hold up. Stop!

269
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,666
How'd you get in here?

270
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,500
Answer me.

271
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:24,500
You reek of cigarette smoke.

272
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,458
Is it coming from you?

273
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,125
Hey.

274
00:24:30,916 --> 00:24:33,625
Don't you try to point fingers at me.
I don't smoke.

275
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,291
So?

276
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,500
-Hey!
-Take that.

277
00:24:40,208 --> 00:24:41,500
Hey, hold on.

278
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,666
Why don't you come play badminton with us?

279
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,708
My friend here wants
to have a game with you.

280
00:24:48,791 --> 00:24:50,875
-Go.
-Faster.

281
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,083
Why'd you say that?

282
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:08,750
Is he going to snitch to our parents
about smoking?

283
00:25:16,416 --> 00:25:17,416
No.

284
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,750
He doesn't seem the type.

285
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,666
Jane, girl.

286
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:24,916
Your room's close to his.

287
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,125
Just right across.

288
00:25:29,041 --> 00:25:32,250
Keep your eyes on him for me,
see if he's got a wife.

289
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,458
But with such good looks,

290
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:37,125
I bet he's taken.

291
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,750
He's going to be mine.

292
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,458
You slutty tomboy!

293
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,541
You're sluttier.

294
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,875
What?

295
00:25:48,291 --> 00:25:49,291
Hey!

296
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,541
Is the ice cream good, Sport?

297
00:26:45,541 --> 00:26:46,541
Mom, hi.

298
00:26:47,958 --> 00:26:49,000
Tong.

299
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:51,083
Hello, Ms. Nee.

300
00:26:51,166 --> 00:26:54,291
-Hi.
-Mr. Phong asked me to drop by.

301
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,208
You're here to collect the money
for covering his shift, right?

302
00:26:57,291 --> 00:26:58,708
Yes, ma'am.

303
00:26:58,791 --> 00:26:59,791
Jane.

304
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,125
Bring me my purse, will you?

305
00:27:03,666 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't leave just yet.

306
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:10,541
Looking at your physique,
you must like working out, right?

307
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,666
Well, do you know

309
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:17,166
any workouts to slim the butt?

310
00:27:17,875 --> 00:27:19,708
Help Jane out, will you?

311
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,083
Whenever I see her wear pants,

312
00:27:22,166 --> 00:27:25,041
her butts look so big and ugly.

313
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:28,750
I never allow her
to have any snacks at home.

314
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,750
I'm not sure if she sneaks them
when she's out.

315
00:27:35,083 --> 00:27:38,500
I think Jane looks normal, ma'am.

316
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:40,750
It's not normal.

317
00:27:41,458 --> 00:27:43,541
She needs to lose a little bit more.

318
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:45,875
How about this?

319
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:49,083
I will leave Jane under your care then.

320
00:27:49,166 --> 00:27:51,083
It's okay, ma'am.

321
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:53,916
Use it to buy drinks after working out.

322
00:27:56,416 --> 00:27:57,500
Thank you, ma'am.

323
00:27:58,875 --> 00:28:00,291
Jane.

324
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,750
I'm making you go exercise with Tong.

325
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,000
Do you understand?

326
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,916
MATCH SCORE

327
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,000
Hit!

328
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:23,500
This way.

329
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,458
Smash!

330
00:28:25,541 --> 00:28:27,208
End game.

331
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,291
21-15. Game!

332
00:28:33,375 --> 00:28:34,625
Ink!

333
00:28:34,708 --> 00:28:37,416
You can't play well yet. Use Ann's racket.

334
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,583
No, I'm going to use Jane's.

335
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:40,833
Well done, Nice.

336
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:42,083
Give me five.

337
00:28:42,166 --> 00:28:44,583
Why do you play so well, Tong?

338
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,625
This is my first time.

339
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,875
This is crazy, I must have talent.

340
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,250
Sure.

341
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:54,333
Great. Awesome.

342
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,750
-Right.
-You're born to do this.

343
00:28:55,833 --> 00:28:56,875
So perfect.

344
00:28:56,958 --> 00:28:58,916
-Don't you believe me?
-Who wouldn't?

345
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,083
There's no way.

346
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:02,125
You're cheeky, aren't you, Nice?

347
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:06,791
Is the light broken again?

348
00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:10,500
Man, how come it's broken
when it's our turn?

349
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:13,416
It's because you were too busy
fighting over my racket.

350
00:29:14,958 --> 00:29:16,708
It'll be a while before we can play again.

351
00:29:16,791 --> 00:29:19,250
Last time, it was ages
before it got fixed.

352
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,750
I'm fed up. The court's full of dog shit.

353
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,750
The court's lines are also all faded.

354
00:29:23,833 --> 00:29:27,250
I'll tell Mom to go press the station,
so they'd quickly come fix it.

355
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:31,208
-Tell your mom to hire a repair guy.
-You wish.

356
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:33,083
She's such a penny-pincher.

357
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:34,916
Why don't you try asking her?

358
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,083
You go ask then.

359
00:29:36,166 --> 00:29:38,208
And what is my relation to your family?

360
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:40,916
She wouldn't do it.

361
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:46,291
DAMNED BULLSHIT

362
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,000
FLATSTERS

363
00:30:04,583 --> 00:30:05,875
Oh, Sport.

364
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:09,958
What happened to all your friends?

365
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,500
Aren't you going to play badminton today?

366
00:30:12,666 --> 00:30:14,083
We aren't playing today.

367
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:16,041
Nice went out
with his friends from school.

368
00:30:16,125 --> 00:30:18,333
We can play, just the two of us.

369
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:19,875
Hurry up and go change.

370
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,916
No. It's not fun with just two people.

371
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,291
You've got a lot of excuses, you know?

372
00:30:26,166 --> 00:30:28,333
Well then, let's go for a run.

373
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,458
Behind the flats.

374
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,291
No, I'm tired.

375
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,291
I'll buy you a popsicle.

376
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:37,291
My mom gave you a lot of money.
Just one popsicle?

377
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:40,416
Your mom had me exercise with you,

378
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,291
not take you to have snacks.

379
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,583
Let's go.

380
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,166
Be careful of the cars.

381
00:30:58,291 --> 00:30:59,208
Hi, ma'am.

382
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,083
-Hello.
-Do you remember me?

383
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,166
Of course I do.

384
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,708
-Did your dad not come with you?
-He didn't.

385
00:31:04,791 --> 00:31:06,958
I'm here with the guy
wearing the navy blue shirt.

386
00:31:07,041 --> 00:31:09,708
He's also a cop. Is there a free table?

387
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:11,875
I just wiped down one.
No one has taken it yet.

388
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,000
-Go in and sit.
-Thank you.

389
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,041
All right, new order is placed.

390
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:19,916
Ready to be served.

391
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:38,916
Noodles in syrup?

392
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,041
Where'd you transfer from?

393
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,750
Phetchabun.

394
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,666
Doesn't Phetchabun have any bok kia?

395
00:31:53,416 --> 00:31:54,500
No.

396
00:31:56,291 --> 00:31:57,291
All right.

397
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,958
I'm going to try it.

398
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:00,791
Bok kia.

399
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:03,625
Right?

400
00:32:11,208 --> 00:32:12,750
It tastes better than I imagined.

401
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,875
I'm happy for you.

402
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,500
I'm happy for you that
you got to eat tasty stuff.

403
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,708
Aren't you happy?

404
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,666
Fine.

405
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,250
I'm happy.

406
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:35,458
Oh, right.

407
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,083
The way you cut the line back there.

408
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,666
It's not right, you know?

409
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,541
It's fine.
That's just how things work around here.

410
00:32:47,625 --> 00:32:49,625
Dad always gets a table
when he comes here.

411
00:32:53,375 --> 00:32:55,583
People hate the cops enough as it is.

412
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,291
Let us have a place in society.

413
00:33:05,208 --> 00:33:06,541
Haven't you eaten enough?

414
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,833
By the looks of it,
we probably won't get to run today.

415
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:09,916
So, let's not.

416
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,333
Are you tired?

417
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,458
Yes.

418
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,500
Keep it up, Sport.

419
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:24,500
About half of the noodles in your stomach
have already disappeared.

420
00:33:25,166 --> 00:33:26,166
Hang in there.

421
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,250
Hurry.

422
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,291
Hey, you're slacking again.

423
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:45,208
Hey.

424
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:46,500
Are you okay?

425
00:33:50,125 --> 00:33:51,166
Hey.

426
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:01,458
What's that?

427
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:08,708
Nothing.

428
00:34:22,541 --> 00:34:24,666
Why would you wear that thing?

429
00:34:27,041 --> 00:34:29,916
What would happen
if you can't breathe and die of shock?

430
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,666
You're being dramatic.

431
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,750
Seriously.

432
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,208
Your mom left you in my care.

433
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,125
I should make sure
nothing happens to you, right?

434
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,666
It's nothing.

435
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,166
Next time,

436
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,250
I won't wear it.

437
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,250
Good.

438
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:00,833
Tong.

439
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,958
Don't tell my mom, okay?

440
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,291
What century are we living in?

441
00:35:13,416 --> 00:35:14,958
No one would say anything.

442
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:17,000
Just be whatever you want to be.

443
00:35:20,166 --> 00:35:21,791
Be whatever I want to be,

444
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,708
just be a good person, right?

445
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,958
Just be happy, that's all.

446
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,625
Are you up for it?

447
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,000
Are you?

448
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,125
Did you push me?

449
00:35:58,666 --> 00:35:59,958
Shit!

450
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:02,208
Jane!

451
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:03,875
Jane.

452
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:08,791
Are you hurt?

453
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,666
Are you okay?

454
00:36:11,916 --> 00:36:12,916
Careful.

455
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:20,458
If it doesn’t hurt,
then it's not sprained.

456
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:21,541
It's good.

457
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,166
You still haven't gotten
to actually run, Piggy.

458
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Wait.

459
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:36,291
That's not what I meant.

460
00:36:36,375 --> 00:36:37,583
It's…

461
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:40,833
You have BDE, Tong.

462
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:44,750
Yes, you do have BDE.

463
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,375
What does BDE mean?

464
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,000
Let's go.

465
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,375
Are you okay?

466
00:36:51,458 --> 00:36:53,666
Hey, wait up.

467
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:55,333
-The cruise!
-What's BDE?

468
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,583
-Let's go look at the cruise.
-Tell me.

469
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:07,125
Come on.

470
00:37:07,791 --> 00:37:09,125
You didn't wait for me.

471
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,875
Tong, have you ever been on a cruise?

472
00:37:26,833 --> 00:37:27,833
No.

473
00:37:32,791 --> 00:37:34,750
It passes this spot every day.

474
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,666
I never know how far it goes.

475
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:40,916
One day, we'll get
to ride this cruise, Ann.

476
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,166
How long have we been wondering?

477
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,166
Did you say you wanted to know

478
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,625
where it travels to?

479
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,125
I'd better go.

480
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:58,708
-Do you know?
-I don't.

481
00:37:58,791 --> 00:38:00,208
-Tong.
-Let us go with you.

482
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,291
-I can't hear you.
-Wait, mister!

483
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:02,375
-What?
-Wait for me!

484
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,958
Tong, it's leaving.

485
00:38:16,916 --> 00:38:18,125
Let's keep on going.

486
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:19,708
-Keep on going?
-Yes.

487
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,333
Come on.

488
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,875
So? Is it on its way?

489
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,708
Are you tricking us?

490
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:07,916
-Or the cruise doesn't come to this point?
-Hey.

491
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,541
You know, I'm not from around here.

492
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,958
Why don't you guys know?

493
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,500
Then should we wait a bit longer?

494
00:39:18,583 --> 00:39:20,583
We've already spent so long chasing it.

495
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:24,958
It should come soon.

496
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,791
Will it be long?

497
00:39:46,083 --> 00:39:47,125
Hold on.

498
00:39:47,208 --> 00:39:49,250
Are you growing out your mustache?

499
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,708
I'm all grown up now.

500
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,708
You're a man.

501
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,750
Have you two been close
since you were kids?

502
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,875
Well, ever since we were born.

503
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:02,458
At my home, there's a picture of Ann
taken with me

504
00:40:02,541 --> 00:40:04,375
when I was a baby.

505
00:40:04,458 --> 00:40:06,250
Show-off.

506
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,625
Well…

507
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:09,708
We were both born at the flats.

508
00:40:09,791 --> 00:40:11,666
And we've always been together.

509
00:40:12,208 --> 00:40:13,583
We grew up together.

510
00:40:13,666 --> 00:40:16,333
You must be bored of each other, then.

511
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,791
You're also irritated, right?

512
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,166
We're irritated with you, Tong.

513
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:24,166
Someone's mad.

514
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,833
Hey, it's here!

515
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:33,916
It's here.

516
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,958
Come on.

517
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:46,250
-We're here!
-Tong, wave at them.

518
00:40:46,333 --> 00:40:47,375
No.

519
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:49,458
-Hurry up!
-Come on, Tong.

520
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:53,000
Hello!

521
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,666
Louder, Tong, louder!

522
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:58,000
Hi! What are you eating?

523
00:40:58,583 --> 00:41:00,125
-Can we have some too?
-Can we have some too?

524
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,041
This is awesome.

525
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:26,791
Right?

526
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,166
Wait for me!

527
00:41:48,791 --> 00:41:50,125
Loser.

528
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,708
You'll trip over again.

529
00:41:52,916 --> 00:41:53,916
Jane.

530
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,625
-Come on.
-What a loser.

531
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,750
Ann.

532
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,875
I'm going to head in first,
not sure if my mom's home with the kids.

533
00:42:04,416 --> 00:42:05,416
Why?

534
00:42:09,208 --> 00:42:11,291
Ann looked really happy today.

535
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,750
You did a great job, Tong.

536
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:19,208
You like Ann, don’t you?

537
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:23,833
Not that way. Are you crazy?

538
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,791
-We've known each other since we're kids.
-Is that so?

539
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:28,125
Yes, I don't like her.

540
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:29,500
-Are you sure?
-Yes!

541
00:42:30,583 --> 00:42:31,625
I don't!

542
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,083
Are you crazy or what?

543
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:35,000
-If you say so.
-I don't like her that way.

544
00:42:35,083 --> 00:42:37,041
Sure you don't.
There's no need to act cool.

545
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:40,583
-Okay. You don't.
-Yes, I don't!

546
00:42:51,291 --> 00:42:53,458
This one.

547
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,041
Here.

548
00:42:57,083 --> 00:42:58,250
Right.

549
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,291
-And then…
-Ann, can you show me?

550
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,041
Ann.

551
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,208
Can I ask you something?

552
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:23,791
Sure.

553
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,041
Do you…

554
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:30,583
Do you like Tong?

555
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,458
Well, I do.

556
00:43:38,125 --> 00:43:39,208
He's kind of cute.

557
00:43:44,791 --> 00:43:46,291
But I won't date a cop.

558
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,416
Good cops are all poor.

559
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't want to be like Mom.

560
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:01,500
Almost done. Just a bit more.

561
00:44:08,625 --> 00:44:11,083
Done. But don't open your eyes just yet.

562
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,833
I said don't open your eyes.

563
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:22,708
Done. You can open your eyes now.

564
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:26,541
Let's go to bed.

565
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,500
Ann.

566
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:25,500
Let's do that.

567
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:31,583
This.

568
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:42,625
Who first?

569
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,000
You first.

570
00:45:58,375 --> 00:45:59,375
Your turn.

571
00:46:47,541 --> 00:46:48,541
Jane.

572
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,500
I…

573
00:47:08,583 --> 00:47:09,833
I don't really like it

574
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,458
when you're with Tong.

575
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,166
I'm not sure…

576
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,791
if I like you in that way.

577
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,250
How do you feel?

578
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,750
I don't know.

579
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:04,875
I…

580
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:09,083
don't feel anything.

581
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,416
What about you?

582
00:48:48,166 --> 00:48:49,166
Ann.

583
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:53,416
When we

584
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,208
kiss the person we like…

585
00:48:59,916 --> 00:49:02,500
how are we supposed to feel?

586
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:06,958
I don't know.

587
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:13,000
You probably wouldn't
even doubt it, I guess.

588
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:15,958
Like…

589
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:19,708
this is it.

590
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,166
It feels right.

591
00:50:18,833 --> 00:50:21,625
I almost couldn't take
my kids out in time.

592
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:22,875
There wasn't any warning.

593
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,333
Is this even allowed?

594
00:50:24,416 --> 00:50:26,791
This captain is so rigid.

595
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:28,791
All the cops at the station
are complaining.

596
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:30,916
What if we get evicted?

597
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,750
What will we do?

598
00:50:33,666 --> 00:50:34,666
I'm scared.

599
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,833
Ten baht per bag, freshly made and hot!
We serve popcorn.

600
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:43,041
Ten baht per bag,
with both sweet and salty flavors.

601
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:48,541
Retail or wholesale, freshly made and hot!

602
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:49,916
Is there anyone home?

603
00:50:54,416 --> 00:50:55,583
Is there anyone?

604
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,458
I guess no one's home.

605
00:51:18,541 --> 00:51:20,666
They won't kick you out, Ann.

606
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:22,625
My mom should be able
to put in a word for you.

607
00:51:22,708 --> 00:51:24,375
It worked last time.

608
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,333
Well, last time, my dad just died.

609
00:51:28,208 --> 00:51:29,875
It has been two years already.

610
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:32,000
They might not let us stay any longer.

611
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:39,583
But if you really can't,
you can stay with me first.

612
00:51:40,416 --> 00:51:42,875
Your sisters can stay with Nice as well.

613
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:44,041
It should be fine.

614
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:46,875
I want to live with Jane.
I want to stay in a room with AC.

615
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:50,416
Right.

616
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:53,333
Stay with me,
you'll get to sleep in the AC room.

617
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:54,916
Wouldn't that be nice, Ann?

618
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,750
Do you want me to be your maid?

619
00:52:17,208 --> 00:52:18,416
How did it go, Mom?

620
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:21,125
They're letting us stay.

621
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,041
Oom.

622
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:28,375
I think you should be
on the lookout for other options.

623
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:29,583
Think of other means as well.

624
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:33,666
The former captain allowed you to stay.
This one did too.

625
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,500
But one day, if they don't,
what will you do?

626
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,291
Where will you go to?

627
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:08,833
Jane.

628
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:11,125
Help me hang the clothes up, will you?

629
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,791
Oh, Jane.

630
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:35,916
If you know anyone
who wants to learn English,

631
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:38,416
please refer me to them.

632
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:40,750
Me!

633
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:42,416
Of course.

634
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,833
If it's you, I'd give you free lessons.

635
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:48,416
No, Ann. Go ahead and charge me.

636
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,250
My mom can afford it.

637
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:52,125
I want to help you out as well.

638
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:53,791
No way.

639
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,958
But aren't you exhausted enough as it is?

640
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,125
You need to wash and iron clothes.

641
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:08,500
Will you have any energy left to tutor?

642
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,958
I wonder as well.

643
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:24,375
Ann.

644
00:54:25,125 --> 00:54:27,875
If you didn't have to worry
about money at all,

645
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:30,041
what would you want to be?

646
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:32,875
What kind of work do you want to do?

647
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:34,000
Things like that.

648
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:39,000
-If I didn't have to worry about money?
-Yes.

649
00:54:43,375 --> 00:54:45,416
I want to be a flight attendant.

650
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,000
I want to travel the world.

651
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,875
And flight attendants have to be pretty.

652
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,500
You can be one for sure.

653
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:05,916
Isn't this like
a flight attendant's uniform?

654
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,500
No. That's a bank teller's uniform.

655
00:55:08,583 --> 00:55:09,958
It belongs to Sgt. Oh's wife.

656
00:55:10,041 --> 00:55:11,083
Really?

657
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,958
But if there were a scarf and cap,

658
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,250
it'll do.

659
00:55:20,041 --> 00:55:21,041
Is it okay?

660
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:37,833
Here.

661
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:43,000
I only know how to fold boats.
But it does look like a cap, right?

662
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,458
Try saying, "Coffee or tea?"

663
00:55:56,041 --> 00:55:57,666
There, there.

664
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,791
You, of course. I chose you.

665
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,125
Take a picture.

666
00:56:10,958 --> 00:56:11,958
Come on.

667
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:13,916
Strike a pose.

668
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,375
-How?
-Like this.

669
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,125
Twist your waist too.

670
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,583
One, two, three! There.

671
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:22,791
With me as well.

672
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,708
Smile. One, two, three.

673
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:32,125
It suits you, Ann.

674
00:56:33,958 --> 00:56:35,083
So pretty.

675
00:56:39,708 --> 00:56:41,000
Ann.

676
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,958
If you see me on an airplane,

677
00:56:43,041 --> 00:56:45,791
don't forget to take me
straight to first class.

678
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:48,708
I probably won't have the means
to do so myself.

679
00:56:51,166 --> 00:56:52,166
Of course.

680
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,041
I'll give Miss Jane the best treatment.

681
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:56,958
Promise?

682
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Promise.

683
00:57:23,416 --> 00:57:25,291
Is it really that good?

684
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:27,416
Yes.

685
00:57:29,250 --> 00:57:30,333
Tong.

686
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:35,541
Why don't I ever see you hang out
with the other cops?

687
00:57:36,166 --> 00:57:37,791
Why are you always with us?

688
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:43,500
Because it's fun hanging out
with you guys.

689
00:57:44,666 --> 00:57:45,958
-Really?
-Yes.

690
00:57:48,041 --> 00:57:49,041
Really?

691
00:57:49,125 --> 00:57:50,125
Why?

692
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,125
Why are you so curious, Piggy?

693
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:56,625
You keep calling me that.

694
00:57:57,791 --> 00:57:59,208
I'm not that fat, am I?

695
00:58:04,166 --> 00:58:05,166
Hey.

696
00:58:07,541 --> 00:58:09,125
I didn't mean it that way.

697
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:11,416
How could you not?

698
00:58:12,166 --> 00:58:14,083
See? You just called me that.

699
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,125
This is Piggy.

700
00:58:30,208 --> 00:58:31,625
My kid.

701
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:39,583
Whenever I see your face, I think of her.

702
00:58:40,625 --> 00:58:44,333
So, I always slip out
calling you her name.

703
00:58:44,416 --> 00:58:45,666
Sorry about that.

704
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,541
Are you that surprised?

705
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:00,750
So,

706
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:02,541
where is she now?

707
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,125
Why isn't she living here with you?

708
00:59:08,125 --> 00:59:10,458
She's with her mom.

709
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,125
Her mom has a new family already.

710
00:59:15,208 --> 00:59:17,916
I moved away to give them space.
It's better this way.

711
00:59:27,166 --> 00:59:29,125
Fine then, you can call me that.

712
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,625
I'm not mad anymore.

713
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:35,916
Really?

714
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,208
In exchange for two popsicles.

715
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:38,583
Every day.

716
00:59:38,666 --> 00:59:40,541
-Okay?
-Do you really mean it?

717
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:44,416
Nice, go slowly.

718
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:46,375
Now, you've got to brake.

719
00:59:46,458 --> 00:59:47,750
-Hit the brakes.
-How?

720
00:59:47,833 --> 00:59:49,500
Gently hit the brakes.

721
00:59:49,583 --> 00:59:51,041
-Hit the brakes!
-Brake!

722
00:59:55,791 --> 00:59:58,708
-I couldn't get the pressure right.
-Nice.

723
00:59:58,791 --> 01:00:01,000
Can I get out of the car?
I don't want to die.

724
01:00:01,083 --> 01:00:03,708
No way! How long have we been friends?

725
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:06,166
-Are you going to ditch me to die alone?
-Stop it.

726
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,458
Don't talk about stuff like that.
It's not good, you know?

727
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:12,541
Tong, we're just joking around.

728
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,666
You don't understand us teens.

729
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:20,083
Can't you pay more attention?

730
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:23,666
I'm at risk of getting thrown into jail
for letting you drive a police car.

731
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:26,500
I will have food delivered to you in jail,

732
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:29,208
-so you won't starve.
-I'll go visit you.

733
01:00:34,958 --> 01:00:36,875
Is he the male lead
of a music video, or what?

734
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,750
What?

735
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:44,416
Are you mocking me?

736
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:46,625
It's not nice to mock grown-ups, Nice.

737
01:00:46,708 --> 01:00:48,750
Oh no. I'm a bad kid.

738
01:00:48,833 --> 01:00:52,166
Are you done taking pictures?
Let's continue with my driving lessons.

739
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,041
Actually, Tong,
even if I knew how to drive,

740
01:00:55,583 --> 01:00:57,125
I wouldn't have a car to drive anyway.

741
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:59,416
But you should still learn to drive.

742
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,750
In case an emergency happens. Right?

743
01:01:01,833 --> 01:01:04,083
If there is an emergency, we have you.

744
01:01:04,166 --> 01:01:05,541
True.

745
01:01:07,166 --> 01:01:10,875
You all, when you grow up,
you will forget all about me.

746
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,958
You're so dramatic. Who'd forget you?

747
01:01:15,666 --> 01:01:17,125
That's what you say now.

748
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,583
Okay, well done, Piggy.

749
01:01:20,666 --> 01:01:22,291
Keep the steering wheel steady.

750
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,500
You're getting the hang of it.

751
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:27,833
Okay, carefully.

752
01:01:29,041 --> 01:01:31,250
Hey, it's counting down. What do I do?

753
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:32,916
Stop the car.

754
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,916
Should we stop or just speed off?

755
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,166
Hey, you can't speed off! Stop it now.

756
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:38,250
Stop!

757
01:01:43,541 --> 01:01:45,916
Officer One, calling Officer Two.

758
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:47,750
Yes?

759
01:01:47,833 --> 01:01:49,625
Tong farted in the car.

760
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,875
It stinks so much.

761
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:54,875
Hey, it's not true. I didn't fart.

762
01:01:54,958 --> 01:01:56,916
I can smell it from here.

763
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,375
-Give me that.
-Hey.

764
01:02:00,458 --> 01:02:02,583
-You can't.
-What's this button for?

765
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:03,666
Don't press it.

766
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,958
You can't play with it.

767
01:02:06,041 --> 01:02:07,833
You should tell yourself that.

768
01:02:11,291 --> 01:02:12,333
Tong.

769
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,583
Hey!

770
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:16,125
What are you doing?

771
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:18,041
You've got soft cheeks.

772
01:02:19,458 --> 01:02:20,875
You're quite daring.

773
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:22,625
Keep your eyes ahead.

774
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,916
-Loser!
-What?

775
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
What loser?

776
01:02:58,083 --> 01:02:59,916
-Who really is a loser?
-What are you blabbing about?

777
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,041
Dang.

778
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:03,750
-You lost!
-Poor you.

779
01:03:17,375 --> 01:03:18,833
Mom.

780
01:03:21,291 --> 01:03:22,291
Mom.

781
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:25,291
Where have you been?

782
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:27,541
I was around here.

783
01:03:27,625 --> 01:03:29,291
Iron these two piles.

784
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:31,083
The customer wants them tomorrow.

785
01:03:32,166 --> 01:03:33,791
I'll put Amy to bed.

786
01:04:02,125 --> 01:04:03,833
Hello, Ann. Are you asleep yet?

787
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:06,916
Not yet.

788
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,333
What is it, Jane?

789
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,166
Ann. Tomorrow, Mom and Dad are taking me
to go house hunting again.

790
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,083
Do you want to go together?

791
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,541
-Are they buying it?
-Mom wants to.

792
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:23,583
She might just buy it,
but we won't move in just yet.

793
01:04:23,666 --> 01:04:24,958
I don't want to move.

794
01:04:25,666 --> 01:04:26,708
Like I said,

795
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,541
I'm going to stay here
with you until the very end.

796
01:04:31,250 --> 01:04:33,833
If you have a house,
you'll get your own room, right?

797
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,500
Yes, when you sleep over at my place,

798
01:04:37,083 --> 01:04:38,791
you don't have to worry about Mom.

799
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,916
Sounds good?

800
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:43,416
Ann.

801
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,375
When you grow up,

802
01:04:46,166 --> 01:04:48,166
finish school and get a job,

803
01:04:49,375 --> 01:04:51,541
buy the house next to mine, okay?

804
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:54,541
I'll go ask Nice to move as well.

805
01:04:54,625 --> 01:04:56,708
We should all live next to each other.

806
01:05:02,625 --> 01:05:05,583
Well, wait for me
to get a job first, okay?

807
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:09,291
Flight attendants earn a lot.

808
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,916
You'll be able to buy a house for sure.

809
01:05:15,208 --> 01:05:16,916
You'd better go to sleep, Jane.

810
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,666
You should also go to bed.

811
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,875
Don't let me find out

812
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:24,833
you snuck in some ironing
and won't go to bed.

813
01:05:58,583 --> 01:05:59,583
Tong.

814
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,708
-I thought you said you don't smoke.
-Hey!

815
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,708
How did you get in there?

816
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,083
We always sneak in here.

817
01:06:11,166 --> 01:06:12,666
The owner is hardly here.

818
01:06:14,458 --> 01:06:15,500
Such a troublemaker.

819
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:24,708
Let me have a puff.

820
01:06:25,291 --> 01:06:28,208
-No, you're still a kid.
-Come on, please.

821
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:32,583
If not, I'm going to tell the girls
that you smoke.

822
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,458
Smart-ass.

823
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:45,791
Here.

824
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,125
Only one puff, okay?

825
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,500
Are you stressed out about something?

826
01:07:11,250 --> 01:07:12,875
Why did you become a cop?

827
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:16,833
Yes, I wonder too.

828
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,500
As a kid, I was a troublemaker.

829
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:23,083
I didn't really like to study.

830
01:07:24,166 --> 01:07:27,625
So, my parents told me
to just get a job as a civil servant.

831
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:32,625
Like how country folks
usually tell their kids.

832
01:07:33,958 --> 01:07:36,500
-It's not what you wanted to be?
-No.

833
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,916
I wanted to be a national athlete.

834
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,625
But I got distracted by girls.

835
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,166
You know,

836
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,291
actually I can just become a cop.

837
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,583
My dad died in the line of duty,
so I'm eligible.

838
01:08:13,583 --> 01:08:16,541
My family isn't allowed
to live here anymore.

839
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:19,750
But Mom doesn't know where to take us to.

840
01:08:20,333 --> 01:08:22,250
So, we have to keep on asking for favors.

841
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:27,333
Who knows when we'll be kicked out.

842
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,500
So, I've been thinking

843
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:39,458
should I just be a cop?

844
01:08:40,083 --> 01:08:42,750
That way, my family can
continue living here.

845
01:08:48,083 --> 01:08:49,125
Don't.

846
01:08:55,708 --> 01:08:57,583
You can be something much better.

847
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:09,333
Could you teach Earng
how to play badminton?

848
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:12,291
-She wants to be a badminton player.
-Sure.

849
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:15,083
But when I told you I was an athlete,

850
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:16,458
I meant I was a boxer.

851
01:09:16,541 --> 01:09:18,875
Jabs and uppercuts, stuff like that.

852
01:09:19,666 --> 01:09:20,666
Will it work?

853
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,208
Well, I guess.

854
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:25,375
Damn.

855
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:28,125
-Tong, move away.
-What?

856
01:09:28,208 --> 01:09:29,750
-Move!
-Is someone coming?

857
01:09:29,833 --> 01:09:32,208
-Yes, move!
-Hey, what are you doing?

858
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:34,958
Be careful. Hey!

859
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:36,041
Shush!

860
01:09:36,708 --> 01:09:37,708
Come inside.

861
01:09:46,833 --> 01:09:49,541
The last time you snuck in
by climbing over like this?

862
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,125
Smart.

863
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:58,041
-You're starting to become a flatster.
-Of course.

864
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,291
You don't want to go home, right?

865
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,041
If there's something you need help with,
let me know.

866
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:38,416
You don't have to be
the Big Sis Ann all the time.

867
01:10:40,166 --> 01:10:42,666
It's tiring, you know?

868
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,208
It's okay.

869
01:12:07,041 --> 01:12:08,291
Jane.

870
01:12:08,375 --> 01:12:10,416
Go collect 3,000 baht from Tong for me.

871
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:12,500
And then meet me in front of the station.

872
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:49,916
Tong.

873
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:38,916
Yes?

874
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:54,541
What is it?

875
01:14:55,291 --> 01:14:56,291
I lost my phone.

876
01:14:56,375 --> 01:14:57,666
Maybe I left it here.

877
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,750
-Where did you leave it?
-I don't know.

878
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,750
This one?

879
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:18,833
Yes.

880
01:16:13,166 --> 01:16:14,500
Do you like it, honey?

881
01:16:18,708 --> 01:16:20,208
Should we take this one?

882
01:16:21,083 --> 01:16:22,708
I think it's too expensive.

883
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,041
And too far as well.

884
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,875
If you don't need such a big house,

885
01:16:26,958 --> 01:16:28,583
just one that's cheaper

886
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,583
and closer to the city,
there are more options.

887
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:34,208
Only a few of us will be living in it.
Why do you need such a big house?

888
01:16:34,291 --> 01:16:36,541
Well, there are three of us.

889
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,916
We can still stay at the flat
for over ten years.

890
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,375
What's the rush?

891
01:16:40,458 --> 01:16:42,750
Jane also doesn’t want to move yet.

892
01:16:55,083 --> 01:16:57,416
Jane, can I borrow your racket?

893
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,125
Ann, could I have the racket?

894
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:30,708
Ann, did you buy a new racket?

895
01:17:34,833 --> 01:17:35,833
Yes.

896
01:17:37,875 --> 01:17:39,416
Earng broke the old one.

897
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:09,041
Tong bought it for you, didn't he?

898
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,250
Jane.

899
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,208
I thought you said
you wouldn't date a cop?

900
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:03,958
Answer me.

901
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:12,000
Well, he gives me money.

902
01:19:18,958 --> 01:19:20,708
You even dare say it out loud?

903
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:25,625
Do you even know what love is?

904
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,291
Love is only what people with money have.

905
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:36,958
What would you know about it?
Your family has everything.

906
01:19:49,375 --> 01:19:51,875
How would someone like me
would dare to love anyone?

907
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:57,458
What are you rambling on about?

908
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:47,000
Why don't you come home with Ann anymore?

909
01:20:49,708 --> 01:20:51,333
I'm too lazy to wait around.

910
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,791
Did she really take a taxi?

911
01:21:01,500 --> 01:21:03,708
Does she have that much money now?

912
01:21:05,875 --> 01:21:07,833
Tong probably gave her the money.

913
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:15,791
Well, they're seeing each other.

914
01:21:17,291 --> 01:21:18,833
Ann and Tong?

915
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:22,083
What's their age gap?

916
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:25,666
Isn't Tong 34 or 35?

917
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,041
And Tong…

918
01:21:28,833 --> 01:21:30,500
He doesn't have much money.

919
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:33,041
He even borrowed money from me.

920
01:21:35,416 --> 01:21:40,041
PIGGY

921
01:21:41,041 --> 01:21:42,416
-Piggy.
-Dad.

922
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,375
Where are you? Are you off work?

923
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:47,333
Do you miss me?

924
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:49,666
I do. Well, do I?

925
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,208
Yes, I do miss you.

926
01:21:51,833 --> 01:21:52,916
Sweetie.

927
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,375
Your mom sent me a clip of you
taking piano lessons.

928
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:58,666
You're very good.

929
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:02,416
Do you like the piano?
If you do, I'll buy you one.

930
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,541
Uncle Nop already bought it for me.

931
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:06,166
Let me show you.

932
01:22:07,083 --> 01:22:08,291
Really?

933
01:22:08,875 --> 01:22:10,291
That's fine.

934
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:11,958
I'll pay him back then.

935
01:22:28,083 --> 01:22:29,541
No need, Dad.

936
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:31,041
Uncle Nop is super rich.

937
01:22:31,125 --> 01:22:33,791
You'd better save the money
so that you can come see me.

938
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:38,000
Mom told me you never visit me
because you don't have enough money.

939
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,500
Of course I do.

940
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,041
I have a lot as well.

941
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,375
The work I'm doing
is to earn money for you, Piggy.

942
01:22:52,875 --> 01:22:55,125
Mom always says stuff like that.
Don't listen to her.

943
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:59,333
-Okay?
-Then, can you come see me this Saturday?

944
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:02,875
I've got to go, Piggy.

945
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,583
Mom asked me to collect the money.

946
01:23:29,458 --> 01:23:31,041
You don't even have money.

947
01:23:32,208 --> 01:23:33,875
And you are still giving it to others?

948
01:23:38,416 --> 01:23:40,000
Ann's family is in need.

949
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,333
I just want to help them.

950
01:23:43,416 --> 01:23:45,250
And why would you help them?

951
01:23:45,958 --> 01:23:47,708
You can't even take care of yourself.

952
01:23:50,375 --> 01:23:51,416
For Ann,

953
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,250
if I can make her life a bit easier,

954
01:23:55,958 --> 01:23:57,083
I'm happy.

955
01:24:04,833 --> 01:24:06,333
When I take care of you,

956
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,375
I am also very happy.

957
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,458
I'm going to smash it now.

958
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:34,583
Earng, you first. Serve it here.

959
01:24:36,791 --> 01:24:37,791
Come on.

960
01:24:38,458 --> 01:24:40,458
That's it, great.

961
01:24:40,541 --> 01:24:41,875
Ink, you're up.

962
01:24:41,958 --> 01:24:43,083
Catch it.

963
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:46,000
Serve it to me.

964
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:47,750
Good.

965
01:24:52,291 --> 01:24:53,333
Ink, catch.

966
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:55,041
You're not running after it.

967
01:24:58,125 --> 01:24:59,125
Earng.

968
01:25:05,208 --> 01:25:06,666
CRIMINAL CODE

969
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:07,750
I'll be back.

970
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,250
Hey.

971
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:33,041
Aren't you going to ask?

972
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:36,416
Did you leave it here for me to ask?

973
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:39,708
Fine, I'll ask.

974
01:25:41,666 --> 01:25:43,333
Are you taking the exam for a promotion?

975
01:25:46,791 --> 01:25:47,916
Yes.

976
01:25:49,250 --> 01:25:50,791
Good for you.

977
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:53,291
Please teach me English, Ms. Ann.

978
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:42,000
Tong is in the room with Auntie Oom.

979
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:46,083
Go take care of the money and the wedding.

980
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:47,208
Then we'll talk.

981
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:58,125
Ann, come inside and talk with me.

982
01:27:04,875 --> 01:27:05,916
Ann.

983
01:27:10,375 --> 01:27:11,375
Ann.

984
01:27:13,958 --> 01:27:14,958
Ann.

985
01:27:19,083 --> 01:27:20,083
Ann!

986
01:27:27,500 --> 01:27:28,875
Have you lost it?

987
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:31,833
Are you satisfied?

988
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:42,083
Ann!

989
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,708
-Come back right now!
-Mom.

990
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,500
Let me talk to her.

991
01:27:47,458 --> 01:27:48,458
Jane.

992
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:51,875
Auntie Oom found out about Ann and Tong.

993
01:27:51,958 --> 01:27:53,791
She wants them to get married.

994
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:01,083
Ann.

995
01:28:04,083 --> 01:28:05,083
Ann.

996
01:28:06,416 --> 01:28:07,416
Ann.

997
01:28:08,083 --> 01:28:09,416
What are you doing?

998
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,250
Why would you care?

999
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,750
You won't marry him, right?

1000
01:28:22,458 --> 01:28:23,458
Why?

1001
01:28:24,333 --> 01:28:26,416
Do you really like him that much?

1002
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:32,416
I don't know.

1003
01:28:33,583 --> 01:28:35,208
But that's not important.

1004
01:28:35,875 --> 01:28:39,041
He isn't good enough for you
to stop your life for him.

1005
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:51,375
Don't you want to leave this place?

1006
01:28:54,708 --> 01:28:56,208
You make it sound so easy.

1007
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,250
It isn't easy at all!

1008
01:29:07,541 --> 01:29:08,541
Ann.

1009
01:29:09,750 --> 01:29:10,750
You know,

1010
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,125
in my life,

1011
01:29:14,458 --> 01:29:16,166
I don't really know anything.

1012
01:29:17,875 --> 01:29:18,916
I've never known

1013
01:29:19,583 --> 01:29:21,583
what I like or what I want.

1014
01:29:24,791 --> 01:29:26,875
But the one thing I know is

1015
01:29:28,041 --> 01:29:30,250
that I'm absolutely confident in you.

1016
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:35,125
I know that if there's something
you want to do,

1017
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:37,333
you can do it.

1018
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:44,041
Believe me just once, will you?

1019
01:30:08,458 --> 01:30:09,625
I'm sorry.

1020
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:13,750
I'm so sorry.

1021
01:31:28,916 --> 01:31:30,458
Let's go ride that cruise.

1022
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,458
Tomorrow.

1023
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,000
Bring the kids as well.

1024
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:39,458
I'll take all of you.

1025
01:31:42,250 --> 01:31:43,250
Okay?

1026
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,791
If you could give me
ten million right now,

1027
01:31:56,708 --> 01:31:58,000
I'll live with you.

1028
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:22,708
Ann, can you not leave me?

1029
01:32:28,375 --> 01:32:29,666
I'm trying.

1030
01:32:32,916 --> 01:32:35,416
But you have to give me
some time, can you?

1031
01:32:42,583 --> 01:32:43,833
I can't wait, Tong.

1032
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:51,916
Ann.

1033
01:33:03,791 --> 01:33:06,250
You know that I might
be able to make it, right?

1034
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:16,583
Yes, I know.

1035
01:33:20,583 --> 01:33:21,583
You know…

1036
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,416
whether it be 10 million

1037
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:29,166
or 20 million…

1038
01:33:32,791 --> 01:33:34,125
you'll be able to earn it.

1039
01:33:37,916 --> 01:33:39,333
You're going to make it.

1040
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,000
I know it.

1041
01:34:43,458 --> 01:34:45,166
Mom. Where did you go?

1042
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,083
I went to move the car.

1043
01:34:49,125 --> 01:34:51,791
Why are you dressed like you went out?

1044
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:53,750
What's with all the questions?

1045
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:03,916
Where are you going now?

1046
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,583
Collect my money from Oom.

1047
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:08,125
She's been avoiding me for days.

1048
01:35:10,166 --> 01:35:11,416
Don't come!

1049
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:12,791
Stay home.

1050
01:35:31,166 --> 01:35:32,166
Ann.

1051
01:35:32,750 --> 01:35:34,458
Is your mom home?

1052
01:35:34,541 --> 01:35:37,083
She never answers my calls.

1053
01:35:38,041 --> 01:35:39,041
She's not home.

1054
01:35:39,125 --> 01:35:40,250
Where is she?

1055
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:44,791
I don't know either.

1056
01:36:02,916 --> 01:36:04,458
Go get her.

1057
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Mom.

1058
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:13,916
Knock again.

1059
01:36:17,583 --> 01:36:19,666
Mom. Auntie Nee is here.

1060
01:36:24,375 --> 01:36:25,375
Where?

1061
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:28,041
The 200,000 you said
you were going to pay me back.

1062
01:36:28,125 --> 01:36:30,250
-Where is it?
-I'm looking for it.

1063
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:32,208
How? Where?

1064
01:36:33,166 --> 01:36:35,083
By playing cards like this?

1065
01:36:36,125 --> 01:36:37,833
Don't play tricks on me, Oom.

1066
01:36:38,583 --> 01:36:41,791
I'll tell the captain about
what you've been doing.

1067
01:36:41,875 --> 01:36:43,500
You'll get kicked out.

1068
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,208
-Please don't do that, Nee.
-Stop it.

1069
01:36:45,833 --> 01:36:49,750
By the end of this month,
you must return the 200,000 to me.

1070
01:36:51,083 --> 01:36:53,666
I've noticed Ann's got money to spend now.

1071
01:36:54,541 --> 01:36:56,708
-Go get Tong to find it for you.
-Mom.

1072
01:36:57,458 --> 01:36:58,583
What's with you?

1073
01:36:58,666 --> 01:37:01,208
Why do you need the money so urgently?

1074
01:37:01,291 --> 01:37:03,333
You see how they're having problems.

1075
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:05,625
How are they going to return the money?

1076
01:37:09,416 --> 01:37:10,833
You really want to know

1077
01:37:11,416 --> 01:37:12,541
the reason, right?

1078
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:14,875
Come.

1079
01:37:33,041 --> 01:37:35,291
Your dad is living in that house
with his mistress.

1080
01:37:38,375 --> 01:37:39,375
Mistress?

1081
01:37:40,625 --> 01:37:41,625
Who?

1082
01:37:42,250 --> 01:37:44,250
A woman from that gambling den.

1083
01:37:44,958 --> 01:37:47,500
He told us he had no money
to buy us the house.

1084
01:37:49,625 --> 01:37:52,083
It's because he spent it all
buying this one.

1085
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,666
He doesn't want us anymore.

1086
01:38:01,833 --> 01:38:04,041
He will leave us in that shitty flats.

1087
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:16,416
Phong, you bastard!

1088
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,458
-Bitch!
-Mom!

1089
01:38:19,541 --> 01:38:20,916
Come out right now.

1090
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,416
One of us must die today.

1091
01:38:32,958 --> 01:38:33,958
Mom!

1092
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:37,208
Didn't you think about me?

1093
01:38:37,291 --> 01:38:40,291
If you get thrown in jail,
what will happen to me?

1094
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,333
Live with your dad.

1095
01:38:44,500 --> 01:38:46,125
You hate me anyway!

1096
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:47,250
I don't want that.

1097
01:38:48,208 --> 01:38:49,750
I want to live with you.

1098
01:38:57,458 --> 01:38:58,458
Jane.

1099
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:20,833
Honey, take your mom back home.

1100
01:39:22,250 --> 01:39:24,416
If I go out now, it'll cause a scene.

1101
01:39:37,958 --> 01:39:39,375
Let's go back home.

1102
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:17,833
I need to collect all the money
I loaned out

1103
01:41:20,333 --> 01:41:22,500
so we can buy a house with it.

1104
01:41:28,916 --> 01:41:31,291
We can't stay here anymore, Jane.

1105
01:42:58,916 --> 01:43:01,291
Ann, what did you ask the Guardian for?

1106
01:43:02,916 --> 01:43:05,166
I can't tell you. It won't come true.

1107
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:07,416
Ann. Hold on.

1108
01:43:07,500 --> 01:43:08,500
Sit down first.

1109
01:43:19,791 --> 01:43:20,791
Ann.

1110
01:43:24,041 --> 01:43:26,208
This is my ring.

1111
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:29,541
My mom gave it to me when I was a kid.

1112
01:43:31,916 --> 01:43:33,291
You can sell it.

1113
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,916
And return the money to my mom.

1114
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:42,333
I can't take it, Jane.

1115
01:43:42,416 --> 01:43:43,416
Ann.

1116
01:43:48,750 --> 01:43:50,416
This time, I'm begging you.

1117
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:54,541
Let me help you.

1118
01:44:24,708 --> 01:44:26,458
You belong with me.

1119
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:29,958
Don't you ever leave me.

1120
01:44:30,958 --> 01:44:31,958
Okay?

1121
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,208
Can I borrow 30,000 from you?

1122
01:45:04,333 --> 01:45:06,166
Just charge me interest.

1123
01:45:07,958 --> 01:45:09,833
My kid is in hospital.

1124
01:45:09,916 --> 01:45:12,000
The little one's very sick.

1125
01:45:12,666 --> 01:45:14,583
She's been in the ICU for a few days.

1126
01:45:14,666 --> 01:45:17,541
-Should I collect Auntie Boom's fee?
-But she still hasn't recovered.

1127
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:21,833
-Sure, it's the end of the month.
-Yes, I'm stressed.

1128
01:45:21,916 --> 01:45:22,958
Okay.

1129
01:45:23,041 --> 01:45:24,125
-Ink.
-She's my daughter.

1130
01:45:24,708 --> 01:45:26,333
-Let's go.
-The treatment costs tens of thousands.

1131
01:45:29,666 --> 01:45:32,000
Damn it.

1132
01:45:35,916 --> 01:45:37,958
What did Tong say about the money?

1133
01:45:45,458 --> 01:45:47,333
I've already broken up with him.

1134
01:45:49,083 --> 01:45:50,416
Are you stupid?

1135
01:45:51,500 --> 01:45:55,625
Don't you see that I have to beg around
asking people to lend me money?

1136
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:59,500
Have you ever thought of
helping the family out?

1137
01:46:01,875 --> 01:46:03,791
And how have I never helped you?

1138
01:46:06,416 --> 01:46:09,583
Ever since Dad died,
I've always helped you earn money.

1139
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,250
Can't I have a life of my own?

1140
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,708
Do you still dare
to only think about yourself?

1141
01:46:17,791 --> 01:46:19,041
Did you ever know?

1142
01:46:19,125 --> 01:46:23,208
The reason your dad was in debt
was that he used the money on you guys.

1143
01:46:24,333 --> 01:46:25,458
Let me tell you,

1144
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:28,583
you should give up your dream
of becoming a flight attendant.

1145
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:32,625
Don't you think I don't know
about your plan to leave us.

1146
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:37,375
You're going to leave me
and your sisters, just like your dad!

1147
01:46:41,958 --> 01:46:43,916
Why did you even have me?

1148
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:58,333
If you aren't going to help,

1149
01:46:59,166 --> 01:47:00,583
I'll do it my own way.

1150
01:48:03,125 --> 01:48:04,958
Hello, this is the police station.

1151
01:48:06,458 --> 01:48:09,375
There are people gambling at the flats.

1152
01:48:09,458 --> 01:48:10,750
Building 2, room 105.

1153
01:48:12,208 --> 01:48:14,250
Could you come and take care of it?

1154
01:48:18,875 --> 01:48:20,458
Mom, do you want anything?

1155
01:48:21,208 --> 01:48:23,166
No. Look after your sisters.

1156
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:25,750
-Okay.
-When will you get out?

1157
01:48:27,125 --> 01:48:28,416
Soon.

1158
01:48:42,166 --> 01:48:43,916
They are so damn mean.

1159
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:46,125
They kicked us out like stray dogs.

1160
01:48:47,833 --> 01:48:49,541
I don't know what to do.

1161
01:48:49,625 --> 01:48:53,000
Are you going to marry Tong
or become a cop?

1162
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:54,500
Think about it.

1163
01:48:56,541 --> 01:48:59,291
Or else, we'll all just live out
on the streets.

1164
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:56,291
Ann.

1165
01:49:57,666 --> 01:49:59,125
Ann.

1166
01:50:03,708 --> 01:50:04,708
Ann.

1167
01:50:07,416 --> 01:50:08,416
Ann.

1168
01:50:11,583 --> 01:50:12,625
Ann.

1169
01:50:13,291 --> 01:50:14,500
Where are you going?

1170
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:16,541
It'd be nice if the cruise kept moving
and never turned back.

1171
01:51:25,666 --> 01:51:27,291
How about we close our eyes?

1172
01:51:29,333 --> 01:51:31,000
That way, when it turns back around,

1173
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:33,125
we won't know.

1174
01:55:31,583 --> 01:55:32,583
Let's go.

1175
01:55:46,625 --> 01:55:47,625
Mom.

1176
01:55:59,125 --> 01:56:00,125
Jane.

1177
01:56:03,333 --> 01:56:05,125
Do you know how to make edits?

1178
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:07,458
Edit what, Mom?

1179
01:56:10,166 --> 01:56:12,583
Can you edit my face onto this picture?

1180
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:17,041
Why?

1181
01:56:19,708 --> 01:56:21,958
I want to have a picture with him

1182
01:56:22,041 --> 01:56:23,291
when he's smiling.

1183
01:56:31,458 --> 01:56:33,083
It won't look real, Mom.

1184
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:37,541
It's fine.

1185
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:39,833
Just do what you can.

1186
01:57:13,625 --> 01:57:15,666
Earng. I brought a fan for you.

1187
01:57:16,916 --> 01:57:18,083
Thanks, Jane.

1188
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:22,541
Where's Auntie Oom?

1189
01:57:23,708 --> 01:57:24,916
I don't know either.

1190
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,958
She's probably over
at Auntie Daeng's room.

1191
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,583
Here, for you.

1192
01:57:35,541 --> 01:57:37,083
Hey, it's fine, Jane.

1193
01:57:37,875 --> 01:57:41,041
I don't really play much these days.

1194
01:57:42,333 --> 01:57:44,666
I want to give it to you. Just take it.

1195
01:57:46,458 --> 01:57:48,875
I usually don't use this one anyway.

1196
01:57:49,583 --> 01:57:50,625
Okay.

1197
01:57:54,250 --> 01:57:57,458
Come out and play today, okay?
As a final hurrah for me.

1198
01:57:59,833 --> 01:58:01,958
I don't think I can, Jane.

1199
01:58:02,041 --> 01:58:04,458
I have to iron the clothes
and deliver them today.

1200
01:58:12,583 --> 01:58:13,916
Can I have that?

1201
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:21,500
This one?

1202
01:58:37,125 --> 01:58:38,375
DOG SHIT COURT

1203
01:58:38,458 --> 01:58:41,625
When they come to repaint,
don't let them cover it up.

1204
01:58:42,666 --> 01:58:45,208
I don't think it'll be possible.
Let's take a picture.

1205
01:58:45,875 --> 01:58:46,875
Sure.

1206
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:52,833
Hey, hold on.

1207
01:59:07,583 --> 01:59:08,583
Hurry.

1208
01:59:11,333 --> 01:59:12,833
-My turn.
-Sure.

1209
01:59:46,208 --> 01:59:52,750
JANE, NICE, INK, AMY, EARNG, TONG, ANN

1210
02:00:03,083 --> 02:00:04,708
Tong, let's go.

1211
02:00:05,833 --> 02:00:09,000
It's your turn to be on the lookout
and I'll take the bet, okay?

1212
02:00:46,916 --> 02:00:50,250
This number is not in service
at the moment.

1213
02:00:51,416 --> 02:00:54,166
Please leave a message after the tone.

1214
02:01:01,875 --> 02:01:02,958
Hello, Ann.

1215
02:01:03,958 --> 02:01:04,958
It's Jane.

1216
02:01:08,333 --> 02:01:09,458
I don't know

1217
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:12,041
if you'll get to hear this.

1218
02:01:13,333 --> 02:01:15,916
But I still want to tell you.

1219
02:01:19,375 --> 02:01:20,375
Tomorrow,

1220
02:01:21,875 --> 02:01:23,916
I'll be moving out of the flat.

1221
02:01:27,291 --> 02:01:29,000
My parents divorced.

1222
02:01:31,708 --> 02:01:33,541
Without you here,

1223
02:01:35,500 --> 02:01:37,458
moving out

1224
02:01:37,541 --> 02:01:39,666
doesn't seem as hard as I thought.

1225
02:01:43,916 --> 02:01:46,375
That day,
we asked the Guardian for a wish…

1226
02:01:48,625 --> 02:01:49,666
I guessed

1227
02:01:51,166 --> 02:01:53,458
you asked to leave this place, right?

1228
02:01:57,458 --> 02:01:59,083
I hope I guessed it right.

1229
02:02:02,208 --> 02:02:05,166
Because at least your wish came true.

1230
02:02:09,750 --> 02:02:10,958
But do you know

1231
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:13,791
what did I wish for?

1232
02:02:20,541 --> 02:02:23,166
I asked for us to be here
together forever.

1233
02:02:28,750 --> 02:02:30,916
And why did the Guardian take sides?

1234
02:02:31,916 --> 02:02:33,416
He only granted your wish.

1235
02:02:37,458 --> 02:02:38,458
That day,

1236
02:02:39,291 --> 02:02:40,291
I wished

1237
02:02:40,916 --> 02:02:43,083
to wake up and become an adult

1238
02:02:44,333 --> 02:02:47,458
who could solve
all the problems of this world.

1239
02:02:48,958 --> 02:02:52,125
That way, I'd know how to make
my dad love my mom again.

1240
02:02:54,416 --> 02:02:58,416
And I'd know how to ease your pain

1241
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:00,208
so you'd stay with me.

1242
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:06,625
Sounds like a silly wish, doesn't it?

1243
02:03:08,625 --> 02:03:10,666
That's why the Guardian didn't grant it.

1244
02:03:21,833 --> 02:03:23,375
I miss you, Ann.

1245
02:03:25,375 --> 02:03:26,958
I miss you terribly.

1246
02:03:31,541 --> 02:03:32,541
Even though

1247
02:03:33,208 --> 02:03:36,166
we aren't still together like I wished…

1248
02:03:38,750 --> 02:03:40,250
I'm glad

1249
02:03:41,291 --> 02:03:43,416
to have grown up together with you.

1250
02:03:48,958 --> 02:03:52,375
And I'll live my life well.

1251
02:03:54,833 --> 02:03:59,208
And I hope one day,
we'll bump into each other on a plane…

1252
02:04:02,041 --> 02:04:05,166
because you'll have to take me
to sit in first class.

1253
02:04:06,208 --> 02:04:07,333
Remember?

1254
02:04:37,791 --> 02:04:44,416
ANN
