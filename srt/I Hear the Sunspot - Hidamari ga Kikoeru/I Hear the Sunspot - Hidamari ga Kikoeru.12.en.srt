1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,030
I'm Sai from Sign.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,580
I'm Chiba from the same company.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,870
Oh, it's finally my turn.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:12,640
Ah.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:14,870
I'm Sakawa from the same company.

6
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,820
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,700
Alright. Then let's start the training now.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,710
Everyone.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,090
Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,840
Applause!

11
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,570
Alright. Thank you, everyone.

12
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:32,250
This means "overseas". This means "domestic".

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,040
Journey. That's right. Start with this finger to make a gesture.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,320
Welcome.

15
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,070
Do it slowly like this.

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,530
Welcome.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:44,920
-Welcome.
-That's right.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,980
Welcome.

19
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:48,810
By the way, Sakawa...

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,280
Yes?

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,230
Are you the one who made the training materials today?

22
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:54,390
Yes.

23
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,070
Oh.

24
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,950
Well, I have something else to do.

25
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,290
Go back to our company with Mr. Sai first.

26
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,080
Huh? Ah?

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
Your "oh" means that I did a good job, right? Mr. Chiba.

28
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,770
The most important thing is to think from the customers' perspectives.

29
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,680
By learning sign language,

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,390
I've found that the employees' consciousness has all changed.

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,650
Really? Thank you for your compliments.

32
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:25,470
Well,

33
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,900
I wanted to ask you before.

34
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,480
Yes?

35
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,110
Mr. Sai,

36
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,190
why did you set up Sign?

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,660
Oh, well...

38
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,220
Maybe it was because of a romantic relationship.

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,740
A romantic relationship?

40
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,310
What?

41
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,620
-Yes, a romantic relationship. That's right.
-A romantic relationship?

42
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,700
Because of a romantic relationship?

43
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,220
I fell in love with

44
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,479
a deaf-mute girl.

45
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,479
Ah?

46
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,960
That girl was in the same group as me.

47
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,759
She was an amazing girl.

48
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,780
-Ah?
-I started to learn sign language to be friends with her.

49
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:04,870
But when you use sign language on the street,

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,289
people will stare at you in a very strange way,

51
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:10,169
and tbey'll also laugh at you.

52
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,170
Yes.

53
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,410
At that time, I was thinking that

54
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,200
if in this world, when someone used sign language as a greeting way,

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,250
he could also get a response in the way of sign language,

56
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:20,620
would she live a happier life?

57
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,550
Although our relationship didn't last till the end,

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,230
I hope that what I'm doing now

59
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,070
can make her, whose whereabouts are unknown to me,

60
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,200
and those who have the same ideas as her

61
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,910
get a bit of salvation one day.

62
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,140
Are you also doing this for the same reason?

63
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,060
Hmm?

64
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,650
You'd rather change the world for someone you want to protect.

65
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,390
Do you also have someone like that?

66
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,990
Why didn't you contact me?

67
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,500
Oh, Yoko.

68
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,550
Why did you say "oh"?

69
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:32,550
We haven't seen each other for a long time, Taichi. By the way...

70
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,890
When can we participate in social events?

71
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,290
You haven't changed at all.

72
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,100
Stop complimenting me like that.

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,740
Who's complimenting you?

74
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,660
Hey, Yoko!

75
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,770
What a mess this is.

76
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,440
Oh, no. Yasu is back.

77
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,920
How come it's not good when I'm back? Who are you talking with on the phone?

78
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,790
It's Taichi.

79
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,579
-What?
-Well...

80
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:54,620
Stop talking on the phone. Just stop it.

81
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,610
Just clean it up.

82
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,130
-Give it back to me.
-I won't give it back to you. Clean it up at once.

83
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,250
If you do this again, I'll forbid you to come in.

84
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,980
Clean it up at once.

85
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,180
Hurry up!

86
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:07,440
Oh, how are you, Taichi?

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,830
Oh, Yasu.

88
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,140
I'm fine.

89
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,600
Oh, really?

90
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,720
You'll get fired if you fight with others.

91
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,180
I won't fight with others.

92
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,350
Ah!

93
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,660
Clean it up carefully.

94
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,940
Can't you see that I'm cleaning it up now?

95
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,220
Oh, by the way,

96
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,380
Sugihara also seems to get along well with that guy now.

97
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,780
Hmm? What do you mean by "that guy now"?

98
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,770
I mean the new note-taker.

99
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,610
Did you hear that?

100
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,110
Oh, really?

101
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,610
Isn't that good?

102
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,430
Oh, by the way,

103
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,600
let's invite Taichi to join the celebration event, too.

104
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,380
The summer will be over soon.

105
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,340
Since then, Kouhei and I

106
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,820
have never met each other.

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,250
Thank you.

108
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,960
Yes.

109
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,970
That's right.

110
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,930
Oh, Mr. Sai!

111
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,680
This is the manager of the cafe.

112
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,380
-Nice to meet you.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,090
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

114
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,070
This is our CEO.

115
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,190
Well, nice to meet you. I'm sorry.

116
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,130
Be careful. It's hot.

117
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:15,530
Sakawa, put this in the meeting room.

118
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,340
Yes.

119
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,150
Ah! This is Mr. Chiba.

120
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,580
Though he looks a bit scary,

121
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,270
-he's a good person.
-What are you saying?

122
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,640
Nice to meet you.

123
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:23,920
This is the manager of the cafe.

124
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,820
Oh, hello.

125
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,190
Oh, Maya.

126
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,810
Oh, Maya.

127
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,630
Hello, Uncle.

128
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,159
Are you hiding because of what happened that day?

129
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,550
This is the stuff which my mother asked me to bring here.

130
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,950
Oh, thank you.

131
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:44,620
Well...

132
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,680
Mr. Sai once mentioned it before.

133
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,230
Oh, that's right.

134
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,850
She's a child of my relative, who is studying at the same university as you.

135
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,820
Maya is my lovely eldest niece.

136
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,740
-Why are you shy?
-No, I'm not shy.

137
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:01,260
-What's wrong? I even changed your diaper.
-Oh, stop saying it!

138
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,010
Just stop it.

139
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,880
-Mr. Sai. There's a call for you.
-Yes? Okay.

140
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,010
Take your time to chat with each other.

141
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,960
Well...

142
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,330
Yes?

143
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,020
Please don't tell Kouhei that

144
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm working in Sign.

145
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,500
How would I tell him about it?

146
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,610
You haven't told him yet, so I won't tell him, either.

147
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,770
I'm sure he also doesn't want anyone else but you to tell him about it.

148
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,930
I didn't expect you to be so nice.

149
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,860
Huh? Are you trying to get close to me?

150
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,100
No, I'm not.

151
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,260
Then why are you unwilling to tell him yourself?

152
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:01,390
Since I... came here to work,

153
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,070
I've finally understood it.

154
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,320
What have you understood?

155
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,360
Actually, expressing ourselves

156
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,420
is really something very difficult.

157
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,330
After I started the job of training,

158
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,750
I've often thought about whether what I want to say

159
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,630
is conveyed to the other person correctly.

160
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,260
However,

161
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,020
since it's the same for people who can hear sounds,

162
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,180
what about those who can't hear?

163
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,080
Will this kind of feeling be more intense?

164
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,460
In this way, they'll be under a lot of pressure gradually.

165
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,230
They might want to hide themselves in a shell.

166
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:48,650
Kouhei was like that from the beginning.

167
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,390
But speaking of that guy,

168
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,210
ever since I saw him smile so well like that,

169
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,409
as I want to see that expression,

170
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,790
I've been trying to make him smile like that more often.

171
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,700
If I work on it alone, my power may be weak.

172
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,530
But if I work hard with Mr. Sai and the others,

173
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,870
maybe there will be more and more

174
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:21,430
such places where people who can't hear

175
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,420
won't feel lonely.

176
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,760
Maybe one day in the future,

177
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,650
such a place will also appear by his side.

178
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,770
Wherever he is,

179
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,370
it can make him smile.

180
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,570
How I wish that the world could become like this.

181
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,800
What kind of thing is this?

182
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,770
What? Is there anything wrong with it?

183
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,130
Why didn't you tell Kouhei about these things?

184
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,340
Oh, why didn't I tell him?

185
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,850
When I see Kouhei, I feel embarrassed and can't say it.

186
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,210
So you mean...

187
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,080
Hmm? What?

188
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,720
How come you're so slow-witted?

189
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:30,170
What on earth are you talking about?

190
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,040
That's enough. It's time to find out about your true feelings, right?

191
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,050
My feelings?

192
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:39,570
Idiot!

193
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,010
What?

194
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,400
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

195
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,090
You annoying girl!

196
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,750
No matter how stupid you are,

197
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,820
you wouldn't have done so much just for an ordinary friend, would you?

198
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,410
What?

199
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,580
I forgot to tell you something.

200
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,170
What is it?

201
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,430
Thank you for

202
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,350
what you did at that time.

203
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,550
At that time?

204
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,820
When was that?

205
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,600
You're such an idiot.

206
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,090
What?

207
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,780
Oh, are you leaving?

208
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,350
I'll see you off.

209
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,430

00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,350
Kouhei.

212
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,430
[Summer Fair, Katsunuma Shrine]

213
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,090
We're at the Torii Gate.

214
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:04,280
Isn't that Taichi?

215
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,240
I've told you it's not Taichi.

216
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,210
Torii Gate.

217
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,950
We're at the Torii Gate.

218
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,590
You're at the gate below.

219
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,980
Taichi's here. Taichi!

220
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,950
We're here!

221
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,040
Oh!

222
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,360
Oh, it's this way.

223
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:19,220
You're well prepared.

224
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,520
No, I'm not.

225
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,130
My grandpa insisted that I should wear it.

226
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,750
It suits you quite well.

227
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,370
You look a bit like a primary school student.

228
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,240
Do you want me to buy you a marshmallow?

229
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,470
Hey.

230
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,670
Are you laughing at me?

231
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,420
No.

232
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,680
Well, where's Sugihara?

233
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,200
I told you to invite him too, didn't I?

234
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,370
It seems that you haven't met each other, either.

235
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,240
Huh? You didn't tell me, either.

236
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,520
I did.

237
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,870
I really didn't hear it.

238
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,190
Right?

239
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,180
It looks delicious.

240
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:48,960

243
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,490
Oh, no.

244
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,380
I got separated from them.

245
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,600
Yoko!

246
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,530
Yasu!

247
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:04,860
Kouhei?

248
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,170
Kouhei!

249
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:12,230
Kouhei!

250
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,040
Kouhei!

251
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,030
Yummy!

252
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,680
It's delicious, right?

253
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,450
Yes.

254
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,060
You also can't find your mother?

255
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,000
Right.

256
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:59,410
I think she saw a friend. I don't know where she went.

257
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:04,980
She said she didn't want to come alone and insisted that I should come with her.

258
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,900
Hey, Taichi.

259
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,000
Yes?

260
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,160
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

261
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,060
Yeah.

262
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,530
You must be very busy.

263
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,220
Well...

264
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,520
Yes.

265
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
You didn't even have time to call me?

266
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,430
No, I didn't. But...

267
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,770
You also didn't contact me, did you?

268
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,730
I couldn't take the initiative to contact you.

269
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:37,530
Why?

270
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,500
If you were working hard, I surely couldn't disturb you.

271
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,230
Yasu told me that

272
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:01,000
you got along well with

273
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,530
the new note-taker.

274
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,050
Yeah.

275
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,710
We get along well with each other.

276
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,100
Really?

277
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,220
That's good.

278
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,690
I missed you very much.

279
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,930
I've been missing you all this time.

280
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:38,990

282
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:46,920
Hey, Taichi.

283
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,330
Can we still meet each other like this?

284
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,650
Meeting each other as friends.

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,650
Oh.

286
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,410
Of course.

287
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,310
What are you talking about?

288
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,320
That's great.

289
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,730
It's almost time to go back.

290
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,730
Bye.

291
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,130
I'm such an idiot.

292
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,850
Why haven't I realized it until now?

293
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,550
Why didn't I notice it then?

294
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,190
Wow!

295
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,340
It hurts.

296
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,130
It was not easy for us

297
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,050
to finally have the same feelings.

298
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,010
Well,

299
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,620
can we express a meaning like this with sign language?

300
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:57,760
Oh, yes.

301
00:15:59,050 --> 00:15:59,920
This means

302
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,720
I like you.

303
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,260
Legal sociology

304
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,340
is a science for observing the legal system.

305
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,420
In this subject, we need to pay special attention to

306
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,920
the difference between legal interpretation and legal sociology.

307
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,500
Basically, legal interpretation

308
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,030
is to think about the law from the inner side of the legal system.

309
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,290
I mean, if possible, next time, let's...

310
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,210
What next time?

311
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,090
[Dear Zombie]

312
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,670
I plan to start filming the second movie next month.

313
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,220
Kouhei?

314
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,940
Why are you here?

315
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:18,619
Because...

316
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,050
if we part from each other like this,

317
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,050
I feel that I may never see you again.

318
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,040
I'm not alone anymore.

319
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,130
There is also

320
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,240
a place for me over there.

321
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,910
Taichi, it's you

322
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,000
who taught me that.

323
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:58,330
However,

324
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,710
even though it's like this, I still want to be with you.

325
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:10,550
I've always wanted to suppress my own feelings.

326
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
But I still couldn't do that indeed.

327
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,280
I don't want to be friends with you.

328
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,930
I like you.

329
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,100
I've still liked you even till now.

330
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,260
All that I think about is you.

331
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,380
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,850
I said something like that again.

333
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,820
Huh?

334
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
Why are you apologizing?

335
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,860
Don't always apologize to me first like this.

336
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
I haven't said anything yet, have I?

337
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,990
Obviously, I like you, too.

338
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,010
I've been missing you so much all this time.

339
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,660
Although

340
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,030
you may not need me anymore,

341
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,090
I still

342
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,430
want to be with you.

343
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,550
Now,

344
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,640
are you saying these things to me?

345
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,810
Of course!

346
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,100
Who else could it be other than you?

347
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,380
But how is that possible?

348
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,190
Really?

349
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,240
Is this not a joke?

350
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,120
Did I hear it right?

351
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,610
I don't know.

352
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,020
I'm not sure whether I heard it clearly.

353
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,800
I even doubted your voice.

354
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,590
I like you!

355
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,270
I like you, Kouhei.

356
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:01,340
No matter how many times I have to tell you,

357
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,710
I'll be willing to tell you

358
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,230
until you understand everything.

359
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,220
It's so delicious.

360
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,260
Your cooking skills have improved, Kouhei.

361
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,040
You're my son indeed.

362
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,270
Oh, it's sunny now.

363
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:56,990
You did a good job.

364
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,040
I haven't seen this for a long time.

365
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,440
Oh.

366
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,010
Ah.

367
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,390
Maya wants to borrow my notes again.

368
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Let me take a look.

369
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,600
I miss it so much.

370
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,500
Hey, Kouhei.

371
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,010
Yes?

372
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,760
Kouhei,

373
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,640
what would you do if you could start over?

374
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:03,350
It hurts.

375
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,390
Delicious! It's so delicious!

376
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,880
Well...

377
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:15,860
Hey!

378
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,760
Aren't you hungry?

379
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,910
Hey!

380
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,210
What about the lunch box?

381
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,120
Hey!

382
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,490
If I

383
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,160
could start over, it would be nice to be like this, too.

384
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,890
What?

385
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,140
Meeting you

386
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,710
is really something very happy to me.

387
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,900
It's the same to me.

388
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,730
Hmm? What did you say?

389
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:57,490
Well,

390
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,740
nothing.

391
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,120
Say it again.

392
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,480
Hey.

393
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,110
You heard it, right?

394
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:07,620
Hey.

395
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,960
-I won't say it again.
-Why?

396
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:12,060
Stop talking. Let's eat now.

397
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,520
-Let's have lunch.
-Okay.

398
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,420
Hey.

399
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,800
What's the food today?

400
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,150
What is it?

401
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,170
Wow! Isn't this meat roll?

402
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,780
Taichi, I think you like eating it, right?

403
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,380
Yeah, it's my favorite food.

404
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:29,270
I'm going to eat now.

405
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,310
Please.

406
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,130
It's so delicious.

407
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:41,850
It's still so delicious indeed.

408
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,610
Great!

409
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,560
Well, Kouhei...

410
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,280
Yes?

411
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,430
Speaking of the skill of reading lips,

412
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,410
can everybody

413
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,320
master this kind of skill?

414
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,310
Anyone can master it after practice.

415
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,030
Really?

416
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,500
Give me a test.

417
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,000
What?

418
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,910
Say something randomly and test me.

419
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:12,250
Okay.

420
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,340
Come on.

421
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,810
Hmm? Do it again.

422
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
You annoying guy!

423
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,190
Don't say something like that so casually.

424
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,730
What?

425
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,140
Taichi.

426
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,540
Your ears are red.

427
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,060
No, they are not.

428
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,960
They're very red. Did you hear that?

429
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,810
You're so annoying.

430
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,040
Just eat now.

431
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:47,970

432
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,150
I'm going to eat now.
