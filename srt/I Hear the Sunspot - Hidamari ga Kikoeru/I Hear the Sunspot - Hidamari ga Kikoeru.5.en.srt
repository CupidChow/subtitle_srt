That's undoubtedly true.

Why is he not here again today?

What?

25
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,930
He hasn't been here for a week.

That guy...

27
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,070
Is he still talking about Sugihara?

28
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,400
This one thing is all that he's thinking about.

29
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,750
However,

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,070
I contacted him so many times, but he didn't reply at all.

31
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,370

Yasu, can I drink this tea?

38
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,570
Of course. But I also don't know when it was put there.

But I didn't expect that Sugihara would also be so hard to please sometimes.

41
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,810
But I talked to him alone for a while previously.

42
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:35,930
I didn't expect that it would be quite easy to communicate with him.

43
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,660
Previously?

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,600
When did you see Kouhei?

45
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,690
I came across him just before the summer vacation was about to end.

48
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,230
Miho had a crush on Sugihara,

49
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,620
so I asked her to talk to Taichi.

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,300
You told him about Miho's secret?

00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,840
Yes, I did.

53
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,790
Why?

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,180
But why didn't you tell him about it instead?

55
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,000
That's because...

56
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,380
If you need to talk to Sugihara, you can just go to his home to see him.

is gloomy and taciturn.

He's not easy to get along with at all.

132
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,470
In terms of personalities, he's really hard to deal with.

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,030
But I feel that since he met you, he has become different.

134
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,400
When he found out that you liked eating hamburger patties,

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,860
he made a request to me, which was quite rare.

136

He asked me to make it delicious.

137
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,070
He looked quite arrogant.

138
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,130
So,

139
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:47,630
I asked him to make it himself.

140
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,390
What?

141
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,770
He really wanted to hear you say that it's so delicious.

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,760

00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,250
I'm back.

149
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,790
Well, you're back. You're a bit late.

150
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,200
There were many procedures, so it took some time.

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,780
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,090
Well, why are you apologizing?

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,250
Well,

166
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,860
it's just...

167
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:06,440
Hehe.

168
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,400
You can tell me about it if you want. Just sit and talk.

169
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,850
Well, okay.

170
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,750
In other words,

171
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:16,440
that girl

172
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,920
asked some questions

173
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,730
about your friend.

174
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,470
But you didn't

175
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:25,960
tell your friend about this.

176
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,410
Yes.

177
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,790
That's it.

178
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,470
But because of this, I've become estranged from my friend.

179
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:37,060
If your friend

180
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,830
likes that girl very much,

181
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,160
I think he'll be angry.

182
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,580
In addition,

183
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,280
if you

184
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:49,190
like that girl,

185
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,350
and that's why you didn't tell him...

186
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,160
What?

187
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,640
If that's the case,

188
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:57,000
and your friend values you very much,

189
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,110
he might think that it's better not to disturb you two.

190
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,490
Well...

191
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,170
You must be hungry. I'm sorry. I'll go make something to eat for you.

192
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,190
That guy...

193
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:27,000
Hey, Taichi!

194
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,390
Oh!

195
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,540
What's wrong with you? You haven't answered the phone since yesterday.

196
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,290
Well, I'm sorry.

197
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,390
I don't know where I left my phone.

198
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,650
Where did you leave it?

199
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:37,340
I don't know, either.

200
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,240
Anyway,

201
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,750
let me know if you find it.

202
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,870
No, no.

203
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,350
There's work.

204
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,050
What?

205
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,040
Alright. Come with me.

206
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,000
-Work?
-Yes.

207
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,910
What is it?

208
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,540
Don't ask. Just come with me.

209
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,080
Alright.

210
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,560
Wow.

211
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,260
Coming.

212
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,990
What are these?

213
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,610
Well, these are videotapes.

214
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,570
When I was cleaning up the warehouse,

215
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,970
I found many videotapes.

216
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:11,860
After checking the content of the videotapes,

217
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,860
label them again.

218
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,230
Well, this is so troublesome.

219
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,800
Nowadays, no one uses these things, right?

220
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,050
That's why they're precious.

221
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,520
Hey.

222
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,250
Alright.

223
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,420
By the way,

224
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,230
did you go to Sugihara's home?

225
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,540
Yes, I did. But I didn't see him there.

226
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,940
I see.

227
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:36,960
But honestly,

228
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,760
it seems to be my fault.

229
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,900
But why do you care so much about Sugihara?

230
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:53,620
Hey.

231
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,130
Kouhei

232
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,640
is a smart man.

233
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,060
He lives in a big house

234
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,820
and is very popular with girls.

235
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,510
How amazing.

236
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,050
You're right.

237
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,610
However,

238
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:18,080
that guy doesn't want to have any connection with anyone around him.

239
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,340
He always bears the pressure by himself.

240
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,800
He's not confident at all.

241
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,080
Well, why is that?

242
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:32,140
Oh, gosh!

243
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,990
I'm going to close it.

244
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,570
Okay.

245
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,110
But because of that...

246
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,920
Because of his ears, he has accumulated many unhappy memories.

247
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:53,760
That's why his confidence has been completely deprived.

248
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,010
I think it's such a pity.

249
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,910
Kouhei is a good person.

250
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,130
Although he's taciturn

251
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,490
and is not very friendly,

252
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,100
he's a very gentle person.

253
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,710
It's a pity that people don't know

254
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,700
how much effort that guy has made

255
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,320
and how beautiful his smile can be.

256
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,330
That's why those who don't want to learn about him at all

257
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,860
bossed him around self-righteously

258
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,360
and then left him alone.

259
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,710
So,

260
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,130
I can't let him face it alone.

261
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:00,010
So, I...

262
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
Hey, Taichi.

263
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,870
Is this appropriate?

264
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,350
What?

265
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,730
He's right here.

266
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:20,560
You left this

267
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,510
at our home, didn't you?

268
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,770
Oh.

269
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:27,480
It turns out that I left it at your home.

270
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,640
Thank you.

271
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,030
I'll get going then.

272
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,480
Hey!

273
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,420
Wait!

274
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,340
Hey!

275
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,780
Where are you going?

276
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,190
Did you hear what I said just now?

277
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,600
Kouhei!

278
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,660
You know everything, right?

279
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,210
The condition of my ears

280
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,050
is worse than before.

281
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,110
No matter what you said just now, I didn't hear it at all.

282
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,060
I'm sorry.

283
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,110
I lied to you.

284
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,830
What?

285
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,570
It was obvious that I couldn't hear any other sounds.

286
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,870
But I don't know why

287
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,340
I could only hear your voice clearly.

288
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,130
Why did you say something like that?

289
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,910
At this point, you still said that. You're really so crafty.

290
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:50,480
What?

291
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,060
Why do you think I'm crafty?

292
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,570
You're the crafty one.

293
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,460
You didn't contact me at all.

294
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,930
Are you going to break off our friendship without telling me?

295
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:08,920
What's more, you're not quite willing to express your own feelings honestly.

296
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,810
Anyway, you won't understand it even if I tell you.

297
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,540
What do you mean by saying that?

298
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,099
Even if I can't understand it completely,

299
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,180
I also want to try to understand it.

300
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,319
But

301
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,130
if you don't say anything,

302
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:27,160
I'll never understand it.

303
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,030
Whether it's about Miho or anything else,

304
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,800
you have to express your own thoughts clearly.

305
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,580
I beg you. Don't bear the pressure silently alone anymore.

306
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,920
You have to tell the other one about it clearly.

307
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,950
Don't give up from the start.

308
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,000
Why are you crying?

309
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,380
I don't know, either.

310
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,440
I don't know.

311
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,450
You really don't know anything.

312
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:51,770
You're so obtuse.

313
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,280
Really.

314
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:56,590
But

315
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,730
I just like Taichi being like this.

316
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:04,980
Actually,

317
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:07,850
compared with

318
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,260
being unable to hear the sounds,

319
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,150
being hated by you is what I'm more afraid of.

320
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,560
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,790
But I'm still quite glad that I've said it.

322
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,240
Thank you for what you did previously.

323
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:57,850
Hmm.

324
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,560
It's really good.

325
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,160
Hmm.

326
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,180
It's so delicious.

327
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,800
What's wrong with you?

328
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,670
Aren't you going to eat?

329
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,630
I'll eat.

330
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,150
I'm going to eat your Shishamo.

331
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,880
I'll eat it.

332
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:24,680
Okay.

333
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,690
Hmm.

334
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,440
Is it a little bland?

335
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,750
I have to go.

336
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,420
Well, wait, Kouhei.

337
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:55,880
Here you are.

338
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,630
Okay.

339
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:57,730
What?

340
00:20:58,630 --> 00:20:59,560
One is enough.

341
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,740
Then eat both of them.

342
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,380
You're growing.

343
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:07,450
I'm leaving.

344
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,520
Bye.

345
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,170
Oh, Sugihara.

346
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,100
Good morning. Are you okay?

347
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:25,450
I'm fine.

348
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,080
We'll have a presentation event later. Come and watch it if you can.

349
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,870
Well,

350
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,750
can I still join your Sigh Language Club?

351
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,270
Of course you're most welcome to join us.

352
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,230
Well, why do you suddenly want to join us?

353
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,180
Well...

354
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,430
I just want to go take a look.

355
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,430
Kouhei!

356
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,160
I'll never roll down again.

357
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,070
What? You're not happy to see me show up normally?

358
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,370
Well...

359
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,950
Wait.

360
00:22:42,330 --> 00:22:43,300
Hmm.

361
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:45,680
Ah.

362
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,300
I found it.

363
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,880
-Hey, Kouhei.
-Wait.

364
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,040
What?

365
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,850
Are you really okay with it?

366
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,620
After you heard what I said,

367
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,590
you probably don't want to see me anymore, do you?

368
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,660
I see.

369
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:15,980
Well,

370
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,920
though I was a little surprised...

371
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,200
Yeah.

372
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,480
I also didn't know what to do.

373
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,460
I thought a lot.

374
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,380
How I wished I would forget to eat.

375
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:33,770
I kept thinking

376
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,070
about it.

377
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,650
But

378
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,640
no matter how long I thought about it,

379
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,660
I just couldn't find any reasons to hate you.

380
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,170
So,

381
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:55,830
let's talk about this first.

[Recruitment of Note-takers]

383
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,330
I've asked them whether it's still okay to apply for this job.

384
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,410
Kouhei.

385
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,990
Did you hear that?

386
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,800
Yes.

387
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,490
I heard everything clearly.

388
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:37,110
Alright.

389
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,140
Did you hear that?

390
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,580
Yes, I did.

[In the Next Episode]

392
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,800
Shouldn't we enjoy the current moment?

393
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,250
Wow!

394
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,200
If you're so defenseless,

395
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,030
I'll kiss you again.

396
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,140
I won't do something like that.

397
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,140
I won't do anything you don't like.

What will you do if I don't hate it?
