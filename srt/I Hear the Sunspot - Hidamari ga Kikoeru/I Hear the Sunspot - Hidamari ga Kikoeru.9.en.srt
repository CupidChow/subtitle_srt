00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,540
What kind of behavior

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:06,780
would be identified as a crime?

3
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,360
We have to judge it in legal terms.

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,820
For example,

5
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:14,420

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,600
Or was it an accident?

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,860
Anyway,

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:20,190
whether it was intentional or unintentional,

9
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,600
it's very important in legal terms.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,540
In this case, he did it on purpose.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,370
In other words, he did have the intention of robbing it.

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,280
It's essential in legal terms.

-Your facial expression...

202

-Your facial expression seems not right.

Grandpa,

Rather than saying he's always frank,

00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,430
Good job.

384
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,120
This is Ms. Natsumi, the head of this office.

385
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,430
Nice to meet you.

386
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm Okami Maya.

387
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,250
Hello, Okami.

388
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,430
Hello.

389
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,140
Excuse me.

390
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,730
I haven't learned sign language so far.

391
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:16,800
I see.

392
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,260
She's just like me.

393
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,690
That's totally fine.

394
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,960
I look forward to working with you.

395
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,750
I look forward to working with you.

396
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,260
I look forward to working with you.

397
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,360
Well done.

398
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,460
Very good.

399
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,330
Ha ha ha.

400
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,480
But

401
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,790
not everyone can use sign language, right?

402
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,000
Yes.

403
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,600
Do you have any measures to help those

404
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,080
who can't use sign language?

405
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,010
For example,

406
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,750
provide them subtitles,

407
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,140
just like taking notes.

408
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,730
Huh?

409
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:52,330
We don't have such services yet.

410
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,080
Our target is deaf-mute.

411
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:55,490
Deaf?

412
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,180
Ah.

413
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,660
In other words,

414
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,220
they can't hear anything.

415
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,660
For those people, sign language is their first language.

416
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,790
It's completely different from those with poor hearing.

417
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:05,880
Okay, enjoy your cake.

418
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,780
Thank you.

419
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,600
Eh?

420
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,650
Don't you think

421
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,700
it's strange?

422
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,010
Why?

423
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,650
What do you mean?

424
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,750
Because

425
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,520
if we categorize people like this,

426
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,300
it won't help those with hearing disorders.

427
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,190
Gosh.

428
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,010
Are you picking a problem with our company?

429
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,130
Anyway,

430
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:42,180
you think it's wrong to separate the deaf-mutes from people with hearing disorders.

431
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,190
I mean,

432
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,470
people with hearing impairment also suffer a lot.

433
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,970
So I don't think it's necessary to separate them.

434
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,210
I see.

435
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,510
This is an issue about idealism.

436
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,230
For example,

437
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,570
you mentioned subtitles just now.

438
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,620
The subtitles may be necessary for those who can't hear it.

439
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,300
But some people also think the subtitles make the screen narrower.

440
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,160
So they don't want the subtitles.

441
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:18,250
For example, we provide tactile pavements for those who are vision impaired.

442
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,450
But it becomes a barrier for those who sit in a wheelchair.

443
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,010
Once we satisfy one of them, it makes the other party unhappy.

444
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,370
We're not volunteers.

445
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,800
This is our job.

446
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,940
It's impossible to satisfy everyone.

447
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,940
Hey, do you understand?

448
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,700
I couldn't hear what they said anyway.

449
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,840
Kouhei!

450
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,150
I don't want...

451
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,090
to lose the chance of hearing that voice again.

452
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:02,560
Now you don't even tell me how you feel.

453
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,560
You won't understand anyway.

454
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,920
What do you mean by that?

455
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,380
I don't understand.

456
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,780
What?

457
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,220
If you keep saying it's hard,

458
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,690
nothing will change.

459
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,400
How should the tactile pavements not cause troubles

460
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,570
to those in wheelchairs?

461
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,470
Maybe you can solve it if you think carefully.

462
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:28,370
And the subtitles.

463
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,930
How should you prevent the screen from narrowing?

464
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,720
You might be able to solve it too.

465
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,340
Hey.

466
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,130
I...

467
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,760
I don't like giving up at the beginning.

468
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,380
If they think they're the only one who's different,

469
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,940
they must be very lonely.

470
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,400
Everyone is the same.

471
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,950
It's no different from being alone.

472
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,400
But

473
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,740
they can't experience the feeling

474
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,070
when people have the same idea

475
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,890
and laugh together.

476
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,050
It doesn't matter

477
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,970
whether they can hear it or not.

478
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,410
Isn't that what people do when they're together?

479
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,180
Is it that hard?

480
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,070
My...

481
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,780
name is...

482
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,000
Maya.

483
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,490
Try it.

484
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,180
My...

485
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,790
name is...

486
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,690
Maya. Did I do it right?

487
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,660
Yes.

488
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:52,830
My

489
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,230
name is...

490
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Finger language?

491
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,890
It is to express the Japanese phonemes

492
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,220
by means of the fingers.

493
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,660
Ta... I... Chi.

494
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,520
Ta... I... Chi.

495
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,890
You've turned it into "kitsune (a fox)."

496
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,370
-Really?
-That's "ki."

497
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,280
-Like this.
-"Chi."

498
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,060
Ta... I... Chi.

499
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,180
Ha ha.

500
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,610
Did I do it right?

501
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,240
You punk.

502
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,010
What are you trying to say?

503
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,110
I don't know anything.

504
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,530
I'm sorry for being so full of myself.

505
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,650
Excuse me.

506
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,240
Hold on.

507
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:08,910
Eh?

508
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:11,490
I understand what you want to say.

509
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,830
Do you want to work in our company?

510
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:22,600
What?

511
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,040
Huh?

512
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,550
Wait.

513
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,340
Mr. Sai.

514
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,630
Mr. Sai, what are you talking about?

515
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:54,810
[In the Next Episode]

516
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,130
Good luck.

517
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,260
Even if we're short-handed, you should find someone more capable.

518
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,390
What do you think if I drop out of college?

519
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:54,720
Ever since I met Taichi,

520
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,200
I'm glad I'm what I am now.

521
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:58,590
I'm fine.

522
00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,560
[This drama is purely fictional. The names of all characters and groups in this drama are fictional.]

523
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,290
It doesn't matter if I don't have Taichi.
