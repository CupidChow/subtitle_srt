All right, I'll start training.

288
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,330
Well, regarding the starting point of philosophy,

289
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,900
it's generally believed to be in Greece.

290
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,020
From today on,

291
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,540
we'll start to study three most representative Greek philosophers,

292
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,290
Socrates, Plato,

293
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,820
and Aristotle.

294
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,360
First, let's take a look at their relationship.

295
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,410
Socrates

296
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,350
was Plato's teacher,

297
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,050
and Plato was Aristotle's teacher.

298
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,890
[Socrates Plato Aristotle Teacher Teacher]

299
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,350
It is said that Socrates liked to initiate arguments with various people

300
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,420
and refute the other party's views during their discussion.

301
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,250
If we compare him to a contemporary figure, he's quite like Mr. Hiroyuki.

302
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,970
They're pretty alike.

303
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,230
By the way,

304
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,090
Socrates and Plato

305
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,270
were both wrestlers.

306
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,470
They might have also defeated their opponents on the wrestling ground.

307
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,820
[Socrates is the king of rebutting. He's like today's Hiroyuki.]

308
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,310
Anyway, in a word,

309
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,990
we can see that he hated failures a lot.

310
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,420
The summary here seems to be incomplete.

311
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

312
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,420
I failed to follow the teacher.

313
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,570
It's really hard actually,

314
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,010

322
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,410
Was that your friend?

323
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,280
She's from the sign language group.

324
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:13,970
Oh.

325
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,380
That's why she used sign language.

326
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,569
I've never seen anyone sign live.

327
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,569
I don't need sign language.

328
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,319
Why?

329
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,210
Even for those with hearing impairment,

330
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,860
the degree of each person's hearing is different.

331
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,100
Besides, most people don't know sign language.

332
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,760
So it's more troublesome if I use sign language.

333
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:38,810

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,580
isn't that even harder?

337
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,840
It's not, actually.

338
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,280
Anyone can do it through practice.

339
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:49,990
But

340
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:53,230
I don't need it when talking to you, Sakawa.

341
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,190
Huh?

342
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:58,950
Has no one ever told you that you have a very penetrating voice?

343
00:17:58,950 --> 00:17:59,700

I've heard people say that I'm too loud and noisy.

346
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,560
That's a good thing.

347
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,750
Since your voice is penetrating,

348
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,610
people can hear you more clearly.

349
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,650

350
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,470

it's easy to talk to you.

352
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,680
I don't have to listen over and over again.

353
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,410
It's easy to talk to you as well.

354
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:24,430
But you're always alone.

355
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,440
Do you like to be alone?

356
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,780
Not actually.

357
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,040
Oh.

358
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,600
Really?

359
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,620
By the way,

360
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,800
can you stop calling me Sakawa?

361
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,580

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,280
Sorry.

384
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,640
I fell asleep.

385
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,280
Sorry.

386
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,100
I forgot to bring lunch boxes.

387
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,100
Oh, really?

388
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,790
Let's go eat something in the canteen.

389
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:21,400
It's cheaper than eating out.

390
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,200
It's good to eat somewhere else sometimes, right?

391
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,970
You don't want to go?

392
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,760
No, it's not that I don't want to.

393
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
It's just I haven't been there much.

394
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,970
Okay.

395
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:34,650
Shall we?

396
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:35,580
Yes.

397
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,930
I'm so torn.

398
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,870
Hmm.

399
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:43,760
Which one should I eat?

400
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,590
I'll go buy us meal tickets.

401
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,160
Okay.

402
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:49,360
Should I have curry

403
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,120
or fried chicken?

404
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,050
Sugihara.

405
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,420
Our group

406
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,600
is having a party today.

407
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,910
Do you want to come?

408
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,220
Can we go to your party?

409
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,510
You're not in our group, right?

410
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,800
He's not, either.

411
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,380
Why? Just because he's handsome?

412
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,010
That's not the reason.

413
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,920
Then we'll go, too.

414
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,180
It should be okay then.

415
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:24,760
Huh?

416
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,720
Are you ignoring me?

417
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,310
Hey!

418
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,400
Stop it. He just didn't hear you.

419
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,530
Oh, right.

420
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,800
Poor thing.

421
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,570
I said stop it.

422
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,900
You're so off-putting.

423
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,410
Don't be so arrogant just because you're sympathized.

424
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,760
Hey!

425
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,430
What the hell?

426
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,670
Let him go!

427
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,720
Taichi!

428
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,770
It might hurt a little.

429
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,710
I'm ready.

430
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,020
It hurts.

431
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:59,130
It hurts so much!

432
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,930
I'm sorry.

433
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,710
It's okay.

434
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,650
I believe the more it hurts, the faster it heals.

435
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,620
How about a band-aid?

436
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,130
No need.

437
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,420
Hey, you.

438
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,350
Do you always eat alone

439
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,380
because you want to avoid being picked on like that?

440
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,000
Why?

441
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,220
What?

442
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,400
Why did you

443
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,030
hit him, Taichi?

444
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,070
It wasn't your business. You could have stayed out of it.

445
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,830
I couldn't hear what they said anyway.

446
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,490
That's not right.

447
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:02,910
Even though you can't hear them,

448
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,510
you can't just let them say whatever they want.

449
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:08,940
Have you always been like this?

450
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,230
You have to say it when you can't hear what they say.

451
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,640
Ask them to repeat it.

452
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,940
Why should you think for them?

453
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,250
It's not your fault that you can't hear.

454
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,950
I didn't think much

455
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,980
before I said it,

456
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:36,620
so I didn't realize

457
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,750
why you cried at that time

458
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,670
at all.

459
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:52,490
[In the Next Episode]

460
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,490
I shouldn't have expectations.

461
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,150
Taichi and I

462
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,400
are also from different worlds.

463
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,810
Oh, Kouhei!

464
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,250
But...

465
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,780
