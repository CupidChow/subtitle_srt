1
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:06,330
I'm home.

2
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,690
Exactly.

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,780
I'm in a dilemma too.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,140
He has two children.

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,650
It's not a lot, but I don't have the energy to take care of Taichi anymore.

6
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:29,450
You don't deserve to be a mother!

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,009
What kind of mother would abandon her own son?

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,070
If that's the case,

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,690
take him back to your place.

10
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,140
Aren't you his father?

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:38,080
I can't.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,850
My wife doesn't know how to take care of children.

13
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,600
These are just excuses.

14
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,780
After all, you're still the same.

15
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,460
You only think about yourself.

16
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,280
What did you say?

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,190
You're the cause of all this.

18
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:52,390
What's wrong with me?

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,760
Taichi.

20
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,760
From now on,

21
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,640
you'll live with Grandpa.

22
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,640
When Plato was 60,

23
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,890
the young Aristotle was only 17 years old.

24
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,780
He joined the academy that year.

25
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,460
Although Aristotle was a disciple of Plato,

26
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,440
he often criticized Plato's theories.

27
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,510
I will introduce Aristotle's theories to you

28
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,660
in the next class.

29
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,350
What?

30
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,320
What's wrong?

31
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,670
The class is over.

32
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,829
I'm hungry.

33
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:30,700
I can't move a bit.

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,060
Why?

35
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,440
I'm hungry!

36
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:36,610
Okay.

37
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,430
Let's eat here.

38
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:41,829
Can we eat here?

39
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:43,300
Yes.

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,430
Then...

41
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,610
Okay, take out the lunch box.

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,160
-Roger that.
-Take it out quickly.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,220
Okay.

44
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,610
What's the menu today?

45
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,640
-Hurry up.
-Got it.

46
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,110
Bon Appétit.

47
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,290
Oh.

48
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,390
Aren't these hamburger patties?

49
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,720
You don't like them?

50
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,160
Of course I do.

51
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,890
I like them so much that I want to marry them.

52
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,810
Glad to hear that.

53
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,450
Wow.

54
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,430
What?

55
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:14,250
Your piece is bigger.

56
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:16,970
They're the same.

57
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,829
Obviously, your piece is bigger.

58
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:19,410
Ah.

59
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,420
How about I swap it with you?

60
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,610
Can I?

61
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,740
No, it's okay.

62
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,480
Why?

63
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,100
It makes me look like a child.

64
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,700
You're indeed a child.

65
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:36,150
Did you say something just now?

66
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,829
I didn't.

67
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,700
You did, right?

68
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,950
-No.
-You did.

69
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,870
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

70
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,160
Okay, cut it out.

71
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,850
-You've been treating me like a child, right?
-Do you want some?

72
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,260
Yes. No, I don't want.

73
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,880
[I Hear the Sunspot]

74
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,600
(Grunting)

75
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,140
Yummy.

76
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,980
Kouhei, your mother is really good at cooking.

77
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:03,110
Sort of. She runs a cooking class.

78
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,190
Wow, that's awesome.

79
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:07,620
So nice.

80
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,680
You can eat such delicious food every day.

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,130
Oh, you're here, Taichi.

82
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,000
I've been looking for you.

83
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:20,600
You're enjoying the food here again.

84
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,420
I won't give it to you.

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,650
Let's get down to business.

86
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:28,170
You have to come next Saturday.

87
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,320
Okay, I got it.

88
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,190
Saturday?

89
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,070
Yes.

90
00:05:32,409 --> 00:05:34,670
The Film Research Club is going to film a video.

91
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,490
And then...

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:36,930
Oh.

93
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,909
Come over if you're free.

94
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,350
What?

95
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,170
Can you come, Sugihara?

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,320
No, I...

97
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,770
Come on. It's fun.

98
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,460
But...

99
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,780
It's just one day.

100
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,610
But...

101
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,170
I'll buy you dinner. No, I'll buy you juice.

102
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,190
But...

103
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:55,250
Don't say "but" anymore! So annoying.

104
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,580
Shut up and come join us.

105
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,490
Fine.

106
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,020
You just agreed, right?

107
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,960
You must come.

108
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,730
Yeah!

109
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,520
Okay, let me tell you the story.

110
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,130
You are a group of high school students who died in an accident.

111
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,190
Do you understand?

112
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,850
And then, you came back to life because of a supernatural power.

113
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,700
Isn't that a zombie?

114
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,280
Is that okay?

115
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,480
It's indeed a zombie.

116
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,190
But,

117
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,220
I've never acted before.

118
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,380
No worries.

119
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,070
You're very athletic, so you should be fine.

120
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,380
It has nothing to do with my athletic prowess.

121
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,920
-It might work.
-Yasu.

122
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,390
Yes?

123
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,380
Can I introduce her?

124
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,010
Of course.

125
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,760
This is my cousin, Miho.

126
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,220
She's a freshman at the Xiehe Girls' School.

127
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,220
She's free now,

128
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,710
so she came to help.

129
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,400
-Hey, I'm not free.
-Anyway,

130
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,280
I'll leave it to you.

131
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,320
Okay.

132
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,330
Then I'll do your makeup.

133
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,340
-Okay. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

134
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,360
Nice to meet you.

135
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,590
Okay.

136
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,990
I'll start now.

137
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,740
Okay, don't move.

138
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,270
Thank you for your cooperation.

139
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,000
Scene 1, cut 1. Ready, action.

140
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,790
Nice.

141
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,000
Taichi did a good job.

142
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:56,950
What about me?

143
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,420
I hope you can show your anger more

144
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,950
like Taichi did.

145
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,720
Anger?

146
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,550
I think that's what it feels like. I've done his makeup.

147
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,010
I'm going to put on his headwear.

148
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:25,840
Okay.

149
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,600
-No, no, no.
-What do you think?

150
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:28,630
Very nice.

151
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,490
It feels good.

152
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,640
Okay, let's go.

153
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,679
-Okay.
-Okay.

154
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,450
Let's go.

155
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,630
Good luck.

156
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,100
-(Screaming)
-Cut.

157
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,860
Okay.

158
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,640
Wow, it's time to

159
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,840
call it a wrap. Thank you, guys.

160
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,960
Thank you for your hard work.

161
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,780
You too.

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,700
Here you are.

163
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,230
The juice we agreed on.

164
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,080
Thank you.

165
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,270
Don't mention it.

166
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:19,170
I'm hungry.

167
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,030
I want to eat it again.

168
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,640
The hamburger patty from the Kouhei family!

169
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,070
What about your mother, Taichi?

170
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,850
Doesn't she know how to make hamburger patties?

171
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:30,330
My parents got divorced.

172
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,600
And then,

173
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,530
they both remarried others.

174
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,990
I live with my grandpa.

175
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,350
I see.

176
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,460
I'm sorry.

177
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,510
It's nothing.

178
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,880
I don't care at all.

179
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:50,000
By the way, isn't it nice to do this occasionally?

180
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,780
Like today.

181
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:51,980
What?

182
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,270
Having fun with friends.

183
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,510
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

184
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,180
-Thank you.
-Thank you, guys.

185
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,040
Thank you.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,800
You're quite popular, aren't you?

187
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,730
What did you say?

188
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,140
I asked, are you popular?

189
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:15,410
I'm not sure.

190
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,960
Being too modest is annoying.

191
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,540
I'm not.

192
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
No one has ever wanted to know me and like me.

193
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:27,730
Why?

194
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,930
There should be a lot of girls who do so.

195
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,650
It doesn't matter.

196
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,470
So long as someone whom I matter most understands me,

197
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,330
that's enough.

198
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,050
You're here.

199
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,220
We're going to celebrate later.

200
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,360
Okay, let's go, Kouhei.

201
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,770
No, I'm not going.

202
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,500
Join us.

203
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,720
No, I'm leaving.

204
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,390
Let's go, Taichi.

205
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,710
Okay...

206
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,550
You must be hungry.

207
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,140
Hey, stop rumbling.

208
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
Did your stomach just growl?

209
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,050
Yes, it did.

210
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,720
That was so loud. You scared me.

211
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,490
I was surprised too.

212
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,120
I'm so hungry.

213
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:24,990
Me too.

214
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,400
What?

215
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,650

And the zombie you played

220
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,910
was really amazing.

Can I tell her?

226
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,600
Miho?

227
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,430
Why is she looking for me?

228
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,360
How would I know?

229
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,280
Maybe she likes you.

230
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,070
What?

231
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,830

Yes?

Well...

247
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,220
It's about Sugihara.

Sugihara is so handsome.

250

But I haven't had a chance to exchange contact information with him.

251
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,120
I think you're quite close to him.

252
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:41,700
Could you please tell me something about him?

253
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,690

I'm sorry.

No, it's nothing.

259
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,900
What's his hobby? What does he like?

260
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,280
Well...

261
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,330
I'm not sure about that.

262
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,860
Aren't you two in the same department?

263
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,450
No.

264
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,260
Then where did you two meet?

265
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,560
We only meet occasionally.

266
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,400
Now I'm taking his notes.

267
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:16,930

00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:17,670
Yes.

269
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,770
His hearing isn't very good.

270
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,780
It's hard for him to follow what's being taught in class.

271
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,540
So,

272
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:26,260
I always jot down

273
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,000

00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,140
No, no.

277
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,560
It's not like he can't hear you at all.

278
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,570
I see.

279
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,190

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,990
Just like this novel,

00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,730
it tells the story of the female lead meeting a man who can't hear

283
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,160
and falling in love with him.

284
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,080
It is very similar to my current situation.

285
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:58,020
The female lead gave up everything for that poor boy. I'm tearing up.

286

I've been looking forward to communicating with sign language.

287
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,080
But I never met anyone like that before.

288
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,310
Now I feel like

289
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm a character in the story.

290
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,670
What are you talking about?

291
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,570
He doesn't even use sign language.

292
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,400
It's not like he can't hear you at all.

293
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,050
Don't pity him just because you want to.

294

I have a request.

305
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:09,920
Okay.

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,330
I'm home.

307
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,670
Grandpa, aren't you home?

308
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,640
Why didn't he tell me he was going out?

309
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,660
In ancient India, people believe in reincarnation.

310
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,960
They believe that humans will reincarnate into everything.

311
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,310
Buddhism teaches you to work hard after reincarnation.

312
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,810
The most important thing is to do good deeds.

313
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:09,700

00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,660

Why were you spacing out?

322
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,660
Ah.

323
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:44,900
I'm fine.

324
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,430
I'm just hungry.

325
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:48,950

00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,560
Ah.

331
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:19,530
Awesome.

332
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,950
You said you love it so much that you want to marry it.

333
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:24,580
Yes.

334
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,870
On the shooting day,

335
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,070
you asked me out, but I took my leave.

336
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,670
This is my apology.

337
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,400
Apology?

338
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,440
I'm not sure about how it tastes.

339
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:38,930
Well,

00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,000
Bon Appétit.

341
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,140
How is it?

342
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,610
Delicious.

343
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,980
Very delicious.

344
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,360
Kouhei's mom is really good at cooking.

345
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:04,990
Really?

346
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:06,730
Glad to hear that.

347
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,860
I think the patty is more delicious compared to yesterday.

348
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,210
Really?

349
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,360
Can I copy the notes first?

350
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,450
Sure.

351
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,220
Thank you.

352
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,650
I'm sorry.

353
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,130
Previously,

354
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,100
I told you that I didn't care about my parents.

355
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,010
That was a lie.

356
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,820
Actually, for a long time, I was very distressed

357
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:02,930
and frustrated,

358
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,570
always throwing tantrums at people around me.

359
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,070
But at that time,

360
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,290
on my birthday,

361
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,890
Grandpa didn't know how to cook at all,

362
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,770
but he made me a hamburger patty which is black like charcoal.

363
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,380
Dig in.

364
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,160
Hey.

365
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,020
Don't you want to eat?

366
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,260
Bon Appétit.

367
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,740
Okay, dig in.

368
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,090
What's wrong?

369
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,840
Is it good?

370
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,810
I think this hamburger patty

371
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:32,280
is as delicious as my grandpa made.

372
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,520
Thanks.

373
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,400
Hey, are you ignoring me again?

374
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,520
Eh, what did you say?

375
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,570
Nothing.

376
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,820
Sorry, I didn't hear anything.

377
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,130
I said it's okay.

378
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,620
It's nothing important. Don't take it to heart.

379
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,410
Come on.

380
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,750
Come and eat after you finish your notes.

381
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,360
Taichi, you said before...

382
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,920
What?

383
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,630
If I don't hear you, I can ask you to repeat as many times as I want.

384
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,690
Having a hearing loss is not my fault.

385
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,970
At that time,

386
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,410
I was really happy.

387
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:35,470
I know.

388
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,530
I'm talking about hamburger patties.

389
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,580
Hamburger patties?

390
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,100
Yes.

391
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,580
I started liking hamburger patties

392
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,200
when I was in middle school.

393
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,370
My parents just got divorced.

394
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,850
At that time,

395
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,430
I just started living with my grandpa.

396
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,820
Ah.

397
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,270
I'll get going then.

398
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,610
I'm heading to work.

399
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:09,940
Bye.

400
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,080
-See you tomorrow.
-Okay.

401
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:26,890
I have a request.

402
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,680
Okay.

403
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,570
Okay.

404
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,050
Next.

405
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,310
Come on, stir it.

406
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:38,960
Just stir it directly?

407
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,740
Yes.

408
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,900
-With my hands?
-Yes.

409
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,340
Okay.

410
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,880
Not yet. Stir it more.

411
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,760
-Does it need more?
-Yes.

412
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,480
A few more.

413
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,650
Yes, that's it.

414
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,160
Oh.

415
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,820
Well done.

416
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:01,890
Very good.

417
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:03,240
It feels good.

418
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:03,770
Okay.

419
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,360
I wish the glory days we bathed in sunshine

420
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,840
would last forever.

421
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,250
But...

422
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:55,130
[In the Next Episode]

423
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,930
You have an event, right?

424
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,400
Did you ask someone out?

425
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,460
She must want to eat too.

426
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:54,210
Your hearing loss is getting worse.

427
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,050
Kouhei.

428
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,090
Someday, that voice.

429
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,040
