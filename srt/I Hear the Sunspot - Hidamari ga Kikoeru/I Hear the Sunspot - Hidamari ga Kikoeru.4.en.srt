1
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,120
Oh, is that so?

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:12,380
Sorry, Kouhei. That meeting was cancelled.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,160
What?

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,830
Although I don't mind, why was it cancelled?

5
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,430
Well, the cooking classroom has already been reserved on that day.

6
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,170
Oh. What if the reservation is canceled?

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,210
Well...

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,110
Your dad seems busy too.

9
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:33,240
Did he say that?

10
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,490
Well...

11
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:47,030
The thing is

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:49,770
I won a ticket to a recommended trip.

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,660
Today,

14
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:57,640
I'll cook all your favorite food for you.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,550
Okay?

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,560
So carefree.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,290
Kouhei, your mom is really carefree.

18
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,060
Right.

19
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,600
Taichi, how are you going to spend your summer vacation?

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,370
Well.

21
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,330
I think I'm going to do some part-time job.

22
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:15,230
You mean as a courier?

23
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:15,820
Yes.

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,960
Also, I'll work somewhere new.

25
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,320
Really? Where is it?

26
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,210
It's...

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,470
Well.

28
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,850
It's a restaurant like this.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:27,980
Oh.

30
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,950
I happened to be having dinner at this restaurant, and they were recruiting.

31
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,670
So I went for an interview.

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,670
I thought I wouldn't stand a chance,

33
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,460
but I passed.

34
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,650
Oh.

35
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,570
You said you happened to be there. Who did you go there with?

36
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:39,170
What?

37
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,289
It's just I can't picture you going to a restaurant like this alone.

38
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,470
It doesn't matter who I went with.

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,270
Kouhei.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,180
Yes?

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,460
Nothing. It's nothing.

42
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:14,780
Oh.

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,020
What is this?

44
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,880
Did we learn this in class?

45
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,620
Oh, this is what I previewed.

46
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,740
Preview?

47
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,390
Yes.

48
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,270
I usually read the textbook and make a summary before class.

49
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,000
This way,

50
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,550
I can imagine what the professor will say in class more easily.

51
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,090
Impressive.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
It's no big deal.

53
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,200
Let's get started.

54
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,790
Next,

55
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,320
it's time for the exam.

56
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,600
You're so slow.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,170
The exam is finally over.

58
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,280
-You must be tired.
-Yes.

59
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,070
I'm going to be late for my job. I'll get going.

60
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,350
Kouhei.

61
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,570
Happy summer vacation!

62
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,090
You too, Taichi.

63
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,680
See you.

64
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,600
The time I spent taking notes with Taichi

65
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,520
is over.

66
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,610
[Theme Song]

67
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,520
The daily menu

68
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,730
changes from time to time.

69
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,220
Please check it every time you take an order.

70
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,670
Yes.

71
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,760
Besides,

72
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,220
today's special is Spaghetti alle vongole.

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:50,680
Von...?

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,550
Vongole.

75
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,090
Vongole?

76
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:52,630
Spaghetti alle vongole.

77
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,970
Spaghetti alle vongole!

78
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,150
One Spaghetti alle vongole!

79
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:55,930
Not bad.

80
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,409
Oh.

81
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,130
Welcome.

82
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:59,230
Hold on, Sakawa. Sakawa.

83
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,230
I've been feeling that you're a bit too energetic.

84
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,210
Oh, I see.

85
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,200
-All right?
-Okay.

86
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,030
Welcome.

87
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,960
Please have a seat.

88
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,580
Please have a seat.

89
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,210
Would you like to order?

90
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,330
What's today's pasta?

91
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,320
Pasta?

92
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,530
It's pe...

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,590
Pe...

94
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,890
Pe... Pe...

95
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,750
-Pe...
-It's pesto pasta.

96
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,440
Oh.

97
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,540
It's pesto pasta.

98
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,690
Excuse me. Can we order now?

99
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,700
No problem.

100
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,430
Welcome.

101
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,540
Ah.

102
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,680
Please forgive me.

103
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,620
I'm so sorry.

104
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,930
It's okay. Are you hurt?

105
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,080
-Yes, I'm okay.
-Leave it to me. It's okay.

106
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,930
Sorry.

107
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,520
It's okay.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,240
Welcome.

109
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:33,909
Welcome.

110
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,700
Manager.

111
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:37,250
What's today's pasta?

112
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,310
It's Spaghetti alla bolognese.

113
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,370
Spaghetti alla bolognese.

114
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:39,909
Got it.

115
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,780
Welcome.

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,970
One person?

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,390
Okay.

118
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,780
Please have a seat.

119
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,960
Table 3 ordered a pasta set.

120
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,140
You seem to be fitting in well.

121
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,990
Yeah.

122
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,870
By the way, I was taken by surprise.

123
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,159
I thought you were harassing a waitress.

124
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,470
I didn't expect you to say you wanted to work here.

125
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,470
Sorry about that.

126
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,360
Welcome.

127
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,130
You're so energetic.

128
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,290
-Of course I am.
-How many of you?
-Two.

129
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,100
I knew it.

130
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,670
You're finally up.

131
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,770
It's already noon.

132
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,810
Good morning.

133
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,120
Although it's summer vacation, you're a bit too lazy.

134
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,470
Mom, you're so energetic.

135
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:29,500
Stop staying at home all day.

136
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,620
You should go out and have some fun.

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,570
What?

138
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,720
What did you say?

139
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,390
I didn't hear anything.

140
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,510
There's a festival tomorrow, right?

141
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,540
What's that?

142
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,020
There's a festival tomorrow, right?

143
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,680
Why don't you ask someone to go with you?

144
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,750
Who?

145
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,450
For example,

146
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,100
the boy you talk about all the time.

147
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,580
What do you think?

148
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,260
He seems to be busy with his part-time job.

149
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,960
Just ask him.

150
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,730
It's a nice day today.

151
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,820
Yes, it is.

152
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:21,390
Yes.

153
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:44,690
Oh.

154
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:46,880
He said okay?

155
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:47,920
What?

156
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,180
You seem to be happy.

157
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,320
No.

158
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,810
Hey, come and help me.

159
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,870
I want Takoyaki,

160
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,610
fried noodles,

161
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,360
and roasted sweet corn.

162
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,040
Wait, Sakawa.

163
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,960
You added too much.

164
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,870
I thought this was employee benefit.

165
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,710
It is, but still, you should remove some of it.

166
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,990
I see.

167
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,490
Yes.

168
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,090
But you're getting more and more proficient at plating.

169
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,420
-Thank you.
-All right.

170
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,450
This is nice.

171
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,880
My ears are ringing.

172
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,500
It happens quite a lot lately.

173
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:09,420
Really? Are you okay?

174
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:13,190
You haven't been to the hospital lately, have you?

175
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,790
Go get it checked.

176
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,660
Okay, I got it.

177
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,170
Mr. Sugihara Kouhei.

178
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,040
Please come in.

179
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,830
Sorry to keep you waiting.

180
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,500
Thank you.

181
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:34,220
I need to confirm first.

182
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:34,990
Please tell me your name

183
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,360
and date of birth.

184
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,670
Sugihara Kouhei.

185
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,080
Born on October 17, 2005.

186
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,230
Okay. Thank you for your cooperation.

187
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,800
Please sit on the chair inside.

188
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:48,110
Next, you'll have a hearing test.

189
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,200
Please take this.

190
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:55,150
Put on the headphones.

191
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,460
Which ear do you usually feel that can't hear clearly?

192
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,000
Which ear do you usually feel

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,630
that can't hear clearly?

194
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,380
The left one.

195
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,130
Got it.

196
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,580
Now, please put on the headphones.

197
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,250
Oh, hearing aids, right?

198
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,510
I'll keep them for you.

199
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,240
All right, please put it on.

200
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,320
All set, right?

201
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,400
The test starts now.

202
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,280
This test needs to be done with the door closed.

203
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,420
If you need anything, please knock on the door and let me know.

204
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,030
I'll close the door now.

205
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Your hearing loss is getting worse.

206
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,400
What?

207
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,120
I'm afraid you didn't notice

208
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:27,430
because it's been getting worse little by little.

209
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,510
Your tinnitus

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,530
may also be related to this.

211
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,100
We need to do some more detailed tests later.

212
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,020
Go make an appointment.

213
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,840
Ms. Hasegawa.

214
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,520
Yes?

215
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,600
Check if we can arrange a CT scan for him next week.

216
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,150
Okay.

217
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,310
Excuse me.

218
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,240
Go ahead.

219
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:54,630
Will my hearing loss keep getting worse?

220
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,550
Someday,

221
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,760
I may become completely deaf, right?

222
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,320
There's a possibility.

223
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,760
But...

224
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,880
Don't always expect the worst.

225
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:16,870
Accumulating too much stress

226
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,800
is the last thing you want to do given your condition.

227
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,240
After all,

228
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,970
the society is more adaptable to those who can hear.

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,060
So it may be really hard for you to live in it.

230
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,420
Delicious.

231
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,360
Super delicious.

232
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,520
Awesome!

233
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:08,590
Delicious!

234
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,170
It's really good.

235
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,360
I'm so happy.

236
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,220
Someday...

237
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,070
That voice...

238
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:21,660
Hi.

239
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:22,710
Ah.

240
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,100
Sugihara, are you also here to visit a patient?

241
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,200
Well.

242
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,800
My uncle was hospitalized because his back hurts.

243
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,530
And I brought

244
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,850
some clothes for him to change.

245
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,440
Sorry, I didn't hear you clearly.

246
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,840
Oh, really?

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,730
Ah.

248
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,950
My uncle is in hospital.

249
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,780
I'm here to see him.

250
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,410
Your uncle is in hospital?

251
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:45,630
I see.

252
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,440
It must be tough.

253
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,390
Thank you for your concern.

254
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,880
Miho should be here soon.

255
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,020
Miho.

256
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:57,900
Miho?

257
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,670
We shot a film together. She's my cousin.

258
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,300
Why do you react like that?

259
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,450
How are things going with you two?

260
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,490
Huh?

261
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,050
Didn't Taichi tell you?

262
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,560
Miho seems to like you.

263
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,750
She said she wanted to be good friends with you,

264
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,680
so I told her to ask Taichi for help.

265
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,260
Ah. It's raining.

266
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,010

Ah.

270
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,460
It's raining so heavily.

[I'll get off work soon, but it's raining so heavily. What should we do?]

272
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,900
[I'll wait for you.]

273
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,310
Manager, can I borrow your umbrella?

274
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,110
No problem.

275
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,070
See you.

276
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,780

Why are you standing here in the rain?

What were you thinking?

285
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,310
You're all wet.

286
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,140
I'm okay.

How can you be okay, you idiot?

288
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,849
You'll catch a cold.

289
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,619
Alas.

290
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,569
Forget it.

291
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,750
I was thinking about getting some Takoyaki.

292
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,460
There's nothing we can do.

Since I last met you, Taichi.

296
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,150
Well.

297
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,420
Come to think of it, it's actually been a while.

[God of Ring Bell]

334
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,520
It tells a story about

335
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:06,200
how the heroine met a boy who can't hear and fell in love with him.

336
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,200
She did everything for her poor boyfriend. It's so touching.

I've always wanted to communicate with people with sign language,
