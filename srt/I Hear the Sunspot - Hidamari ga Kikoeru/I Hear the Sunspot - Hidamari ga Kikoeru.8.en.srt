1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,580
By the way, Taichi,

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,010
do you need to discuss it with Sugihara?

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,610
You're going to continue to do that job of taking notes, right?

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,830
My name is Okami Maya.

5
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,290
Just like me, one of her ears can't hear.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,510
Okami?

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,670
If he has the same experience as that girl,

8
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,700
I think they can understand each other's feelings better.

9
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,230
Anyway, isn't this good?

10
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,480
It's okay

11
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,480
for Sugihara to be without Taichi.

12
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,060
Right?

13
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:25,430
It's so messy.

14
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,250
What?

15
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,000
It's really unbelievable.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,960
How could you regard the job of taking notes as a game?

17
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,619
So,

18
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,800
I also don't think this is right. I'm going to do it carefully from now on.

19
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,210
What can you do for Senior?

20
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:03,270
[Teaching and Student Affairs Office]

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,420
Okay. Got it.

22
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,670
Take a look at the note-takers'  schedules.

23
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:15,610
Find someone who can help you with your class and pair yourself with him.

24
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,470
-Thank you, Ma'am.
-Okay.

25
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:19,930
Could you please tell me...

26
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,850
Sugihara.

27
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:26,900
You're going to find a note-taker through the Student Affairs Office this year, right?

28
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:30,570
There are more specialized courses in your sophomore year.

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,570
The courses are getting more and more difficult, too.

30
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,650
Please submit the application materials

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,780
as soon as possible.

32
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,900
Hey, Senior.

33
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,910
Previously,

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,720
I quit the chat group for my high school classmates.

35
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,300
What?

36
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:05,630
Although my relationship with everyone is normal,

37
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,770
in order to maintain this kind of normal relationship with my friends,

38
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,350
I've been making huge efforts.

39
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,150
Aren't you the same, Senior?

40
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:22,630
What?

41
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,200
In order to be with that person,

42
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,400
aren't you also forcing yourself?

43
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,190
No.

44
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,990
It's not like that.

45
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,520
-Well, I'm sure this is delicious.
-Doesn't this meat look delicious?

46
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,240
Amazing. Both its color and look are amazing.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,400
Just taste it.

48
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,880
-Wow.
-Haha.

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,460
I haven't eaten yet.

50
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,570
Ah.

51
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,080
I look so happy.

52
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,300
Oh, this expression is wonderful.

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,460
Are you praising yourself?

54
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,940
I really want to go back to that moment.

55
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,490
What are you talking about?

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,630
Well,

57
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,380
didn't we look so young back then?

58
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,500
After half a year, we look like middle-aged men now.

59
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,460
That's probably because we've been the same as we are now,

60
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,190
eating junk food all this time.

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,160
This is non-fried food.

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,060
I've always attached much importance to health and keeping fit.

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,190
You just want to be popular, don't you?

64
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,230
Kouhei. Kouhei.

65
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,070
It's done.

66
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,490
-Thank you.
-Then how about this?

67
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,780
You two can eat it together.

68
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,770
Oh, no problem.

69
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,030
Are you ready?

70
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,820
Ready.

71
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,970
It's delicious!

72
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,500
Right?

73
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,250
-It's super delicious.
-Is it delicious?

74
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,450
It's very delicious.

75
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,560
Right?

76
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,200
You just feel that youth has come back to you, right?

77
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,730
Do you want to play bowling?

78
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,329
Oh, okay.

79
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,910
-How about Saturday?
-Okay.

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,980
Oh? Why have I become so embarrassed?

81
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,040
Ah.

82
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,980
Hi, Kouhei.

83
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,980
It's because of this guy.

84
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:43,280
Huh? What did you say just now?

85
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,750
I didn't hear it at all.

86
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,270
What?

87
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,909
Please speak louder.

88
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,010
You can hear it, can't you?

89
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,050
With that expression, it's obvious that you heard it.

90
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,260
I couldn't hear it.

91
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,390
I'm talking about you.

92
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,780
I couldn't hear it.

93
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,880
Hey, Kouhei.

94
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:59,210
Senior, let's go to the library.

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,000
I want to find some books.

96
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:01,830
The library?

97
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,170
Yeah, let's go.

98
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,570
Taichi, I'm sorry.

99
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,870
[Opening Theme]

100
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,140
[Central Library]

101
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,430
What's going on between you and Taichi?

102
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,290
Hey, Kouhei!

103
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,120
Senior, let's go have some tea.

104
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,570
Hey.

105
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,570
Hey. Wait.

106
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,550
-Let's go.
-Hey!

107
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,500
Hey!

108
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,850
Let's go.

109
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,800
Hey! Ah!

110
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,180
Hey!

111
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,590
Alas.

112
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,070
That guy...

113
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,520
Gosh.

114
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,600
What was she doing?

115
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:56,130
She completely stopped me from talking to him.

116
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,140
How awesome.

117
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,110
But why did she stop you from talking to him?

118
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,040
How would I know?

119
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,760
I want to know the reason, too.

120
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,360
Wow.

121
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,090
They showed up.

122
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,370
Haha. Really?

123
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,020
Lend it to me.

124
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,380
Hey! Wait!

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,200
The brake of this bike is broken.

126
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,190
What?

127
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,210
-It'll be bad, won't it?
-Oh no!
-Let's chase him now!

128
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,410
Ah!

129
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,720
Go!

130
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,570
Yo!

131
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,720
Look! Look! Look!

132
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,860
What? What? What?

133
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,690
-What? Wait!
-Ah!

134
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,909
Oh!

135
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,390
Taichi!

136
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,530
It was so dangerous!

137
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,350
I almost knocked you two down.

138
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,300
What were you thinking?

139
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,300
Maya, are you okay?

140
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,409
What if you really knocked us down?

141
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,890
That was why I dodged.

142
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,490
That's enough. Both of you had better stop talking.

143
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,940
Can you think for others too?

144
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,470
Ah, I got it.

145
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm sorry. Okay?

146
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,750
Anyway, I have something to tell Kouhei.

147
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,560
Oh, Sugihara, are you free this Saturday?

148
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,140
What?

149
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,080
Oh, yes.

150
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,080
I'm free this Saturday.

151
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,020
Hey, Yoko!

152
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:12,700
Brat, why didn't you tell me that the brake was broken?

153
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,450
That was why I told you to wait.

154
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,570
Oh, you too, Taichi.

155
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,420
Make sure that you're free this Saturday.

156
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,990
This Saturday?

157
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,220
-Yes.
-I need to work.

158
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,020
We want to hold a bowling competition.

159
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:25,280
We'd like to invite the members of our Film Research Club and Maya to participate.

160
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,810
What? Are you going to invite her?

161
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,270
Yes.

162
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,780
-What?
-So cute.

163
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:29,620
Ah? What?

164
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,680
What? Do you like the Moses Party?

165
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,280
Yes.

166
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,350
I'm collecting its merchandise.

167
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,720
What? That's great! Me, too!

168
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,890
Recently, I've just bought the Moses Party's socks.

169
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,500
Oh, that's great!

170
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,970
Hey!

171
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,870
-Look.
-Yasu.

172
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:41,720
And this, too.

173
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:42,270
Good job.

174
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,690
-Oh, that's amazing! "Moses Party" is written on it.
-Hey, Kouhei.

175
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,690
Here's the thing.

176
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,180
This year...

177
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:51,720
This year?

178
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,780
Well, yes.

179
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,550
The task of notes taking this year...

180
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:56,970
Oh, Yoko.

181
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,630
Ah!

182
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,200
You should also participate in the club activities occasionally.

183
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,390
Oh, I can't.

184
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,600
Because I can't play tennis at all.

185
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,150
Huh?

186
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,220
Then why did you join us?

187
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,170
That was because

I once watched a TV drama when I was a kid.

189
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,040
The boys of the tennis club were very popular.

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,440
I can't believe that you joined us because of this reason.

191
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,260
That's right.

192
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,380
But you're not popular now.

Really?

194
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,030
-What you said is a bit mean, isn't it?
-Are you a fool?

195
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,920
-I've never seen anyone like you.
-I'm quite popular, right?

196
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,520
Ah-ha.

197
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,400
You're not popular at all.

198
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
-How could you be popular? I've told you that you've thought too much.
-Your expression looks so weird. You're lying to me, right?

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,030
-Hehehe.
-Why?

200
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,040
Can't you play tennis?

201
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,680
No, I can't.

202
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,700
What? You really can't play tennis?

203
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,430
No, I can't.

204
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,630
-Ah-hahaha.
-That's not true. I can play tennis.

-Ah, you can play tennis.
-You obviously can play tennis, right?

He noticed that in a TV drama, the boys who played tennis were very popular.

209
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,280
He thought he would also be popular if he joined the tennis club.

210
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,570
That guy is really hopeless.

211
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,000
No girls will like him even though he imitated them.

How can I play bowling when I'm injured like this after falling from the bike?

What's wrong with this bike?

221
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,810
It's all your fault.

Oh, he organized this activity, but he's so late.

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,900
if you are so good at cooking,

373
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,950
why don't you just train yourself to be a professional chef?

374
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,910
A professional chef?

375
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:10,540
Yes.

376
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,980
You can work in a big hotel

377
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,460
or be a professional cook.

378
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,830
Or

379
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:18,890
you can open a cooking classroom like your mother.

380
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:21,370
I can't.

381
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:22,790
What?

382
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,940
Why?

383
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,650
What a pity.

384
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:31,310
I don't think I have that much talent to do this job well.

385
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,430
Besides,

386
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,420
except for you, I also don't want anyone else to eat the food made by me.

387
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,190
Well, are you okay?

388
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
I'm sorry.

389
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:46,330
-Here you are.
-I'm choking.

390
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,330
-Hmm.
-Thank you.

391
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,370
I'm sorry.

392
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:52,990
What?

393
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,680
I said something so unpleasant again.

394
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:57,930
I'm really sorry.

395
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,680
Huh? Why are you apologizing?

396
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,110
Your words are not unpleasant at all.

397
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,350
What's more,

398
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,350
I'm really happy that you came to see me today.

399
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,440
So,

400
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,000
I forbid you from apologizing again.

401
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,010
Understand?

402
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,120
Yes.

403
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,180
Hey, Taichi.

404
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:31,720
Yes?

405
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:35,390
Can you continue to take notes for me this year?

406
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,590
There are more courses in the Law Department this year.

407
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:41,250
Maybe it'll be a burden to you.

408
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,040
But...

409
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,830
I'll do it.

410
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,910
If you think I can do it, I'll do it.

411
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,890
Of course I'm willing to do it.

412
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,420
That's great.

413
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,700
I thought you would reject me.

414
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,780
I wouldn't.

415
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:06,760
Because I...

416
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,040
want no one else but you to help me.

417
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,310
I see.

418
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,940
Now that I feel so relieved, I don't have any strength anymore.

419
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,330
You're just exaggerating it.

420
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,900
Taichi.

421
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,420
Thank you!

422
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,290
Taichi.

423
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,090
Hey!

424
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:14,650
Did you hear it?

425
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:17,290
Hey, what's wrong? Is there a guest here?

426
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,300
Kouhei.

427
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,270
Sorry to disturb you.

428
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,690
Oh, please make yourself at home.

429
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,180
What is that?

430
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:26,960
What?

431
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,020
I won't give it to you.

432
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,960
Well, wash your hands first and then come here.

433
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,110
Gosh.

434
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,810
How can you always eat something uneatable?

435
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,350
These are the leftovers from last year's celebration event.

436
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,370
Hey.

437
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:52,270
Alright. Then I'll eat it now.

438
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,120
Okay.

439
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,890
It's so delicious.

440
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,410
What?

441
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,590
It's so delicious.

442
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,230
That's great.

443
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,770
Gosh.

444
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,850
Grandpa, that's mine.

445
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,120
Hey! Did you hear it?

446
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:11,630
It's delicious.

447
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:12,710
It's not a big deal, Taichi.

448
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,870
That's not good!

449
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,820
I won't let you eat this.

450
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,690
You're such a glutton.

451
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,550
Grandpa, you're just the same, aren't you?

452
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:23,650
Young man.

453
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:25,740
When Taichi

454
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:27,280
was a kid,

455
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,260
he apologized to me for a prank

456
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,200
and gave me a peony cake.

457
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:33,300
A peony cake?

458
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,330
But

459
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,790
that was because his grandma criticized him.

460
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,690
Actually, he did it quite reluctantly.

461
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,000
Hey, Grandpa.

462
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:43,050
His eyes were full of tears.

463
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,390
He looked as if it had been the end of the world.

464
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:50,360
Just eat it.

465
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,570
Just eat it.

466
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,060
-Grandpa.
-Hahahaha.

467
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:59,620
Hey, Kouhei, why are you laughing?

468
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,150
I'm sorry. It feels as if I could see your look at that time.

469
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,650
Gosh! Stop talking about these meaningless things.

470
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,850
I really want to see

471
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,050
how Taichi looked at that time.

472
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,060
Really?

473
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,690
Here you are.

474
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,630
Thank you.

475
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,690
It's good, right?

476
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,480
What?

477
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,850
It's good to have a friend, right?

478
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,760
It's quite good.

479
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,240
The two of us

480
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,700
will be friends

481
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,310
like this forever.

482
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,430
In the future?

483
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:35,240
[In the Next Episode]

484
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,540
You didn't think about anything, did you?

485
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:28,910
What?

486
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,530
-Wow!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

487
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
I'm the president, Sai.

488
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,850
I can't believe that you're the president, old man.

489
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,110
What old man? You brat!

490
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,850
Our job is to worry about wrinkles.

491
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,280
The moment I find another goal,

492
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,240
I'll leave without looking back.

493
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,730
Senior, by that time,

494
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,260
what will you do?

495
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,980
I can hear you.

496
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:51,730
It doesn't matter whether yon can hear me or not.

497
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,400
That's what the two people should be like when they're together.

498
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,620
Well, Kouhei...

499
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,450
What?

500
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,980
What will happen if I don't go to college?
