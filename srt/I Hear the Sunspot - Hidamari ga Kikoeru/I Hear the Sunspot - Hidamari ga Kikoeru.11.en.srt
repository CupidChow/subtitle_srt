1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:06,370
You're going to drop out of college?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,650
Really?

3
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,060
Yes.

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,080
Why do you want to drop out of college?

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,340
Hey, Taichi! Have you committed a crime?

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,040
It's not like that.

7
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,220
I have a relative who is a lawyer.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,190
Contact him at once.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:22,810
I'll do it right now.

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,060
Hey, what are you guys doing?

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,010
I told you that I didn't do anything illegal.

12
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,120
-You're lying.
-It's true.

13
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,220
Ken.

14
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,240
-What are you doing?
-A friend of mine is in trouble.

15
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,810
Hey!

16
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,680
I think he's going to drop out of college.

17
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,920
I would like to ask for your help.

18
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,630
Well, I've told you that it's not like that. Hey, Yoko!

19
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:38,100
I roughly understand what you mean.

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,350
But you're being too subjectively assertive by doing this.

21
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,270
That's right.

22
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:43,680
As for that company,

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,420
if it goes bankrupt soon after you join it, what are you going to do?

24
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,280
Stop saying such ominous things.

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,470
After you drop out of college, it'll be too late for you to regret it.

26
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,720
All in all,

27
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,430
isn't it better to wait until you graduate?

28
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,400
I think so, too.

29
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,040
Actually, I'm not suitable for this place.

30
00:00:59,040 --> 00:00:59,970
What do you mean?

31
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:05,310
My purpose of studying in college was to find out what I wanted to do.

32
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:06,950
However,

33
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,150
now that I've found out what I want to do,

34
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,880
how can I still muddle along like this with debts?

35
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,640
Why do you have to do this?

36
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,720
-Don't say that again.
-Why do you have to do this?

37
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:18,010
I didn't expect that Taichi

38
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,060
would also be able to say something so serious.

39
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,060
What do you mean by "didn't expect"?

40
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,620
Ah.

41
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:25,830
That's so boring.

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,820
In the future, I can't be with Taichi anymore.

43
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,780
How tedious.

44
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:33,479
In that case,

45
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:37,039
you've made up your mind?

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:38,920
Yes.

47
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:41,110
Well,

48
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,880
I'll count on you for the social events with the young ladies

49
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,870
in your company.

50
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,550
Hey.

51
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,530
Are you kidding? Hey, Yoko!

52
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,789
Taichi.

53
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,560

I'm sorry for

58
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,820
having said those words to you previously.

I have something to tell you.

Okay.

-Thanks for your hard work.

what is

your hobby?

71
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
She's asking you.

72
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm sorry.

73

Why isn't Okami here today?

76
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,350
Ah.

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,310
I think she'll be here soon.

78
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,200

Maya!

85
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,410
It's really you. We haven't seen each other for a long time.

86
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,290
It's you, Ri.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,040
You're still the same. You're always in a trance.

88
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,020
How are you doing in college with your situation like this?

89
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm quite worried about you.

90
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,440
Yes.

91
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,700
Oh, by the way,

92
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,770
-let's get together and chat with each other.
-What?

93
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,600
Well, Yuuki, this is Maya.

94
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,060
She's my high school friend.

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,510
Really? Nice to meet you.

96
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,230
Well, this girl has a problem with her ears.

97
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,930
Oh, really? So you can't hear me?

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,040
That's right.

-My name is...
-I can hear you.

102
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,540
Oh, really?

103
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,900
My grandma's hearing is worse than yours.

104

Please don't mind it.

105
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:42,960
Why is it up to you

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:45,230
whether I should

107
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,290
mind it or not?

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,500
From tomorrow onwards, we will learn about relative pronouns.

Lunch...

118
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:18,860
Lunch?

119
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:21,660
Oh, it's lunch break.

120
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,990
I can't hear you.

121
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,370
I can't say this sentence no matter what happens.

122
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,790
I'm afraid others will know that I can't do it.

123
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,590
In order to catch up with the classmates around me,

124
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:41,850

There are many parts you don't understand, right? Are you having a hard time?

Everyone is just so amazing.

129
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:27,890
All the people here are deaf or mute.

130
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,660
Most of them regard sign language as their first language.

131
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,920
They've all studied very hard to master the sign language.

132

It's the same to you, Okami.

133
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,790
You have to study harder.

When I'm speaking so loudly like this, can you hear me?

Yes.

141
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,360
Well, I can understand.

142
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,700
People always say that this is not a big deal, right?

143
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,559
Though you've tried your best to read people's lips,

144
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,620
actually, you still can't hear them.

145
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,720
Compared with being unable to hear,

146
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,920

He's my friend.

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,640
However,

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,930
there are still some people who can understand.

00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,100

You'll see him when you come.

Huh?

169
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:44,760
Are you harassing her?

170
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,050
No, I'm not.

171
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,190
My girlfriend met her friend. We were just chatting.

172
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,370
Was it really like that?

173
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,790
Yes.

174
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,420
Then why did you look so reluctant?

175
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,590
What?

176
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,300
Your expression showed that you wanted to run away.

177
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,720
It must be your delusion.

178
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,020
What nonsense are you talking about?

179
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,100
Gosh.

180
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,280
Ah, I'm sorry.

181
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,890
I'm sorry.

00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,310
What?

185
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,140
Why did you do that?

186
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,280
You're still asking me why?

187
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,280
-That was because you...
-Did you try to show your sense of justice?

188
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,360
Or are you pitying me?

189
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,830
Huh?

190
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:32,380
Why do I have to pity you?

191
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,480
Speaking of you,

192
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,460
-previously, I just thought that...
-What?

193
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:46,270
Is your condition of being unable to hear more serious than what everyone knows?

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,060
You're pretending that you can hear,

195
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:53,490
and you're trying to fit in with the people around you, right?

196
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,510
Even if it's true, so what?

197
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,320
What?

198
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,580
If I tell everyone that I can't hear, can I feel more relaxed?

199
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,940
Or can I live an easier life?

200
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,110
No, I can't.

201
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,460
It's absolutely impossible.

202
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,890
So I asked you why you made a conclusion so subjectively.

203
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,460
I...

204
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,510
just need to work hard, and it'll be fine.

205
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,660
If I work harder,

206
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,550
then I don't have to pretend that I can hear anymore.

207
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,590
If I work harder and harder...

208
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,040
This idea of yours is so strange.

209
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,070
What?

210
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,000
Why do you have to work so hard?

211
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,640
You've worked hard enough, haven't you?

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,150
You know nothing.

213
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,290
I really don't know anything.

214
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,510
But...

215
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,430
Why did you say something like that?

216
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,490
Wait. I'll take you home.

217
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,090
No need. I can go back myself.

218
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:00,910
Kouhei.

219
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,570
I'm sorry that I'm late.

220
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,600
It's okay. I'm sorry for asking you to come somewhere so far away.

221
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,730
It's not so far away.

222
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:18,720
What's wrong?

223
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,420
Did something happen?

224
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,090
Well,

225
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,420
I just came across that girl just now.

226
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:27,540
What?

227
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,270
That girl, Maya.

228
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I was with her all this time just now.

229
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,370
And then...

230
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,700
I made her cry.

231
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,380
She cried?

232
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,420
Maya cried?

233
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,590
What did you tell her?

234
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,780
I'm doomed.

235
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,370
I might have

236
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,630
said something so officious.

237
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,850
Ah, I'm so bad.

238
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:02,470
She must think that I'm such an annoying guy.

239
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,760
It's very likely that

240
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,100
she doesn't think that way.

241
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,220
What?

242
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:17,010
She unleashed her own emotions in front of you.

243
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,380
Maybe it's just the opposite of what you thought.

244
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,980
Hmm?

245
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:23,870
What do you mean by "it's just the opposite"?

246
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,720
You're really slow-witted, Taichi.

247
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,930
What do you mean?

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,070
Why are you so slow-witted about your own things,

249
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
but so sensitive to other people's things?

250
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,990
What did you say?

251
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,630
Normally,

252
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,340
healthy people

253
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:48,100
can't understand how a patient feels, right?

254
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:49,390
Right.

255
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,640
Me, too.

256
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,000
If I hadn't become like this,

257
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,570
I wouldn't have understood Maya's feelings.

258
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,140
This is the normal situation.

259
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,330
But as for you,

260
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:08,410
you can meticulously notice some trivial matters

261
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,410
which others don't even care about.

262
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:16,500
Do you know how happy I am because of that?

263
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,550
Taichi, you're really so amazing.

264
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,050
I...

265
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,170
I always thought that I wanted someone to understand me.

266
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,260
But actually, it's not like that.

267
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,890
I just hope that there is someone who can make me believe that he can understand.

268
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,030
You're the one who made me understand these things.

269
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,640
Are you trying to flatter me on purpose?

270
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm not that great.

271
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,920
I just said what I thought.

272
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:15,020
What's more, I kept failing.

273
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,870
This time, I even want to drop out of school wilfully.

274
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,580
Well...

275
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,410
Are you sure that

276
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,190
you want to drop out of college?

277
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,420
Really?

278
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,310
Well...

279
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,460
So...

280
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,110
Taichi.

281
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,590
Thank you for having taken notes for me all this time.

282
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:00,220
I'll also do my best in college.

283
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,190
You too, Taichi.

284
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,569
Go on working hard in the new place.

285
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:11,900
Okay.

286
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,150
Ah, I'm so hungry.

287
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,930
It's almost time to go back.

288
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,280
Taichi.

289
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,110
Your heart is beating too fast.

290
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:53,920
Huh?

291
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,180
It was just a hug.

292
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,600
Don't be so scared.

293
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,650
I'm not scared.

294
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:02,310
Taichi, it's so easy to understand you.

295
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,250
Don't always tease me.

296
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,550
I'm sorry. Okay?

297
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,700
Hey.

298
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,590
You don't feel sorry at all, do you?

299
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,670
I feel sorry.

300
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,910
You don't feel sorry.

301
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,280
Right. I don't feel sorry.

302
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:16,840
Hey!

303
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,200
There's a trick for cutting onions.

304
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:29,150
A trick?

305
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
Give me the knife.

306
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,120
Before your tears drop,

307
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,880
chop, chop, chop! Finish cutting it as soon as possible.

308
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,550
Hey-hey.

309
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,110
-What kind of trick is that?
-Haha.

310
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,620
I've finished cutting it.

311
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,090
You have to make it delicious.

312
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,760
Okay.

313
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:41,840
Speaking of which,

314
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,430
when I was a student, I often used the word "emergency refuge" quite casually, too.

315
00:19:46,430 --> 00:19:49,920
For emergency refuge before the exam, I borrowed notes from my classmates.

316
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,180
For emergency refuge,

317
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,840
I borrowed money from others.

318
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,690
I could say these words without too much hesitation.

319
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,340
Everyone, please remember the word "emergency refuge" firmly.

320
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,140
Well, how about letting me do this?

321
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,320
Your name is Sugihara Kouhei, right?

322
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,540
Then I'll call you Kouhei.

323
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,880
Can you let me do the job of taking notes?

324
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,390
Great!

325
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,140
I'm writing so slowly that I'm almost unable to keep up with it.

326
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,080
This is really hard.

327
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:08,070
Alright. I'll also do my best to take notes today.

328
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,200
Sir!

329
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:14,680
Please talk slowly.

330
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,650
Please talk more slowly.

331
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,050
I'm sorry that I fell asleep.

332
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,560
Oh! My drawing is nice, isn't it?

333
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,410
I portrayed all their characteristics so well.

334
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,840
I'm willing to do it.

335
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,630
As long as you think that I can do it, I'll do it.

336
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,290
Of course I'm willing to do it.

337
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:39,690
Kouhei.

338
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,170
Can you hear me?

339
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,200
What's written here?

340
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,080
I wrote "normally". It's "normally".

341
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,090
Normally? Oh, you wrote the katakana.

342
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,210
Got it. I'm sorry.

343
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:21,910
It can be understood with just a glance, right?

344
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,830
Great!

345
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,890
I can see this lunch box again.

346
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm so happy.

347
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,950
You're just exaggerating it.

348
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,750
What?

349
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,000
You should be happy, too.

350
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,410
Otherwise, you'll be too disrespectful to the hamburg steak.

351
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,380
Being disrespectful

352
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,230
to the hamburg steak?

353
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:40,980
Yeah.

354
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm going to eat now.

355
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,530
It's so delicious!

356
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,410
Yummy!

357
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,880
That's right. I just want an expression like that.

358
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,470
What?

359
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,530
What's the expression?

360
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,690
That's great.

361
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,350
Well...

362
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,180
Take care.

363
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,780
Okay. You, too.

364
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,120
Ta-i-chi?

365
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,680
How I wish I could

366
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,640
figure out that meaning back then.

367
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,160
[Preview of the Final Episode]

368
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,630
Since then, Kouhei and I

369
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,220
have never seen each other again.

370
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,020
Sugihara is also getting along well with the note-taker this time.

371
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,690
Can you figure out what your innermost thoughts are?

372
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,290
