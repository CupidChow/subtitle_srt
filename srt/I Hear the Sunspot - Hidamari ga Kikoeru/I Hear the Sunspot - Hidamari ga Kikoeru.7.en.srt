192
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,930
About what?

193
00:10:58,950 --> 00:10:59,550
Well...

194
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,760
Oh, that.

195
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,390
Didn't you go to the lecture?

196
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:06,160
You're still going to be his note-taker this year, right?

197
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,860
He hasn't said anything to me yet.

198
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,620
Oh, I see.

199
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,480
Why hasn't he made it clear to me?

200
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,650
That guy...

201
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,050
He never tells me anything important.

202
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:20,530
Hey.

203
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,270
Did you two

204
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,550
have a fight?

205
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,070
No.

206
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,210
But the relationship between you two

207
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,840
is facing a great crisis.

208
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,840
Yeah.

209
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,860
You guys have encountered the same problem before, right?

210
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,840
-Yes.
-I don't know when, but you made up.

211
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,370
Right.

212
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,770
What was the situation at that time again?

213
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,850
What do you want to ask?

214
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:38,450
How did you make up back then?

215
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,160
At that time...

216
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,580
You really don't know anything.

217
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,860
You're so numb.

218
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,460
Seriously.

219
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,760
But

220
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,780
I like you the way you are, Taichi.

221
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,690
What's wrong?

222
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:27,690
Your ears are red.

223
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,110
You're right.

224
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,510
Nothing. It's nothing.

225
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,230
What's wrong with you?

226
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,340
Taichi?

227
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:34,110
What's wrong? Why are you hiding your face?

228
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,760
-Don't look at me.
-You're blushing.

229
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,460
All right.

230
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,760
-Oh.
-What? What?

231
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,210
I said nothing.

232
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,450
What do you mean nothing?

233
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:44,050
-Nothing means nothing.
-Then why is your face like this?

234
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,870
Oh.

235
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:57,980
What do you want to eat, Yoko?

236
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,780
Well, nutritious diet with tomato juice, I think.

237
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,400
Hey, Taichi.

238
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:03,090
Yeah?

239
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,730
Go talk to him.

240
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:06,870
Oh.

241
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,560
One, two.

242
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,850
Ah, idiots! Hey!

243
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,370
Oh, my!

244
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,540
Taichi?

245
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:26,880
Huh?

246
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,180
Well,

247
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,560
this year...

248
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,620
-Well...
-Senior.

249
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,640
Oh?

250
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,060
Are you Sugihara's friend?

251
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,370
Yeah.

252
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,270
What?

253
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,020
What's your name?

254
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,470
Which major are you from?

255
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,220
What about the club?

256
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,060
-Have you decided which club you'll join?
-Hey, Yoko.

257
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,700
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,000
She has a hearing problem just like me.

259
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,160
I see.

260
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,850
I'm okay, Senior.

261
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,870
I'm Okami Maya.

262
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,080
I'm a freshman in the Science Department.

263
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,500
I haven't decided which club I want to join yet.

264
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,950
Oh, you're a science major.

265
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,940
So cool.

266
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,110
We're all going out for dinner tonight.

267
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,640
Look.

268
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,910
The Film Research Club is going too.

269
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:17,790
Why are you making decisions for us?

270
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,820
There are freshmen in Film Research Club too.

271
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,880
Let's do that.

272
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:21,950
Okay?

273
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,460
Sugihara, do you want to come?

274
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,170
Ah.

275
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,390
Okay.

276
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,900
We have classes next.

277
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,780
I'll contact you later.

278
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,210
Let's go.

279
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,670
-Let's go.
-See you later, Okami.

280
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,500
See you later.

281
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,490
Did they ask us out for dinner?

282
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,590
Are you going too, Senior?

283
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,060
Yes.

284
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,560
Next, let's welcome our new member,

285
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,680
Matsuda.

286
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,550
Please show us your ability as a lead actor.

287
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,950
-Okay.
-Great.
-Come on.

288
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,990
-I'll give it a shot.
-Show us.

289
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,820
Let's do this.

290
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,890
Ready?

291
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:07,980
Start.

292
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,250
Ugh!

293
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,230
Sugihara also acted really well in Zombie.

294
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,930
Oh, that's right. He was great.

295
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:27,270
It was amazing. I was shocked.

296
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,120
Zombie, you know?

297
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,640
Sugihara was in that film.

298
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,350
Zombie?

299
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,390
Okami, do you need a refill?

300
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,530
Do you need a refill?

301
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,260
No, I'm good.

302
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,130
I want a refill of the same drink, please.

303
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,260
Oh!

304
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:44,270
The squid tentacles are so good!

305
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:48,220
You make the food look so delicious, Senior.

306
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,290
Really?

307
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,660
Many people say that.

308
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,160
Do I really make the food look delicious?

309
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes, you do.

310
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,210
Seeing you enjoy your food so much, others will feel happy too.

311
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,290
Are you making a monkey out of me?

312
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,350
Of course not.

313
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:58,950
That's what you meant!

314
00:15:58,950 --> 00:15:59,880
It's really not!

315
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,120
-Hahaha.
-Matsuda.

316
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,900
What drink would you like?

317
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,720
Ah, a glass of ginger ale then.

318
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,270
I'm sorry. Can you say it again?

319
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,250
Ginger ale.

320
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,360
Ginger ale, right?

321
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,780
Excuse me, a glass of ginger ale, please.

322
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,610
Thank you.

323
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,390
I can't hear very clearly,

324
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,010
so I often hear things wrong.

325
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,080
Sometimes I have to hear it several times. Sorry for all the trouble.

326
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,310
No, not at all.

327
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,300
What movie do you like, Matsuda?

328
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,370
Well, Director Nishiumi's works.

329
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,360
Oh, I know him.

330
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,060
His Sun & Moon is awesome.

331
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,510
I know, right?

332
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,780
That's my favorite.

333
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,620
The callback in that film is the best.

334
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,740
-That's also my favorite. It's so good.
-I understand. Exactly.

335
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,270
The plot took a sharp turn for the worse at the end.

336
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,070
-I know!
-You know, right? Haha.

337
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,300
Well...

338
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,540
Are you okay?

339
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,500
You must be exhausted.

340
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,260
Oh.

341
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,410
I'm sorry.

342
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,590
Can I take a break?

343
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,130
Okay.

344
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,880
It's really tiring when there are many people around.

345
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,640
I couldn't hear what everyone was talking about, so I've just been spacing out.

346
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,150
You really tried hard, Senior.

347
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,670
It seems I tried a bit too hard.

348
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,130
Do you

349
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,910
like that kind of girl, Senior?

350
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,120
Didn't you talk this much to that girl

351
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,710
because you like her?

352
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:46,920
Oh, that.

353
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,460
I'm

354
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,020
really a twisted person.

355
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,440
Yes?

356
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:00,760
Oh!

357
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,850
The squid tentacles are so good!

358
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,680
You make the food look so delicious, Senior.

359
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,220
-Really?
-Yes.

360
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,760
Many people say that.

361
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,370
Do I really make the food look delicious?

362
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,270
Yes, you do.

363
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:14,480
Seeing you enjoy your food so much, others will feel happy too.

364
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,370
Hey.

365
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,980
-Are you making a monkey out of me?
-No.

366
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,040
I'm not.

367
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,490
-Really?
-Of course.

368
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:24,110
I don't want others to find out how great Taichi is.

369
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,660
When I think about someone will find out how great he is one day,

370
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,430
I get anxious and uneasy.

371
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:32,890
Really uneasy.

372
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,820
Senior.

373
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,860
What's that supposed to mean?

374
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,070
Nothing.

375
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,460
It's nothing.

376
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,470
Taichi.

377
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,650
Did you have too many squid tentacles?

378
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,040
I did.

379
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,310
I didn't get to eat any.

380
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,010
You didn't order our share in the first place, right?

381
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,430
I'm so full that

382
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,280
I feel my stomach is sagging.

383
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,610
Are you all right?

384
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,610
By the way, has Sugihara always been that talkative?

385
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,560
-No.
-Right.

386
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,050
Hey, Taichi.

387
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:26,770
Yeah?

388
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,230
Do you think maybe he'll just leave you aside and neglect you next time?

389
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,960
Huh?

390
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,120
What do you mean by that?

391
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:36,570
Didn't you say that

392
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,070
Sugihara is easy to be misunderstood?

393
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,150
That's why he's always left aside by people around him.

394
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,270
Well.

395
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:44,800
Yes.

396
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,560
But that's true.

397
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,360
That's the vibe he used to give off.

398
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,070
But that guy...

399
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,840
He has really changed a lot.

400
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,910
Indeed.

401
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,940
He seems to have become more cheerful.

402
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,640
And look.

403
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,260
There's Okami.

404
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,180
If that girl's in the same situation as him,

405
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,180
they can surely understand each other better, right?

406
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,690
Anyway, it's a good thing.

407
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,970
Sugihara

408
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,050
will do okay even without Taichi by his side,

409
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:10,620
right?

410
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,090
Hey.

411
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,320
Thank you for yesterday.

412
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,840
I'm sorry

413
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,420
it was such short notice.

414
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,640
Here.

415
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,110
These are the notes you took before, right?

416
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,810
Oh.

417
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,740
Yes.

418
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,500
I selected the same course this year.

419
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,150
I borrowed this from Senior.

420
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,880
The good old days.

421
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,050
[Socrates Plato Aristotle]

422
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,180
So messy.

423
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,010
What?

424
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,280
The handwriting and drawing are both so messy

425
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,810
that I can't even read them.

426
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,560
You didn't even finish the training before you became a note-taker.

427
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,130
Do you look down on this job?

428
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:41,180
Huh?

429
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,550
Hi, Taichi.

430
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,830
Maya.

431
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,220
Oh.

432
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,140
It was so much fun yesterday.

433
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,940
We're going out again some time soon.

434
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,450
Let's have fun together then.

435
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:52,910
See you.

436
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:55,560
Seriously.

437
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,010
That guy, Yoko.

438
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:01,030
Did he ask me out for dinner again?

439
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,560
Huh?

440
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,950
Didn't you hear that?

441
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,780
That guy's voice is hard to distinguish.

442
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,250
But

443
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,400
you chatted with him before,

444
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
didn't you?

445
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:10,960
That's because

446
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,310
I can guess

447
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,070
what people meeting for the first time would say.

448
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,830
-Something seems to be wrong with the brake.
-What?

449
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,970
-Is it okay?
-It seems

450
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,460
that guy doesn't have anything to worry about.

451
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,260
It must be nice to be so carefree.

452
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,270
I can imagine how he lives.

453
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,680
Anyway,

454
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,560
I'm sure he has never suffered any hardship growing up.

455
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,020
Hold on.

456
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,160
What?

457
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,160
Don't make the judgment that he has never suffered based on nothing.

458
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,080
You don't even know them.

459
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:02,790
Don't measure others' lives according to your standards.

460
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,890
Why are you defending him?

461
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,790
What?

462
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,930
So annoying.

463
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,780
You're the most annoying kind, so full of yourself.

464
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,290
Senior

465
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:37,950
talks about you a lot, and I thought you must be a great person.

466
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,660
I didn't expect you to be this kind of person.

467
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,710
You take note-taking as a game.

468
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:43,900
That's why

469
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,370
I also felt this isn't right. I want to work hard and do it well.

470
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,370
You just want him to bring you lunch.

471
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,780
-You're just taking advantage of Senior's kindness to blackmail him.
-Blackmail?

472
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,640
I never did anything like that.

473
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,770
-That's exactly how you are.
-I didn't!
-You did!
-Maya.

474
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,280
Taichi.

475
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,510
What's wrong?

476
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,700
What happened?

477
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,310
It's nothing.

478
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,690
What brings you here, Senior?

479
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,130
You said you wanted to go to the Student Affairs Office, right?

480
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,150
The teacher also wants to see me.

481
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,120
Oh, let's go now.

482
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,050
Let's go.

483
00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:18,170
What can you do for Senior?

484
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:22,300
Let's go.

485
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:37,070
Is it okay for you if I'm not by your side?

486
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,220
You've been forcing yourself to be with that person, haven't you?

Is it Isabel again?
