1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,280
We'll start with the next lecture, right?

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,230
Yes.

3
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,910
This job is really hard for an inexperienced person.

4
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:14,970
If you have any problems, just say it.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,050
Ask the experienced note-takers to give you more guidance.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:22,440
Okay.

7
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:24,720
Okay.

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,940
Done.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,500
Okay.

10
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:27,980
Here.

11
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,260
I'm here to submit my scholarship application.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,070
Did you bring your student ID?

13
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,700
Yes.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:42,680
Did you get this?

15
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,210
I've seen this before.

16
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:47,660
Then...

17
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,700
No, this is really hard.

18
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,200
I lost my share.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,850
Let me learn it again.

20
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,960
I'm going to the training.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,080
You must go.

22
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,190
Thank you.

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,210
I see.

24
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,060
Taichi, are you applying for a scholarship?

25
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,010
I wanted to work after graduating from high school.

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,180
But my head teacher told me if I had no ideal job,

27
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,690
I should go to college first.

28
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,610
The head teacher

29
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,170
seems to know you well.

30
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,280
What?

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,370
What do you mean?

32
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,440
Even if you go to work,

33
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,660
you'll get fired sooner or later.

34
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,830
Hey, you!

35
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,640
Yoko.

36
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,039
Look.

37
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,720
I won. Here.

38
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,100
Really?

39
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:26,700
That's great.

40
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,060
Remember to return it to me when you work.

41
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,740
I hate the future.

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,750
Hey, you two.

43
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,930
Forget about the future.

44
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,030
Let's enjoy the moment.

45
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,039
Oh.

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,590
Camping?

47
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,920
Wow, this is nice.

48
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,950
What are you doing?

49
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,170
It's dangerous.

50
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:59,289
Stop looking at your phone

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:01,670
while cooking.

52
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,760
Hey, do you hear me?

53
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,610
[We decided to go camping together.]

54
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,610
[What are you going to do next Saturday? Do you want to join us?]

55
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,500
What's going on?

56
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,840
What?

57
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,770
What?

58
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,210
It's dangerous.

59
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,540
What did you say?

60
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,150
It fell.

61
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:19,850
What?

62
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,910
Eh.

63
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,180
Kouhei said he was going too.

64
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:30,610
Oh, really?

65
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,000
You seem excited, Taichi.

66
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,710
No, nothing special.

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,170
I'm glad you and Sugihara made up.

68
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,860
Are you snickering?

69
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:42,760
Cut the crap.

70
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,710
[Theme Song]

71
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,970
Gosh.

72
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,870
What takes him so long?

73
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,840
Ah, it's still ten minutes.

74
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,080
Oh, Taichi!

75
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,310
So early?

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,370
Hey, Yoko.

77
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,510
Eh?

78
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,560
Miho said she wanted to go camping too.

79
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,630
Long time no see, Taichi.

80
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,910
I'm going to the convenience store.

81
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,720
Well...

82
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,000
Well...

83
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:32,760
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,650
What?

85
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,090
Well,

86
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,360
I suddenly got mad at you.

87
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,010
No, no.

88
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,990
That's because I was thoughtless.

89
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,250
No, it's because of me.

90
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,780
-No, I'm really sorry. It's really my fault.
-No, it's my fault.

91
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:49,940
Eh?

92
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,110
Sugihara.

93
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,180
Good morning.

94
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,050
Good morning.

95
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,740
Miho

96
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,480
changed her mind so quickly.

97
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:01,780
What?

98
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,070
Look.

99
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,100
She said you were handsome,

100
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:08,730
but she seems to have a boyfriend at her part-time workplace.

101
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,720
Really?

102
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,000
I see.

103
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,190
Oh, Kouhei.

104
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,760
Oh...

105
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,440
Are you a dog, Taichi?

106
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,330
Huh?

107
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,510
-Who are you calling a dog?
-It's you.

108
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,520
How are you?

109
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,800
Wow, that's great.

110
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,630
Let's go on an adventure.

111
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,850
An adventure? Are you still in primary school?

112
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,080
Shut up!

113
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,940
Oh, the house.

114
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,270
He's so excited.

115
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,450
Awesome.

116
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,620
- Is it here?
- Yes.

117
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,590
Chiji.

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,580
Nice to meet you.

119
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,909
Okay, let's go in.

120
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,800
Let's put our luggage in the room.

121
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,620
Let's go inside.

122
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,130
Wow, this is great!

123
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,800
Wow, it's nice.

124
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,430
I'll choose this place.

125
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,740
There's a second floor!

126
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,950
What are you doing, Taichi?

127
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,250
Come on in!

128
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,300
The boys are on the first floor, right? Come on in.

129
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,520
Come on in.

130
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,070
-We'll prepare the barbecue after you put your luggage in place.
-Gather around.

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,570
We have to play a life simulation game during camping.

132
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:17,590
Really?

133
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,140
We just arrived, yet you're playing already?

134
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's finish the preparations first.

135
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,760
Okay.

136
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,690
The loser

137
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,840
will start the fire.

138
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,110
-Hey.
-No way.

139
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,060
Hey, Kouhei.

140
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,030
Isn't this place nice?

141
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,900
Let's do it.

142
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,500
Here.

143
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,030
Okay.

144
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,110
Okay.

145
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,990
-Hold the fishing rod.
-Hold the rod.

146
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,010
Hold the rod well.

147
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:42,510
Throw it

148
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,930
-far away.
-Throw it out?

149
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,580
Yes.

150
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,400
Exactly.

151
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,159
Ha ha, hold on.

152
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,460
That's it.

153
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,670
It's so hard.

154
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,600
It's hard, isn't it?

155
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,580
The river is so clear.

156
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,480
I think this is my first time fishing.

157
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,490
Really?

158
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,350
I sometimes go fishing with my grandpa at the pond.

159
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,310
Ah.

160
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,320
When I was in primary school,

161
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,570
my dad took me fishing at the sea.

162
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,570
I see.

163
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,350
Yes.

164
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,890
Okay.

165
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,990
By the way,

166
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,430
when I was fishing with my dad,

167
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,220
we didn't catch anything.

168
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,230
So,

169
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,230
we went to the market to buy fish on our way back.

170
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,110
My mom got mad because my dad didn't clean the fish thoroughly.

171
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,640
They had a fight.

172
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:49,770
Is it boring?

173
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,080
What?

174
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,010
Well...

175
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,730
I wonder if you're bored.

176
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,520
Why do you say that?

177
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,590
Because

178
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,810
you've had that look on your face all day.

179
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,420
I thought you'd be very happy when we came here.

180
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,330
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:13,140
I've been talking on my own.

182
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:13,910
No.

183
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,570
It's the exact opposite.

184
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,640
Opposite?

185
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,420
Yes.

186
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,060
Everyone's nice and friendly.

187
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,490
I'm glad you invited me.

188
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:26,900
Really?

189
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,550
Yes.

190
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,110
I always talk nonsense when I'm relaxed.

191
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,370
I don't want that to happen. So I pull a long face on purpose.

192
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,500
Huh?

193
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,630
You should talk more.

194
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,280
Don't restrict yourself.

195
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,750
Everyone must be delighted to see you having fun.

196
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:51,640
Get it?

197
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,010
Yes.

198
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,820
I get it.

199
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,770
What's wrong?

200
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:13,700
Nothing.

201
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,250
Nothing at all.

202
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,800
Oh, Kouhei.

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,360
There's a fish!

204
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:31,450
-We caught it.
-Did we catch it?
-Hurry up.

205
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,170
Hey.

206
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,530
It's coming.

207
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,570
-Hurry.
-What should we do?

208
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,930
Reel in the line!

209
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,670
We're almost there.

210
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,490
Wow.

211
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,920
Oh, it's a rainbow trout.

212
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,450
Wow, it's a rainbow trout.

213
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:45,950
-Wow
-Awesome.

214
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,430
Everyone will be happy.

215
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,430
Oh, okay.

216
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,400
Hey.

217
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,650
We got it!

218
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:53,520
Oh, you caught a few fish.

219
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Yes.

220
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,250
Wow, what kind of fish is that?

221
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,110
Rainbow trout.

222
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,670
Wow!

223
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,730
Wait, wait, wait. Take it away.

224
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,820
Have you never touched a living fish before?

225
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,470
No, no, no. Take it away.

226
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,550
Let me borrow this.

227
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,780
Okay. Wow. So disgusting.

228
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,950
Very slippery.

229
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,010
It's slippery, right?

230
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:13,600
Why?

231
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know.

232
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,770
My grandpa always asked me to take the fish off the hook.

233
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,040
Thank you.

234
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,890
What is it?

235
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:26,880
What?

236
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,210
Weren't you looking at me just now?

237
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,410
You're so annoying for being obtuse.

238
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,640
What do you mean?

239
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,510
Cool.

240
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,930
The fried noodles will be ready soon.

241
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,580
Tell me who wants to eat it.

242
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,990
I want...

243
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:47,290
-I want it.
-Have some too, Sugihara.

244
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,110
-Okay.
-Okay.

245
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,940
Let's share it, okay?

246
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,140
Taichi, can we eat these rainbow trout now?

247
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,800
Huh?

248
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,560
It should be cooked already.

249
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,030
I think it's okay.

250
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,420
-Good.
-How many?

251
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,030
Three.

252
00:10:59,240 --> 00:10:59,940
What?

253
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,150
This is going to be a battle.

254
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:01,900
Exactly.

255
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,080
Want a rock-paper-scissors?

256
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,700
Sure.

257
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,300
There's one fish

258
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,280
caught by Kouhei.

259
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,090
He was so scared.

260
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,930
Were you scared?

261
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:13,730
No, I wasn't.

262
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,300
He couldn't catch it without me.

263
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,770
Sugihara, did you catch them?

264
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,500
I caught two.

265
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,780
You did? Taichi only got one, huh?

266
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,130
I caught two, right?

267
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,910
What's going on?

268
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,110
-Who's lying?
-No.

269
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,170
Kouhei, don't lie!

270
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,570
Taichi! It's Taichi!

271
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:29,530
Hey!

272
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,600
Bon Appétit.

273
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,430
-Bon Appétit.
-Bon Appétit.

274
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,110
Kouhei.

275
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:29,930
Taichi.

276
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,790
Wait for me.

277
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,340
Okay.

278
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,420
Oh.

279
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,640
What's wrong?

280
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,480
You can't sleep?

281
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,800
Yes.

282
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,460
Yoko is so noisy when he snores.

283
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:55,730
No.

284
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,650
It's not because of that.

285
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,580
Eh?

286
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,230
I had so much fun.

287
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,040
I don't want to go back.

288
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,380
So I can't sleep.

289
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,210
You can come again.

290
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,190
You're right.

291
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,070
Wow!

292
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,830
Amazing!

293
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,470
The stars are beautiful.

294
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,090
By the way,

295
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,980
what's the sign language of a star?

296
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,010
Ah.

297
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,260
Well...

298
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,780
This is the star.

299
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,540
The star?

300
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:45,380
The star.

301
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:48,940
And...

302
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:51,400
Taichi's favorite hamburger meat cake

303
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,130
is like this.

304
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,630
Hamburger meat cake?

305
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:56,880
Yes.

306
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,670
Delicious.

307
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,640
Delicious.

308
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,620
I'm full.

309
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:04,910
I'm full.

310
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,330
Awesome.

311
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,830
Your sign language is quite fluent.

312
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,450
No.

313
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,390
Vocabulary is fine for me,

314
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,720
but I can't keep up with the conversation.

315
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,520
-Ah.
-When that happens,

316
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,450
I'll use finger language instead.

317
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,580
Finger language?

318
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,080
It is to express the gojūon

319
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,410
by means of the fingers.

320
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,810
Ta-i-chi.

321
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,720
Ta-i-chi.

322
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,340
You've turned it into "kitsune (a fox)."

323
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,550
That's how you express "ki."

324
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,350
-Like this.
-This is "chi."

325
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,480
Ta-i-chi.

326
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,160
Am I doing the right one?

327
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,710
If you keep being so careless,

328
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,790
I'll kiss you again.

329
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,240
Just kidding.

330
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,680
I...

331
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,260
won't do that again.

332
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:13,710
Huh?

333
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,450
I won't do anything that Taichi doesn't like.

334
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:31,100
What will you do if I say I'm not unwilling?

335
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,230
What?

336
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,440
What did you say?

337
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:39,780
Nothing.

338
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,630
Good morning.

339
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:11,950
Good morning.

340
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:12,990
Good morning.

341
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,339
Hey, Taichi!

342
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,670
You didn't sleep last night?

343
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,790
No.

344
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,680
What?

345
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,270
I didn't expect you to be so sensitive that you couldn't sleep in the camp.

346
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,680
Good morning.

347
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,020
Good morning.

348
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,410
-Good morning.
-Did you sleep well, Sugihara?

349
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,540
Did you fall asleep?

350
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,030
Yes.

351
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:45,970
I slept well.

352
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,190
That's good.

353
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,800
[Once you master the above principles, you'll be a fantastic note-taker!]

354
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,800
[Easy to understand, quick, faithful] [ Generalize and summarize all the text!]

355
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,800
[Follow the three principles to transform the speech into the written text idiomatically]

356
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,800
[Three Principles of Summarizing and Note-taking]

357
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,580
Note-takers need to tidy up the articles

358
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:17,860
and make some deletions consciously.

359
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,860
The key is to convert the content

360
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,850
into written text using simple wording.

361
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Instead of summarizing the content,

362
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,520
it's more like compression

363
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,540
and reduction.

364
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,990
In conclusion, never stop writing.

365
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,990
Correct your mistakes as soon as possible.

366
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,390
Use some cross-lines

367
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,470
or dialog boxes.

368
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,470
You don't have to write kanji all the time.

369
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,110
You can use katakana instead.

370
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,210
Also, you may connect them with threads

371
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,120
or use symbols to represent the repetitions.

372
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,600
That will increase your speed greatly.

373
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,380
The way of using the symbols

374
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,280
should be standardized as much as possible in one team.

375
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,610
And keep a good posture.

376
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,930
What matters most, even if you can't keep up,

377
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,030
you can't give up.

378
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:11,330
Never

379
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,580
give up.

380
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,660
I'm so tired.

381
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,460
Ah.

382
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,520
Are you okay?

383

The word "éclair"

413
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,360
is originated in France.

Do you know that?

415
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,800
That means the origin of the dessert comes from the word "éclair."

-Lightning.

Although it's a bit absurd, there are indeed several theories.

You don't believe it, do you?

428

It's true.
