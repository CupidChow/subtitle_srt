1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:08,470
I'm here.

2
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,170
Ah?

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,300
How is the word "small" spelled again?

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,100
Hey.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,310
Yes.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,030
Have you finished the training directory?

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:25,560
Almost.

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,910
Just a little bit left.

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,000
How much longer do you need exactly?

10
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,830
You've been saying

11
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,890
"just a little bit left" for a while. When can you finish it completely?

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:35,490
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,040
-Hurry up already.
-Chiba, come here please.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:39,230
Step it up.

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,110
Sakawa.

16
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:41,030
Yes.

17
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:42,530
Come on.

18
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,080
Come on!

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,140
You...

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,140
Chiba.

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,690
About this...

22
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,240
Come on. Seriously.

23
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,340
Mr. Sai.

24
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:53,980
Yes?

25
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,110
Why did you let that guy join us?

26
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:57,690
Yes?

27
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,530
Well,

28
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,410
no matter how badly we need manpower, we can find someone better than him, right?

29
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:03,820
Well...

30
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,110
It's done!

31
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,870
Finally.

32
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:10,700
Chiba.

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,430
Smile.

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,120
Okay.

35
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:16,830
Hiss.

36
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,490
Ahem.

37
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,890
Okay, thank you.

38
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,350
Let me see.

39
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,730
Here.

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,890
Hey.

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,120
You missed something

42
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,340
here.

43
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,650
You call this "finished"?

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,120
-You...
-Smile.

45
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm sorry!

46
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:36,979
It's okay. It's all right.

47
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,460
Take your time.

48
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,800
-Okay.
-Look, here.

49
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,340
You...

50
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,960
Um, there's a misspelling here.

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, I spelled it wrong.

52
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,810
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Okay.

53
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,960
It's okay.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
Do it over again, all right?

55
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,220
Yes!

56
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,789
Okay.

57
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,530
What else?

58
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:54,240
What?

59
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,450
What's with that face?

60
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,250
What?

61
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,370
I don't know. It doesn't matter.

62
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,320
-I'm sorry.
-I didn't expect they'd make a good team.

63
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,990
[Theme Song]

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,380
Conversion refers to

65
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,220
treating someone else's property as if it is your own.

66
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,079
In media reports, it is sometimes also referred to as misappropriation.

67
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,270
But in the legal field,

68
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,070
the correct term is conversion.

69
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,320
In criminal law,

70
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,430
conversion can be divided into three major categories,

71
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,480
namely pure conversion,

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,630
professional conversion,

73
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,720
and lost item conversion.

74
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,930
In legal provisions, they correspond to

75
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,310
Article 252,

76
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,880
Article 253 and Article 254 respectively.

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,470
Taichi.

78
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,320
Taichi!

79
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,000
I've finished entering it!

80
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,730
What?

81
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,600
What?

82
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,960
Oh, I'm at school.

83
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,920
Are you okay? Are you feeling unwell?

84
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,960
Why do you ask?

85
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:05,850
Well...

86
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,550
You fell asleep without eating anything.

87
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,170
Right.

88
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,180
What's that supposed to mean?

89
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,710
Are you really okay?

90
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,370
I'm fine.

91
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,089
I'm just a little bit too busy with my part-time jobs.

92
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:19,750
Is that so?

93
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,050
You're working both as a waiter at the cafe and as a courier.

94
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,670
Yes.

95
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,930
Also...

96
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,370
Yes?

97
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,120
Well, forget it.

98
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,350
So good. Today's lunch is delicious as always.

99
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,110
I'm finished.

100
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,670
I still have part-time work to do today.

101
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,760
Oh, okay.

102
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,010
These are today's notes.

103
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:55,659
Ah.

104
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,630
Thank you.

105
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,470
See you then.

106
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,870
Good luck.

107
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,510
Okay.

108
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,570
All right.

109
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,890
Today's training is to improve customer service quality

110
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,010
through sign language learning

111
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,410
and deepen the understanding of hearing-impaired people.

112
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,120
Besides,

113
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:38,070
I hope this training can help you gain some good awareness.

114
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,450
Let's take a look at the materials first.

115
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:42,920
Sakawa.

116
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:44,100
Sakawa.

117
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:44,690
Yes.

118
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,310
Do it faster.

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,380
Got it.

120
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,480
Communication can be done

121
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,110
through multiple approaches according to

122
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,930
the degree of hearing impairment of the other party and the environment.

123
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,780
We need to find out which approach the other party wants to take the most

124
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,040
and take corresponding measures. This is very important.

125
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,740
Some elders may not be able to hear you when you talk to him like this.

126
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,300
Therefore, we should enter their sight

127
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,970
and give them a signal with hand gestures like this.

128
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,890
Besides,

129
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,240
gently tapping the other party's shoulder to attract attention

130
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,030
is another approach.

131
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:23,930
Now,

132
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,290
although you're here,

133
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,130
the company

134
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,490
is still paying you salary.

135
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,830
As a social being, please don't forget that it's still working time.

136
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,280
Let's carry on.

137
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,310
What's your emergency?

138
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,960
Emergency. One more time.

139
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,080
What is

140
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,990
your emergency?

141
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,550
Lastly, reach out your hand to the other party.

142
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,010
Next, we arranged some time for discussion.

143
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,520
After 30 minutes of discussion,

144
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,790
each class shall make a presentation according to your respective topic.

145
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,320
Start.

146
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,960
-Nice to work with you.
-Nice to work with you.

147
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,410
Excuse me, teacher.

148
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:03,160
Yes?

149
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,580
Are you talking to me?

150
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,100
Yes.

151
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,800
So you think I'm a teacher.

152
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,530
I didn't hear this part just now. Please give me some instructions.

153
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,700
Here?

154
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,000
Have you asked your group members?

155
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,040
No.

156
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,770
Please solve the problem within your group first.

157
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,830
There will be no teachers when you enter the workforce.

158
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,610
Yes.

159
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,410
Don't tell them so easily.

160
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,000
If she can't communicate with the people around her actively,

161
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,130
she will be the one to suffer in the end.

162
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,150
Do you all understand

163
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,860
the topic?

164
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,290
No, I don't understand it at all.

165
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,460
I'm back.

166
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,520
-Good work.
-Good work.

167
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,170
Welcome back.

168
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,490
Perfect timing. I've got a delicious pudding for you.

169
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,920
Okay.

170
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,030
Um.

171
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,640
What, you don't like pudding?

172
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,660
No, I like it a lot.

173
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I wish I could dive

174
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,660
into a pudding's swamp.

175
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,210
Please. Please. Dive in it.

176
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,900
Did something happen?

177
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,980
No.

178
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,240
How should I put it?

179
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,100
Well.

180
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,350
I think Mr. Chiba is amazing.

181
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,270
Our ways of thinking

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,010
are completely different.

183
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Sakawa.

184
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,920
Yes?

185
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,410
You said before that

186
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,450
those with hearing impairments

187
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,270
suffer a lot because they can't hear,

188
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,370
and they shouldn't be deliberately separated from ordinary people.

189
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,150
Well,

190
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,690
yes.

191
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,590
Although I said you were being idealistic,

192
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,250
ideals are what everyone wants to pursue.

193
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,410
Hehe.

194
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:29,370
That's why I wanted to work with you, a person who pursues his ideals.

195
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,540
Our company also hopes that one day,

196
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,560
we can provide more services besides sign language.

197
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,720
No matter how hard it is,

198
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,120
it'll be lame to give up easily.

199
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:45,680
What you said

200
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,160
is for us to turn into an international design company, right?

201
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:54,980
Well,

202
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,020
to achieve those is also why

203
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,990
I wanted to work here.

204
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:01,550
Yes.

205
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:04,600
But

206
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,410
if it goes on like this,

207
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,950
I feel I'm like a jack-of-all-trades.

208
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,180
I'm

209
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,920
not like those around me.

210
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:20,070
Some want to be social insurance agents,

211
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
and some want to be movie directors.

212
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,070
There's nothing I want to do in college either.

213
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,890
I just want to be a student like this.

214
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,680
Well.

215
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,080
There are many things to learn in college.

216
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:41,140
But

217
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:45,800
if you have that thought,

218
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,260
would you like to be our regular employee?

219
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:51,860
What?

220
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,530
[Sorry, I overslept. I might be late for the first class today.]

221
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:08,530
[Taichi]

222
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:28,880
Taichi.

223
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:33,540
Taichi.

224
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,890
Oh.

225
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,070
What are you doing?

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,940
Ah, look at you.

227
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,920
There's grass all over your head.

228
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:46,690
Yes?

229
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:52,640
Well, Kouhei.

230
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,770
What?

231
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,050
What do you say if I want to drop out of college?

232
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:04,550
What?

233
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,140
Well.

234
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,690
Just forget what I said.

235
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,450
You want to drop out?

236
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:17,650
Yeah.

237
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,640
What did you do, Taichi?

238
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,010
It'll be bad if the school finds out about it, right?

239
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,930
Did you get into a fight again?

240
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,300
What?

241
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,380
-What did you do?
-It's not like that.

242
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,940
I didn't do anything.

243
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:28,870
Really?

244
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,030
Yes.

245
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,880
Then why do you want to drop out?

246
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,200
Well... It's just...

247
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,880
How should I put it?

248
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,000
It's just something happened.

249
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,480
Well...

250
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,540
I realized what I want to do.

251
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,890
What you want to do?

252
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,840
Yes.

253
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,390
How should I put it?

254
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,950
I just have some thought about it.

255
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,760
I said something weird, didn't I?

256
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:10,710
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:16,830
Even a boar knows

258
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,570
when it's time to turn.

259
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,260
Once he finds another target,

260
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,640
he will leave even without blinking.

261
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,680
What will you do then?

262
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:32,520
Besides,

263
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,220
I still have to take notes for you.

264
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:40,810
If I leave, things will be difficult for you, right?

265
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,530
No, they won't.

266
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,390
Really?

267
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,540
But...

268
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,090
The Student Affairs Office also talked to me.

269
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,590
Since we have more specialized courses now,

270
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,360
they think it'll be better to let a professional note-taker do it.

271
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,670
But

272
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,350
didn't you say you don't want someone else to do it?

273
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,010
But you have something you want to do, don't you?

274
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,750
Don't worry about me.

275
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,950
Just go do what you like.

276
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:20,560
But

277
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,250
I'm the one who proposed it, so I'll see it through to the end.

278
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,960
-I said it's okay.
-But...

279
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:31,930
I'm

280
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,120
all right now.

281
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,510
I'll be fine without you.

282
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,900
What do you mean by that?

283
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,770
Oh, right.

284
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,210
I got it.

285
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,990
Do whatever you want.

286
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,950
It's my fault

287
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,770
for meddling in your business.

288
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,620
You...

289
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,640
You've already...

290
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,900
Taichi.

291
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,340
Just come.

292
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,010
There will be many people next time.

293
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,790
You have a lot of friends, don't you?

294
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,450
-Are you asking me out?
-Yeah.

295
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,380
Hi, Taichi.

296
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,360
Taichi?

297
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,560
Looks like something happened to him.

298
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:13,160
Well, as for the suitable note-taker for you, Sugihara,

299
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,790
I think you should pick someone from the Law Department.

300
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,190
Sugihara?

301
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:27,840
Yes.

302
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,370
All right, I'll find you someone from the Law Department.

303
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,960
I'm home.

304
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,510
You're back.

305
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,720
Hey, Grandpa.

306
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,230
Yes?

307
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,890
What do you think if I say I want to drop out of college?

308
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,230
It's fine by me.

309
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,960
What?

310
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,500
I mean, do whatever you want.

311
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,599
Huh?

312
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,280
You're not stopping me? And you are not angry?

313
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,700
Is the reason why you want to drop out something I should be mad about?

314
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,970
No, of course not.

315
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:32,210
You're going to school with the money you make anyway.

316
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,090
Do whatever you want.

317
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,230
But

318
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,210
I'm still being too willful, aren't I?

319
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,450
What?

320
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:45,570
I finally have a friend who trusts me so much,

321
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,780
but I'm being capricious for my own reasons.

322
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,930
Why?

323
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,290
Did you have a fight with your friend for that?

324
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,130
You and that friend of yours

325
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:59,180
will graduate in two or three years anyway.

326
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,710
You'll still have to say goodbye then.

327
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,340
You're not middle school students anymore.

328
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:07,310
Why are you acting like a baby?

329
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,880
I'm not!

330
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,800
No matter who he is,

331
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,500
you can't

332
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,870
stay in a place with him forever.

333
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:21,170
You're actually the easiest to feel lonely.

334
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,160
You always act like a child.

335
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,470
Who are you talking about, old man?

336
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,100
You are exactly

337
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,170
like my stupid son in this regard.

338
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,030
Hey, Taichi.

339
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,510
When you need to make a choice,

340
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,550
don't take loneliness into consideration.

341
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,500
As humans,

342
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,300
when we feel lonely,

343
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:06,690
we won't be able to see the path under our feet clearly.

344
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,430
That way,

345
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,330
we'll end up taking the wrong path.

346
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,950
You should

347
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,360
light up the path under your feet

348
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,420
and choose a bright path.

349
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:20,970
All right?

350
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,540
Maya.

351
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,880
How was your class?

352
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,530
Did you get along well with your note-taker?

353
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,460
Well...

354
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,860
Pretty well.

355
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,230
Will everything go well for me?

356
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,360
Yes?

357
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,010
Be with someone who's not Taichi.

358
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,110
Maya?

359
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,880
Well...

360
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,810
Senior,

361
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,660
do you like that guy?

362
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,170
Yes.

363
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,830
But it's just my unrequited love.

364
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,150
You're really sharp, Maya.

365
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,010
-Or am I just too easy to see through?
-Hey.

366
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,990
Why does it have to be him?

367
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,410
He's so rude

368
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,330
and naive.

369
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:03,220
It may look like he's helping you, but he's always causing you trouble.

370
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,140
Do you really need him?

371
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,190
Maya.

372
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,180
Have you ever hoped

373
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,060
that your ears are not like this?

374
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:26,820
What?

375
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,460
I have.

376
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,770
I wished countless times that

377
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,050
I could hear clearly.

378
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,020
That way, my life might be completely different.

379
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,180
I may not be afraid of talking,

380
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:53,740
and I may not have to force smiles anymore.

381
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:56,720
I may challenge new things one after another.

382
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,320
And there may be many things that can make me happy.

383
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,840
But I dropped that kind of thought a while ago.

384
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,090
No matter I was happy

385
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,440
or mad,

386
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:13,370
I wanted to do something for someone.

387
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,330
I wanted to live on

388
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,680
without thinking anything.

389
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,400
But

390
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:31,730
when I was with Taichi,

391
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,750
I remembered it all over again.

392
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,600
He's always hungry.

393
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,490
For someone else's sake, he'd get even angrier than the person involved.

394
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,640
He'd try harder to tell me every joke the professor told

395
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,270
rather than the content of class itself.

396
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,880
When I realized it, I found I already started laughing with him.

397
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,680
I'm so lucky to have met Taichi.

398
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,850
Ever since I met Taichi,

399
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,640
I've been feeling that I can stay the way I am now.

400
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,440
Although there are still many undelightful things,

401
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,290
and although I thought

402
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,460
I didn't want this kind of ears countless times,

403
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,640
ever since I met Taichi,

404
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,860
I've been feeling it's good to stay the way I am.

405
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,360
So,

406
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,690
I hope

407
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,990
I could have more time like this.

408
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,380
Excuse me.

409
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm here to go through the procedures for dropping out.

410
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:41,230
What?

411
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,230
Do you have time tonight?

412
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,770
[In the Next Episode]

413
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,960
I have something to tell you.

414
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,160
You've worked hard enough.

415
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,590
Even the tiniest things that no one would notice

416
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,100
can't escape your eyes.

417
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,030
Do you know

418
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,700
[This drama is purely fictional. The names of all characters and groups in this drama are fictional.]

419
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,090
how happy I am for that?

420
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,380
Thank you for taking notes for me.
