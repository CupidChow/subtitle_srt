185
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,270
Oh,

186
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,620
am I talking too fast?

187
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,430
Yes, you are.

188
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,370
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,440
Then I'll say it again.

190
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,460
The foundation of Platonic philosophy is...

191
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
You're talking too fast!

192
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,020
It's still too fast?

193
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,900
The foundation of

194
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,180
Platonic philosophy is...

195
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,160
Hey, thanks.

196
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,720
What's the food today?

197
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,430
Wow!

198
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,970
Today's food is very delicious, too.

199
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,520
I'm going to eat now.

200
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,150
Oh, it's very delicious.

201
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,020
Today's lunch is risotto with meat and vegetables.

202
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,650
Well,

203
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,340
I don't quite understand this part.

204
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,660
Oh, what?

205
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,000
It's this part.

206
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,940
Wow, it smells so good.

207
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,440
Hey, are you listening?

208
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,250
Today's lunch is so amazing.

209
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,460
What's written here?

210
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:51,970
It's this part.

211
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,420
What?

212
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,950
What's written here?

213
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,550
Wait.

214
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,230
Let me think about it carefully.

215
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:02,890
Oh!

216
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,530
My painting is good, isn't it?

217
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,210
I portrayed the characteristics of each of them so well.

218
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,140
Unfortunately,

219
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,780
Taichi

220
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,870
still has some flaws as a note-taker.

221
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,550
It's delicious!

222
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,690
Amazing!

223
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,840
I'm so happy.

224
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,940
Do I really deserve to eat such delicious food?

225
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,980
Will I be punished because of this?

226
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,200
Haha, punishment?

227
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:30,770
Yes.

228
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,130
Well, why are you laughing?

229
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,170
Are you that touched?

230
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,030
Of course. Because it's really delicious.

231
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,640
What?

232
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,790
Well, nothing. I'm sorry.

233
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Ha.

234
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,010
This is my first time seeing you smile.

235
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,550
What?

236
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,320
Because you rarely had an expression like that.

237
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,850
Yes.

238
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,440
It feels better when you smile.

239
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,780
It's really delicious.

240
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,150
But...

241
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,660
But my painting of Aristotle here is quite amazing, isn't it?

242
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,020
It has occupied too much space.

243
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,850
It's not a big deal. This is my great masterpiece.

244
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,940
I hope that your notes can be neater.

245
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,110
By the way, what's written here?

246
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,940
Are you okay?

247
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh, I'm fine.

248
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,850
Well, I'm sorry.

249
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,110
It's okay. I'm fine.

250
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,620
-Can you do it?
-Yes.

251
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,680
Okay. Let's continue.

252
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:20,660
Guys, defend well.

253
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,120
If we had played seriously, he would be so pitiful.

254
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,060
Look. He seems to be wearing something on his ear.

255
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,670
Stop saying it. What if he hears it?

256
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,120
Don't worry. He can't hear anyway.

257
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,710
Taichi, go! Taichi!

258
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,370
Oh, Yoko, nice pass!

259
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,050
Oh, great!

260
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,670
Hey!

261
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,780
Hey!

262
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,550
Oh, Kouhei!

263
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,810
Hey, Taichi! Taichi, come back to defend now!

264
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,510
Ah!

265
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,950
I can't have any expectations.

266
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:47,990
Taichi...

267
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,190
lives over there, too.

268
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,780
He lives in the place where I can't go.

269
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,050
He also

270
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,500
has his friends over there.

271
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,970
Oh, good morning, Kouhei.

272
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,650
Good morning.

273
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,010
I'm sorry that I've overslept.

274
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:00,500
Ew.

275
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:03,140
Hey, are you okay?

276
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,119
I'm fine.

277
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:07,990
I feel so sick.

278
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:13,930
Hey, Mom.

279
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,690
Ah, I'm feeling quite unwell.

280
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:20,369
Well...

281
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,130
Yesterday,

282
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,000
I went to a concert, didn't I?

283
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:28,089
The atmosphere was so good that

284
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,550
I drank too much.

285
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,080
Ah...

286
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,410
I can't hang in anymore.

287
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,580
Then don't make lunch for me today.

288
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,130
What?

289
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,390
But...

290
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,660
-It’s okay.
-Ew.

291
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,620
I know.

292
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,200
Sit down now.

293
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,370
Sit down.

294
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,220
I'll get you something to drink.

295
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,860
Why are you so drunk?

296
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,180
Oh, wait!

297
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,110
I'm feeling quite unwell.

298
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,550
Alright, alright.

299
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,670
Drink it.

300
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,610
Thank you.

301
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,550
I'm sorry, Kouhei.

302
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,590
Oh, Taichi!

303
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,920
Ah!

304
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,150
It's finally done.

305
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,660
What?

306
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,260
The movie script.

307
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,920
I finally finished it.

308
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
Hey, really?

309
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,670
What kind of reaction is that? You also need to participate in the shooting.

310
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,700
Gosh.

311
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,160
I won't do it.

312
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
Let's make preparations first.

313
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,680
Hey, Yoko.

314
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,120
Yes?

315
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:15,610
You have to help, too.

316
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,510
I'm not a member of your Film Research Club.

317
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,250
What are you talking about? You come and go freely in our activity room.

318
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,380
You're just like a member of our club.

319
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,680
That's right.

320
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,090
But I won't do it.

321
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,660
What are you talking about? Just do the task well.

322
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,410
Oh, Kouhei!

323
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:56,490
Taichi talked to me

324
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,820
because he wanted to get rewards.

325
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,560
Please

326
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:02,900
let me do it.

327
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,290
It's delicious!

328
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,470
Amazing!

329
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,160
Without rewards,

330
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,670
he has no reason to be with me.

331
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,750
It's not your fault that you can't hear.

332
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,800
What's more,

333
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,990
I...

334
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,010
Kouhei!

335
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:42,460
What's wrong with you? You've been ignoring me since yesterday.

336
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,680
I feel hurt. Okay?

337
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,690
Hey, say something!

338
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,320
But...

339
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,340
I didn't bring my lunch today.

340
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,960
Huh?

341
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,270
I'm not doing this for your lunch.

342
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:00,660
Oh...

343
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,470
Well, did you hear it?

344
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:09,970
Yes, I did.

345
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,980
Darn it! The glutton in my stomach

346
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,910
has started yelling again!

347
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,620
You're so noisy!

348
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,430
Humph!

349
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,260
Would you like to eat with me if you haven't had lunch yet?

350
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:27,090
Yes.

351
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,360
Can I?

352
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,220
What should we eat?

353
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:37,150
Oh, let's go eat ramen!

354
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,360
Do you like eating ramen, Taichi?

355
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:39,890
Yes.

356
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,890
I haven't eaten ramen since then.

357
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,550
Since then?

358
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,260
Oh, you're talking about the incident that you were fired by the ramen restaurant?

359
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,550
Hey, don't remind me of those painful memories.

360
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,150
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,450
You seem happy.

362
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,820
Did something good happen to you?

363
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:57,070
Sort of.

364
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,370
Who knows?

365
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,110
Alright. What kind of ramen should we eat today?

366
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,880
How about soy sauce ramen?

367
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,950
Do you like that kind of flavor?

368
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:07,900
Yes, I love eating soy sauce.

369
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,520
Let's go.

370
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,600
Sugihara!

371
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,230
Kouhei, nice shot!

372
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:28,120
Sugihara, nice shot!

373
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,200
Darn it!

374
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,430
Don't think that it's over like this, Kouhei!

375
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,030
Hey, come back to defend now!

376
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,400
Defend against him!

377
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,380
Sugihara!

378
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,360
Look at me!

379
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,690
Go! Go!

380
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,240
-Nice!
-Nice!

381
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,530
Sugihara, well done!

382
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,390
Nice shot!

383
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,590
You're really good, brat!

384
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,980
Defend against Taichi!

385
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,980
Hey!

386
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:11,070
Great! Yeah!

387
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,020
Kouhei.

388
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:23,930
Ah! What are you doing?

389
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,270
Are you angry?

390
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,850
No, I'm not.

391
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,870
You're obviously angry.

392
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,210
You're angry.

393
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,420
You're really angry.

394
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,430
I've told you that I'm not angry.

395
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:33,320
You're just angry.

396
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,670
Oh, no.

397
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:35,830
Stop it now!

398
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:36,760
Stop!

399
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,660
Gosh, buddy!

400
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,650
You'll be miserable. I have a water pipe!

401
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,230
Gosh!

402
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:45,970
Haha.

403
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,490
Hey, no!

404
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm spraying water on you!

405
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,760
I'll make you angry!

406
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,210
That day, Taichi

407
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:56,780
made me understand something.

408
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,850
There might be

409
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,260
a place for me over there.

410
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:51,610
[In the Next Episode]

411
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,260
The Film Research Club is going to shoot a movie.

412
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,570
Mio is here to help.

413
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,540
As long as I can see the person I care about,

414
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,140
it'll be enough.

415
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,280
Does she have a crush on you?

416
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:56,080
Well...

417
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:56,710
Yes?
