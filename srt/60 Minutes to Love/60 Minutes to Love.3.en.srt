00:00:08,475 --> 00:00:11,211
YEEUN CHOSE CHOI JONGWOO

00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:13,213
-<i>Lee Yongwoo is out.</i>
-I had so much fun.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,882
I could feel that you liked me more.

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:16,916
I'll show you more.

6
00:00:16,983 --> 00:00:18,718
I know what you like.

7
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:20,854
I said that I liked someone like Ji Yeeun.

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,689
We used to talk casually
with each other.

9
00:00:22,756 --> 00:00:24,290
May I call you "Yeeun"?

10
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,726
Oh, my. What am I supposed to do?

11
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:28,928
This is driving me crazy.

12
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:31,865
60 MINUTES TO LOVE

13
00:00:32,665 --> 00:00:35,869
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

14
00:00:35,935 --> 00:00:38,038
<i>Two-on-one blind date begins now!</i>

15
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,010
<i>Park Changsun from</i> I'm Solo <i>has entered.</i>

16
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,481
-Hello.
-Hello.

17
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,883
-Hello.
-Hello.

18
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:50,817
-Hello.
-Hello.

19
00:00:52,819 --> 00:00:54,387
You seem familiar.

20
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:56,423
-Is that so?
-Hello.

21
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:02,729
You brought something.

22
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:03,797
I came empty-handed.

23
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,366
Seriously.

24
00:01:08,134 --> 00:01:08,968
My goodness.

25
00:01:09,035 --> 00:01:10,904
I could see you two
were having a good time.

26
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,005
-You could?
-Yes.

27
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,840
So I wondered if it'd be possible

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,843
for me to get involved.

29
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,545
Don't be like that.

30
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,548
-It's nice to meet you.
-Hello.

31
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,483
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

34
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:31,925
-What's your name?
-I'm Park Changsun.

35
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:33,726
I'm from Busan.

36
00:01:33,793 --> 00:01:35,128
-I see.
-Busan.

37
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,031
I work as a bank clerk in Busan.

38
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,399
A bank clerk.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,735
-I think I saw you in <i>I'm Solo</i>.
-Yes.

40
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,970
-Right?
-You're right.

41
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,171
I see.

42
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,407
Do you watch <i>I'm Solo</i>?

43
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:49,642
Yes, I watch <i>I'm Solo</i>.

44
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,077
Did you watch the season I was in?

45
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:53,146
Yes. Weren't you in an earlier season?

46
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,247
It was three years ago.

47
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,615
-Right? It was a while ago.
-Yes.

48
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,317
-I watched it regularly back then.
-I see.

49
00:01:57,383 --> 00:02:00,787
Not so much these days.
I watched a lot of dating shows back then.

50
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,425
I prepared a present.

51
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,594
I prepared a present.

52
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,761
I see.

53
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:13,533
A present?

54
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,601
It's…

55
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,537
I don't know if it'll be okay
to accept a present.

56
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:21,241
-It's small, so don't feel pressured.
-Really?

57
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,942
-What is it?
-Let me show you.

58
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,981
-On your Instagram account, I saw…
-Okay.

59
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,582
…that you had keychains on your bag.

60
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:32,886
I have teddy bear keychains on my bag.

61
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,087
That's right.

62
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,690
-So…
-Thank you.

63
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:40,059
-I thought that you liked teddy bears.
-I do like them.

64
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:44,264
Were we allowed to bring such things?

65
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,067
I should've done the same.

66
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,305
Would you like my necklace?

67
00:02:55,408 --> 00:02:57,911
-Had I known, I would've brought one.
-It's okay.

68
00:02:57,977 --> 00:02:59,445
-Seriously, it's okay.
-All right.

69
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,082
You look really pretty in person.

70
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:10,890
My goodness. You know,

71
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,526
-she didn't laugh like that with me.
-I see.

72
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:17,530
-Well…
-She's showing all of her gums.

73
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,367
He told me that I looked pretty in person.

74
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,803
-You look really pretty in person.
-Thanks.

75
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,341
<i>Ten minutes have passed.</i>

76
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:34,881
-Did you come from Busan?
-Yes.

77
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:38,451
In order to see you,
I took a day off without hesitation.

78
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,153
-Thank you.
-All right.

79
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,289
You're so popular.

80
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,295
Why didn't you ask me where I came from?

81
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:51,698
Where did you come from?

82
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,768
Gangneung, Gangwon Province.

83
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:56,769
For real? Gangneung?

84
00:03:56,836 --> 00:03:57,937
Yes. I took KTX.

85
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,707
You're lying.

86
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:01,741
It's true.

87
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:03,810
Don't you live in Seoul?

88
00:04:03,876 --> 00:04:05,812
But I'm originally from Gangneung.

89
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:07,580
-You didn't come today.
-Not today.

90
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,115
-I see.
-Give me a break.

91
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,184
-I came to Seoul from my hometown.
-I see.

92
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,486
Today, I came from Hakdong Station.

93
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:14,487
I see.

94
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,523
-What's your age?
-My age?

95
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,159
I was born in 1988. I'm 38 years old.

96
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:21,327
I see.

97
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,031
-You were born in 1994.
-Yes.

98
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:28,034
You were born on July 26.

99
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:30,670
My goodness.

100
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,806
To be honest, I collected information.

101
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:35,808
-We only get 30 minutes.
-Yes.

102
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,910
So… Have you heard of Namuwiki?

103
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:39,045
Yes. I know what it is.

104
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:42,415
Your Namuwiki page had
a lot of information.

105
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,353
Thus, I memorized most of the information
before coming here.

106
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,055
You know, I did the same.

107
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,359
I checked out your Namuwiki page too.

108
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:54,661
I see. My Namuwiki page.

109
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,429
I see.

110
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,097
I began doing that last year.

111
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:00,099
"TRYING HARD NOT TO LOSE"

112
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:01,601
-So…
-I see.

113
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,903
…why don't you ask us questions and see

114
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,305
-who does better?
-A quiz on Yeeun?

115
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:06,205
Yes.

116
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,175
I'm confident.

117
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,244
-The one who answers first will win.
-Okay.

118
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,079
This is ridiculous.

119
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:17,583
Which school did I graduate from?

120
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,952
Let me answer.

121
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,389
Korea National University of Arts

122
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,791
-and Jungang Girls' High.
-Correct.

123
00:05:24,857 --> 00:05:26,259
Korea National University of Arts

124
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,694
-and Jungang Girls' High.
-Correct.

125
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,629
That's insane.

126
00:05:35,768 --> 00:05:36,769
Jungang Girls' High.

127
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,138
-You have an incredible memory.
-I can't believe it.

128
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,540
I memorized the information.

129
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,775
I studied her Namuwiki page for a week.

130
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,811
My goodness.

131
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,481
Gosh, that's amazing.

132
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,050
I didn't expect you to get
the Jungang Girls' High part.

133
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:53,553
What do you usually do when you rest?

134
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:54,721
-When I rest?
-You're very…

135
00:05:54,787 --> 00:05:56,222
I stay at home.

136
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,291
I watch videos

137
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,359
and read books.

138
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:02,729
Actually, I read that on Namuwiki as well.

139
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,667
YEEUNWIKI KNOWS EVERYTHING

140
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,739
According to your Namuwiki page,
you either go

141
00:06:12,805 --> 00:06:14,340
-to Cheonggyecheon…
-Cheonggyecheon.

142
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:16,209
-…or Kyobo Book Center.
-Kyobo Book Center.

143
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:21,080
-Oh, my.
-You go to those places.

144
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,716
Do bank clerks have a good memory?

145
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:27,053
I reread the page
right before coming here.

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,622
-You practically studied for a test.
-I know.

147
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,556
-Did I?
-Yes.

148
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:33,559
You didn't gain information from me.
You studied for this.

149
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,466
-Recently, I watched your YouTube videos.
-I see.

150
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,701
Was it called, "<i>Dining</i>"?

151
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:43,369
-<i>Dining Table</i>?
-Yes. I watched it.

152
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,838
-You studied very hard.
-Yes.

153
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,474
Is there such a show? <i>Dining Table</i>?

154
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,876
I don't know what it is.

155
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,010
You didn't know?

156
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:54,680
-Your body is already leaning toward him.
-No.

157
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,949
It's just that we're talking
for the first time.

158
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:58,484
Fifteen minutes have passed already.

159
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,856
-Time…
-Oh, no.

160
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,057
You're right.

161
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:06,192
Oh, no.

162
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,293
Time is passing faster.

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,261
Oh, no.

164
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,130
I'm nervous.

165
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,665
-Really?
-Yes.

166
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:14,700
Really?

167
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,102
There's no need to be nervous.

168
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,136
-Is that so?
-Yes.

169
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,037
Okay.

170
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:24,076
I'm also very nervous.

171
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,213
Really?

172
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,214
My palms are sweaty.

173
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,215
See?

174
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,050
I don't see any sweat.

175
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
They're really sweaty.

176
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,587
You have very big hands.

177
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:36,122
-Your hands are bigger than mine.
-No.

178
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,690

00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,102

-Rock-paper-scissors!

00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,972

-Okay.

357
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:10,743
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

358
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,747
"Can a man and a woman be friends?"

359
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,783
One, two, three.

-No.
-No.

361
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,353
-My answer is no.
-Mine too.

362
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,489
This is what you need to consider.

363
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,459
There are things friends of the same sex
need to do together

364
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,561
such as calling each other late at night

365
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:31,230
or going on a trip.

366
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:32,564
A man and a woman can't do that.

367
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:34,700
-Right.
-Thus, they can't be friends.

368
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,135
-You're right.
-Yes.

369
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,070
Now…

00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,438
"IT'S CHANGSUN'S TURN"

371
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,907
I'll take this one out.

-"Do you feel good or bad?"

374
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,685
How would you feel?

375
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,788
-I'd feel good.
-Right? Me too.

376
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,856
It means he's cool in other people's eyes.

377
00:15:57,923 --> 00:15:59,391
That's right.

378
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,494
And I'll find it cute
if my lover brags about it.

379
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,796

380
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:04,763

-Yes.

00:16:10,402 --> 00:16:11,971
Aren't both dates good?

384
00:16:12,037 --> 00:16:13,105
I agree.

00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,977

00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:19,812
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:20,746
-Former.
-Former.

389
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,947
Oh, my.

390
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,049
Do you prefer calling or texting?

391
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,351
One, two, three.

392
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,252
-Calling.
-Calling.

393
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,254
All of my answers
have matched yours so far.

394
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,390
Why are you doing this to me?

395
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,727
-How fascinating.
-You did too much research.

396
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:36,061
It's scary.

397
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,697
No. This isn't on the web.

398
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:39,798
This isn't…

399
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,473
-It came out.
-I'm really good at this.

400
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,377

I'll grant your wish.

404
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,620
-The thing is, this is my wish.
-What is it?

405
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,055
Taking a selfie together.

406
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,556
-Is that your wish?
-Yes.

407
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,724
I'll grant that wish.

408
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,659
-Okay.
-I'll grant that wish.

409
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,361
When it's time for me to leave,

410
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,230
-please take a selfie with me.
-Of course.

411
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,803
Do you wish to be in a relationship?

412
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,204
Of course I do.

413
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,206
When do you feel that way the most?

414
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:23,008
When I'm upset.

415
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,344
When I need someone to take my side.

416
00:17:26,612 --> 00:17:28,947
You want to call someone and go,

417
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,283
-"This and that happened today."
-I want to do that.

418
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,951
-But you have no one.
-I have no one.

419
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:35,754
I cry alone at home.

420
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:37,890
That's when I feel the most…

421
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,827
I'm not the type to open up to my family.

422
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:43,762
I'm the eldest daughter.

423
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,464
-The Korean eldest daughter.
-Exactly.

424
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,099
-You already know that, right?
-Yes.

425
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,235
That's when I have the strongest urge.

426
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:52,137
I want to talk to someone.

427
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,773
That's when I think,

428
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,076
"I want to be in a relationship."

429
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,916
You can call me anytime.

430
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:05,551
I'm a very good listener.

431
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:08,654
Call me.

432
00:18:09,154 --> 00:18:10,255

433
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,492
I can be a very good listener.

434
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,262
Please do that if you get a chance.

435
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,298
Who knows what will happen in the future?

436
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:20,199
Right. Who knows?

437
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,268

-Look at the time.
