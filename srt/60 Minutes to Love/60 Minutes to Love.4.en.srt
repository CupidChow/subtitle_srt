HE STUDIED NAMUWIKI

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,946
Thus, I memorized most of the information
before coming here.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,314
Which school did I graduate from?

5
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:16,616
Korea National University of Arts
and Jungang Girls' High.

6
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:17,684
That's insane.

7
00:00:18,818 --> 00:00:20,920
Choi Jongwoo is out.

8
00:00:21,488 --> 00:00:22,822
I brought something.

9
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:24,190
Each block comes with a question.

10
00:00:24,257 --> 00:00:26,326
"Someone asks your lover
for their number."

11
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:27,594
-"Do you feel…"
-"Do you feel…"

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,162
-I'd feel good.
-Me too.

13
00:00:29,229 --> 00:00:31,097
"Can a man and a woman be friends?"

14
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:32,232
-No. Calling.
-No. Calling.

15
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,000

JUNG JAIHO, HEART SIGNAL 2

25
00:00:58,825 --> 00:01:01,261
FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN YEEUN, ENFJ,
INFLUENCER AND ENTREPRENEUR

26
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,129
Hello.

27
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,665
Hello.

28
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,267
-Hello.
-Hello.

29
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,704
I saw you on <i>Heart Signal</i>.

30
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:12,772
-Really? Did you?
-Yes.

31
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:14,007
I watched <i>Heart Signal</i>.

32
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,108
The season I was in?

33
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:16,776
-Yes.
-I see.

34
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:17,977
-Season Two, right?
-Yes.

35
00:01:18,044 --> 00:01:21,815
-Wasn't that the most popular season?
-It practically laid

36
00:01:21,881 --> 00:01:24,417
the foundation
for all Korean dating shows.

37
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,219
You're right. Seriously.

38
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:27,587
Technically, I'm his senior.

39
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:28,888
You're right.

40
00:01:30,056 --> 00:01:31,057
-Yes.
-It's true.

41
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,295
How old are you?

42
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:36,896
I was born in 1990.

43
00:01:36,963 --> 00:01:38,131
"FOUR YEARS OLDER THAN YEEUN"

44
00:01:38,798 --> 00:01:40,600
My name is Jung Jaiho.

45
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,368
Nice to meet you.

46
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,137
Nice to meet you.

47
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,340
-Yeeun.
-I was born in 1994.

48
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,709
I was born in 1988.
My name is Park Changsun.

49
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,277
-Changsun.
-Yes.

50
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:52,745
You don't look your age.

51
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,281
Is that so?

52
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:56,816
You look like a younger man.

53
00:01:56,883 --> 00:01:58,051
I'll be one.

54
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,687
"I'll be one."

55
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:02,188
If you're okay with a younger man…

56
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,029
You must be very exhausted.

57
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:14,567
It isn't easy to have blind dates
for over four hours.

58
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,936
Right. It's beginning to get…

59
00:02:17,003 --> 00:02:18,972
Since you're meeting new people,

60
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,875
you need to keep answering
the same questions.

61
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,009
It must be very exhausting.

62
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,819
-Still, it's a different person each time.
-Right.

63
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,420
-I see.
-So it feels new.

64
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,890
Then I must ask

65
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,758
-some trite questions.
-Okay.

66
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,093
Feel free to do that. Seriously.

67
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,661
I've been curious.

68
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,631
On TV, you've played characters

69
00:02:44,697 --> 00:02:47,834
such as Chorong's girlfriend,
Mala Tang Wei,

70
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,302
and Flower Pot.

71
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,438
All of these characters have been
lighthearted

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,941
and fun.

73
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:58,111
I really want to know what you're like
when you aren't making people laugh.

74
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,212
And…

75
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,580
You're curious about

76
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,516
-my personal side.
-I want to see your personal side.

77
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,953
Just by sitting here
and talking to you briefly,

78
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,454
I can sense your different charms.

79
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,622
-Really?
-Yes.

80
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,591
-It's undoubtedly true.
-Really?

81
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:12,659
-Right?
-Yes.

82
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:14,460
-Thank you.
-So…

83
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,631
We've talked for about an hour.

84
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:22,635
I was so surprised.

85
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:26,272
Unlike what I've seen on TV,
she has a calm side.

86
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,342
-I do.
-You guys must've talked a lot.

87
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,277
Yes, we've talked for an hour.

88
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,847
Yes. For about an hour.
We played this game as well.

89
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:35,915
-Yes.
-I see.

90
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:37,016
I prepared it.

91
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,718
-You guys played a board game.
-Yes.

92
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,687
Each block has a question.

93
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:41,854
The board game is like that.

94
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,922
What kind of questions?

95
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:45,058
On the count of three,

96
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:47,126
we gave an answer

97
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:49,996
-about what we liked.
-Regarding the question.

98
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,698
We gave the same answers three times.

99
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,903
Yes.

100
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:01,941
I also have a connection with Yeeun.

101
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,043
-Oh, okay.
-I looked up information.

102
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:12,051
Firstly, aren't your parents
four years apart?

103
00:04:12,118 --> 00:04:14,721
-My mom and…
-They were born in 1967 and 1971.

104
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,656
-What?
-It's 1965. That's wrong information.

105
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:20,760
It's 1965. That's wrong information.

106
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,928
-Your dad's birth year?
-Yes.

107
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:24,364
-No way. That means Namuwiki is wrong.
-On Namuwiki…

108
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,832
-Right? Did you read Namuwiki?
-Yes.

109
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:27,400
-Right? Did you read Namuwiki?
-Yes.

110
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,902
-Namuwiki.
-Namuwiki.

111
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:33,973
Jee Seokjin is close to my dad's age.

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,743
-I see. On Namuwiki…
-It says my dad was born in 1967.

113
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,611
But he was born in 1965.

114
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,580
Was he born in 1965?
I had the wrong information.

115
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,851
I thought your parents were
four years apart.

116
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,786
"You and I are also four years apart."

117
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,921
I wanted to say that,
but I had the wrong information

118
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,356
because of Namuwiki.

119
00:04:50,923 --> 00:04:51,958
That means…

120
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,394
That means your parents are
six years apart.

121
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,595
-I see.
-Yes.

122
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:57,363
She and I are six years apart.

123
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,898
"SHE AND I ARE SIX YEARS APART"

124
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,001
This is bad.

125
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:05,104
My goodness.

126
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,874
Then I can't talk about the age.

127
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,943
Your siblings…

128
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:13,212
I already know the answer,

129
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,315
-so I won't ask this question.
-Is that so?

130
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:16,849
Two younger siblings.

131
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:20,953
That's right.

132
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,889
Did you get that from Namuwiki?

133
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:25,525
-Yes, I did.
-He memorized everything.

134
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:27,260
-He memorized everything.
-Yes.

135
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,495
If I say more, she might feel uneasy.

136
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:31,497
You studied up on me.

137
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,002
-About your MBTI…
-Okay.

138
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,904
-It's unexpected, but you're introverted.
-Yes.

139
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,872
-ISFP.
-Yes.

140
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:43,009
There is an MBTI personality type
that's very compatible with ISFP.

141
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,143
Okay.

142
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,846
What's your MBTI personality type?

143
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:48,348
It's ENTP

144
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,550
-or ENTJ.
-ENTP or ENTJ.

145
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,452
It's always one of the two.

146
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,755
-The match is a disaster.
-Okay.

147
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,823
Really?

148
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,258
Okay.

149
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:00,827
Mine is ENFJ.

150
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,564
ENFJ is very compatible.

151
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,665
-That's right.
-Well…

152
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,335
<i>Ten minutes have passed.</i>

153
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,406
-I was very startled when he entered.
-Okay.

154
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,607
Why?

155
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:15,775
He's very handsome.

156
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,713
"This is bad. He shouldn't have come."

157
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,914
I had that thought.

158
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:23,449
But you survived.

159
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,551
-You're a very strong…
-I know. He survived.

160
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:27,920
She chose me out of consideration

161
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,589
since I was from Busan.

162
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,024
-He had to travel far.
-Yes.

163
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:33,693
-Where do you live? Seoul?
-Me?

164
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,828
I live in Seoul.

165
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,096
Seoul.

166
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,532
Should I say that I traveled far?

167
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:40,767
No.

168
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,169
He came all the way from Busan.

169
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,239
What are your opinions
on a long-distance relationship?

170
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,008
"ATTACKING A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP"

171
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,243
Oh, my.

172
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,679
To be honest,
a long-distance relationship…

173
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,615
-It isn't easy.
-It isn't easy.

174
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,051
-You're right.
-Since you're an ISFP,

175
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,620
-you like being at home.
-I do like it.

176
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:02,889
-When you meet your lover…
-It makes me happy.

177
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:04,690
-You need interactions.
-Yes.

178
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,426
It won't be easy for me to travel to Busan

179
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:08,394
-given my ISFP traits.
-I see.

180
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,396
-Being an EN--
-Leaving the room…

181
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:12,031
-Being an EN--
-Leaving the room…

182
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,166
-won't be easy.
-Right.

183
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,333
-Right.
-Yes.

184
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,440
Being an ENTP,

185
00:07:20,506 --> 00:07:21,507
I'd visit her myself.

186
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,178
I'd knock on the door.

187
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:27,814
-Your job…
-You work in Busan.

188
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,981
-Busan.
-BNK Busan Bank.

189
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,183
Busan.

190
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,453
Will you give up on your livelihood?

191
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,288
"ANOTHER ATTACK
ON THE LOCATION OF HIS WORK"

192
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:40,460
There are many branches of the bank
in Seoul.

193
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:43,262
-Later…
-Seoul branches of BNK Busan Bank.

194
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,764
Yes. Thus,

195
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:47,633
I can come anytime.

196
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,835
I see.

197
00:07:51,037 --> 00:07:52,071
"SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE"

198
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,640
What kind of food do you like?

199
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,809
-Spicy food? Really?
-I like spicy food.

200
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:57,877
Do you like hot pot?

201
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,278
I absolutely love it.

202
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:00,379
-I…
-Okay.

203
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,383
-I'm a VIP member of Haidilao.
-Really?

204
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:06,719
I don't need to wait in a line
at any branches.

205
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,721
-Is there a VIP membership?
-Of course.

206
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,693
The wait is so long there.

207
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,795
Exactly. You typically need to wait
for three hours.

208
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,964
I'm a gold VIP member.

209
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,232
How do you become a VIP member?

210
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,567
If you spend two million in a month,

211
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:24,871
they invite you to a group chat room
with the directors of all branches.

212
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,074
"I'll visit the Konkuk University branch
today."

213
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,378
They set up the VIP sign.

214
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,046
If it doesn't embarrass you…

215
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,481
-My goodness.
-Yes.

216
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,652
The never-before-seen Haidilao flirting.

217
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,487
-That's incredible.
-Yes.

218
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,822
I went there all the time.

219
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,191
I studied the sauces all the time.

220
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,559
It's really tasty.

221
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:48,728
I know the recipe
for a sauce you'll die for.

222
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,496
Is it better than the Keonhee's sauce?

223
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:51,631
It doesn't even compare.

224
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,834
If you want to know,
I'll tell you after 17 minutes.

225
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,469
I'll tell you after 17 minutes.

226
00:08:56,969 --> 00:08:58,271
You'll need to make a wise choice.

227
00:08:58,337 --> 00:08:59,605
I see. Seventeen minutes.

228
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:01,073
That's one way to appeal.

229
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,410
I know that Yeeun is an educated woman.

230
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:07,647
This is hard.

231
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,683
There are great spicy tteokbokki places
in Busan.

232
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,751
You're right.

233
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:12,852
Really?

234
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,253
That's right.

235
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,822
-Busan is also known for fish cakes.
-Yes.

236
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:18,190
I'll tell you after 17 minutes.

237
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,926
You'll need to make a wise choice.

238
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,627
I'll tell you one at a time.

239
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,129
After 17 minutes?

240
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:28,000
"WHOM WILL YEEUN CHOOSE AFTER 17 MINUTES?"

241
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,939
I know most of the chefs who run
popular restaurants all over Korea.

242
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,509
I can make reservations with ease.

243
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,177
That's a big one.

244
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:39,579
-That's a big one.
-Seriously.

245
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:40,846
-That's a big one indeed.
-Yes.

246
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,582
Do you make investments?

247
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,216
I don't know anything about it.

248
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,486
There's a very famous private banker
at my workplace.

249
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,624
I can introduce you
to that private banker.

250
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,828
As for me,

251
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:59,365
I can get the rate of return that's higher
than the available interest rates

252
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,499
through investments.

253
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:06,906
My rate of return must be higher
than that of the private banker.

254
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,477
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

255
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:13,646
I asked about investments…

256
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,348
-Okay.
-…because I figured

257
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:17,249
that it'd be a new question.

258
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:18,818
That's right. Yes.

259
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:19,885
It was a new question.

260
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,487
When was your last relationship?

261
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:23,556
My last relationship? To be honest,

262
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,224
it was three months ago.

263
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,493
-It hasn't been long.
-No. We broke up three months ago.

264
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,396
Yeeun has been single for many years.

265
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,399
Since she has talked for a long time,

266
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,533
I'll relay information

267
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,502
-for a short while.
-I've talked for a long time.

268
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,739
-She has never been on a blind date.
-No.

269
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,873
-Really?
-Yes.

270
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,676
You know,
I haven't heard Yeeun's story yet.

271
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:44,744
Okay.

272
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,278
Okay.

273
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,649
I haven't had a chance.

274
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:51,250
May I ask some questions?

275
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,585
-Sure.
-Sure.

276
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,722
Is there an age group you prefer?

277
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,625
As long as the man isn't much younger…

278
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,460
It's because I have younger brothers.

279
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,629
Younger men seem like younger brothers.

280
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,199
-When you're angry about something…
-Okay.

281
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,802
…how do you relieve stress? I'm curious.

282
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:10,970
When I'm angry?

283
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,471
I eat tasty food.

284
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:14,340
-You relieve stress through food.
-Otherwise,

285
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,876
-I go to the karaoke alone.
-What?

286
00:11:16,942 --> 00:11:18,444
-You enjoy singing.
-Yes.

287
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,046
I sing alone.

288
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:21,714
Then my anger subsides.

289
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:24,083
Now…

290
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,586
Now, you've entered your 30s.

291
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:29,822
Are you looking for someone you can spend

292
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,123
-your future with?
-Of course.

293
00:11:31,891 --> 00:11:34,927
Isn't it natural to consider marriage
when you're in a relationship?

294
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,495
Are you considering marriage?

295
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,664
-I totally am.
-Really?

296
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:39,932
I totally am.

297
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:42,735
In that case, I want to know
your ideal type for marriage.

298
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:44,203
-My ideal type for marriage?
-Yes.

299
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,638
I really want someone

300
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,440
who is kind.

301
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,608
Someone who is family-oriented.

302
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:50,676
Family-oriented.

303
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,011
Someone who is diligent.

304
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:53,879
-Diligent. Someone who works hard.
-Yes.

305
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:57,316
-You need someone who provides stability.
-Yes.

306
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,552
I want that the most.
Someone who provides stability.

307
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:02,455
In my line of work,
success and failure come and go.

308
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,056
-The fluctuation is…
-That's right.

309
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,424
-…too extreme.
-Yes.

310
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,792
Then my mood swings become

311
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,195
-too extreme.
-<i>One minute remains.</i>

312
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:10,930
That's how it is,

313
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,132
so I want someone
who can give me stability.

314
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,101
-Someone like a tree.
-Yes. Someone like a tree.

315
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,502
Someone dependable.

316
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,770
Even if I waver,

317
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,173
-he should anchor me by my side.
-He should anchor you.

318
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,844
If I have someone like that,
not even the rough waves and hardships

319
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,046
will affect me.

320
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,114
That's right.

321
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,650
When you have a chance,
please look up the traits of ENFJ.

322
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:35,521
-You'll see everything you said.
-Really?

323
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,989
-ENFJ.
-Yes.

324
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,358
-The MBTI personality type was known…
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>

325
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,893
-…to show goodwill.
-That's right.

326
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,095
-<i>Two, one.</i>
-This type is very selfless.

327
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,765
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

328
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,500
Time passed so quickly.

329
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:49,335
-The moment of decision.
-It passed in a blur.

330
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:50,436
Yes, it did.

331
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,573
<i>Ji Yeeun, you must now choose one</i>
<i>of the two dates.</i>

332
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,676
<i>Please get up and move</i>
<i>to the back of the man of your choice.</i>

333
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,178
This is nerve-racking.

334
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,247
It's really nerve-racking.

335
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,785
This is…

336
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,319
-It was fun.
-…too much.

337
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,288
-It was fun. Seriously.
-It was fun.

Did you get that from Namuwiki?

344
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:29,909
Yes, I did.

I'm a gold VIP member.

346

I can make reservations with ease.

00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:54,800
<i>Please choose in three seconds.</i>

353
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,602
<i>Three, two,</i>

354
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,304
<i>one.</i>

355
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,240
<i>The decision has been made.</i>

356
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,808
<i>Park Changsun,</i>

357
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,611
<i>Ji Yeeun chose…</i>

358
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,083
<i>Park Changsun.</i>

359
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,018
<i>Park Changsun.</i>

360
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,188
<i>Jung Jaiho is out.</i>

361
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:21,160
<i>Ji Yeeun chose Park Changsun.</i>

362
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,229
Congratulations.

363
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:24,964
Oh, my.

364
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,365
Congratulations.

365
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,100
-Congratulations.
-Again…

366
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,268
-Have a good time.
-Okay.

367
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,103
I'll root for you.

368
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,404
-Thank you.
-I'll get going now.

369
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,009
<i>When I heard that I only had 30 minutes,</i>

370
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:38,177
<i>I thought it was short.</i>

371
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,946
<i>I felt like time flew faster</i>
<i>when it actually happened.</i>

372
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:42,715
<i>And since it was a two-on-one situation,</i>

373
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,150
<i>there wasn't much I could say.</i>

374
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,919
<i>I'm disappointed about that.</i>

375
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:50,089
<i>Had I had ten more minutes,</i>

376
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:54,026
<i>I might've been able to change her mind.</i>

377
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,898
How…

378
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:01,934
Suddenly, I feel even more nervous.

379
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,673
It's just that Changsun came

380
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,009
from a faraway location.

381
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,777
He also came fully prepared.

382
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,712
He did his studies.

383
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:14,880
He's the real deal.

384
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:19,518
Seriously, he came here knowing
so much about me.

385
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,221
I was touched.

386
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,758
I felt like it'd be a shame to let him go
just after 30 minutes.

387
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,293
I wanted to talk to him more.

388
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,438
IF CHANGSUN GETS CHOSEN AGAIN,
HE'LL BECOME A ROMANTIC INTEREST

389
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:44,276
ONE WEEK LATER, ITAEWON

390
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:53,185
YEEUN IS WAITING FOR CHANGSUN

391
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,455
This place is pretty.

392
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,135
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

393
00:16:10,202 --> 00:16:12,137
<i>One-on-one date begins now!</i>

394
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,141
Hello.

395
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,244
<i>Park Changsun from</i> I'm Solo <i>has entered.</i>

396
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,848
-Hello.
-Hello.

397
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,886
He brought something today as well.

398
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,056
"CHANGSUN BROUGHT SOMETHING TODAY AS WELL"

399
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,958
He brought a cooler.

400
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,293
It'll be like a staycation.

401
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:36,528
Have you been well?

402
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,497
Yes. It has been a week.

403
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,631
-Has it been a week?
-Yes.

404
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,401
Yes.

405
00:16:47,706 --> 00:16:49,842
What's inside the cooler?

406
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,243
I'll reveal what's inside

407
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,245
after ten minutes.

408
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,280
What is it?

409
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,849
-I prepared something.
-Okay.

410
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,018
But it won't be fitting to reveal it

411
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,453
right away.

412
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,088
What could it be?

413
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,057
You've been very busy for a week.

414
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,592
I've been busy.

415
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:07,926
-Right.
-I'm leading a busy life.

416
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,094
How was Waterbomb Festival?

417
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,162
What? Waterbomb?

418
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,365
You visited Waterbomb Festival.

419
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,433
I did visit.

420
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,435
How was it? The atmosphere must've been

421
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,770
-very nice.
-Yes.

422
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,205
-It was all the rage.
-You had fun.

423
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,273
Have you been busy?

424
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,142
As for me, every day has been the same.

425
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,910
Work, go home, and exercise.

426
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,981
I lead a simple life,

427
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,316
so time passes quickly.

428
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,887
After our first meeting last week,
we're having our second meeting.

429
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,855
I was so excited…

430
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:39,358
that I couldn't sleep.

431
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,095
My face was too puffy in the morning.

432
00:17:43,162 --> 00:17:44,997
So I woke up and exercised.

433
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,999
-To remove puffiness?
-Yes, I removed puffiness.

434
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,600
I get puffy easily.

435
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,335
I get puffy easily as well.

436
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,703
-You do?
-Yes.

437
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,806
But your jawline is very sharp today.

438
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,174
You're good.

439
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:57,643
Thank you.

440
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,246
<i>Three minutes have passed.</i>

441
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,250
-Our coffee is here.
-What?

442
00:18:05,317 --> 00:18:06,518
Thank you.

443
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,020
Thank you.

444
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,922
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

445
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,423
Thank you.

446
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,791
You're well-mannered.

447
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:13,926
Gosh, it's nothing.

448
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,230
I slept here last night.

449
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,298
-Here?
-Yes.

450
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,400
-How luxurious.
-It's really nice.

451
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,501
-Is it really nice?
-Yes.

452
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,003
Isn't this place perfect for a blind date?

453
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,071
-It's pretty.
-Yes.

454
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,740
-It's so pretty outside.
-Yes.

455
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,376
-This is our second date, right?
-Yes.

456
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,045
-So I thought about it for a week.
-Okay.

457
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,683
I realized that I didn't ask
a lot of questions about yourself.

458
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,452
I was all over the place.

459
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:42,721
I only learned a few new things.

460
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,056
-I see.
-About four things.

461
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,791
You like spicy food.

462
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,993
When you're stressed out,
you go to the karaoke.

463
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,563
You enjoy quiet walks.

464
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,499
You like effortless styles.

465
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:55,400
Those were all.

466
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:57,769
Thus, today,

467
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:01,740
I want to find out
what kind of a person you are

468
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,208
through a conversation.

469
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,145
Last week, I was Namuwiki.

470
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:08,013
Today, I'll be Changsunwiki.

471
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,081
-Chang…
-Yes.

472
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,382
I'll be Changsunwiki.

473
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:11,950
Okay. That sounds good.

474
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,018
Yes.

475
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:16,588
Do you prefer the sea or the mountains?

476
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:17,756
I prefer the sea.

477
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:18,857
-Do you like the sea?
-Yes.

478
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,193
Thank goodness

479
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,394
that you like the sea.

480
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,231
Have you been to Busan?

481
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:27,866
Only once. It was for a shoot.

482
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:28,934
It was for a shoot.

483
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,702
I haven't visited for enjoyment.

484
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,304
-You haven't visited for enjoyment.
-No.

485
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,473
There are so many places
to visit in Busan.

486
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:36,508
-Is it really nice?
-Yes.

487
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,580
There are many good restaurants
and places to check out.

488
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:42,648
I see.

489
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:55,093
If I choose you again today,
you'll be a romantic interest.

490
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,895
-I see.
-I hope

491
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:00,632
you'll survive until the end today.

492
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,401
I'll do my best.

493
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,906
What can I do
to make you become interested in me?

494
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,175
I don't know either.

495
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,443
You don't know?

496
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:16,648
There must be things men do
that make your hearts flutter.

497
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:19,484
Are there such things?

498
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,188
Right. My heart fluttered
when I watched <i>Lovely Runner</i>.

499
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:26,124
Do handsome men make your heart flutter?

500
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,660
That isn't true.
I care about a man's heart

501
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:29,761
as well as his face.

502
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,063
How do you judge a man's heart?

503
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,130
-His heart?
-Yes.

504
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:34,600
I like someone who radiates kindness.

505
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,201
You radiate kindness too.

506
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:37,869
So my heart has been accepted.

507
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,271
Now, my face needs to be accepted.

508
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,573
-I don't know about your heart either.
-Okay.

509
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,142
-We only met briefly last week…
-Right.

510
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:45,277
…so I can't be sure.

511
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,378
You're right.

512
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,713
-After I get to know you better today…
-Okay.

513
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,848
…I might choose you again.

514
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,084
-I might not.
-You might not.

515
00:20:53,151 --> 00:20:54,519
-Okay.
-Please don't feel hurt.

516
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,255
It's okay. I'm always mentally prepared.

517
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,290
-A woman's heart is a fickle thing.
-Right.

518
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,426
I'll work hard
so that I can win your heart.

519
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,428
It won't be easy to win my heart.

520
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,298
It won't be easy,

521
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,834
-but I'll make an effort.
-I'm a difficult woman.

522
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,269
Then it'll be more rewarding.

523
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,471
-You're right. It'll be more rewarding.
-Yes.

524
00:21:12,537 --> 00:21:15,240
I thought about how
I could express my feelings well.

525
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,309
While words are important,

526
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,877
I decided to use actions

527
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,146
and other various means.

528
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,282
Thus…

529
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,783
Oh, my.

530
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,885
I prepared something.

531
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,854
"I PREPARED SOMETHING"

532
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,222
Will you open the cooler?

533
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,525
Firstly…

534
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:35,560
"WHAT DOES CHANGSUN HAVE IN THE COOLER?"

535
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,131
I decided to make you a milkshake.

536
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:41,199
-My goodness.
-I'll do it on the spot.

537
00:21:41,266 --> 00:21:42,668
Is this a milkshake?

538
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:43,735
Yes.

539
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,304
If you look over here…

540
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,773
The words aren't very visible
since they're white.

541
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:49,841
Oh, my!

542
00:21:50,242 --> 00:21:51,243
Oh, my!

543
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,845
-"Ji Yeeun, let's go even higher."
-Yes.

544
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:55,080
"JI YEEUN, LET'S GO EVEN HIGHER"

545
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,248
This is incredible.

546
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:57,716
I'm so touched.

547
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,187
-I'll make it for you.
-Seriously.

548
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,322
It's very simple.

549
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,091
Still, you prepared everything.

550
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,659
You put so much care into it.

551
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,063
There's milk too.

552
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:12,197
It's top-quality milk.

553
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:14,132
-It's premium milk.
-That's right.

554
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,168
I got the best ingredients.
It's Häagen-Dazs.

555
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:17,803
-Häagen-Dazs.
-Yes.

556
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:18,937
I got the best ingredients.

557
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:20,772
You got expensive ingredients.

558
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,841
I prepared the top-quality ingredients.

559
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:25,944
Seriously, your attention to detail
is incredible.

560
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:27,813
Physical health.

561
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,147
-Physical health.
-Mental health.

562
00:22:29,214 --> 00:22:30,248
Replenishing sugar.

563
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:32,351
Yes. Please take good care
of those things…

564
00:22:32,417 --> 00:22:35,287
-This is incredible.
-…so that you can go even higher in life.

565
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,255
-That was why I prepared it.
-I'm so touched.

566
00:22:37,322 --> 00:22:38,657
I'm so touched.

567
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:40,826
Thank you.

568
00:22:40,892 --> 00:22:42,294
Now, I'll make it.

569
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,196
Oh, my.

570
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:45,263
Oh, my.

571
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,999
You'll become very popular among women.

572
00:22:48,066 --> 00:22:49,701
-I…
-I'm sure you're already popular.

573
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,370
I don't care for such popularity.

574
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:53,171
What I care for is winning your heart.

575
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,241
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

576
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,976
What's wrong with you? Seriously.

577
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,878
What's important is one woman's heart.

578
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:05,650
-Three minutes remain.
-My goodness.

579
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,752
Three minutes remain.

580

581
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,590
All right. I'll blend the ingredients.

-You even prepared a pretty straw.
-Yes.

592
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:51,997

exactly like the one in your album art.

593
