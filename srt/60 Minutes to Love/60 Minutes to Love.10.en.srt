How am I in real life?

6
00:00:15,058 --> 00:00:16,893
You're much prettier in real life.

I thought that meeting you in person
would be a reward enough.

14
00:00:30,373 --> 00:00:31,474
-Really?
-Yes.

00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,906
What? What was that?

39
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,609
The same city. Our hometown is the same.

40
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:41,244
-Yes.
-Do you know each other?

41
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,311
-Yes.
-We know each other.

42
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:44,013
-We go to the same gym.
-Yes.

43
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:47,016
-So you didn't know that he'd be here?
-No, I didn't.

44
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:48,818
No.

45
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,656
How should I address you?

00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,825

Right now…

51
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,504
You're actually shaking.

52
00:02:09,472 --> 00:02:10,773
-You must be really nervous.
-A bit.

53
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,842
I'm nervous since this is
my first blind date ever.

54
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:16,112
I'm…

55
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,314
Modern Tarzan.

56
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:20,183
My real name is Suk Hyunjun.

57
00:02:20,249 --> 00:02:21,684
-Modern Tarzan?
-That's right.

58
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:24,220
Modern Tarzan is my nickname.

59
00:02:25,888 --> 00:02:28,591
My real name is Suk Hyunjun.

60
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:30,793
Why is your nickname Modern Tarzan?

61
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:34,564
After getting discharged from the army,
I went to Australia for a working holiday.

62
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,799
I lived in the countryside.

63
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:40,770
Since it was hot every day of the year,
I kept my top off.

64
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:43,706
So, my friends started calling me Tarzan.

65
00:02:43,773 --> 00:02:45,241
That was how I got my nickname.

66
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:46,976
Did you have long hair back then?

67
00:02:47,043 --> 00:02:49,145
I've had long hair since then.

68
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,747
I began growing out my hair

69
00:02:51,814 --> 00:02:56,252
because getting a haircut
cost around 35,000 won there.

70
00:02:56,852 --> 00:02:58,254
What's your job in the industry?

71
00:02:58,854 --> 00:03:00,323
Me?

72
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:01,390
Me?

73
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,694
Back in Australia,

74
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,162
when I was studying abroad,

75
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:08,331
I wanted to run a YouTu** channel
and make some money.

76
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:10,733
-Are you a content creator?
-I began as a content creator.

77
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,101
I run a YouTu** channel.

78
00:03:12,168 --> 00:03:13,769
How big is your channel?

79
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,172
Is that important?

80
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,373
Is that important?

81
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:22,578
Will you pick me for Round Two
if I have one million subscribers?

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,017
Will you ditch me if the number is less
than 200,000 or 100,000?

83
00:03:28,084 --> 00:03:29,151
Will you ask me to leave?

84
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,657
I'm on YouTu** all the time.

85
00:03:34,724 --> 00:03:37,660
I only watch the videos
that are related to me.

86
00:03:37,727 --> 00:03:38,728
Right.

87
00:03:40,096 --> 00:03:42,331
I bet I haven't watched yours.
I'll watch them today.

88
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:43,799
So, how big is your channel?

89
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:47,703
I have about 1.18 million subscribers.

90
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,005
"HE HAS ABOUT 1.18M SUBSCRIBERS"

91
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,508
That's a lot!

92
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,445
Does that make me more attractive?

93
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:57,913
Yes.

94
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,483
I lied. The number is 180,000.

95
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:01,851
I lied. The number is 180,000.

96
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:07,056
Your face suddenly fell.

97
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:08,691
No.

98
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:13,029
It's really hard to get
180,000 subscribers.

99
00:04:14,764 --> 00:04:19,335
I came to this blind date to find love.

100
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:24,674
I want a woman…

101
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,908
who is wise,

102
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,110
upright,

103
00:04:29,578 --> 00:04:31,113
and funny at times.

104
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,349
That's my ideal type.

105
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:34,884
-And Yeeun,
-Yes?

106
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:36,919
you're that kind of woman.

107
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:46,729
This is the first blind date

108
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:48,898
in my life.

109
00:04:49,565 --> 00:04:51,767
I couldn't come empty-handed,
so I brought a present.

110
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:53,936
"HYUNJUN PREPARED
A PRESENT FOR YEEUN"

111
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,541
I brought this.

112
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,576
It's…

113
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,680
a special present.

114
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:10,486
-Here you go. Please open it.
-I'll open it.

115
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:13,589
What's this?

116
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:15,825
What's this?

117
00:05:15,891 --> 00:05:18,327
-What's this?
-Let me tell you what it is.

118
00:05:18,394 --> 00:05:19,428
Is it a neck massager?

119
00:05:19,495 --> 00:05:20,830
-Do you use it lying down?
-I'm…

120
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:26,001
friends with a singer and an athlete,
Kim Jongkook.

121
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:27,636
Jongkook.

122
00:05:29,939 --> 00:05:31,974
I told him about a blind date with you.

123
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,376
Really?

124
00:05:33,442 --> 00:05:34,910
When I asked for his advice,

125
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,480
he said that you had forward head posture.

126
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:42,518
I was told that you'd like it a lot.

127
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,320
Forward head posture!

128
00:05:49,125 --> 00:05:51,560
That was why I brought it.

129
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:52,928
How do you use it?

130
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:55,564
It's very nice. I…

131
00:05:56,532 --> 00:05:58,067
I tested it ahead of time.

132
00:05:58,134 --> 00:05:59,101
Did you test it?

133
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:02,104
It's very nice.
I used it for about five days.

134
00:06:02,171 --> 00:06:03,472
Does that mean it's used?

135
00:06:05,307 --> 00:06:07,443
I checked it first
so that you wouldn't get injured.

136
00:06:08,077 --> 00:06:09,445
But it's a present.

137
00:06:10,546 --> 00:06:11,781
Like this.

138
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:12,948
Does it go under the butt?

139
00:06:13,015 --> 00:06:15,017
-The back. When your back hurts,
-The back.

140
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,319
lie down like this. When my back hurts…

141
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,322
The piece for the neck hurts a bit.

142
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,891
If you lie down like this…

143
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:24,360
Would you align it?

144
00:06:28,397 --> 00:06:29,732
I don't think I can do that.

145
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:32,768
In any case…

146
00:06:34,236 --> 00:06:35,504
-Are you using it right?
-Do this…

147
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:38,140
-to straighten out your entire body.
-Really?

148
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:40,509
Thank you. It's an item I really need.

149
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:42,945
-Use it.
-Will it fix my forward head posture?

150
00:06:43,012 --> 00:06:44,647
-That's right.
-I'll take it for real.

151
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:45,815
Thank you.

152
00:06:49,385 --> 00:06:51,854
How many blind dates have you been on?

153
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:53,956
I had my first one through this show.

154
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:55,191
-Really?
-Yes.

155
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:57,293
I don't really like
getting set up on a date.

156
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,295
I also prefer a natural, unforced meeting.

157
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,030
Natural meeting?

158
00:07:01,096 --> 00:07:02,765
-Meeting someone naturally.
-That's right.

159
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:05,000
Meeting someone naturally.

160
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,470
-There's something I really want to know.
-Okay.

161
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:11,740
Women don't really like
my sense of fashion.

162
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,876
Is it so bad?

163
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,783
I mean, I'm sure some people…

164
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,951
Do you want to take a look?

165
00:07:25,754 --> 00:07:26,755
Is it bad?

166
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,592
I'm sure a select few will be fans.

167
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,498
Would you dress that way

168
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:37,066
to an actual blind date?

169
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:39,702
Is my outfit bad?

170
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:46,408
-Before I start dating a woman,
-Okay.

171
00:07:46,475 --> 00:07:48,110
I want to show her who I am.

172
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:49,578
-So…
-I don't want to be fake

173
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:51,981
with my fashion or my hairstyle.

174
00:07:52,047 --> 00:07:54,183
-Right.
-I want to show her who I am first.

175
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,518
When things go well between us…

176
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,187
"Tarzan,

177
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:01,724
wear a dress shirt today."
Then I'll wear a dress shirt.

178
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,526
-You have a distinct style.
-He does.

179
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,094
-Totally.
-It's distinct, but…

180
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,495
Which style do you prefer in men?

181
00:08:06,562 --> 00:08:09,098
I like an effortlessly chic style.

182
00:08:09,164 --> 00:08:10,833
-Effortlessly chic style?
-Yes, an effortlessly chic style.

183
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,501
Stylish without looking like
you tried too hard.

184
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:15,037
Something like a T-shirt and jeans.

185
00:08:15,104 --> 00:08:17,072
-I'm wearing jeans.
-I like simple outfits.

186
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm wearing jeans.

187
00:08:19,475 --> 00:08:20,476
They're skinny jeans.

188
00:08:21,944 --> 00:08:24,380
-Natural-looking jeans, not skinny jeans.
-Yes. Skinny jeans…

189
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:26,815
You're wearing a T-shirt and jeans.

190
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:31,620
You should try a different style.

191
00:08:31,687 --> 00:08:33,355
Seriously…

192
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:43,766
Every time you lift your arms…

193
00:08:47,169 --> 00:08:49,338
I don't know where to look.

194
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:50,973
Really?

195
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:54,944
I mean…

196
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:58,514
I trimmed my armpit hair
with a trimmer yesterday.

197
00:08:58,581 --> 00:08:59,582
Really?

198
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:00,783
-Yes.
-There's still hair.

199
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:02,117
That's…

200
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:03,519
You know,

201
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,955
that's a part of my style.

202
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,356
-A part of my style.
-Your style.

203
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:11,060
It looks strange
if I shave off my armpit hair completely,

204
00:09:11,126 --> 00:09:12,261
so I leave some behind.

205
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:13,495
You go for the natural look.

206
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,197
Isn't that an effortlessly chic style?

207
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,600
That's an effortlessly chic style.

208
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:19,001
That's an effortlessly chic style.

209
00:09:19,068 --> 00:09:20,970
That's an effortlessly chic style. Yeeun.

210
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:23,606
He uses his shaving skills
for an effortlessly chic style.

211
00:09:23,672 --> 00:09:24,974
Yeeun, you're difficult to please.

212
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,575
Are you from Seoul?

213
00:09:26,642 --> 00:09:28,877
Why do you think people from Seoul
are difficult to please?

214
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,079
I'm from Seoul,

215
00:09:30,145 --> 00:09:32,915
but I'm not difficult to please.
There's just a style I like.

216
00:09:32,982 --> 00:09:35,417
-I'm here on a blind date too.
-You're right.

217
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,019
-I…
-You're right.

218
00:09:37,086 --> 00:09:38,921
Yeeun, seriously…

219
00:09:39,922 --> 00:09:41,457
You're cute when you get angry.

220
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,364
What am I supposed to do
when you scream like that?

221
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,103
I'm trying to charm you.

222
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,674
What were you guys talking about?

223
00:09:58,741 --> 00:10:01,777
You were repeating the things
we've done already,

224
00:10:01,844 --> 00:10:03,345
so I was watching.

225
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:04,580
-You were watching.
-Yes.

226
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,315
-We had some time to talk.
-Yes.

227
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,292
This is my cherished pinky ring.

228
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,362
Why don't you try it on?

229
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,132
If the ring fits, it means…

230
00:10:23,632 --> 00:10:24,867
-You know what they say.
-Then…

231
00:10:24,933 --> 00:10:26,568
If the ring fits, it means…

232
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,703
We'll get married?

233
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,972
-We're a fated pair?
-I don't know about that.

234
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,373
If it fits on your fourth finger,

235
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:33,942
-it'll seal the deal.
-Really?

236
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,310
Really?

237
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:36,445
I'll try it on.

238
00:10:39,214 --> 00:10:40,783
If this ring fits,

239
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:42,418
it'll seal the deal.

240
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:44,086
Will you be okay with that?

241
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:45,888
Will you be okay with that, Yeeun?

242
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:47,389
Okay.

243
00:10:47,456 --> 00:10:49,124
-I'm nervous.
-I'm also nervous…

244
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,560
-I'm nervous.
-I'm also nervous for no reason.

245
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:54,296
If it really fits,
I don't know what will become of us.

246
00:10:56,265 --> 00:10:57,433
-I'm scared.
-The left hand.

247
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,469
-The left hand.
-The left hand.

248
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:01,804
The left hand.

249
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:10,779
-It isn't going in.
-Hold on.

250
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:12,481
Hold on.

251
00:11:18,554 --> 00:11:19,988
-For real?
-It really isn't going in.

252
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,858
-Give me your hand for a second.
-It really isn't going in.

253
00:11:22,925 --> 00:11:23,926
Let me see your hand.

254
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,361
Give me your hand for a second.

255
00:11:26,428 --> 00:11:28,664
Let me see your hand.

256
00:11:29,698 --> 00:11:31,100
-I'm serious.
-Let me see your hand.

257
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,468
I think she's rejecting the ring.

258
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:34,570
It looks really good on you.

259
00:11:35,637 --> 00:11:37,139
I can't take it out.

260
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,843
I guess we aren't meant to be.

261
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:43,545
"FLUSTERED"

262
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:45,848
-We aren't…
-I was so sure that it'd fit.

263
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,250
We aren't meant to be.

264
00:11:48,317 --> 00:11:49,818
-It definitely fit.
-No.

265
00:11:49,885 --> 00:11:52,321
Can you see how red my finger is?

266
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:55,290
It doesn't fit.

267
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,261
What do you call it?
Can we check the surveillance camera?

268
00:12:01,296 --> 00:12:02,664
Is there VAR?

269
00:12:05,701 --> 00:12:07,636
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

270
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:09,805
I prepared a special skill.

271
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,575
My friends told me to prepare
some special skills

272
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,210
for a blind date, so…

273
00:12:15,811 --> 00:12:18,580
-Who does that for a blind date?
-I need to charm my date.

274
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:22,317
To entertain and charm my date,

275
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:23,585
I prepared some special skills.

276
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:28,757
There's a variety.

277
00:12:28,824 --> 00:12:31,560
-Show me.
-I don't know which one to show first.

278
00:12:37,866 --> 00:12:39,268
I'll play the ocarina.

279
00:12:39,334 --> 00:12:40,302
Ocarina?

280
00:12:42,437 --> 00:12:44,139
I began playing the ocarina when…

281
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:47,976
I was in elementary school
when my mom went,

282
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:50,546
"Hyunjun, you should know
how to play a musical instrument."

283
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:54,750
To show you that I can play
a musical instrument,

284
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,519
-I'll play the ocarina.
-Okay.

285
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,155
I practiced all night yesterday.

286
00:13:07,362 --> 00:13:08,530
What?

287
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,666
HE WROTE THE NOTES ON THE PAPER

288
00:13:12,868 --> 00:13:15,103
"NERVOUS"

289
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:19,608
-I haven't seen an ocarina in a while.
-I know. I haven't seen one in a while.

290
00:13:41,763 --> 00:13:43,999
-Please hold on.
-Which song are you playing?

291
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,534
"Milk Shake."

292
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:48,570
You didn't notice?

293
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:52,307
Please hold on.

294
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,443
"HE CONTINUES TO
PLAY THE OCARINA"

295
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,448
<i>Like a balloon on a summer day</i>

296
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,151
<i>I fly up into the sky</i>

297
00:14:04,253 --> 00:14:07,623
<i>I'm happy when I have you</i>

298
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:10,259
<i>Milkshake</i>

299
00:14:11,526 --> 00:14:12,861
A round of applause.

300
00:14:15,197 --> 00:14:16,198
That was funny.

301
00:14:16,265 --> 00:14:18,100
I'm touched that you played "Milk Shake."

302
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,568
-Really?
-Yes.

303
00:14:23,972 --> 00:14:25,941
I'll perform a monologue.

304
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:29,878
"DID HYUNJUN PREPARE TO PERFORM
A MONOLOGUE?"

305
00:14:30,445 --> 00:14:32,014
-Okay.
-I'll do it when two minutes remain.

306
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:37,386
"HYUNJUN'S MONOLOGUE IS
COMING SOON."

307
00:14:37,452 --> 00:14:42,024
Now, I'm training to become an actor.

308
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,893
In a sense, you're my senior.

309
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,961
I'm your senior.

310
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,897
I went
to Korea National University of Arts.

311
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:52,334
Would you give me feedback?

312
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,902
That sounds great. That's a great idea.

313
00:14:54,469 --> 00:14:56,405
<i>Two minutes remain.</i>

314
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:59,341
-Two minutes remain. Do it now.
-Two minutes. All right.

315
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:01,209
-Do it now.
-Two minutes. All right.

316
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,912
-Two minutes. Hold on.
-Hurry up and perform a monologue.

317
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,353
Hold on.

318
00:15:14,056 --> 00:15:15,123
I'm excited about this.

319
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,138
I like you.

320
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:34,943
I like you mighty.

321
00:15:38,213 --> 00:15:39,748
I've watched you on <i>SNL</i>

322
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:44,419
since your swearing days.

323
00:15:50,359 --> 00:15:52,794
I remember when you played Flower Pot.

324
00:15:55,597 --> 00:15:57,165
Still, I'm attracted to you.

325
00:16:01,803 --> 00:16:03,839
I've made it pretty obvious since then.

326
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,640
I like you.

327
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,511
I want you to like me.

328
00:16:19,154 --> 00:16:20,555
Is it that awful?

329
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:24,459
Do you hate it that much?

330
00:16:26,261 --> 00:16:28,430
I don't think I deserve such a reaction.

331
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:36,138
Women have been startled by my fashion,

332
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,939
but they've never been grossed out…

333
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,176
by every word I said.

334
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:44,312
I could really feel your sincerity.

335
00:16:44,913 --> 00:16:46,615
I didn't know how to react.

336
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,483
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,787

<i>Gentlemen, please get up from your seats.</i>

Seriously, am I really that bad?

343
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:10,705
That was funny.

344
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,679
I'm serious when I say
that you're much prettier in real life.

345
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,182
Your face is so small.

346
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,616
…your skin is flawless.

"THE HONEST AND MANLY MAN,

351

Yes. Living in Seoul made me feel lonely.

392
00:19:25,273 --> 00:19:27,742
And I'm curious about women
from Seoul, to be honest.

393
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:32,681
I'm curious about you.

394
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:40,689
I thought it was a facial mist.

I stayed up all night yesterday
for preparations.

399
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,169
Today, I even went to a sauna…

400
00:19:55,203 --> 00:19:56,571
-to get rid of puffiness.
-Really?

401
00:19:56,638 --> 00:19:58,907
I did five sets of hot tub and cold tub.

402
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,342
All that for a good impression.

403
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,211

-Right.

00:20:07,015 --> 00:20:08,783
from Gyeongsan.

407
00:20:09,351 --> 00:20:12,320
I received it the day before yesterday.
I listened to "Milk Shake" last night.

408
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:16,625
There wasn't a music sheet
for the 12-hole ocarina

409
00:20:16,691 --> 00:20:17,726
since the octave was too high.

410
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:19,828
-I moved the notes down an octave
-Really?

411
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,196
and adjusted them.

412
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,031
-I wrote them on paper.
-Thank you so much.

-Really?

415
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,875
Do you prefer a pale man

416
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,211
or a tanned man?

417
00:20:36,811 --> 00:20:38,647
I don't care about that.

418
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:41,049
-You don't care?
-No.

00:20:51,226 --> 00:20:53,228

00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,796
I'll do this from now on.

421
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:58,633
Your armpit hair is thick
like a mechanical pencil lead.

422
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:04,472
You saw it correctly.

423
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,743

424
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:10,278

425
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,281

-Yes.

426
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:14,883
-Please tie your hair then.
-Okay.

427
00:21:15,383 --> 00:21:16,751
-My hair.
-You have a hair tie.

428
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,087

429
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,889
My hair…

430
00:21:23,758 --> 00:21:25,827
-Should I turn around and do it?
-No.

431
00:21:25,894 --> 00:21:27,829
-I'll cover them like this.
-For a second…

432
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:29,764
-I'll cover them like this.
-Okay.

433
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,201
My hair…

434
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,309
You shaved the sides.

435
00:21:41,376 --> 00:21:43,812
-That's right.
-I thought you had hair there.

436
00:21:43,878 --> 00:21:45,947
You shaved the sides.
I guess it keeps you cool.

437
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:48,583
When you tie your hair like that,

438
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,785
-you look different.
-Really?

439
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:51,986
Yes.

-I couldn't tell you earlier. Your outfit…
-Okay.

443
00:22:03,898 --> 00:22:05,100
Is it cute?

444
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:07,268
Yes, it's cute.

445
00:22:09,104 --> 00:22:10,672

446
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:11,740
Yes.

448
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:15,844
I like women who resemble my mom.

449
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,978
She's my ideal type.

450
00:22:19,514 --> 00:22:21,249
-My mom is…
-Okay.

451
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:22,617
…very wise.

452
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:26,988
Since I'm very spontaneous,

453
00:22:27,622 --> 00:22:30,892
I want a woman
who grounds me and leads me.

454
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:33,495
I like it when such a woman
tells me what to do.

455
00:22:34,195 --> 00:22:35,864
That's the kind of woman I like.

456
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:39,467
Did you tell your mom about
the blind date?

457
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,302
-Yes, I did.
-What did she say?

458
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:44,439
My mom doesn't like it
when I use the Daegu dialect.

459
00:22:44,506 --> 00:22:45,907
But…

460
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,308
I can't converse in the Seoul dialect.

461
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,010
-So…
-Really? Why don't you try it?

462
00:22:49,644 --> 00:22:51,146
Hey, I'm better at it now.

463
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,915
Why are you talking casually?

464
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:56,918
I'm better at it now.

465
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:58,953
Yes.

466
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,089
Hey, will you choose me?

467
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:03,091
Why are you talking casually?

468
00:23:03,158 --> 00:23:05,326
Why do you do that
when you use the Seoul dialect?

469
00:23:05,393 --> 00:23:06,528
I picked up a bad habit.

470
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:07,695

471
00:23:08,363 --> 00:23:09,964

472
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,669
Can you act using the Seoul dialect?

473
00:23:15,336 --> 00:23:16,838
I'm trying hard to do that.

474
00:23:16,905 --> 00:23:18,840
Can you perform the monologue from earlier

475
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:20,074
using the Seoul dialect?

476
00:23:21,876 --> 00:23:23,077
I like you.

477
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,881
I like you mighty.

478
00:23:29,884 --> 00:23:31,753
"Mighty" isn't…

479
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,857
Why do you want to be an actor?

480
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:37,559
-Me?
-Yes.

481
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,028

482
