I came to this blind date to find love.

5
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:18,828
My friends told me to prepare
some special skills for a blind date…

6
00:00:18,895 --> 00:00:20,029
Who does that for a blind date?

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:28,604

I thought you had hair there.

15
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:45,988
You shaved the sides.
I guess it keeps you cool.

16
00:00:46,055 --> 00:00:48,624
…you look different.

17
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:50,226
You look really nice today.

18
00:00:50,293 --> 00:00:51,527
Is it cute?

19
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:52,829
Yes, it's cute.

It's a four-syllable name.

46
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:12,708

00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:29,192
-Really?
-Yes. The year of the pig.

54
00:02:29,258 --> 00:02:30,927

-Thank you.
-I was born on July 26.

61
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,207
I already know that. Yes.

62
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,944
Other dates must've asked you that a lot.

63
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:51,914
-Your blood type is A, right?
-Yes.

64
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,483
I know your MBTI as well. It's ISFP.

65
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:55,885
It's ISFP.

66
00:03:00,656 --> 00:03:01,991
Didn't you look it up?

67
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:12,735
-What do you do for a living?
-I'm self-employed.

68
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:15,004
I'm in the food service industry.

69
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,139
I run brands in the food service industry

70
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:18,674
and do distributions as well.

71
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:21,244
I do various things.
Do you like gourmet food?

72
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,813
-I'm not a gourmet, but I enjoy eating.
-You enjoy eating.

73
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,682
-Tasty food.
-I'm guessing

74
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,784
-that you don't usually cook at home.
-That's right.

75
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:31,187
-I order deliveries.
-What do you usually order?

76
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,555
Hot pot!

77
00:03:32,622 --> 00:03:34,323
-I can't order a hot pot.
-Hot pot?

78
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:36,859
-Hot pot…
-Do you like hot pot?

79
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:39,128
I run a shabu-shabu restaurant.

80
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:40,596
Shabu-shabu…

81
00:03:40,663 --> 00:03:42,698
-Shabu-shabu…
-Game over.

82
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,567
I really like shabu-shabu too.

83
00:03:44,634 --> 00:03:46,335
You should try it out when you have time.

84
00:03:46,402 --> 00:03:47,803
-I really want to.
-Okay.

85
00:03:49,672 --> 00:03:50,673
I shouldn't have asked.

86
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,776
Have you had multiple blind dates here?

87
00:03:53,843 --> 00:03:56,112
Yes, I've had multiple blind dates here.

88
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:57,647
-In one day, right?
-Yes.

89
00:03:57,713 --> 00:03:59,248
You must be exhausted.

90
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:01,384
The dates were fun, not exhausting.

91
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,188
We had fun for an hour.

92
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:09,725
It's okay. The dates are fun.

93
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,926
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

94
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:15,264
-Have you been with her for an hour?
-Yes.

95
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:16,532
Yes.

96
00:04:17,733 --> 00:04:19,168
We became close.

97
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,538
Thanks for coming to the blind date today.

98
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,207
Don't mention it. I'm a big fan of yours.

99
00:04:25,274 --> 00:04:26,442
"I'M A BIG FAN OF YOURS"

100
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:27,777
I wanted to see you in real life.

101
00:04:27,843 --> 00:04:29,645
-Really?
-Yes.

102
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:34,350
It's an honor to see you in real life.

103
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,352
-Really?
-Yes, of course.

104
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:38,087
So…

105
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:40,656
How am I in real life?

106
00:04:40,723 --> 00:04:42,191
I saw you when I walked in.

107
00:04:43,693 --> 00:04:47,630
Compared to how you were
on comedy shows and variety shows,

108
00:04:48,497 --> 00:04:50,066
you look much prettier.

109
00:04:51,734 --> 00:04:52,735
Thank you.

110
00:04:58,641 --> 00:04:59,675
You're very sweet.

111
00:04:59,742 --> 00:05:00,810
-What?
-You're very sweet.

112
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,144
-Really?
-Yes.

113
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,646
Yes.

114
00:05:03,713 --> 00:05:05,715
I can't believe you guys are the same age.

115
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:07,616
"I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU GUYS ARE THE SAME AGE"

116
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:10,286
What's your ideal type?

117
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,588
-My ideal type?
-Yes.

118
00:05:12,655 --> 00:05:14,657
Someone with common interests.

119
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:16,759
-That's important.
-Someone grounded.

120
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:19,128
-That's important.
-I think I'm done

121
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:21,731
with stormy relationships
that bring a dopamine rush.

122
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:23,799
I want a long-lasting relationship

123
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,202
-that keeps me grounded.
-You want someone grounded.

124
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:28,604
I'm trying hard to get into a relationship
these days.

125
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:30,039
When was your last relationship?

126
00:05:30,106 --> 00:05:32,041
It was about two years ago.

127
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:35,077
I've put in a lot of effort since then.

128
00:05:35,144 --> 00:05:37,513
I've gone on multiple blind dates.

129
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,081
Have you been on many blind dates?

130
00:05:39,148 --> 00:05:40,683
I have during my hiatus.

131
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,853
If there was someone I liked,

132
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,088
I approached her first
and attempted to start something.

133
00:05:46,155 --> 00:05:48,290
Did you have any luck?

134
00:05:48,357 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm here because the answer is no.

135
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:56,365
I've been feeling very lonely recently.

136
00:05:56,432 --> 00:05:57,500
Very lonely.

137
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:03,305
-I knew that you'd be my date, so…
-Right.

138
00:06:04,807 --> 00:06:06,475
I thought, "Let's do this."

139
00:06:10,112 --> 00:06:11,781
I looked up a lot of information.

140
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,749
I watched many videos.

141
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:17,386
I watched your cooking videos on YouTu**.

142
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,355
I watched many clips of <i>SNL </i>and thought

143
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:22,391
that you seemed to have a serious side

144
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:26,762
behind your bubbly and playful side.

145
00:06:26,829 --> 00:06:29,632
I came here
because I was curious about that.

146
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,674
It's nothing.

147
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:39,942
What is it?

148
00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:41,377
Are you helping me right now?

149
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:43,846
No, I'm not.

150
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:45,915
Thanks to you, Sanghoon…

151
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,851
-It's Sehoon.
-Thanks to you, Sehoon…

152
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:50,252
I'm sorry. Thanks to you, Sehoon…

153
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,790
Thanks to you, Sehoon,
I learned a lot about Yeeun.

154
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:56,759
That's nice.

155
00:07:00,896 --> 00:07:02,531
You're very fit.

156
00:07:02,598 --> 00:07:04,767
I enjoy working out.

157
00:07:04,834 --> 00:07:05,868
Do you work out?

158
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,103
I only do cardio. I run.

159
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:10,573
I mostly do cardio.

160
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,875
I don't lift weights at the gym
until I'm nearly dying.

161
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:14,677
My schedule is too packed.

162
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:16,779
I don't do it until I'm nearly dying.

163
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,750
Yeeun, do you enjoy working out?

164
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,252
Not really.

165
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:30,192
I'm sure you rest and recharge
during your free time.

166
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,396
-Do you have something like a pastime?
-A pastime?

167
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:36,232
I read the Scripture.

168
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:39,001
-The Scripture? You're Christian, right?
-Yes.

169
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:41,904
-What's your religion?
-I don't have one.

170
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:43,439
-I don't have a religion.
-Okay.

171
00:07:43,906 --> 00:07:46,242
But since I run a business,
I believe in everything.

172
00:07:46,775 --> 00:07:48,711
I pray to everything.

173
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:52,848
Sometimes, I pray to God.

174
00:07:53,315 --> 00:07:55,784
Sometimes, I pray at a Buddhist temple.

175
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,753
A prayer is a prayer.

176
00:07:59,255 --> 00:08:01,257
You seem a bit fickle.

177
00:08:01,323 --> 00:08:03,125
You seem a bit fickle.

178
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:06,028
-Fickle…
-You should pick one and stick to him.

179
00:08:10,065 --> 00:08:11,901
Since I run a business,

180
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,169
I pray to different higher powers

181
00:08:14,236 --> 00:08:15,971
because one of them might listen.

182
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:19,842
What's your religion?

183
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:24,780
I only believe in myself.

184
00:08:24,847 --> 00:08:26,248
That's cool.

185
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,587
You shouldn't put so much faith
on yourself.

186
00:08:34,323 --> 00:08:36,825
Only believing in yourself
can be disastrous.

187
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:37,893
It can be dangerous.

188
00:08:39,862 --> 00:08:40,930
I'll keep that in mind.

189
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:49,405
What did you guys talk about?

190
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,707
-This is my seventh Americano.
-Yes.

191
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:53,175
Really?

192
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,745
Isn't it your fourth Americano?

193
00:08:56,812 --> 00:09:00,849
Why are you copying me
and sticking out your pinky?

194
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,887
This is how I drink tea. It's like
that green plum drink commercial.

195
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,702
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

196
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,103
Seriously.

197
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,072
"TEN MINUTES REMAIN
OF THE TWO-ON-ONE DATE"

198
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:25,808
When were you on <i>Single's Inferno</i>?

199
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:27,142
I watched it.

200
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:29,345
I was in the first season
of <i>Single's Inferno</i>.

201
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:30,579
You have an incoming call.

202
00:09:31,614 --> 00:09:33,115
-You have an incoming call.
-I'm sorry.

203
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:35,784
-I asked him to give me a call.
-Okay.

204
00:09:36,385 --> 00:09:38,120
-I'm sorry.
-Suit yourself.

205
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,089
It's Jongkook.

206
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:43,926
-The one who's on a TV show with you?
-Yes.

207
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,395
-I see.
-I told him about today's blind date.

208
00:09:46,462 --> 00:09:47,496
Okay.

209
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:50,366
-Hello?
-<i>Okay!</i>

210
00:09:51,033 --> 00:09:53,102
-Big brother.
-<i>Where are you?</i>

211
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:57,539
I'm having a blind date with Yeeun
at a hotel.

212
00:09:58,407 --> 00:09:59,475
Jongkook!

213
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:02,244
I'm having a blind date right now.

214
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,314
-<i>I mean… With Tarzan?</i>
-Yes.

215
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:06,448
I need your help.

216
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:09,818
A handsome man has joined us.

217
00:10:09,885 --> 00:10:12,287
-<i>A man?</i>
-It's a two-on-one date.

218
00:10:12,354 --> 00:10:13,455
-<i>Really?</i>
-Yes.

219
00:10:13,522 --> 00:10:15,624
That's why I need your help.

220
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:17,292
Please put in a good word for me.

221
00:10:17,359 --> 00:10:18,961
Jongkook, but here's the thing.

222
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:20,029
<i>Go ahead.</i>

223
00:10:20,095 --> 00:10:21,630
You know about my ideal type.

224
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:23,465
"LAUGHING"

225
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:26,568
Why didn't you tell Tarzan?

226
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,237
<i>I know about your ideal type.</i>

227
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:29,338
-Okay.
-It was intentional.

228
00:10:29,405 --> 00:10:32,307
<i>But Tarzan is a fine man, okay?</i>

229
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,410
Really?

230
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:37,680
-<i>He's the nicest.</i>
-Thank you, big bro.

231
00:10:38,147 --> 00:10:39,481
<i>I can vouch for that.</i>

232
00:10:39,548 --> 00:10:41,383
-<i>He's incredibly nice.</i>
-Okay.

233
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,820
<i>He doesn't have a delinquent bone</i>
<i>in his body.</i>

234
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:47,623
But he's wearing earrings and a necklace.

235
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,559
But he's wearing earrings and a necklace.

236
00:10:53,662 --> 00:10:55,364
-He's wearing designer shoes.
-<i>Right?</i>

237
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:56,932
He has the entire look.

238
00:10:58,534 --> 00:10:59,868
He has the entire look.

239
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,571
-<i>He looks like a delinquent, right?</i>
-Yes.

240
00:11:02,638 --> 00:11:04,273
<i>He's just a bit of a moron.</i>

241
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,375
"HE'S JUST A BIT OF A MORON"

242
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:10,245
<i>He's trying to cover that up.</i>

243
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:15,184
-<i>All right.</i>
-I got the pillow for my posture.

244
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:17,986
-<i>Did you receive it?</i>
-Yes.

245
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:20,856
<i>Since your forward head posture</i>
<i>was no joke,</i>

246
00:11:20,923 --> 00:11:22,758
<i>I recommended it to Tarzan.</i>

247
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:25,127
-<i>In any case, he's a very charming man.</i>
-Okay.

248
00:11:25,194 --> 00:11:26,562
<i>Give him a shot, Yeeun.</i>

249
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:29,364
-Okay. Thank you.
-<i>I'll…</i>

250
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,267
-<i>I'll look for your actual ideal type.</i>
-Okay.

251
00:11:32,935 --> 00:11:34,837
Okay. Jongkook…

252
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:39,274
Jongkook, please find him for me.

253
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:41,844
-Big bro…
-<i>He's just someone I sent in a hurry.</i>

254
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,011
"In a hurry."

255
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:44,880
Thank you, big brother.

256
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,915
-<i>Five minutes remain.</i>
-Not much time…

257
00:11:46,982 --> 00:11:48,250
Big brother, right now…

258
00:11:50,586 --> 00:11:54,123
-<i>All right. Hurry up.</i>
-I'll hold Yeeun's hand and go to the gym.

259
00:11:54,189 --> 00:11:55,290
-<i>Okay</i>.
-Please wait.

260
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:57,092
-Thank you.
-Bye, Jongkook.

261
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,160
<i>All right.</i>

262
00:12:00,963 --> 00:12:02,564
-That was so funny.
-That was funny.

263
00:12:02,631 --> 00:12:03,799
That was funny.

264
00:12:03,866 --> 00:12:06,068
I should've prepared something like that.

265
00:12:06,135 --> 00:12:08,504
He prepared many things.

266
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,905
I prepared many things.

267
00:12:10,305 --> 00:12:12,641
-You startled me.
-Here.

268
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,710
-Take a look at this.
-What's this?

269
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,045
-A monologue.
-I prepared a monologue too.

270
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,680
"I'M HAPPY WHEN I HAVE YOU"

271
00:12:18,747 --> 00:12:19,915
He prepared…

272
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:22,885
-You prepared a monologue.
-He prepared a monologue.

273
00:12:25,254 --> 00:12:26,955
I also brought a present for Yeeun.

274
00:12:28,524 --> 00:12:30,092
It looks like an alien, but…

275
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,260
You're very thoughtful.

276
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:35,330
He did many things.

277
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,000
You must be a passionate man.

278
00:12:39,501 --> 00:12:40,936
A passionate man.

279
00:12:41,003 --> 00:12:42,938
Time definitely passes so… I see.

280
00:12:46,942 --> 00:12:50,345
Is there anything
the two of you want to say before the end?

281
00:12:50,412 --> 00:12:53,849
I have a question. Do you prefer long hair
or short hair on men?

282
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,756
-My personal preference?
-Yes. Appearance-wise.

283
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,727
Short hair.

284
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,331
I have short hair on the sides.

285
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:11,300
Where… Where do you want short hair?

286
00:13:13,702 --> 00:13:15,437
You could say that his hair is short.

287
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,706
If a man's hair is longer than mine,
it's a bit…

288
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,609
Is your hair longer than Yeeun's?

289
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:22,578
-Show him.
-I'll do that.

290
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,548
Seriously, it's charming.

291
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:27,816
-It's your trademark.
-My hair…

292
00:13:27,883 --> 00:13:28,984
-It's cool.
-My hair is a bit long.

293
00:13:29,051 --> 00:13:31,353
Seriously, it's cool.

294
00:13:31,787 --> 00:13:32,988
-I'll say a word.
-Okay.

295
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,991
Yeeun.

296
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:40,095
I want to stop drinking Americanos
with you.

297
00:13:40,896 --> 00:13:43,532
I want to go out and eat desserts
with you.

298
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,403
Stop spraying that facial mist.

299
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,442
It's moisturizing and nice.

300
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:54,543
In any case…

301
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:56,812
I want to do that with you.

302
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,146
Okay.

303
00:13:59,014 --> 00:14:00,082
Then…

304
00:14:00,782 --> 00:14:02,084
I'll be completely honest.

305
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:06,521
I think it'll be nice
for us to meet up by ourselves

306
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:09,424
and converse in a relaxed setting
like friends.

307
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:14,329
You seem to have
many more unexpected facets.

308
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,698
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>
-I'd like…

309
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:19,067
-<i>Five, four…</i>
-…to see them.

310
00:14:19,134 --> 00:14:22,271
-<i>…three, two, one.</i>
-Yes.

311
00:14:22,337 --> 00:14:23,805
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

312
00:14:25,874 --> 00:14:30,212
<i>Yeeun, you must now choose one</i>
<i>of the two dates.</i>

313
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:32,881
<i>Gentlemen, please get up from your seats</i>

314
00:14:32,948 --> 00:14:35,183
<i>and close your eyes.</i>

315
00:14:38,654 --> 00:14:41,556
<i>Yeeun, please stand</i>
<i>between the two gentlemen.</i>

316
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:52,200
The dates were fun, not exhausting.

317
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:54,803
"MODERN TARZAN WITH ROUGH CHARMS,
SUK HYUNJUN"

318
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,138
We had fun for an hour.

319
00:14:57,506 --> 00:15:01,510
I want to go out and eat desserts
with you.

320
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:10,786
You must be exhausted.

321
00:15:10,852 --> 00:15:12,154
It's okay. The dates are fun.

322
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,722
-Is it okay?
-Yes.

323
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,223
I wanted to see you in real life.

324
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,825
-Really?
-Yes.

325
00:15:16,892 --> 00:15:18,727
It's an honor to see you in real life.

326
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:20,429
-Really?
-Yes, of course.

327
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,836
<i>Now, please put a lei</i>
<i>around the neck of the man</i>

328
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:30,772

<i>one.</i>

335
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,727
<i>Moon Sehoon.</i>

<i>Yeeun chose Suk Hyunjun.</i>

"MOON SEHOON IS OUT"

340
00:16:00,035 --> 00:16:01,370
Thank you.

341
00:16:01,436 --> 00:16:03,338
-I'll visit your restaurant.
-Thank you. Okay.

342
00:16:04,773 --> 00:16:08,510
<i>Failing to appeal to Yeeun</i>
<i>isn't upsetting,</i>

343
00:16:08,577 --> 00:16:11,179
<i>but losing to Suk Hyunjun is a bit…</i>

344
00:16:11,246 --> 00:16:12,981
<i>I'm not very happy about that.</i>

345
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,019
I got it again.

346
00:16:20,222 --> 00:16:21,223
Thank you.

347
00:16:23,392 --> 00:16:24,426
Tarzan.

348
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,728
He comes off as strong.

349
00:16:27,262 --> 00:16:30,198
But when you have
a deep conversation with him,

350
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:31,266
he's pure.

351
00:16:33,068 --> 00:16:36,972
"SUK HYUNJUN, TWO WINS"

352
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,474
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

353
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,910
<i>One-on-one date begins now!</i>

354
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:46,715
We've spent about one and a half hours
getting to know each other.

355
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:51,586
I think it's long in some ways
and short in other ways.

356
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:56,024
I'm curious about
your first impression of me.

357
00:16:56,091 --> 00:16:57,092
First impression?

358
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,160
-Yes.
-A bit like…

359
00:17:01,463 --> 00:17:02,464
Tarzan.

360
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:06,034
Literally. It's the perfect nickname.
Tarzan.

361
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:08,403
-Really?
-Yes. You really resemble Tarzan.

362
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:11,973
Tarzan.

363
00:17:18,814 --> 00:17:21,483
How about after conversing with me
for an hour and a half?

364
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:24,820
You're funny.

365
00:17:25,654 --> 00:17:27,089
-You're funny.
-Funny?

366
00:17:27,155 --> 00:17:29,925
Yes. I think you're funny.

367
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:37,566
I'm not exactly your ideal type
if you could be completely honest, right?

368
00:17:37,632 --> 00:17:39,134
-My ideal type? Not at all.
-Yes.

369
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:43,839
I could sense it.

370
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:53,849
Why do you think I chose you?

371
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:58,687
The two of us seem to be
completely different, but…

372
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:02,924
we can relax and
have fun around each other.

373
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,128
You're right.

374
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:07,496
I feel the same way about you.

375
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:09,898
You're totally right.

376
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,466
I can relax and have fun around you.

377
00:18:11,533 --> 00:18:12,601
Exactly.

378
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,141
-I'll show you something funny.
-Okay.

379
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,176
I have a talent.

380
00:18:21,977 --> 00:18:23,678
-You've prepared many special skills.
-I have a special skill.

381
00:18:27,883 --> 00:18:29,251
I brought a coin.

382
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:33,955
I'll move the coin between my hands.

383
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:35,991
-Should I guess where it is?
-Guess left or right.

384
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,095
It appears simple, but it's hard.

385
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,530
Okay. I'll give it a go.

386
00:18:43,198 --> 00:18:46,668
-If you fail to guess where the coin is…
-Okay.

387
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:51,039
Would you like to
get to know each other more?

388
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,745
I'll give it a go.

389
00:18:57,879 --> 00:18:59,948
-I won't play around.
-Okay.

390
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:08,957
It's hard.

391
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:11,293
You know the penalty.
We have to get to know each other more.

392
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:12,394
This one.

393
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,595
This one.

394
00:19:14,563 --> 00:19:16,131
"SHE CHOSE THE LEFT HAND"

395
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,532
What?

396
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:20,402
You can change your answer.

397
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,871
This one.

398
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,775
THE COIN ISN'T IN HIS HAND

399
00:19:27,642 --> 00:19:29,644
THE COIN ISN'T ON THE TABLE EITHER

400
00:19:30,312 --> 00:19:31,646
-You moved it just now!
-Wait,

401
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:33,215
how did you get it right?

402
00:19:36,251 --> 00:19:37,953
Since I got it right…

403
00:19:38,019 --> 00:19:39,421
Do you want me to leave?

404
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,424
We don't need
to get to know each other more, right?

405
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,559
Let's try one more time. This is…

406
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:47,395
Shouldn't the reward be
to stop getting to know each other?

407
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:49,297
Is that what you want?

408
00:19:52,367 --> 00:19:54,636
You're good at this.
You must have good vision.

409
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:00,742
Your dialect is so fascinating.

410
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:03,578
I forgot to use the Seoul dialect.

411
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:06,047
-Please use the Seoul dialect.
-Okay.

412
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:09,718
I forgot. I forgot for realsies.

413
00:20:09,784 --> 00:20:11,386
-Is that the Seoul dialect?
-No.

414
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:13,221
-Hold on. Let me catch my breath.
-That isn't…

415
00:20:13,288 --> 00:20:14,956
Let me go over the questions I wrote down.

416
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:19,094
I wrote down the questions I wanted to ask

417
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,495
during the blind date.

418
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,774
By the way…

419
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:35,443
By the way…

420
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,680
No. What will you do…

421
00:20:39,581 --> 00:20:40,715
if your relationship enters

422
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:43,718
a boring phase?

423
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,320
-A boring phase?
-Yes.

424
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:46,855
How will you fix that?

425
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:48,857
I'll overcome it.

426
00:20:48,923 --> 00:20:50,859
I think it's important
to talk to your partner.

427
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:52,827
But how will you overcome it?

428
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:55,230
I don't know.
Will there be a boring phase?

429
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:57,499
-If two people are in love?
-Yes.

430
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:59,634
-I don't want there to be a boring phase.
-But…

431
00:21:00,602 --> 00:21:01,936
even when two people are in love,

432
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,139
a boring phase might come.

433
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:07,042
So…

434
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,144
-So…
-So,

435
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,212
does the dialect turn you off?

436
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,514
-It doesn't turn me off.
-Okay.

437
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,016
It's just entertaining
to hear you use the Seoul dialect.

438
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:16,351
-Really?
-Yes.

439
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,321
Yeeun.

440
00:21:20,455 --> 00:21:21,956
Do you love desserts?

441
00:21:22,023 --> 00:21:23,124
Yes.

442
00:21:23,892 --> 00:21:26,428
I prepared some desserts
since I knew that you liked them.

443
00:21:27,062 --> 00:21:29,130
I could really use an energy boost
right now.

444
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:30,932
-Please enjoy your snack…
-Okay.

445
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:32,133
…and focus on me today.

446
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:35,770
-The desserts are here.
-They're here.

447
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,011
-Thank you.
-I love desserts.

448
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:44,846
They look so tasty.

449
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,151
This is incredible.

450
00:21:50,218 --> 00:21:51,619
There are so many kinds.

451
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:55,357
They look so tasty. Try one.

452
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:56,658
Ladies first.

453
00:22:03,498 --> 00:22:04,799
It's so tasty.

454
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,071
-You know, they're so pretty and tasty.
-What?

455
00:22:10,138 --> 00:22:12,540
Usually, pretty desserts
aren't very tasty.

456
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,476
Right?

457
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:21,182
Is it tasty?

458
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:24,619
It's really tasty.

459
00:22:26,187 --> 00:22:27,822
It's so pretty. It's so tasty.

460
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:32,994
I can forgo rice and survive on bread.

461
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:35,697
I absolutely love bread.

462
00:22:35,764 --> 00:22:37,132
Do you prefer bread over rice?

463
00:22:37,532 --> 00:22:38,833
I like munchies…

464
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,168
I like snacks too.

465
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,672
I like the carp-shaped ice cream.

466
00:22:45,974 --> 00:22:47,275
What else?

467
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:48,843
Pokém** bread.

468
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,978
The chocolate Swiss rolls?

469
00:22:50,044 --> 00:22:51,880
-How did ya know?
-It's obvious.

470
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:54,149
How did you know?

471
00:22:56,317 --> 00:22:57,452
How did you know?

472
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:01,489
I'm going cuckoo.

473
00:23:01,556 --> 00:23:02,857
I'm going crazy.

474
00:23:03,858 --> 00:23:05,193
Seriously, I'm going crazy.

475
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,331
It's an incoming call.

476
00:23:10,398 --> 00:23:12,333
"ANOTHER CALL DURING A BLIND DATE?"

477
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,401
What is it?

478
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,837
-What is it?
-My mom is calling me.

479
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:17,539
-Please go ahead.
-My mom…

480
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:18,740
Please go ahead.

481
00:23:20,008 --> 00:23:21,209
Yes, Mom?

482
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:24,179
<i>Son, have you been well?</i>

483
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,181
<i>Son, have you been well?</i>

484
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:28,216
I'm in the middle of a blind date
right now.

485
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:30,552
<i>What blind date?</i>

486
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:33,655
I'm on a blind date with Yeeun.
What was it called?

487
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:35,223
-Mom.
-<i>With who?</i>

488
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,491
Yeeun.

489
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:37,926
I told you about it yesterday.

490
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:39,828
I'll put her on the phone.

491
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,229
<i>Don't be absurd. Why would you do that?</i>

492
00:23:41,296 --> 00:23:45,099
-She wants to say hello.
-<i>For goodness' sake.</i>

493
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:46,701
Hello.

494
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:48,369
<i>Hello, it's nice to talk to you.</i>

495
00:23:48,436 --> 00:23:50,472
I'm Ji Yeeun.

496
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:51,873
<i>Okay.</i>

497
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,442
<i>You guys are spending time together today.</i>

498
00:23:54,509 --> 00:23:56,344
We're on a blind date.

499
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,047
<i>Really?</i>

500
00:23:59,113 --> 00:24:00,181
Yes.

501
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:03,551
<i>-Okay. Have a good time.</i>
-Okay.

502
00:24:03,618 --> 00:24:05,420
Mom, I'll call you later. I love you.

503
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:06,588
-This is so funny.
-<i>Okay.</i>

504
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,690
-<i>Have a good time.</i>
-Okay.

505
00:24:08,756 --> 00:24:10,058
Thank you.

506
00:24:10,124 --> 00:24:11,659
-Thank you.
-<i>Have fun.</i>

507
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:13,461
-Okay. Thank you.
-<i>All right.</i>

508
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,830
That was so funny.

509
00:24:15,897 --> 00:24:16,998
-Is the date over?
-Your mom…

510
00:24:18,066 --> 00:24:20,335
-Your mom is friendly too.
-60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>

511
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:22,103
-<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>
-That was funny.

512
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,005
<i>Two-on-one blind date begins now!</i>

513
00:24:24,072 --> 00:24:28,042
"TWO-ON-ONE DATE BEGINS"

514
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:32,213
-<i>Kim Jinwook from</i> Love Mafia <i>has entered.</i>
-Hello.

515
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,281
Hello.

516
00:24:35,783 --> 00:24:37,118
-Hello.
-Hello.

517
00:24:37,986 --> 00:24:39,220
-Hello.
-Hello.

518
00:24:39,287 --> 00:24:41,089
-Hello.
-Hello.

519
00:24:41,155 --> 00:24:42,657
-Hello.
-Hello.

520
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,226
-Hello.
-Hello.

521
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:46,628
-Hello.
-Hello.

522
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:49,364
Your hair is longer than Yeeun's.

523
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,305
For a second, I thought
I was on a date with two women.

524
00:24:58,306 --> 00:24:59,774
-Did you get excited?
-A little bit.

525
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,177
-You need to choose one of us.
-Okay.

526
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,714
-That's funny.
-Nice to meet you.

527

ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN YEEUN, ENFJ

532
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,301
-How old are you?
-I was born in 1995.

533
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:27,502
I was born in 1995 too.

534
00:25:27,569 --> 00:25:29,504
-In what month were you born?

535
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,572
How about you?

-May.
-May?

537
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:33,141
Do you care about that?

538
00:25:33,207 --> 00:25:34,275
No.

539
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:37,111
-I don't.
-I do.

540
00:25:42,784 --> 00:25:45,253
How are you doing?
You've had multiple blind dates.

541
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,855
-Right. I'm doing fine.
-I thought you might be a bit tired.

542
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:51,159
So, I prepared some questions.

543
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:52,860
So…

544
00:25:54,662 --> 00:25:56,798
What's your latest obsession?

00:25:56,864 --> 00:25:58,199
-Me?
-Yes.

00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,467
-These days…
-Okay.

547
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:02,303
…I like the woman
whose head is a flower pot.

548
00:26:04,005 --> 00:26:05,506
"The woman
whose head is a flower pot"?

549
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:06,674
I like Mala Tang Wei.

550
00:26:09,644 --> 00:26:11,579
I like…

551
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,582
the woman who dressed up as a radish.

552
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:17,151
Please ask the questions.

553
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,756
If you could take one thing
to a deserted island, what would you pick?

554
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,558
You!

555
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:30,531
