1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:10,610
I think they are coming.

00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,146
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

3
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:15,682
<i>Two-on-one date begins again.</i>

4
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:23,223
<i>Model Kim Sungjun and Model Kim Sunghun</i>
<i>have entered.</i>

5
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:24,891
They're models.

6
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:29,963
Hello.

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:39,005
Oh, my!

8
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,442
-Gosh.
-Hello.

9
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,910
-Hello.
-Hello.

10
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,211
-Gosh.
-Hello.

11
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,513
-Hello.
-Hello.

12
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:47,614
The two of you…

13
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:52,652
Are you guys twins?

14
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,421
-We're twins.
-Yes, we're twins.

15
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,489
We didn't think you'd notice so soon.

16
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,391
-You noticed so soon.
-You guys look identical.

17
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,261
Our looks are identical,
but our charms are a bit different.

18
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:03,263
So, I grew out my hair on purpose.

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,231
I see. I mean…

20
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:08,435
You guys really look identical.

21
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:12,138
-What's your name?
-I'm Kim Sungjun.

22
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,007
-Sungjun.
-Nice to meet you.

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,942
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you.

24
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:18,244
-I'm Kim Sunghun.
-Sung…

25
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,679
-I'm Kim Sunghun. Yes.
-Hun.

26
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,414
-Sungjun and Sunghun.
-That's right.

27
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:28,221
KIM SUNGJUN, OLDER TWIN, MODEL

28
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,490
KIM SUNGHUN, YOUNGER TWIN, MODEL

29
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:32,959
This is so fascinating.

30
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:37,397
Sungjun.

31
00:01:37,464 --> 00:01:39,599
-I'm Sungjun. He's Sunghun.
-I'm Sunghun. He's Sungjun.

32
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:41,768
-Sungjun. Sunghun.
-Yes.

33
00:01:42,702 --> 00:01:45,205
The one with short hair
and a gentle disposition is Sungjun.

34
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,276
And Sunghun is a bit…

35
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,512
-I'm cute and gentle.
-I see.

36
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:55,381
-I have both charms.
-I see.

37
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:58,084
Are you guys the same age?

38
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:00,186
-Who is the older brother?
-We're identical twins, so…

39
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:01,387
We're twins.

40
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,991
You're very cute.

41
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,726
You're cute. Yes.

42
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,895
Being identical twins,
we're three minutes apart.

43
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,163
-I see.
-Yes.

44
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,431
Who seems like an older twin?

45
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:14,901
-Yes?
-You seem like an older twin.

46
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,969
Why?

47
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:18,638
Well, he has that vibe.

48
00:02:18,705 --> 00:02:20,006
-He has that vibe.
-Yes.

49
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:23,009
He seems serious.

50
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,912
-You think he seems serious.
-It's just a vibe.

51
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,347
We hear that a lot.

52
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,415
People say that Sungjun seems like
an older twin.

53
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:33,653
It's because I'm taciturn and manly.

54
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,787
Hold on.

55
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,757
-I didn't say that.
-Hold on a second.

56
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,692
-I'm a bit…
-Hold on a second.

57
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,528
Hold on. Are you saying
that I'm not serious?

58
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,465
Are the two of you wearing

59
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,033
a tank top?

60
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,635
I mean…

61
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,571
This is a blind date.

62
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,176
I guess it's okay to wear a tank top
to a blind date.

63
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:58,011
I'm going to put on a shirt later.

64
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:01,748
-It's too revealing, so… Yes.
-It's too… Seriously.

65
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:03,650
How old are you guys?

66
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,717
I'm 33.

67
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,985
We're 32 by international age.

68
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:08,454
-You were born in 1993?
-In 1993.

69
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,923
-You were born in 1994, right?
-Yes.

70
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:12,725
Do you guys have
the same MBTI personality type?

71
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,395
I'm ENFJ, but I'm…

72
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,331
-half extroverted and half introverted.
-I see.

73
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,266
I'm ENFP.

74
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,135
-They're different. That makes sense.
-Yes.

75
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,204
-Our personalities are a bit different.
-Of course.

76
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,005
-Yes.
-Of course, they're different.

77
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:28,541
I'm the type to plan ahead,

78
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,876
but he's a bit more like that.

79
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:33,112
What's your blood type?

80
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,514
-It's A.
-A?

81
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,882
Which blood type do you like?

82
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,183
I'm not familiar with them.

83
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,185
My blood type is O.

84
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,321
My blood type is O too, obviously.

85
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,295
-Hold on. We're too identical.
-Hold on.

86
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:50,396
Did you look down on me?

87
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:52,332
-I feel like you did that just now.
-No. No way.

88
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:54,367
No. No way.

89
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,802
-You're cute.
-Hey.

90
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,869
-You're really cute.
-Hey.

91
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:58,838
-Were you telling me off…
-No, you're really cute.

92
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,307
-…just now?
-No, you're really cute.

93
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,675
Sungjun, watch yourself!

94
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:04,010
Okay? Watch yourself!

95
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:06,045
-I mean…
-Seriously.

96
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,483
Being twins, are you guys close?

97
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,785
-We're very close.
-I see.

98
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:16,389
We used the same room until the age of 32.

99
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,224
-Thirty-two years.
-That's right.

100
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,526
Of course, we used separate beds.

101
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,095
Yes. Separate beds were a must.

102
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,964
We began using separate rooms this year.

103
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,432
Thus, we talk less these days.

104
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:28,601
-Have you guys become distant?
-A little bit, I think.

105
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,137
We have the same friends.

106
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,072
I introduced my close friends to Sungjun

107
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:35,208
and Sungjun introduced
his close friends to me.

108
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,144
Thus, we're always together.

109
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,213
We even work at the same place.

110
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,781
How do you guys do that?

111
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,217
Do you guys currently work as models?

112
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,186
We're models and the CEOs
for a content creators' agency.

113
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,988
-Both of us. It's the same agency.
-Both of you?

114
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,990
You guys are identical.

115
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:55,261
When one smiles,
the other one doesn't smile on purpose.

116
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,030
We really look like twins when we smile.

117
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:58,698
You guys have the same smile.

118
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,199
-The two of you.
-Yes.

119
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,674
-You guys have pearly teeth too.
-Yes.

120
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:09,609
We're showing bigger smiles now.

121
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:11,911
Seriously.

122
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,714
-Today…
-You guys have the same voice.

123
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,986
You guys have the same reactions.

124
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,021
"THE TWINS RESEMBLE EACH OTHER
SO MUCH"

125
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,590
Your parents don't get
the two of you mixed up, right?

126
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,925
The hairstyles are different.

127
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:30,930
When my hair was short,
they often got us mixed up.

128
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,800
After all, we used the same room
in the same house.

129
00:05:33,866 --> 00:05:36,102
Since we had many overlapping aspects
in our lives,

130
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,970
we began speaking in similar ways.

131
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,540
Of course. That happens
when people are joined at the hip.

132
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:42,875
-Let's see if you guys are telepathic.
-Okay.

133
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,243
-Telepathic?
-The Telepathy Test.

134
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,979
-You eat soybean noodles with salt…
-Of course.

135
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,281
…or sugar.

136
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:49,415
-I see.
-Let's go.

137
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,850
Shall I answer as well? Okay.

138
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,385
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

139
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,453
-Sugar.
-Salt.

140
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,721
For goodness' sake.

141
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,489
Salt.

142
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,658
-Did you choose salt?
-No, I chose sugar.

143
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,926
-Both of you chose sugar.
-Yes.

144
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,294
-I…
-We connected.

145
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:02,929
-I didn't connect.
-No.

146
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:05,698
This is wrong. This can't be happening.

147
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,166
Can we get another chance?

148
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,768
-Another chance?
-Yes, please.

149
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:11,104
What's your favorite shake?

150
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,839
-Okay.
-Answer honestly.

151
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:13,906
-Honestly.
-Honestly.

152
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,441
-I won't be happy if you lie.
-Okay.

153
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,643
-Answer this question honestly.
-Okay.

154
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,413
Milkshake versus protein shake.

155
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,149
A protein shake shouldn't be an option.
Seriously.

156
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:27,720
-This is… Choose something else.
-Choose something else.

157
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,990
We work out, so it'll be a lie if we say
that we don't like protein shakes.

158
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,792
I might like protein shakes.

159
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,460
-Okay.
-I might like them.

160
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,063
I really like
chocolate-flavored protein shakes.

161
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,531
-Okay. Let's go.
-Don't lie.

162
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:39,899
-Don't lie. Seriously.
-Seriously.

163
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,934
If you lie, I'll…

164
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,370
-I don't like flattery.
-It'll make us lose points.

165
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,605
Okay. We understand.

166
00:06:45,671 --> 00:06:47,206
-One, two, three.
-Two…

167
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,341
-Milkshake.
-Protein shake.

168
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,575
-Milkshake.
-Protein shake.

169
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,310
-That's a lie. Seriously.
-No.

170
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:53,579
-Listen. I didn't lie.
-That's a lie.

171
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,181
-You asked us which one we liked.
-Yes.

172
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,017
I drink protein shakes often,

173
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,052
-but I like milkshakes better.
-Okay.

174
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,621
-I'm serious.
-Okay.

175
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:03,156
-Hold on.
-Okay.

176
00:07:03,222 --> 00:07:04,991
-Hold on.
-That's right. I'm the same.

177
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:07,026
-I like milkshakes…
-Okay.

178
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:09,295
…but I drink protein shakes more often.

179
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,865
-That's what you mean.
-You're right.

180
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,567
I think we connect on many levels.

181
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,473
Why did you guys agree to a blind date?

182
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,842
You're my ideal type.

183
00:07:22,909 --> 00:07:24,343
-To be honest…
-Don't lie!

184
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,512
I'm not lying. I'm very nervous.

185
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,947
It's just that I have a poker face.

186
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,982
-Seriously, don't lie!
-I'm serious.

187
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:31,384
That's why I'm happy today.

188
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,286
"I'm happy when I'm with you, milkshake."

189
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,189
"Milk Shake."

190
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,323
I watched the performance.

191
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:40,393
I see. So, you've actually liked me.

192
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,128
That's right. I like someone

193
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,264
-who isn't fake.
-I see.

194
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,601
-You aren't fake in any of the shows.
-You're right.

195
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:49,902
-You're honest.
-You're right.

196
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,104
Because of those qualities,
I came to like you.

197
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,974
Really?

198
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,780
Have the two of you ever fought
because you guys had the same ideal type?

199
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:03,616
No. Our ideal types are different.

200
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,285
What are your ideal types, respectively?

201
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:07,520
I'll be honest with you.

202
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,188
-Be honest.
-I'll be honest with you.

203
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,556
-Very honest.
-Very honest.

204
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:12,158
-I like someone who's cute.
-Me?

205
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,894
-And sexy.
-I'm not sexy.

206
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,231
You have a sexy side.

207
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,499
-No, I don't.
-No.

208
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,634
-No.
-I think you're mistaken.

209
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,236
I have no sexy side whatsoever.

210
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,838
-I can be quite objective with myself.
-Okay.

211
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,106
I'm not sexy.

212
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,543
I like cute women.

213
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,412
-Cute.
-Okay.

214
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,614
-Pure.
-That's me.

215
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,715
Honest.

216
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:36,949
Transparent.

217
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,351
-That's me.
-That's right.

218
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:39,418
That's right.

219
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:45,291
So, your ideal type is me.
Your ideal type is the exact opposite.

220
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,959
Yes. I mean, no.

221
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,528
Yes. I mean, no.

222
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:49,862
That came out wrong.

223
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:51,197
-I mean…
-You're out.

224
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,866
I mean… That came out wrong.

225
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,401
-You know…
-Can I choose now?

226
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,303
No! I mean…

227
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:01,874
You're sexy, Yeeun.

228
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,946
I'm serious. You're very sexy in my eyes.

229
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,481
I'm not.

230
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,549
You're sexy.

231
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,351
I think you're pure and cute.

232
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,020
Yes, I'm the pure and cute type.

233
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,555
I fit into that category.

234
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,290
That's my desired image too.

235
00:09:18,758 --> 00:09:21,294
-Let's say you eat chewy candies.
-Okay.

236
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,828
-Let's say you eat candies.
-Okay.

237
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,164
Let's say lovers eat candies
during a date.

238
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,000
When you say, "chewy," your lips…

239
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,369
"HE GOES OVERBOARD
IN DESPERATION"

240
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,207
-Hold on.
-It could happen, right?

241
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,611
Someone might find you sexy
even if you're being cute, right?

242
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,881
If it's someone you like…

243
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:43,182
If it's someone you like…

244
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,884
Sungjun, you must be nervous.

245
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,953
-You're sweating so much.
-I usually don't sweat.

246
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,021
-But I'm sweating so much.
-You're sweating so much.

247
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,023
Right now…

248
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,291
-I see.
-Yes. Right now…

249
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,794
You're sweating so much by yourself.

250
00:09:56,162 --> 00:09:57,229
Negative feedback…

251
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,534
-Seriously.
-This is…

252
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:03,202
You aren't in a sauna, are you?

253
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,574
-This is the first time.
-You're wearing the least.

254
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,809
This is the first time.

255
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,510
You're wearing the least.

256
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,448
You're the woman who makes me nervous.

257
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,887
I'm serious.

258
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:23,589
-I see.
-Yes.

259
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,960
My sweat is proof of my sincerity,
isn't it?

260
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,295
Right?

261
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:30,930
Seriously.

262
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:33,666
-You're sweating.
-Yes.

263
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,534
It looks like you're struggling.

264
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:37,503
You're sweating. Seriously.

265
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,805
I didn't expect Sungjun to sweat so much.

266
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,340
I'm happy to see him like this.

267
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,376
-I see.
-It feels like…

268
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,745
It feels like I've broken his spirit.

269
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,147
-You've been sweat-free and smooth.
-Yes.

270
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,549
I'm maintaining my composure.

271
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,354
Did you have breakfast?

272
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:58,824
In the morning, I had hot chocolate
and vanilla latte.

273
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,126
-Milkshake.
-Milkshake.

274
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:01,927
-You should have a milkshake.
-Milkshake.

275
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,329
-I had that too.
-Really?

276
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:06,732
My previous date made it.

277
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,367
He made a milkshake.

278
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:10,136
-Did he do the dance for your song?
-No.

279
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:13,305
He brought the ingredients in a cooler.

280
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,342
-Really?
-Yes.

281
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:17,677
Why didn't I think of that?

282
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,414
Oh, my.

283
00:11:22,481 --> 00:11:24,250
Oh, my.

284
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:25,718
I feel…

285
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,120
-If a man comes too prepared…
-Right.

286
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:31,057
It was something I hadn't expected.

287
00:11:31,657 --> 00:11:33,826
Actually, I prepared something

288
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,227
for you.

289
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,601
May I give it to you now?

290
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:45,004
-If it's a heart…
-It isn't a heart.

291
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:49,275
I thought a big present would be too much
on our first meeting.

292
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:51,310
What is it?

293
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,082
It's a chewy candy.

294
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:01,754
Did you mention chewy candy earlier
for this?

295
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,091
You mentioned chewy candy earlier
for this.

296
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,026
Good thinking.

297
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,967
I don't know if it's
because of your sweat, but…

298
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,836
-It looks like it has become softer.
-Yes.

299
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,037
-You sure this is a candy?
-Yes.

300
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,238
It contains my effort.

301
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,610
I'll eat it after it's cooled down a bit.

302
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,345
Eat it when you think of me.

303
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,580
When you think of me.

304
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:35,387
You know, 30 minutes is
such a short amount of time.

305
00:12:35,454 --> 00:12:37,189
-You're right.
-Ten minutes remain.

306
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,491
For real?

307
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,493
It's much shorter than I expected.

308
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,964
Time passed so quickly with you guys.

309
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,098
It's fun.

310
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:47,233
-Really?
-Yes.

311
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,102
Do you guys have the same height?

312
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,404
No, I'm about 2 cm taller.

313
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,109
How tall are you?

314
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:59,779
-I'm 187 cm tall and…
-I'm 185 cm tall.

315
00:12:59,845 --> 00:13:02,281
You guys must've gotten good genes.

316
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,816
Do you guys work out together?

317
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,418
We work out together.

318
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:08,487
I began working out first.

319
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:12,958
He began three years before I did,

320
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:15,895
but I won an award at a competition first.

321
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,501
Do you prefer long hair or short hair?

322
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,470
LONG HAIR

323
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:26,338
VERSUS SHORT HAIR

324
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:34,280
Short hair.

325
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,348
Most women are like that, right?

326
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,416
-But…
-Of course.

327
00:13:39,785 --> 00:13:40,786
-But…
-Of course.

328
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,689
Seriously. Had you had short hair,

329
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,758
I wouldn't have known which one to choose.

330
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,028
-I would've done eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
-Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

331
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,263
-Are you serious?
-Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

332
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,136
-This happened once in elementary school.
-Okay.

333
00:13:57,203 --> 00:14:00,039
A girl asked me out,

334
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,473
-and I turned her down.
-Okay.

335
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,275
Then she asked my brother out right after.

336
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:08,147
-I'm serious.
-It actually happened.

337
00:14:08,214 --> 00:14:09,615
-But…
-I wasn't happy about it.

338
00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:11,750
She didn't choose me first.

339
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,386
She went to Sungjun
before she came to me.

340
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,188
-I think…
-Oh, my.

341
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:18,090
…it was possible because we were young.

342
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,659
We didn't have that experience as adults.

343
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:22,061
I really can't decide.

344
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,829
I want to know if you like our looks.

345
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,664
-I have long hair, right?
-Yes.

346
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:29,001
Many women dislike long hair on men.

347
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,970
-How is it for you?
-As for me…

348
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,272
I personally prefer short hair on men.

349
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,077
-Right.
-But you said that you liked sexy women.

350
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,912
After entering the thirties,

351
00:14:40,746 --> 00:14:42,314
my taste in women changed.

352
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,350
-I see.
-I've been wanting to tell you that.

353
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,651
How did it change?

354
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,354
Just like him, I like women who are

355
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,755
honest, innocent,

356
00:14:49,822 --> 00:14:51,357
-and pure.
-Your ideal types overlap.

357
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,359
Our ideal types do overlap now.

358
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,500
What happens if there's a war
between the brothers?

359
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,102
To be honest, I'm nervous right now.

360
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,904
You guys shouldn't fight because of me.

361
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:06,906
We'll probably fight today.

362
00:15:10,776 --> 00:15:11,810
You have a way with words.

363
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,145
We'll probably fight today.

364
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,581
A fight between the brothers…

365
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:19,285
-I have a question.
-Okay.

366
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,553
When you go on a blind date,

367
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,855
what kind of men do you like?

368
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,723
Do you prefer men
who lead you comfortably?

369
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,659
I prefer men who lead me.

370
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:28,494
-Something like that.
-Yes.

371
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,095
-Men who lead you.
-Yes.

372
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,300
"FIDGETING"

373
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,104
Here is a napkin. You might sweat.

374
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,173
You didn't wipe your sweat with it, right?

375
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,308
-No.
-Hold on.

376
00:15:43,642 --> 00:15:45,577
I wiped my sweat with this one.

377
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,346
I'll hide it.

378
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,450
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

379
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,256
What kind of man do you usually like?

380
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,391
I like someone who is kind.

381
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:01,460
SHOWING A KIND SMILE

382
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,029
SHOWING A KIND SMILE AS WELL

383
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,104
About the type of men you like…
If a man talks too much,

384
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:14,540
you'll get exhausted.
You won't feel like you're resting.

385
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,408
That was why I didn't talk much today.

386
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,011
-You talk a lot.
-Yes.

387
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,747
I don't talk a lot. Seriously.

388
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,784
I'm taciturn and manly.

389
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,120
But if I show those aspects
from the start…

390
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:31,023
I'm worried I'll seem no different
from your other dates.

391
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:34,460
I liven up the atmosphere at first.

392
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,262
-Then I show those sides when we talk.
-It's nice. Really.

393
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,198
Ever since the two of you entered,

394
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,933
time has been passing quickly.

395
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,801
Yeeun, do you have
long-term relationships or…

396
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:44,803
I have long-term relationships.

397
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,007
I'm not making this up.

398
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,943
In long-term relationships,
I'm more popular than Sunghun.

399
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,646
Sunghun is for short-term flings.

400
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,315
That's nonsense.

401
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:59,084
Why is that? Why are you more popular?

402
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,619
-Let's say we meet someone.
-Okay.

403
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,654
-This is our first two-on-one blind date…
-Right.

404
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,890
…but Sunghun is more popular at first.

405
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,625
He really is.

406
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,762
But in the end, everyone comes to me.

407
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,829
Why is that?

408
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,398
I'm prudent.

409
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,111
Why do you keep checking the time?

410
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,679
No. Three minutes remain.

411
00:17:27,746 --> 00:17:29,748
What are you looking at?

412
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:30,816
What should I do?

413
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,251
I really don't know what to do.

414
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,921
-Time passed faster than I expected.
-Seriously.

415
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,423
The two of you are too similar.

416
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,858
But we aren't similar. I'm serious.

417
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,493
I don't know about that.

418
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,362
She wouldn't know
since she has just met us.

419
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:45,397
I've only known you guys
for a short amount of time.

420
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,934
If I get to know you guys over time,
I'll go, "They really are different."

421
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,837
But I've only had 30 minutes.

422
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,772
-It's short.
-Yes. Very.

423
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,442
It's too…

424
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,510
We haven't shown enough charms.

425
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,578
Show me your charms.

426
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:01,513
Is it time to show our charms?

427
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,148
-It's time to show your charms.
-Okay.

428
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,650
-I'll show one charm of mine.
-Okay.

429
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,887
-I'm wearing a tank top today, right?
-Yes.

430
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:11,990
I'm someone who works out.

431
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,227
It isn't easy to add arm exercises
to the routine every day.

432
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,696
But I've done arm exercises for a week.

433
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,631
These are my charms.

434
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:26,405
I'll impersonate Lee Jungjae.

435
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,208
-I wasn't going to do it.
-Hold on.

436
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,943
Okay. Go ahead.

437
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,678
You have that vibe. Seriously.

438
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,547
I was going to do it
if we ended up spending time alone.

439
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
-But I think I should do it now.
-Yes.

440
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,419
"Do only three of us know
about this operation?"

441
00:18:40,486 --> 00:18:42,554
-What?
-"Do only two of us know about it?"

442
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,022
-That's it.
-Okay.

443
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,291
It was too short, right?

444
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,293
-It was a bit similar.
-Really?

445
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,129
-It was similar, but embarrassing.
-Really?

446
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,731
I'm about to start sweating.

447
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,667
-You also resemble Son Heungmin.
-Son Heungmin?

448
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,536
We get that a lot.

449
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,037
The two of you…

450
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,439
"SON HEUNGMIN'S CEREMONY"

451
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:01,874
You guys look exactly like him!

452
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,008
Come on!

453
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,243
Don't do it.

454
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,545
-Don't do it.
-Let me show my charms.

455
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:07,880
-I was doing it.
-My charms.

456
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,648
Both of you look like him.

457
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:12,284
Since I resemble him,
I was going to do this alone.

458
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,685
But he did it with me.

459
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,855
-It was a chance to show my charms.
-You really resemble Son Heungmin.

460
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,225
If you look at our eyes closely,
Sungjun's eyes droop a bit more.

461
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,593
My eyes are slanted.

462
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,729
Some people tell us apart that way.

463
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:26,532
-<i>One minute remains.</i>
-My goodness.

464
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:27,966
Oh, my.

465
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,205
What should I do?
I really don't know what to do.

466
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,741
The thing is,

467
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:39,678
Sunghun is funny.

468
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:41,013
He makes women feel comfortable.

469
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,183
Sometimes, he's cute.
Sometimes, he's tough and sexy.

470
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,618
Still, I'm one level above him.

471
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,987
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>
-You should remember that.

472
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,323
-I want a chance to show you those charms.
-<i>Four, three…</i>

473
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,158
-Seriously.
-This is driving me crazy.

474
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,793
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

475
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,264
"BLIND DATE ENDS"

476
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,134
-<i>Ji Yeeun, you must now choose one…</i>
-I'm sweating so much.

477
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,735
<i>…of the two dates.</i>

478
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:07,072
<i>Gentlemen, please get up from your seats,</i>
<i>close your eyes,</i>

479
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,442
-<i>and stretch out your hand.</i>
-Oh, man.

480
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,981
<i>Gentlemen, stretch out your hand</i>
<i>to the side.</i>

481
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,849
Please wait.

482
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,585
My hands are sweaty.

483
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,595
Seriously, this is…

484
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:32,097
You're cute. Seriously.

485
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,166
You're very cute. I mean it.

486
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,902
We're nervous too.

487
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:39,238
"IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT
DECISION"

488
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:42,107
In a sense, it's a match of pride

489
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:44,109
-between the twins.
-I don't know what to do.

490
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,611
"A MATCH OF PRIDE
BETWEEN THE TWINS"

491
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,447
You're the woman who makes me nervous.

492
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,783
I'm serious.

493
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,053
"OLDER TWIN, KIM SUNGJUN"

494
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,659
You're my ideal type.

495
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:02,561
I came to like you.

496
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:06,231
"YOUNGER TWIN, KIM SUNGHUN"

497
00:21:09,234 --> 00:21:11,203
This is the hardest decision.

498
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,938
This is the hardest decision. It's too…

499
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,109
<i>Now, please hold the hand of the man</i>
<i>you'd like to go on</i>

500
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,677
<i>a one-on-one date with.</i>

501
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,312
This is the hardest decision.

502
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,819
KIM SUNGJUN
VERSUS KIM SUNGHUN

503
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,956
Seriously.

504
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,057
-What?
-Seriously.

505
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,326
-I don't know.
-I'll show my charms during the next date.

506
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,162
Why am I so nervous?

507
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,831
<i>Ji Yeeun, please choose in three seconds.</i>

508
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:40,899
<i>Three,</i>

509
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,501
<i>two,</i>

510
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,603
<i>one. Please choose one.</i>

511
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:48,573
<i>That startled me!</i>
