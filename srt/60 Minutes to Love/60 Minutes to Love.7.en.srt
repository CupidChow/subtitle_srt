1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,876
<i>Now, please hold the hand of the man</i>
<i>you'd like to go on</i>

2
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,478
<i>a one-on-one date with.</i>

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:12,712
This is the hardest decision.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,681
<i>Please choose in three seconds.</i>

5
00:00:15,415 --> 00:00:17,550
We're nervous too.

6
00:00:17,617 --> 00:00:19,886
"IT'S THE MOST DIFFICULT
DECISION"

7
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,589
In a sense, it's a match of pride

8
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:24,758
-between the twins.
-I don't know what to do.

9
00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:26,292
"A MATCH OF PRIDE
BETWEEN THE TWINS"

10
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,695
You're the woman who makes me nervous.

11
00:00:31,398 --> 00:00:32,432
I'm serious.

12
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,702
"OLDER TWIN, KIM SUNGJUN"

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,706
You're my ideal type.

14
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,940
I came to like you.

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,579
"YOUNGER TWIN, KIM SUNGHUN"

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,582
Seriously.

17
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:50,750
-What?
-Seriously.

18
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,053
-I don't know.
-I'll show my charms during the next date.

19
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,790
-Why am I so nervous?
-<i>Ji Yeeun,</i>

20
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:58,591
<i>please choose in three seconds.</i>

21
00:00:58,658 --> 00:00:59,659
<i>Three,</i>

22
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,261
<i>two,</i>

23
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,363
<i>one. Please choose one.</i>

24
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:12,806
That startled me!

25
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,708
<i>Kim Sunghun is out.</i>

26
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,244
Hold… Hold on.

27
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,479
Ji Yeeun!

28
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,282
<i>I think I got outshined.</i>

29
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,051
<i>I didn't get eliminated</i>
<i>because of my long hair, right?</i>

30
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,522
<i>Ji Yeeun chose Kim Sungjun.</i>

31
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,990
"JI YEEUN CHOSE KIM SUNGJUN"

32
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,829
Now… Hold on.

33
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:36,996
My goodness.

34
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:39,799
-Chewy candy played a big role.
-Chewy candy?

35
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,534
-Don't throw it away, okay?
-Okay.

36
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,906
I can't stand awkward situations.

37
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>He smoothed out the situation</i>

38
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,510
<i>in a witty way.</i>

39
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,146
He made things very entertaining for me,

40
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:54,314
so I chose him.

41
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,152
60 MINUTES TO LOVE

42
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,522
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

43
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,390
<i>One-on-one date begins now!</i>

44
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,097
You don't need to put it on.

45
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,166
I brought it to show different charms.

46
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,934
-It's okay.
-This is how I look in a shirt.

47
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,469
You're making me feel warm.

48
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,804
Really? It's okay.

49
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:18,905
Please.

50
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,341
-I saw it.
-This is how I look in a shirt.

51
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:23,476
-I'll take it off if I get warm.
-You look too warm.

52
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:28,148
Now, you're right in front of me.

53
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:31,184
Thanks to the two of you,
time passed so quickly.

54
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:34,220
I wanted to show my fun side
as well as my serious side.

55
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,157
I thought I wouldn't get to show them,

56
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,625
so I was disappointed.

57
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:41,060
Despite being an identical twin,

58
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:43,029
I'm different from Sunghun in some ways.

59
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:45,598
I think you've chosen me
because of those differences.

60
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,433
-That's right.
-Yes.

61
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,736
You're quite different
from the image I had in mind.

62
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,171
Why do you say that?

63
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:52,605
You have a very small face.

64
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:55,942
You're tall.

65
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,111
Your personality too.

66
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,847
You aren't overly cheerful.

67
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:03,049
-There's seriousness about you.
-Yes.

68
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:04,184
You saw correctly.

69
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,251
It's nice.

70
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:07,787
When I look at a person,

71
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,622
I pay attention to his or her energy
or vibes.

72
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,691
-You have incredible energy.
-Can you feel it?

73
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,493
You're full of positive energy.

74
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:15,595
I don't like awkwardness.

75
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,201
When there's silence,

76
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,770
I constantly try to break it.

77
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,038
I'm the same.

78
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:26,506
-I see.
-I'm the same.

79
00:03:27,473 --> 00:03:29,609
We have many similarities.

80
00:03:29,676 --> 00:03:30,977
"WE HAVE MANY SIMILARITIES"

81
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:35,515
You said earlier
that you couldn't ask many questions.

82
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:36,783
-Do you have questions?
-Well,

83
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,618
I have many questions.

84
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:40,920
Do you like hot weather?

85
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:42,755
-I prefer winter.
-Winter.

86
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:43,890
Do you like cold weather?

87
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,893
I enjoy the scenery of cold weather.
I enjoy watching the snow fall.

88
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,127
But I'm actually

89
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:50,196
too sensitive to cold weather.

90
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,899
-But…
-You're sensitive to heat too.

91
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,567
I'm a bit sensitive to heat too.

92
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,002
You can take it off.

93
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,904
Shall I take it off?

94
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,007
It's too hot. I'll need to take it off.
This won't do.

95
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,712
"HE GOES BACK TO THE TANK TOP"

96
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,082
I don't know where to look.

97
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,252
It's okay. My body is covered anyway.

98
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:14,554
What are you looking at?

99
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,826
Your eyes are very clear.

100
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:21,527
You look a bit like a quokka.

101
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,397
That's right. Many people told me
that I resembled a quokka.

102
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:27,467
Hamsters and quokkas.
Animals in that category.

103
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:29,168
Cuteness is the strongest quality.

104
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,837
You can't help but fall for cuteness.

105
00:04:33,206 --> 00:04:35,708
-Many people were on the show.
-Yes.

106
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,845
-There must be men you've chosen.
-Yes.

107
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:39,912
Yes.

108
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,149
What do you look for in those men?

109
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:46,052
Which quality do you hope
that they'd possess?

110
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,022
Me? I want our conversations
to flow easily.

111
00:04:49,922 --> 00:04:52,458
I want our conversations to be fun.

112
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:53,526
Right.

113
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:56,863
-People who put you at ease are the best.
-That's right.

114
00:04:56,929 --> 00:04:58,097
Do you have a hobby?

115
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,332
I like to walk.

116
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,501
Do you walk alone or with other people?

117
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,902
I walk alone.

118
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:04,537
Do you go to the Han River?

119
00:05:04,604 --> 00:05:05,605
Cheonggyecheon.

120
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:06,773
-Really?
-Yes.

121
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,574
I might see you at Cheonggyecheon.

122
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,076
"I MIGHT SEE YOU
AT CHEONGGYECHEON"

123
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,444
Even if we don't go on a date…

124
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:12,845
Right? That might happen.

125
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,448
Where do you live?

126
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:18,284
I currently live in Oksu.

127
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:20,653
It's close to Cheonggyecheon.

128
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,757
That's right. That's what I think.

129
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,627
<i>Ten minutes remain.</i>

130
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:30,763
I'm someone who likes the pull.

131
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,032
When I do something…

132
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,537
When I set my mind to do something,
I think it through.

133
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,871
That's good.

134
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,274
"I'll meet Yeeun today.
I'll go on a date with her today."

135
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,942
Then it comes true.

136
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,744
It's the law of the pull.

137
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:45,912
-The law of the pull?
-Yes.

138
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,413
I'm sure you didn't realize this,

139
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,082
but I've been pulling you in.

140
00:05:52,985 --> 00:05:54,387
The weather is very nice today.

141
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,521
It's pretty outside.

142
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,991
I want to go outside with you
and enjoy a date.

143
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:00,493
That sounds good.

144
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:06,299
Is there a male actor you like?

145
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:09,469
It depends on the drama.

146
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,171
When I watch this drama,
I like this actor.

147
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,140
When I watch that drama,
I like that actor.

148
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,475
Then your ideal type must change.

149
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,542
That's right.

150
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:17,977
It changes.

151
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:19,979
That's why I don't know myself.

152
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,048
-You know…
-<i>Three minutes remain.</i>

153
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,252
Women's ideal type changes a lot.

154
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,354
-It actually changes.
-Exactly.

155
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:29,756
Is it the same for men?

156
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,824
-Does your ideal type change over time?
-Mine did.

157
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,460
It went from sexiness to cuteness.
That was why I asked.

158
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:35,595
It changed today.

159
00:06:35,661 --> 00:06:37,964
-Why are you lying?
-I'm not lying.

160
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,166
I love cute characters so much.

161
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,503
I mentioned a quokka earlier
because it was my absolute favorite.

162
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,804
That was why I mentioned it.

163
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,608
On my way here,

164
00:06:48,674 --> 00:06:50,476
I had many thoughts.

165
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:52,612
"I'll show this side to Yeeun."

166
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,780
"I'll make this comment."

167
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,748
-Such thoughts…
-Which side did you want to show?

168
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,218
I wanted to show my sincere side.

169
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,286
That's nice.

170
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:03,589
Within that side,
I wanted to show my sense of humor.

171
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:06,359
You've done a good job
of showing your charms.

172
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,863
You've been very charming.

173
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,198
There's more to show.

174
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,266
-Right.
-Yes.

175
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:14,500
Is there more to show?

176
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:15,568
Of course.

177
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,640
Hold on. After 1 minute and 30 seconds,

178
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,042
-will another man come?
-Yes, I think so.

179
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:24,477
Who will come?

180
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,512
"NERVOUS"

181
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,580
Seriously.

182
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:32,385
It's my first time having a blind date
alongside a man, except my brother.

183
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,352
Right.

184
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,154
It's all about my confidence.

185
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,956
-Your confidence.
-Yes, my confidence is key.

186
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,791
-Your confidence.
-I need to build up my confidence.

187
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:40,059
I'll need to control my mind.

188
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,127
I see. Do it now.

189
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,932
Hold on. I'm getting a bit nervous.

190
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,334
-Another man will come in 30 seconds.
-Seriously.

191
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,604
Hold on. Let me put on some lip balm.

192
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,441
-Lip balm.
-Yes.

193
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,114
It's over.

INTERNATIONAL FOOD SALES MANAGER,
THREE YEARS YOUNGER, ENFJ

204
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,682
You're more petite than you appear on TV.

205
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,986
I guess I looked huge on TV.

206
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:41,821
No.

207
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,022
You just look very pretty

208
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:44,957
in person.

209
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:46,993
Thank you.

210
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,128
Thank you.

211
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,236
-I watched <i>EXchange</i>.
-Did you watch it?

212
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,372
Does it mean that you know who I am?

213
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:02,575
I know who you are, Kwangtae.

214
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:04,076
You know who he is.

215
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,578
-I know you.
-That's good, I guess.

216
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:07,380
How old are you?

217
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:09,048
I was born in 1997.

218
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:13,052
-He's young.
-You're young.

219
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:14,654
I'm younger than you.

220
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:17,790
You're the same age as my brother.

221
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,858
You were born in 1997.

222
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:19,959
You were born in 1997.

223
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,027
Do you have a brother?

224
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,762
-Do you have a brother?
-Yes.

225
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,697
I have two younger brothers.

226
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:30,403
Have you dated someone
who was your younger brother's age?

227
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,573
…your younger brother's age?

228
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,711
I bet she has.

229
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,280
-No, I haven't.
-No?

230
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:42,848
So, what do you think?

231
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,419
Do you prefer a man
who is your younger brother's age

232
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:49,455
or a man who is one year older than you?

233
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:54,594
As for me,

234
00:09:55,561 --> 00:10:00,466
"FULL OF HOPE"

235
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:04,103
I prefer older men.

236
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:07,006
My younger brother's age…

237
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,008
"A CEREMONY OF VICTORY"

238
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:11,944
That's right.

239
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,614
You'll change your mind today.

240
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,054
Kwangtae, how did you join
this blind date?

241
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,757
Me? To be honest,
this is my very first blind date.

242
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:25,825
So…

243
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,160
I was simply invited
to a blind date with you.

244
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,796
I thought, "I should do it."

245
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:31,931
"A BLIND DATE WITH YEEUN"

246
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,367
I'm here to show you

247
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:35,635
my natural side.

248
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,902
What's your natural side?

249
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,038
My strength is

250
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,308
that I can put you at ease
even though we've just met.

251
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,010
You have a great personality,

252
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:47,446
so you'll probably feel at ease
no matter who you're with.

253
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,682
You're right about that.

254
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,752
Am I right about that?

255
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:55,488
You're right about that.
I have a great personality,

256
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:57,390
so no matter who I'm with…

257
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,660
You're right about that.

258
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,665
-Since this is my first time meeting you,
-Okay.

259
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,167
may I ask you what kind of men you like?

260
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,704
I was surprised to see a man in a tank top
upon entering.

261
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,406
She likes a man in a tank top.

262
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,410
-No.
-I was wearing this shirt earlier,

263
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,644
but she told me to take it off.

264
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:19,712
So, I took it off.

265
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:23,449
I wanted to keep it on,
but I took it off.

266
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,517
Yes.

267
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,522
He looked too warm in it.

268
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:31,223
He was sweating a lot.

269
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,359
-I like someone who is kind
-Okay.

270
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,095
and considerate.

271
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,831
It has nothing to do with tank tops.

272
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,566
It has nothing to do with tank tops.

273
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,405
<i>Five minutes have passed.</i>

274
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:48,174
What do you do for a living?

275
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,510
I haven't introduced myself properly.
I currently work at a company.

276
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,879
Caviar and truffles

277
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:58,284
are some of the luxury food items
my company deals with.

278
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,852
I'm their sales manager.

279
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,189
Do you enjoy eating?

280
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,557
I really enjoy eating.

281
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,958
Do you go to famous restaurants?

282
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,427
-I don't go to famous restaurants.
-I see.

283
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,563
In that case, what's your favorite food?

284
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,498
-<i>Tteokbokki</i>.
-<i>Tteokbokki</i>.

"YEEUN'S FAVORITE FOOD"

00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:14,667
I like <i>tteokbokki</i>.

287
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,969
There are many famous <i>tteokbokki</i> places.

288
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,604
-But <i>tteokbokki</i> is
-Okay.

289
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,206
usually tasty.

290
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,809
There's <i>tteokbokki</i> at the Seokgwan Market
near the school you attended.

291
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,945
-I've tried it.
-It's famous.

292
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:27,613
-It's so tasty.
-My school was nearby.

293
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,381
-Which school?
-Kyunghee University.

294
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,483
It's quite near.

295
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,119
I've been to Kyunghee University.

296
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,754
-People visit for cherry blossoms.
-Yes.

297
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,492
I asked about famous restaurants

298
00:12:39,558 --> 00:12:41,961
because I run a social media account
on that topic.

299
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:46,332
I'd say that I have a talent
in finding good restaurants.

300
00:12:46,398 --> 00:12:48,501
I love taking people to such restaurants.

301
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,869
-So…
-There's a line, right?

302
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,971
No, these places don't have a line.

303
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,639
These places are hidden gems.

304
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:56,809
Otherwise, I'll make the reservation.

305
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,444
That's really nice.

306
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:03,349
I work at a company
that deals with food items, right?

307
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:04,583
I really like truffles.

308
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:05,751
-Really?
-Yes.

309
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,186
I'd like to give them as a gift.

310
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:09,155
If he gives you truffles,

311
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:10,456
I'll give you <i>tteokbokki</i>.

312
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,592
-I'll give you truffle <i>tteokbokki</i>.
-Truffle <i>tteokbokki</i>.

313
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,462
Truffle <i>tteokbokki</i>.

314
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,731
I haven't thought of truffle <i>tteokbokki</i>.

315
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,600
I'll cook for you myself.

316
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:24,670
Are you good at cooking?

317
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,572
I enjoy cooking. Also,

318
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,941
I make the best <i>tteokbokki</i>.

319
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:34,780
Have you had a meal?

320
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,015
No, I haven't.

321
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,884
-You must be hungry. I'm hungry too.
-My stomach is empty.

322
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:42,354
I heard that this place was famous
for its afternoon tea set.

323
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:45,891
I absolutely love desserts.

324
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,963
The desserts here are well-known
among foodies.

325
00:13:51,463 --> 00:13:53,632
I want to eat them right away.
My blood sugar is low.

326
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:55,000
-Please bring them in.
-It's low.

327
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:56,335

00:14:00,372 --> 00:14:01,440

331
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,690

It's so tasty.

334
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,035
There's a variety,
so please try a bit of each.

335
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:33,105
Perhaps because they're hotel desserts,
they're luxurious.

336
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,740
They're luxurious.

337
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,711

You're a sweet guy.

341
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,920
-It's too big.
-I want to try this one.

-Yeeun wants to try this one.

I'll cut it for you.

345
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,327
-It's…
-Thank you.

00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,997
Do you like small bites or big bites?

347

Today, I'll go for small bites.

Small bites.

349
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:03,903

There you go.

351
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,909
-This piece has the most cream.
-Okay.

352
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:10,976
Thank you.

353
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:15,981
It looks so tasty.
I love brown cheese waffles.

354
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,753
This place must be famous for desserts.

355
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:25,424
Where do you recommend…

356
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,293
Which dessert do you like?

357
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,695
It depends on which dessert you like.

358
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,498
-I'll give you one recommendation.
-You're good.

359
00:15:32,564 --> 00:15:33,766
You're good.

360
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,167
-He's good.
-You're good.

361
00:15:37,636 --> 00:15:39,271
Where did you learn such techniques?

362
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,606
When a guy is too smooth,
it's a turn-off, isn't it?

363
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,743
I'm not like that. I've never been here.
I've never had such desserts.

364
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,945
I can see that.

365
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,347
You're right.

366
00:15:48,414 --> 00:15:50,516
Although I'm younger than you,

367
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,152
I'm not a young man.

368
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,954
Time passes so quickly.

369
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,188
What?

370
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,057
-While eating…
-I know.

371
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,327
Seriously.

372
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,929
-This is like a mealtime.
-I finished it.

373
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:06,065
"TIME PASSED QUICKLY
WHILE THEY WERE EATING"

374
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,733
It's good to see you eat well.

375
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,603
When I take a woman somewhere
to eat something,

376
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:14,640
I don't want her to go,
"Why would you pay so much for this?"

377
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:18,143
When I say, "Let's go
to this nice restaurant I found,"

378
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:21,313
I want her to follow me
and enjoy the food. That's all I want.

379
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:24,783
Let's say you go to a good restaurant

380
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,285
-and see a long line.
-Okay.

381
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,621
Do you tend to wait or not?

382
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:30,856
I don't wait.

383
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,891
Me neither.

384
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,227
I make sure we don't need to wait.

385
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,398
That's nice.

386
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,600
How do you do that?

387
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:44,203
I wait in line alone

388
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,404
and get close to the owners.

389
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:51,844
What's your ideal type?

390
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:55,814
I like someone
who does her work diligently.

391
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,316
That's totally me.

392
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,051
I agree.

393
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:02,221
-I also like someone with definite charms.
-That's me.

394
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,922
That's totally me.

395
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:06,091
You're doing a very good job
of eating right now.

396
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,393
It's nice to see.

397
00:17:08,227 --> 00:17:10,362
It made me happy just watching you.

398
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:12,097
I like someone who eats with gusto.

399
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,036
Your face is turning red.

400
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,538
While I enjoy eating,

401
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,141
I'm only eating right now
to raise my blood sugar level.

402
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,580
I mean…

403
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,649
I didn't mean it that way.

404
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,585
It was really nice
to see you eat comfortably. Seriously.

405
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,192
<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

406
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,362
Do you have any questions you want to ask?

407
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:44,630
-Me?
-Yes.

408
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,832
That's right. I want to know
what your MBTI is.

409
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:48,834
I'm a firm believer,

410
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:50,769
so I'm curious.

411
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,171
What do you think it is?

412
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,238
ENFP?

413
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:56,809
ISFP?

414
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,244
Am I right?

415
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,347
-Didn't you hear it earlier?
-No.

416
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,616
I really didn't.

417
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,185
-It's ISFP.
-ISFP?

418
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,387
Do you know a lot about MBTI?

419
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:12,291
-I know which personality types suit mine.
-What are they?

420
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,792
-Which ones suit yours?
-As for me,

421
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,663
I like the personality type that has
either S or T.

422
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:21,133
In that sense,
your personality type is very nice.

423
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,468
I thought you were an extrovert

424
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,837
because you were cheerful on TV.

425
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,707
You make us feel at ease,
so I took you for an extrovert.

426
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,976
I guess that on the inside…

427
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,511
-I'm different.
-You're soft-hearted.

428
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,848
I'm definitely not an extrovert.

429
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,851
I have to be alone when I rest.

430
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:43,055
You're the type to listen to music,
read a book, and go on a stroll.

431
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,560
What kind of date do you enjoy?

432
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,396
-The thing is,
-Okay.

433
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,867
I haven't been on many dates.

434
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,803
-It depends on who you're with.
-That's right.

435
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:02,841
-That's right. It depends on who I'm with.
-It's different.

436
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,409
I like simple dates.

437
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,712
I enjoy taking a stroll together.

438
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,782
Some people like outdoor activities.

439
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:13,352
I'm not a big fan of outdoor activities.

440
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:14,586
For example…

441
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:15,754
How should I put it?

442
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:19,124
-Something like rock climbing.
-Rock climbing.

443
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,759
I don't like that. It makes you sweaty.

444
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:26,532
I enjoy going on a stroll too.
I like simple dates.

445
00:19:26,598 --> 00:19:30,369
I enjoy eating <i>tteokbokki</i>
and listening to music together.

446
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:31,737
I'm serious.

447
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:34,773
But your outfit is perfect
for outdoor activities.

448
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,008
Right now, I'm feeling warm again.

449
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,210
-I cooled down earlier.
-You cooled down earlier.

450
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,745
But I'm sweating again.

451
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:41,213
Yes.

452
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,583
<i>One minute remains.</i>

453
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,118
-Time passes so quickly.
-So quickly.

454
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,553
Only one minute remains.

455
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,321
-I thought 30 minutes were long.
-I know.

456
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:50,756
Seriously,

457
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,025
it was nice to get to know you.

458
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,527
You speak as if you won't see him again.

459
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,666
Do you have any more questions for me?

460
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,334
-Me?
-It's okay if you don't have any.

461
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,603
-I do have questions, but…
-I have so many questions.

462
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,737
Time passed so quickly.

463
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,306
Since you've had something to eat,

464
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,641
it'll be nice if you can relax

465
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:11,877
and continue on with the conversation.

466
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,448
What should I do?

467
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,618
It's hard.

468
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:22,487
It's really hard.

469
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,656
-Of course, it's hard.
-It must be hard to choose one.
