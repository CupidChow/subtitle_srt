1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,409
<i>Yeeun, you must now choose one</i>

2
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,011
<i>of the two dates.</i>

3
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:15,281
I'm not a big fan of outdoor activities.

4
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,783
I don't like that. It makes you sweaty.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,252
I have to be alone when I rest.

6
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:22,455
You're the type to listen to music,
read a book, and go on a stroll.

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,057
I'll cut it for you.

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,925
"THE SWEET OLDER MAN, KIM SUNGJUN"

9
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:26,993
You're a sweet guy.

10
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,300
I prefer older men.

11
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,002
You'll change your mind today.

12
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:40,073
Although I'm younger than you,

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,342
I'm not a young man.

14
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,644
It depends on which dessert you like.

15
00:00:45,612 --> 00:00:47,080
I make sure we don't need to wait.

16
00:00:50,483 --> 00:00:53,787
<i>Yeeun, please put a rose</i>
<i>on the hand of the man</i>

17
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:57,123
<i>you'd like to go on</i>
<i>a one-on-one date with.</i>

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,763
<i>Gentlemen, please keep your eyes closed</i>
<i>until the end.</i>

19
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,134
<i>Please choose in three seconds.</i>

20
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,636
<i>Three,</i>

21
00:01:09,702 --> 00:01:10,937
-<i>two…</i>
-Chewy candy!

22
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,505
<i>…one.</i>

23
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,973
<i>Please choose one.</i>

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,409
"WHO WILL YEEUN CHOOSE?"

25
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:19,079
<i>Please open your eyes.</i>

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,215
<i>Kim Kwangtae is out.</i>

27
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:27,220
"YEEUN CHOSE KIM SUNGJUN"

28
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,422
-I mean…
-Thank you for coming.

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,091
I didn't know what it was.

30
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:33,726
I got green onions.

31
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:35,862
Okay.

32
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,199
<i>I wish I could've shown myself more.</i>

33
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:41,901
<i>We didn't get to talk much</i>
<i>since it was a two-in-one date.</i>

34
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,804
<i>I thought, "Yeeun definitely prefers</i>
<i>older guys."</i>

35
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,606
<i>I could feel that.</i>

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,145
Should I keep it on or what?

37
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,482
I hadn't talked much,

38
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,317
so I was very nervous.

39
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,018
You're funny.

40
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,225
I just feel like it's easier

41
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,526
to talk to him.

42
00:02:06,593 --> 00:02:09,262
I can joke around more
since he puts me at ease.

43
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,363
That was why I chose him.

44
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,567
"SUNGJUN, TWO WINS"

45
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,469
-I haven't had a meal, so…
-60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>

46
00:02:16,536 --> 00:02:17,904
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

47
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,340
<i>One-on-one date with the older twin,</i>
<i>Kim Sungjun,</i>

48
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:22,642
-<i>begins now!</i>
-The older twin.

49
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,912
It's nice to meet you.

50
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,814
-It's nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

51
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,948
I said it one more time.

52
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,517
"I SAID IT ONE MORE TIME"

53
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:31,651
Is it hot for you?

54
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:32,752
It's hot.

55
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,420
I brought a fan since it was hot.

56
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:42,195
It's okay. You need this more.

57
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,663
All right.

58
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,465
Did you bring this fan?

59
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,867
There are so many things
I want to do for you.

60
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,336
I knew that giving you another chewy candy
wouldn't be enough,

61
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,172
so I prepared a fan.

62
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,709
I want to use this time

63
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:58,378
-to talk to you at ease.
-Right.

64
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,512
I'm at ease.

65
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,847
The thing is, I…

66
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:05,285
Between you and Kwangtae,

67
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,355
I chose you because you made me feel
more comfortable.

68
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,893
I don't make you feel comfortable
like a friend, right?

69
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,763
That was what my brother, Sunghun, did.

70
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,198
-He was like that.
-Okay.

71
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:19,866
But I'm not like that.

72
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,405
Did you know that I'd choose you?

73
00:03:25,905 --> 00:03:27,073
To be honest, I had no idea.

74
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,142
-Really?
-There was a reason why I had no idea.

75
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,378
While the other guy talked,
I looked for the right time to interject.

76
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,683
-But I didn't get many chances to do that.
-Right.

77
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:40,086
We had talked for about an hour
beforehand.

78
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:43,122
Also, you kept looking this way.

79
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,457
"YOU KEPT LOOKING THIS WAY"

80
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:47,026
-Also…
-He was the new guy…

81
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:48,328
-Right.
-…so I had to talk to him.

82
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,296
-We had talked for a while.
-Right.

83
00:03:50,363 --> 00:03:51,798
I had to talk to him.

84
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,399
-Right.
-That was why.

85
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:55,401
But your side profile was pretty.

86
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,204
Watching you was enough.

87
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,107
Which side is prettier,
the left or the right?

88
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:02,609
I think the left side is prettier.

89
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:03,676
The left side?

90
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,980
-The left side.
-I stared at only the left side earlier.

91
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:09,849
This is fun, right?

92
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:13,853
-It's your first time doing this.
-Yes, it is.

93
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,888
It's your first time meeting many men.

94
00:04:15,955 --> 00:04:16,956
How is it?

95
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,525
I don't get many chances to meet men.

96
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,927
-That's right. Seriously.
-So,

97
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,230
I think I'll get to find out
what kind of men I like.

98
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,000
-You haven't dated many people.
-Not at all.

99
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:28,401
I haven't dated many people.

100
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,036
I haven't dated many people either.

101
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:33,206
But I think I learn more about myself
as I date women.

102
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,009
-I keep seeing your cute side.
-Right.

103
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:40,246
Even now, I'm realizing
that I like that side in women.

104
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,484
-You put them together like puzzle pieces.
-You're right.

105
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,853
All of my dates have been great.

106
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,421
-Of course.
-Yes.

107
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,257
Which celebrities do you like?

108
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:52,925
I… I'll be honest with you.

109
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,627
-Seriously, be honest.
-Really?

110
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,862
Han Sohee.

111
00:04:55,928 --> 00:04:57,897
"HAN SOHEE"

112
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,234
Han Sohee is the sexy type.

113
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,770
Yes. She's too different from me.

114
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,539
That's right. But I like someone
who's cuter than Han Sohee.

115
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:07,807
I think you like sexy women.

116
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:08,908
No! I really don't.

117
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,210
-Go and find a sexy woman.
-No. I shouldn't have said that.

118
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,612
It's hot in here.

119
00:05:12,679 --> 00:05:13,980
It's hot in here.

120
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,348
It's hot, right?

121
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:16,749
It's hot in here.

122
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,718
-It's cool now, right?
-You can stop now.

123
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,955
I won't use the word "sexy" again.

124
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,490
You've used it many times already.

125
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,591
I won't use it again.

126
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:32,098
-Not much time remains.
-How many minutes?

127
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,067
-Is it 8 minutes?
-We have 8 minutes and 50 seconds.

128
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,640
-Let's say you go on a date with me.
-Okay.

129
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:41,874
If that happens,

130
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,376
is there a date you have in mind?

131
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,912
-I want to go someplace cool.
-Someplace cool. Right.

132
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,347
I want to go to Japan with you.

133
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,815
-You like desserts, so…
-With me?

134
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:50,016
Yes.

135
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,720
I thought about going to Japan with you
for the next date.

136
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,355
-So…
-You have a great imagination.

137
00:05:55,421 --> 00:05:56,556
That was just a thought I had.

138
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:57,790
You're free to imagine.

139
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,559
-Right?
-Yes, you're free to imagine.

140
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:02,095
I also imagine things as I watch dramas.

141
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,365
It's just like that.
You're the main character to me.

142
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,604
Are you trying to be funny?

143
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:13,272
I want to make you feel comfortable.

144
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:15,641
-I can feel it. I feel comfortable.
-Really?

145
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:19,112
Yes. I think you've put me at ease
by joking around.

146
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,548
To put you further at ease, I prepared
an acrostic poem with your initials.

147
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,083
"I PREPARED AN ACROSTIC POEM FOR YOU"

148
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:29,622
-Please start with the first letter.
-J.

149
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,457
Just like now…

150
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:32,592
Y.

151
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:34,227
Yeeun, go on a date with me.

152
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,195
"JUST LIKE NOW, YEEUN,
GO ON A DATE WITH ME"

153
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:37,597
-E.
-Escape with me.

154
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,265
"ESCAPE WITH ME"

155
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,337
It was good, right?

156
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,073
I can't stop sweating.

157
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,975
I'm sweating because you didn't say
that it was good.

158
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,311
It wasn't bad, right?

159
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,348
Yeeun, do it with my initials.

160
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,816
Kim Sungjun.

161
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,285
Yes?

162
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,421
-S.
-Stop being so rash.

163
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:02,588
"KIM SUNGJUN, STOP BEING SO RASH"

164
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,656
That doesn't sound good.

165
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,591
-Okay. J.
-Just stop it.

166
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:06,692
"JUST STOP IT"

167
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,861
-"Just shut it?"
-Just stop it.

168
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,163
"Just stop it?" You startled me.

169
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,064
I thought you said, "Just shut it."

170
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,735
You startled me.

171
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:22,141
Since you're meeting many people,
the conversation topics must overlap.

172
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:23,576
It must be exhausting.

173
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,678
Even when I go to a cafe with a friend,

174
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:28,648
I don't spend more than an hour there.

175
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:29,715
I'm the same.

176
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:37,490
"SUNGJUN AND YEEUN HAVE ALREADY SPENT
TWO HOURS TOGETHER"

177
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:39,425
Only five minutes remain.

178
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,327
Five minutes? Five minutes is too long.

179
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:45,231
"FIVE MINUTES IS TOO LONG"

180
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,701
We've spent enough time together.
Think about it. We've talked for so long.

181
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:51,604
Thirty minutes would've felt short,

182
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,206
but we've talked for two hours.

183
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,908
-Right.
-I think I can show a different side.

184
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,112
-You've become comfortable, right?
-Yes.

185
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:01,914
People might say,
"Behave during a blind date!"

186
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,350
-Right.
-But we've talked for too long.

187
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,118
That's good.
I love that we've become closer.

188
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:08,120
-We've become closer.
-We've become closer for real.

189
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,822
I've become comfortable.

190
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,957
I see.

191
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,625
Thank you.

192
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:15,895
-So, you feel closer now.
-I've never had such a comfortable date.

193
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,396
-That's bad.
-It's nice.

194
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,332
-Although it's comfortable…
-It's very comfortable.

195
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:23,135
Although it's very comfortable,
there should be a bit of tension.

196
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,470
That's how it is for me.

197
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,175
You've been very entertaining.

198
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,943
Let's be comfortable together.

199
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,279
We'll need to talk
for an additional 30 minutes anyway.

200
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,647
One minute remains.

201
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:38,084
We have 1 minute and 30 seconds.

202
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,520
Now, it's 1 minute and 15 seconds, right?

203
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,654
Be comfortable.

204
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:42,722
Let's be comfortable.

205
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:43,890
Be comfortable.

206
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:45,024
Let's be comfortable.

207
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:48,427
I'm curious about the next man.

208
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:49,996
I know.

209
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,197
Right? Relax.

210
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,665
-Let's relax.
-Relax like this.

214
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:06,679
Hello.

215
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,782
Are you serious?

216
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,856
-Hello.
-Hello.

217
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:20,893
RO SEUNGHYEOK, CONTEMPORARY DANCER

218
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,628
THREE YEARS YOUNGER THAN YEEUN, INFJ

219
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,499
For a date with you, I brought flowers.

220
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:27,567
What?

221
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:29,802
Oh, my!

222
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:30,870
What?

223
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,341
This is insane.

224
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,878
I fell in love with you at first sight,

225
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,547
so I came here with flowers.

226
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,283
Thank you.

227
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:47,620
Hold on a second.

228
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,891
I got this flower from Yeeun.

229
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,094
That came out of nowhere.

230
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,133
This flower…

231
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,269
You whipped out a flower from your chest.

232
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,771
It's a wet rose.

233
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:08,207
I'll give it to you.

234
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,344
A wet rose?

235
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,447
A wet rose is a bit…

236
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,582
No, it's okay.

237
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,919
I gave it to you.

238
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:21,420
Shall I keep it then?

239
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,155
Okay.

240
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,227
It's an honor to see you in person.

241
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,363
I'm a big fan of <i>SNL</i>.

242
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:33,733
-You were so charming on the show.
-Really?

243
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,968
Yes. So, I wanted to see you in person.

244
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,336
<i>SNL</i>.

245
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:39,605
Yes. I can't believe I'm here.

246
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,140
Seriously. You came here

247
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,575
-with flowers.
-Well,

248
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,779
seeing you smile makes me very happy.

249
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,382
Thank you.

250
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,756
How old are you?

251
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,924
I'm 29 years old.

252
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,060
I'm a contemporary dancer.

253
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,395
"SEUNGHYEOK IS
A CONTEMPORARY DANCER"

254
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,296
Contemporary dance.

255
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:08,000
I had initially planned to do 20 turns
as I entered.

256
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,404
But the red carpet made it hard
to do turns.

257
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:14,740
-Yes.
-Thank you for coming.

258
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:15,808
Thank you so much.

259
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,343
You're more beautiful in person.

260
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,412
Thank you.

261
00:11:20,212 --> 00:11:22,048
Did you enjoy a conversation with him?

262
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,783
We talked for two hours.

263
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,418
-It was very fun.
-We talked for too long.

264
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:27,453
But he made it very entertaining.

265
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,754
-Was it entertaining?
-Yes.

266
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:31,057
He made it seriously entertaining.

267
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,591
I'm really thankful.

268
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,694
Now that I've joined the group,

269
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,830
-I'll make sure 30 minutes feels like…
-Right.

270
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,465
…three minutes.

271
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,938
I'm most curious about
the things you like.

272
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,173
-The things I like?
-Yes.

273
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:49,742
I enjoy decorating my home

274
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,611
and relaxing indoors.

275
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,715
-You mentioned decorating your home.
-Yes.

276
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,016
How did you decorate it?

277
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,818
I gave it a cozy atmosphere.

278
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,554
-Is it white-toned?
-It's ivory-toned.

279
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,621
Yes.

280
00:12:03,022 --> 00:12:04,690
I heard that

281
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:08,461
ivory and white were the best colors
for a cozy atmosphere.

282
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,200
Black is a color that creates
a somber atmosphere for men.

283
00:12:16,001 --> 00:12:17,036
I'm not somber.

284
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,738
You look very somber today.

285
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,074
That must be why you wore ivory.

286
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:24,844
Beige.

287
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,278
This way, my color is beige.

288
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,480
Seriously…

289
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,017
Beige… I see.

290
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,252
It's beige.

291
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:34,453
Dark beige.

292
00:12:36,655 --> 00:12:41,460
I like to match my outfit
to that of the person I like.

293
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:45,464
I had a feeling that you'd wear
light-toned clothes today.

294
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,767
I was going to wear navy,

295
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,903
-but I switched to white and ivory.
-That outfit suits you.

296
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,171
-Really?
-Yes.

297
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,342
This isn't the right outfit
for the occasion.

298
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,043
But I wanted to leave a strong impression.

299
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,745
-It definitely left a strong impression.
-I'm glad.

300
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,413
-It left a powerful impression.
-I'm glad.

301
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:04,283
I'll wear white next time.

302
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,454
-Actually, he's someone I know.
-Really?

303
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,122
-Yes.
-I didn't know that he'd be here.

304
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,758
-He's someone I know.
-How do you know him?

305
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,193
How do you know him?

306
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,562
-We exercise together.
-Yes.

307
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,963
Our works overlap.

308
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,031
-Really?
-Yes.

309
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:21,534
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

310
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:25,905
Same here. I was filled with excitement
as I entered

311
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,607
and saw a man who looked like a tiger
from the back.

312
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,076
I can't believe you guys met like this.

313
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,514
-What's your ideal type?
-Seriously.

314
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,117
I'm attracted to people who have
a beautiful smile with their eyes.

315
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:39,418
That's me.

316
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:42,521
"HIS HEART FLUTTERS"

317
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,423
I think I can go home happy now.

318
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,229
You have a beautiful smile.

319
00:13:52,698 --> 00:13:55,100
If you keep doing that, I'll melt.

320
00:13:55,701 --> 00:13:57,503
It's already hot in here.

321
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,604
This is fun.

322
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,839
I'll melt.

323
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:05,811
Have you dated a lot?

324
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:08,581
No, I haven't dated many people.

325
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:13,652
I need to like the woman more
for the relationship to last long.

326
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,890
If I like someone,
I'm the one who makes a move.

327
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:19,992
How about you?

328
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:23,596
I like someone who takes the lead.

329
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,998
I follow along if I'm interested.

330
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,703
-You don't make the first move.
-I never make the first move.

331
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:33,772
If you come to like someone,

332
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,175
how do you express your interest?

333
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,243
I can't.

334
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,510
-Not at all?
-Yes.

335
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,778
-I just can't do it.
-Really?

336
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:42,314
In many cases,
I simply give up after a while.

337
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,716
I just can't do it.

338
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:47,519
They never know if I like them.

339
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,855
I don't show my feelings.

340
00:14:51,156 --> 00:14:53,259
I guess you're not the type to show
your feelings too much.

341
00:14:53,325 --> 00:14:55,160
-No.
-I can be affectionate instead.

342
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:01,433
I'm very affectionate.

343
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:06,238
A man who is affectionate versus

344
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:09,875
a man who bottles himself up
and only shows affection when you ask.

345
00:15:13,812 --> 00:15:15,347
I prefer an affectionate man.

346
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,249
"AN AFFECTIONATE BOYFRIEND"

347
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,518
-An affectionate man?
-Yes.

348
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,786
Yeeun, I like you so much.

349
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:29,995
However, I don't say what I don't mean.

350
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,264
I just tell a pretty woman
that she's pretty.

351
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:35,734
-I don't say what isn't in my heart.
-That's right.

352
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:37,670
I don't do that either.

353
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:39,872
I'm serious.

354
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,542
Now, I'm like that heart.

355
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,381
That's the love inside my heart.

356
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,650
Don't you think you fell in love
way too quickly?

357
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:53,652
If you say that you already love me,
it's a lie.

358
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:55,621
It isn't like that.
That heart is small, right?

359
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,523
My love will become bigger.

360
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,526
-Shouldn't you speak with actions?
-No.

361
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,661
How am I supposed to do that?

362
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,930
Speak with actions?

363
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,909
Oh, my.

364
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:20,112
She'll die!

365
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,680
If you shoot her, she'll die.

366
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,382
-Oh, my.
-If you shoot her, she'll die.

367
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,951
When he talked about that heart,

368
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:28,654
that was the choreography I thought of.

369
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,291
This is hard.

370
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,093
Seven minutes remain.

371
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,962
-It's such a short time.
-I should use that time to the fullest

372
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,798
to prove myself, right?

373
00:16:43,902 --> 00:16:46,905
Let me show you the moves first.

374
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:48,640
This is how it goes.

375
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,778
From this move…

376
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:54,613
That startled me.

377
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:57,349
You're cool!

378
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,018
You're cool!

379
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:03,856
You're cool.

380
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,760
Like that,

381
00:17:07,826 --> 00:17:10,329
I can express myself

382
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:12,498
just by stretching out my arms.

383
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:14,867
-Just now…
-You stretched out your arms.

384
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,836
…I told you that I liked you
through my movements.

385
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,043
May I give it a try?

386
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,678
-Okay.
-I'll show you a pose.

387
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:31,350
Hold on.

388
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,553
These are my triceps.

389
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,155
I'm sorry.

390
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,258
I'm sorry. I want to keep going,

391
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:41,827
but I don't know how to dance.
I'm so sorry.

392
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,263
Still, I wanted to show you
the lines of my body as he has.

393
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,131
-What was that pose?
-Just like him,

394
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:47,399
I showed the lines of my arms

395
00:17:47,466 --> 00:17:49,835
-and flaunted my triceps.
-That was your pose.

396
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,003
But I got a bit nervous.

397
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:53,539
This is tricky.

398
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,911
Do you prefer a man
who is very muscular or slightly muscular?

399
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,579
"VERY MUSCULAR VERSUS SLIGHTLY MUSCULAR"

400
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,747
A man who is slightly muscular.

401
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,948
"A MAN WHO IS SLIGHTLY MUSCULAR"

402
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:05,484
A man who is slightly muscular?
Shall I pull up my sleeves?

403
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,420
Sure.

404
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,289
I prefer a guy with a moderate build.

405
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:12,124
I have more fat than him,

406
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,859
so I'm not that muscular.

407
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:20,666
Do you enjoy exercising?

408
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:22,401
I absolutely love exercising.

409
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,937
Since my body fat percentage is very low,

410
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:27,539
the muscles of my body
don't get pumped up.

411
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:30,909
They just get divided up
while staying the same in size.

412
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:32,511
We have different body types.

413
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,746
You have a really beautiful physique.
When you stood up,

414
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,715
you looked really fit.

415
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,784
-Thanks for the compliment.
-Seriously.

416
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:40,752
A man should be cool, not beautiful.

417
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,624
A man

418
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,594
who looks the coolest when he's working

419
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,761
-is the best.
-I agree.

420
00:18:49,828 --> 00:18:52,698
I'll probably fall in love
if I see you when you're working.

421
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:57,769
I know that you're at your best

422
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:02,174
and most attractive when you're working.

423
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:03,275
You're good.

424
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:08,313
Thus, I wanted to show you what I could do
to the best of my ability.

425
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:11,416
Are you very thirsty?

426
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:13,819
I want some more, but there's no coffee.

427
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,954
-You drank so many cups of coffee today.
-I know.

428
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,593
-Do you currently do contemporary dance?
-That's right.

429
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,129
I currently teach people
and perform on stage.

430
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,033
-Come and watch me perform next time.
-For real.

431
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,335
-Come and see me for real.
-I bet it'll be very cool.

432
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,405
If you want to come,
I'll welcome you anytime.

433
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,674
The two of us can go together.

434
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:41,847
It's off-limits for men.

435
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:42,948
Is it off-limits for men?

436
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,017
-I didn't know.
-Men can't come.

437
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,084
I didn't know.

438
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,962
Seriously. Oh, no.
Only three minutes remain.

439
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:04,269
I thought 30 minutes was
a long period of time.

440
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:09,374
I thought I'd be able to learn
a lot about you in 30 minutes.

441
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:10,976
But time passed so quickly.

442
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:14,079
Was there anything you wanted to say or do

443
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:15,981
upon coming here?

444
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,118
I had a long script in my head.

445
00:20:20,185 --> 00:20:22,354
I just ended up saying upon entering,

446
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:24,489
"You're pretty. I like you."

447
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,925
Those were my sincere feelings for you.

448
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,394
Making you understand them
was my priority.

449
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,731
Gosh.

450
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,968
Thank you so much for coming.

451
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,169
Both of you.

452
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,572
We can talk more during the next date.

453
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,376
I came all the way here
to have another date with you.

454
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,282
What am I going to do?

455
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,919
I'm going through the busiest week,

456
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,922
but I took this day off to see you.

457
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:59,358
I saved this day in red on the calendar

458
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,159
since it was the most important day.

459
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,329
Seriously, what am I going to do?

460
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,566
<i>One minute remains.</i>

461
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,268
I know. Seriously.

462
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,005
-Time passed so quickly.
-What am I going to do?

463
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:16,842
I'm satisfied that I got to see you
on a nice day with the perfect weather.

464
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:17,909
Well,

465
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,479
if you pick me for the next date,

466
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,283
we'll be able to make more memories
and have fun.

467
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,386
-But seeing you for 30 minutes was enough
-Really?

468
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,254
to make me happy.

469
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:33,792
Thank you.

470
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,129
Seriously, this is hard.

471
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,164
It must be hard.

472
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,767
-What am I going to do?
-<i>Five…</i>

473
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,235
-Not much time remains.
-<i>…four,</i>

474
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,303
<i>three,</i>

475
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,837
<i>two, one.</i>

476
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,939
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

477
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:50,309
"BLIND DATE ENDS"

478
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,211
-<i>Yeeun, you must now choose one…</i>
-Thirty minutes passed so fast.

479
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,080
<i>…of the two dates.</i>

480
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:59,017
<i>Please get up and move</i>
<i>to the back of the man of your choice.</i>

481
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:00,152
I don't know what to do.

482
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:03,488
<i>Gentlemen, please get up from your seats.</i>

483
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:10,095
I like you, Yeeun.

484
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:12,798
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO"

485
00:22:13,598 --> 00:22:15,067
This is so hard.

486
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,642
<i>Kim Sunghun is out.</i>

487
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,545
"HE BEAT HIS TWIN BROTHER, KIM SUNGHUN,
AND TOOK THE FIRST WIN"

488
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,814
<i>Kim Kwangtae is out.</i>

489
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,084
"HE BEAT KIM KWANGTAE FROM EXCHANGE 3
AND TOOK THE SECOND WIN"

490
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,487
IF HE GETS CHOSEN THIS TIME,
HE'LL BECOME A ROMANTIC INTEREST

491
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,389
A NEW FACE IS HERE TO STOP HIM

492
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:39,324
I brought flowers.

493
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:41,793
I fell in love with you at first sight…

494
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,230
You're more beautiful in person.

495
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,698
Yeeun, I like you so much.

496
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:52,637
YEEUN'S BIGGEST FAN, RO SEUNGHYEOK

KIM SUNGJUN VERSUS RO SEUNGHYEOK

498
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:58,643
WHO WILL YEEUN CHOOSE?

499
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,080
<i>To the man you'd like to go on</i>
<i>a one-on-one date with,</i>

500
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,282

501
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,952
<i>and make a cheek heart.</i>

<i>Please choose in three seconds.</i>

503
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,957
