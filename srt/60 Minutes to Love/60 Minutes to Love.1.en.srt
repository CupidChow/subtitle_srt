-Yes.

I haven't watched <i>My Sibling's Romance</i>.

113
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:09,676
I see. I like it better that way.

114
00:05:10,176 --> 00:05:11,144
That might be better.

115
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,280
I have brothers, so I don't want to
watch anything with "sibling" in it.

116
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,548
I see.

117
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:16,683

118
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:18,818

Is your actual personality similar
to what we see on TV?

124
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:34,233
I was very curious about it.

125
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,902
-That side is me.
-Right.

126
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,037
The other side is me as well.

127
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:41,107
-But I need to gather up my energy
-You need to do that.

128
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,111
for my TV personality.
But I think that side is me as well.

129
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:50,283
-But I'm not like that when I'm alone.
-Right.

130
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,585
I'm actually very introverted.

131
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,753

For the longest time,
my ideal type was Han Goeun.

152

She used to be my ideal type.

153
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,504

I was into women with a classy vibe.

158
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,954
But now, I like women
who give off a cheerful vibe.

159

optimistic, bubbly, and energetic,

I have fun.

161
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:16,469
I really like having fun.

162
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,372

the wrong path."

173

"She wouldn't go about life

174

with a kind heart.

180

Don't you care about his appearance?

182
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:23,769
Even if he looks attractive,
if our personalities don't match,

183
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,905
I can't develop feelings for him.

184

-Extremely hard.

188
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:36,349

-Same here.
-Me too.

190
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:40,052
But there's no place to meet
people organically.

I've been feeling a bit lonely lately.

209
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,331
-It's the same for me. I'm lonely,
-Yes.

210
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,367
but there's nowhere to meet someone.

Love over work?

212
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,205

-Good answer.

214
00:09:38,544 --> 00:09:39,545

-He does.

Have you heard of bread with pea paste?

244

-Pea.
-Green filling.

00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,239
and I didn't feel anything,

354
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,875
I thought, "I guess I'm going home now."

355
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:13,312
-I wanted to talk to you more.
-I see.

356
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,513
Thank you.

357
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,915
We didn't get much time.

358
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,683
We only had 30 minutes.

359
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,984
You're right. Time flew by.

360
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,787
Now that we're closer, it's more…

361
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,056
-We're too close.
-I know.

362
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,227
Your face is so small.

363
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:29,929
Your face is so small.

364
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,633
It's incredible you have
all the features in such a small face.

365
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,202
Thank you.

366
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,439
-I'm prettier in person, right?
-Yes.

367
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,874
Really?

368
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,008
Totally.

369
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,877
Please spread the word.

370
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,878
Okay.

371
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:53,319
I think people who make others laugh

372
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,087
are the smartest.

373
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:55,988
I agree.

374
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:57,122
"THAT'S ME"

375
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:00,392
I love comedy.

376
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,894
-You've always loved comedy?
-Yes.

377
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,697
You studied acting
at a very prestigious school.

378
00:16:05,164 --> 00:16:06,966
-Korea National University of Arts.
-Yes.

379
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,867
Yes. Only geniuses…

380
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,169
-Only geniuses go there.
-Yes.

381
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:14,974
That was why I liked it.

382
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,710
I knew that people who did comedy were

383
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:20,279
-extremely smart.
-That's right.

384
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:24,316
Is there anything you want to do
when you start dating someone?

385
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,752
-Going on a drive.
-A drive.

386
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,987
-I think it'll be very nice.
-Yes.

387
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,657
I enjoy taking a walk
when the weather is nice.

388
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,925
You enjoy exercising, right?

389
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,860
I do enjoy exercising.

390
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,830
Do you exercise out of enjoyment
or do you feel like you have to do it?

391
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:39,365
I enjoy exercising.

392
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,600
But after reaching a certain age,

393
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,335
it has become a necessity of sorts.

394
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,670
You know, to stay fit.

395
00:16:45,237 --> 00:16:46,271
Do you enjoy exercising?

396
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,278
No, I don't.

397
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,849
Taking a walk is an exercise too.

398
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,752
That's right. I love walking.
I can walk for a long time.

399
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:02,154
-I see.
-I can walk for three hours.

400
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:03,989
-Three hours?
-Yes.

401
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,424
But the weather has to be nice.

402
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,694
-If the weather is bad, I stay at home.
-I see.

403
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,362
What do you do in your free time?

404
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,765
I stay at home.

405
00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:15,634
I enjoy going to karaoke alone.

406
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,835
-Alone?
-Yes.

407
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,204
I sing alone for two hours at a time.

408
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,539
-Without drinks?
-Yes.

409
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:21,807
-You just go sober?
-Yes.

410
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,142
I go to coin karaoke.

411
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,843
-Coin karaoke.
-Yes.

412
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,911
Don't you like karaoke?

413
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,381
I like going to one.
But I prefer listening to others.

414
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,250
-Really?
-What's your go-to song?

415
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,619
I released an album!
Haven't you listened to it?

416
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:35,087
Really?

417
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,091
I'll look it up.

418
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,492
-I'll look it up.
-Well…

419
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,264
You don't like me, do you?

420
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,534
You didn't even care
to do that much research?

421
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,904
If I know everything,
there won't be anything to talk about.

422
00:17:53,705 --> 00:17:54,740
I'll have a listen.

423
00:17:54,807 --> 00:17:55,774
It's a great song.

424
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,809
What's the title?

425
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:57,976
<i>Milk shake</i>.

426
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:00,012
-<i>Milk Shake</i>.
-<i>Milk Shake</i>.

427
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,548
That song came to be
while drinking a milkshake.

428
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:04,249
I'll have a listen while drinking it.

429
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,618
Yes. I love milkshake.

430
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:11,023
I think I sang pretty well.

431
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,159
Apparently, my voice is pretty.

432
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,427
-Your voice?
-Yes.

433
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,234
-Appearance-wise--
-<i>Three minutes remain.</i>

434
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,139
<i>Three minutes remain.</i>

435
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,475
Two minutes.

436
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,612
I'm the same
as what you've seen on TV, right?

437
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,281
Yes, but you're
definitely different in some ways too.

438
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,184
How am I different?

439
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:43,722
I thought that you might be someone

440
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,359
who only has cheerful vibes.

441
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:50,129
-But you aren't all that.
-I'm introverted.

442
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:54,199
Then you suddenly show an upbeat side.

443
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,367
You show big reactions.

444
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,902
I think I always have big reactions.

445
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,036
I find that fun.

446
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,543
<i>Five seconds remain.</i>

447
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,712
Oh, my. Time passed so quickly.

448
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:10,415
It was nice meeting you.

449
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,484
-It was nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

450
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,454
-They're bringing it back.
-Yeah.

451
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,191
Thank you.

457
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,553
This is insane.

458
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,989
Oh, geez.

459
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,024
What was that?

460
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,726
-Oh, my. Hello.

Oh, my.

466
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,740
-It's good to see you.
-I didn't expect you here.

467
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,209
"DO THEY KNOW EACH OTHER?"

468
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:11,276
-What a surprise.
-Yes.

469
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,145
Today, we meet as enemies.

470
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:14,346
-Oh, my.
-Enemies.

471
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:16,114
-Have you guys met?
-You're right.

472
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:18,917
We're in the same soccer club.

473
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:20,319
Didn't you know that he'd be here?

474
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,520
-I didn't know.
-No.

475
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,388
It's crazy you're meeting each other here.

476
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:24,923
Do you remember me?

477
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,458
Do you remember me?

478
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,426
Yes, I do.

479
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,928
You haven't forgotten about me.

480
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:31,663
We've met once.

481
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,131
How do you guys know each other?

482
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,200
We've met once.

483
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,337
-At a private gathering,
-You guys know each other.

484
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,005
-we've met once.
-We've met once.

485

A private gathering?

486
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,008
-You know,
-A private gathering.

487
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,710
I got rejected once.

488
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,945
-What's wrong with you?
-So I want to try again today.
