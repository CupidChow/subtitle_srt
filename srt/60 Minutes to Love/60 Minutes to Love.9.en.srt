00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:02,315
Someone who gives off a soft peach energy.

177
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,483
-A soft peach?
-A soft peach.

178
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,384
Someone who's lovely and cheerful.

179
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,221
When it comes to personality,
I like someone who's soft-spoken.

180
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,323
-Someone who's soft-spoken? I see.
-Yes.

181
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,658
-When I was young…
-Okay.

182
00:08:12,725 --> 00:08:15,428
…I liked women who looked fierce.

183
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,831
But I became a fan of yours
partly because of your appearance.

184
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,100
I like women who look gentle and kind now.

185
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:22,869
What's your ideal type?

186
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,936
A caring man.

187
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,139
-A caring man is the best.
-A man who's affectionate as well.

188
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,207
Yes.

189
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:31,410
I was well-known as the caring guy
when I was on a show last year.

190
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,480
-Really?
-Yes.

191
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,415
-I was on <i>I'm Solo</i>.
-Okay.

192
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:37,617
I didn't watch that season.

193
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,285
I watch <i>I'm Solo</i> often.

194
00:08:39,552 --> 00:08:43,656
You were very busy around that time.

195
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:45,024
-Will I see it on the show?
-Yes.

196
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,093
Other people have told me

197
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,829
that I'm sweet to my girlfriend.

198
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,965
-Yes.
-I think I'm also nice to my girlfriend.

199
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:56,536
I don't look that way,

200
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,006
but I show a lot of affection
in a cute way.

201
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:06,212
People find me difficult to approach
when we meet for the first time.

202
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,115
You know, my appearance is a bit…

203
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:11,050
I look like I'm angry.

204
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,952
-You look intimidating.
-That's right.

205
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,053
However,

206
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,956
I don't care how other people see me.

207
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,492
I just need to be good to my girlfriend.

208
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:20,927
You're right.

209
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,397
What are you usually like
in a relationship?

210
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:28,734
I'm not sure because I haven't been
in many relationships.

211
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,470
My last relationship lasted a long time.

212
00:09:33,172 --> 00:09:36,075
I think I'll be different
when I meet someone now.

213
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,209
Now,

214
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,212
I've become a mature adult.

215
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,715
-I've become an adult.
-Right.

216
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,351
I also work diligently.

217
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,024
-So…
-You'll have a mature relationship.

218
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,127
-I think so. I also read a lot.
-Now…

219
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,431
Is reading your hobby?

220
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,366
I try to read.

221
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,134
Same here.

222
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:05,838
Same here.

223
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,673
-I try to read.
-Reading.

224
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,309
Which book did you enjoy reading recently?

225
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:13,746
-It's too much of a religious talk, but…
-Okay.

226
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,381
-I know that you're Christian.
-Really?

227
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,750
I read a book titled <i>Why Jesus</i>.

228
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:22,488
When you're struggling…

229
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,892
-Your mind…
-Religion can be a consolation.

230
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,995
I agree. I also think
religions are important.

231
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,297
-Do you have a religion?
-I'm a Buddhist.

232
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,533
But… Well,

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,435
-I can't lie.
-That's funny.

234
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,839
But if you recommend me
the book you've read,

235
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,508
I'll convert to Christianity momentarily

236
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,277
and read it with care.

237
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,447
I'm Christian, so I don't need to convert.

238
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,249
That's right.

239
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:53,953
That's right.

240
00:10:57,123 --> 00:10:58,791
-Are you Christian?
-Yes.

241
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:01,761
I attend a church in Seoul.

242
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:03,929
<i>One minute remains.</i>

243
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:04,997
CHEEZE.

244
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:06,265
-She's nice.
-Cheese?

245
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,834
I watched the music video you were in.

246
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,970
I like the song.

247
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,538
Thank you. How about "Milk Shake?"

248
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,806
Of course, I know the song.

249
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,207
I listen to it on repeat.

250
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,209
-I know the song.
-Do you know it?

251
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,378
-I know the song.
-Do you know it?

252
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:21,313
I received an award yesterday.

253
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,715
Good Influence Award.

254
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,688
You're the best.

255
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,358
<i>Five seconds remain.</i>

256
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:34,827
-<i>Four, three…</i>
-You might win it again next year.

257
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,929
-<i>…two, one.</i>
-I agree. I'll look forward to it.

258
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,498
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

259
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,437
How did you know about that?

260
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,771
Time passed so quickly.

261
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,140
<i>Yeeun, you must now choose one</i>

262
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,942
<i>of the two dates.</i>

263
00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:52,578
-<i>Gentlemen, please get up from your seats…</i>
-What should I do?

264
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:56,615
<i>…and close your eyes</i>
<i>with a bouquet in your hands.</i>

265
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,658
I don't know
because the date was so short.

266
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,163
I really don't know what to do.

267
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,132
What should I do?

268
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,540
I've liked you a lot since <i>SNL</i>.

269
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:22,608
Really?

270
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:24,510
You're much prettier in real life.

271
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,180
Your face looks small on TV as well.

272
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,749
You just look prettier in real life.

273
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,486
"LEE JINSEOK SHOWED HIS INTEREST
FROM THE START"

274
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,023
I actually brought some <i>tteokbokki</i>.

275
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,258
-It's a fried dumpling.
-Okay.

276
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,894
-I brought fruit too. It's shine muscat.
-Thank you.

277
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,864
I'm Christian, so I don't need to convert.

"KIM MINGYU GAVE HIS LAST SPURT"

00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,508

My eyes…

300
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:59,238
I was more drawn to Jinseok.

301
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:01,507
It was a really tough decision.

302
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:04,376
I feel like the first decision is
always the hardest.

303
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:07,513
I chose the one
who caught my attention more.

304
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,248

Really?

311
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,867
Yes.

"JINSEOK CONFESSES TO BEING A FANBOY

314
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,673
I'll ask for your autograph and go home."

315
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,977
I wanted to frame it nicely
and hang it up at home.

316
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,312
Seriously, I'm a fan.

317
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:44,083
You played piano in childhood.

318
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,918
-How do you know that?
-I just do.

319
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:50,389
Bragging about knowing a lot about you
when we've just met

320
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,891
could be off-putting.

321
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,393
That was why I kept quiet.

322
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,230
Seriously. I've watched
so many clips of you.

323
00:14:58,297 --> 00:14:59,398
-Really?
-Yes.

324
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,966
How are you feeling? Be honest.

325
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,002
Well…

326
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,205
I was a bit nervous when I entered.

00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,141
I was being a fanboy.

328
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,745
I feel fine now because I've eased up
during our conversation.

329
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:17,082
I'm serious when I say
that you're much prettier in real life.

330
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,752
Your face is so small.

331
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:20,819
Seriously.

334
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,428
-They go well together.
-When you smile,

335
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,497
-you get upper cheek dimples.
-Upper cheek dimples.

336
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,632
-I love them so much.
-Really?

337
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:35,334
Yes. So, when you smile…

338
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,103
You're smiling more on purpose.

339
00:15:38,971 --> 00:15:39,972
Upper cheek dimples.

340
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:43,375
People used to tease me
for having these dimples.

341
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,678
-Did your friends do that?
-They said that dimples were

342
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,681
-signs of dead skin cells back in the day.
-Really?

343
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,083
That kind of talk is absurd
because your skin is flawless.

344
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:55,287
I think I have pretty good skin.

345
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,956
-Your skin…
-I take good care of my skin.

346
00:15:57,022 --> 00:15:58,557
I do at-home skincare.

347
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,060
You have good skin.

348
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,729
Since I'm a man,

349
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:06,532
I have visible pores up close.

350
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,667
It looks like you've taken good care
of your skin.

351
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,570
I don't know much about skincare.

352
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,640
If I have someone who teaches me about it,

353
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,208
I'll be diligent with it.

354
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,211
You're flirting.

355
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,679
Later on,

356
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,083
when we exchange numbers,

357
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,085
please teach me about at-home skincare.

358
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:29,054
Exchange numbers? You dream big.

359
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,358
I failed.

360
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:36,328
Which neighborhood in Seoul has
the best <i>tteokbokki</i>? Shindang-dong?

361
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:38,530
Yes. But <i>tteokbokki</i> is tasty anywhere.

362
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,832
<i>Tteokbokki</i>.

363
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,368
To be honest, I haven't had it many times.

364
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:43,469
-<i>Tteokbokki</i>?
-Yes.

365
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:47,272
People who work out
avoid eating <i>tteokbokki</i>.

366
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:48,974
That's because…

367
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,212
it's high in sugar and carbs.

368
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:54,279
Right.

369
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:57,016
But I'll have some if my girlfriend likes
it.

370
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,519
I'll enjoy it with her.

371
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:03,222
When I try it at times, it's really good.
I tried a popular brand.

372
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:04,690
-It's tasty.
-Right?

373
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,459
-These days, there's mala <i>tteokbokki</i>.
-Mala <i>tteokbokki</i>.

374
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,527
-Is it good?
-Yes.

375
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,096
I like mala seasoning.

376
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:12,531
I like mala seasoning too.

377
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,066
Mala <i>tteokbokki</i> is really good.

We're from the same city.

What? What was that?

397
00:18:18,697 --> 00:18:20,699

00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,847
Yes.

405
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,150
I'm Modern Tarzan.

Really?

412
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,267
I'm training hard to be an actor
because I want to go to Hollywood.

413
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:57,936
How old are you?

414
00:18:58,003 --> 00:18:59,204
I was born in 1995.

415
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,841
-I'm…
-Are you younger than me?

416

Are you?

417
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,878
You're one year older than me.

418
00:19:05,944 --> 00:19:06,945
Right.

419
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,815
I can't believe you're younger.

420
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,719
