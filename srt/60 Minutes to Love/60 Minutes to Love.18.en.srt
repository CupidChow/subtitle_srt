Where did it go wrong? What went wrong?

74
00:04:45,027 --> 00:04:46,495
Perhaps it was

75
00:04:47,396 --> 00:04:49,332
a mistake to make her do
a triceps exercise.

76
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,068

-I gained weight.
-Did you gain weight? I'm sorry.

103
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:05,274

Please don't do this.

120
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,051
Women hate this the most.

121
00:06:55,124 --> 00:06:56,692
Thank you.

122
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,462
I thought the vibe was too depressing.

123
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:03,833
It came apart.

124
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,802
Oh, no.

125
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,637

Thank you.

129
00:07:15,444 --> 00:07:18,614
I brought a present as well.

130
00:07:19,448 --> 00:07:21,517
Why did you do that? I didn't…

131
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,421
Today,

132
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,490
I don't want you to get exhausted.

133
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,993
-So… Yes.
-It's an energy drink.

134
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,396
-It's an ampoule. Press the top.
-You brought one for me as well.

135
00:07:34,463 --> 00:07:35,598
-Press it.
-Did you know

136
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,166
-that he was a pharmacist?
-Yes.

137
00:07:37,233 --> 00:07:38,868
I know because I watched <i>Couple Palace</i>.

138
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:40,102
-Really?
-Yes.

139
00:07:41,637 --> 00:07:43,172
Open it and drink it later.

140
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,441
I also brought multivitamins.

141
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:49,044
This is the date Yeongseok has prepared.

142
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:52,314
Last time we met,
we mentioned a video arcade.

143
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:53,382
A video arcade.

144
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:55,784
So I prepared a video arcade date.

145
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:58,220
The weather is still hot, so…

146
00:07:58,287 --> 00:07:59,455
…video arcade…

147
00:07:59,955 --> 00:08:01,624
Those were the places I thought of.

148
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:07,096
I thought about what we could do
to have an active date

149
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:08,297
indoors.

150
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,633
I decided to take her to a video arcade.

151
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:15,538
Then we'll capture today's good memories
at a photo booth.

152
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:19,308
-I haven't been there in a long while.
-Me neither.

153
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:20,376
Let's go today.

154
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:21,644
The date has begun.

155
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,312
Twenty-seven minutes remain.

156
00:08:26,448 --> 00:08:28,417
I see that you've met many men.

157
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:29,552
That's right. Many men.

158
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,387
I'm the first romantic interest.

159
00:08:36,358 --> 00:08:38,928
I haven't been to a video arcade often.

160
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:40,963
But it's fun
even if you're bad at the games.

161
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,265
Even if you're bad at the games,

162
00:08:43,332 --> 00:08:44,800
time will pass quickly.

163
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:46,302
I agree. Time will pass quickly.

164
00:08:49,872 --> 00:08:53,275
-I…
-Hongdae has changed so much.

165
00:08:54,677 --> 00:08:55,911
I haven't been here in a while.

166
00:08:56,612 --> 00:08:57,880
Same here. Seriously.

167
00:08:59,048 --> 00:09:00,849
-Rain…
-Thank goodness it stopped.

168
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,918
-Rain…
-Thank goodness it stopped.

169
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:04,687
I know.

170
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,021
"YEEUN AND YEONGSEOK CONTINUE TALKING"

171
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:07,289
Thankfully, the rain stopped.

172
00:09:09,024 --> 00:09:11,360
-The two of you became very close.
-Well…

173
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:13,162
-We decided to talk casually.
-Yes.

174
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,265
-Okay.
-Yeongseok…

175
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:17,766
-"Yeongseok."
-Yeongseok…

176
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:21,470
-He's younger than me.
-Okay.

520
00:24:29,077 --> 00:24:30,245
We sing "The two of us" together.

521
00:24:30,311 --> 00:24:34,015
<i>-The two of us</i>
<i>-The two of us</i>

522
00:24:34,883 --> 00:24:36,251
That was funny.

523
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:38,620
You know…

524
00:24:39,954 --> 00:24:42,423
-You were well-suited.
-Yeeun, 10 minutes remain.

525
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,825
-Ten minutes?
-What should we sing?

526
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:46,961
-Then…
-I wonder which song you'll choose.

527
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,298
Do you know "Thank you for Goodbye"?

528
00:24:50,932 --> 00:24:51,933
I've listened to it.

529
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,167
-Really?
-Yes.

530
00:24:53,234 --> 00:24:55,470
I want to be sentimental.
May I sit alone in a corner?

531
00:24:55,937 --> 00:24:58,039
-Okay.
-I want to sit alone.

532
00:24:58,106 --> 00:25:00,542
-You do this when you go to karaoke alone.
-Yes.

533
00:25:00,608 --> 00:25:02,410
I need to lower the key. It's too high.

534
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:05,246
You want to be sentimental. How pitiful.

535
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,515
-The light should be dimmer.
-I…

536
00:25:07,582 --> 00:25:09,183
-It should be dimmer.
-Yes.

537
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,818
"'THANK YOU FOR GOODBYE'
JI YEEUN"

538
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,021
I'll lower the key by four steps.

539
00:25:17,959 --> 00:25:21,596
<i>Don't make me repeat myself</i>

540
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:25,199
<i>Don't make me hate you more</i>

541
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:29,070
<i>I won't change</i>

542
00:25:29,137 --> 00:25:34,075
<i>Let's stop hating each other</i>
<i>Let's save ourselves from more regrets</i>

543
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:38,913
<i>Let's just go crazy and break up</i>

544
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,384
<i>You and I act like it's love</i>

545
00:25:43,451 --> 00:25:47,789
"CHANGSUN GOES SOMEWHERE"

546
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:52,226
<i>What's the point</i>
<i>Of ending things in words only?</i>

547
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:56,297
<i>Let's stop dragging it out and break up</i>

548
00:25:57,231 --> 00:25:58,600
-How about…
-Where did he go?

549
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:03,004
"CHANGSUN COMES BACK"

550
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:05,640
"CHANGSUN IS BACK WITH ICE CREAM"

551
00:26:06,908 --> 00:26:09,010
I only brought two
because I have two hands.

552
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:11,045
"ONE IS OBVIOUSLY FOR YEEUN"

553
00:26:11,846 --> 00:26:14,515
-Oh, no. You'll share it with me, right?
-Thank you.

554
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:16,751
Is it for me? Thank you.

555
00:26:17,218 --> 00:26:19,020
Oh, no. Eat this.

556
00:26:19,087 --> 00:26:21,489
I wanted to give it to the younger one.

557
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:22,924
Thank you.

558
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,061
Yeeun, stop being sentimental.

559
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,262
Come here.

560
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:30,732
-Really?
-Three minutes remain.

561
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:33,134
-It's time for the last song!
-Three minutes.

562
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,302
-Let's go.
-You don't know it.

563
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:35,637
"THEY PARTY HARD UNTIL THE END"

564
00:26:45,346 --> 00:26:46,881
The date has ended.

565
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:48,683
That was so funny.

566
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:52,387
Seriously, your singing was so…

567
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:53,588
-It was funny, right?
-Yes.

568
00:26:53,655 --> 00:26:54,989
I'm glad you relieved your stress.

569
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:56,824
-It was so funny.
-I had fun.

570
00:26:56,891 --> 00:27:00,128
"THE TWO-ON-ONE DATES HAVE ENDED"

571
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:04,666
Yeeun, you must now choose one
of the two romantic interests.

572
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:06,467
Park Changsun,

573
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:08,202
please look Yeeun in the eye

574
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:10,071
-and say your last words.
-Seriously.

575
00:27:10,138 --> 00:27:12,473
I hate this part the most.

576
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:18,279
<i>I prepared a date that Yeeun would like.</i>

577
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:20,782
<i>She enjoyed my terrible singing.</i>

578
00:27:21,382 --> 00:27:24,385
<i>I prepared the date in hopes</i>

579
00:27:24,452 --> 00:27:25,887
<i>of moving her heart.</i>

580
00:27:28,222 --> 00:27:30,458
Pink hydrangea symbolizes
a fluttering heart.

581
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:31,626
Hold on.

582
00:27:33,061 --> 00:27:35,029
It can be unsafe for the wrist.

583
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:39,333
"SWEETNESS PERSONIFIED, PARK CHANGSUN"

584
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,936
Despite being a terrible singer,

585
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:44,138
I tried my best to prepare a date

586
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,674
that'd make you happy.

587
00:27:48,276 --> 00:27:49,977
If you choose me by any chance,

588
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,680
I'll prepare something you'd like
for the second date as well.

589
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,651
Yes.

590
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:58,553
Cho Yeongseok,

591
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,522
please look Yeeun in the eye
and say your last words.

592
00:28:03,091 --> 00:28:04,225
I brought a present as well.

593
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:05,560
I thought you looked a bit tired.

594
00:28:05,626 --> 00:28:07,028
This is…

595
00:28:07,595 --> 00:28:08,596
<i>Since it was hot,</i>

596
00:28:08,663 --> 00:28:11,532
<i>I thought about what we could do</i>
<i>to have an active date</i>

597
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,934
<i>indoors.</i>

598
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,703
Yeeun is cute, so…

599
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,439
<i>I wanted to record the day with photos.</i>

600
00:28:18,506 --> 00:28:19,774
One, two, three.

601
00:28:19,841 --> 00:28:23,311
<i>The way she was so focused on singing</i>
<i>was very cute.</i>

602
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,680
"THE MAN WHO PUTS YOU AT EASE
LIKE A FRIEND, CHO YEONGSEOK"

603
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:31,419
I prepared a second date as well.

604
00:28:32,086 --> 00:28:33,521
It'd be a shame to part ways now.

605
00:28:33,588 --> 00:28:35,957
Once more, I want us to go,
"Let's get it."

606
00:28:39,327 --> 00:28:40,328
That's funny.

607
00:28:43,798 --> 00:28:46,300
Gentlemen, please go into
your respective room

608
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:47,869
and stand by.

609
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:55,443
I'm in trouble.

610
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,890
"CHO YEONGSEOK'S ROOM,
PARK CHANGSUN'S ROOM"

611
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:15,463
It'd be a shame to leave now.

612
00:29:20,535 --> 00:29:23,504
Yeeun, please open the door
and enter the room of the man

613
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:26,474
you'd like to go on
a one-on-one date with.

614
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,712
Please choose in three seconds.

615
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:32,780
Three…

616
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,382
In three seconds?

617
00:29:34,949 --> 00:29:36,517
-That's insane.
-Two…

618
00:29:38,653 --> 00:29:39,654
one.

619
00:29:41,756 --> 00:29:42,757
Please choose one.

620
00:29:47,895 --> 00:29:52,433
60 MINUTES TO LOVE
