00:00:11,587 --> 00:00:12,655
It's nice to meet you.

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:14,957
I remember when you played Flower Pot.

5
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:17,760
Still, I'm attracted to you.

6
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:25,001
"HYUNJUN CONTINUED
TO SHOW HIS CHARMS"

7
00:00:25,068 --> 00:00:28,237
<i>But Tarzan is a fine man, okay?</i>

8
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:29,806
Would you like to
get to know each other more?

9
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,677
<i>Yeeun chose Suk Hyunjun.</i>

10
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,946
YEEUN CHOSE SUK HYUNJUN

11
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:39,415
HE BEAT LEE JINSEOK
AND TOOK THE FIRST WIN

12
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:43,386
<i>Moon Sehoon.</i>

13
00:00:43,953 --> 00:00:46,656
<i>Yeeun chose Suk Hyunjun.</i>

14
00:00:46,722 --> 00:00:48,191
HE BEAT MOON SEHOON
AND TOOK HIS SECOND WIN

15
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:57,366
IF HE GETS CHOSEN AGAIN,
HE'LL BECOME A ROMANTIC INTEREST

16
00:00:58,801 --> 00:00:59,802
That was funny.

20
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:12,081
Hello.

KIM JINWOOK, LOVE MAFIA

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,451
PERSONAL TRAINER
GRADUATE STUDENT

23
00:01:15,518 --> 00:01:16,752
ONE YEAR YOUNGER
THAN YEEUN, ENFJ

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,489
-Hello.
-Hello.

25
00:01:21,924 --> 00:01:24,060

-Hello.
-Hello.

30
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,935
-Hello.
-Hello.

31
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,572
Your hair is longer than Yeeun's.

32
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:44,447
For a second, I thought
I was on a date with two women.

33
00:01:47,016 --> 00:01:48,484
-Did you get excited?
-A little bit.

34
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:51,454
-You need to choose one of us.
-Okay.

35
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:55,525
That's funny.

36
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,995
-Nice to meet you. Yes.
-Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:02,298 --> 00:02:04,700
-What's your name?
-It's Kim Jinwook.

38
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,102
-Kim Jinwook.
-Yes.

39
00:02:12,308 --> 00:02:14,410
I'm a personal trainer.

40
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:16,979
During the day, I attend graduate school.

41
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:19,348
What do you study?

42
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,350
I attend a college of physical education,

43
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:23,452
so I study sports marketing and such.

44
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,088
The two of you have something in common.

45
00:02:26,155 --> 00:02:28,958
-Physical education. He likes sports.
-I studied sport management.

46
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,126
-Really?
-Yes.

47
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,562
-How old are you?
-I was born in 1995.

48
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:34,830
Why was everyone born in 1995?

49
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:36,599
The two of you are the same age too.

50
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:38,100
-I was born in 1995 too.
-Really?

51
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:39,168
I was born in 1995 too.

52
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:41,304
-In what month were you born?
-March.

53
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,139
-You're older than me.
-How about you?

54
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:45,308
-May.
-May?

55
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,375
Do you care about that?

56
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:48,411
No. I don't.

57
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:49,812
I do.

58
00:02:51,113 --> 00:02:52,114
-Really?
-Yes.

59
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:56,552
Okay.

60
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,690
How are you doing?
You've had multiple blind dates.

61
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:04,093
-I'm doing fine.
-I thought you might be a bit tired.

62
00:03:05,995 --> 00:03:07,563
So, I prepared some questions.

63
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:11,033
So…

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,102
I wrote them down during the wait.

65
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:14,804
"HE BROUGHT A QUESTIONNAIRE"

66
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,972
There are ten.

67
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,314
Everyone brings a questionnaire.

68
00:03:26,882 --> 00:03:28,551
-Did you bring questions as well?
-No.

69
00:03:28,618 --> 00:03:30,486
He brought questions.

70
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,455
Let me go over the questions I wrote down.

71
00:03:33,489 --> 00:03:35,157
"HYUNJUN HAD BROUGHT
A QUESTIONNAIRE TOO"

72
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:37,493
What will you do

73
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,829
if your relationship enters
a boring phase?

74
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,865
"THESE TWO HAVE
MANY THINGS IN COMMON"

75
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,868
They must've asked the same questions.

76
00:03:47,036 --> 00:03:49,472
-I asked an AI chatbot…
-Really?

77
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:51,607
…to give me ten witty questions.

78
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:53,876
"HE COMPLETED THE QUESTIONNAIRE
WITH THE HELP OF AI"

79
00:03:55,544 --> 00:03:58,681
If you read the questions, I'll answer.

80
00:03:58,748 --> 00:04:00,283
What's your latest obsession?

81
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:02,051
These days,

82
00:04:02,718 --> 00:04:04,620
it's "Milk Shake" by you.

83
00:04:08,724 --> 00:04:10,259
I'm obsessed with the dance.

84
00:04:10,893 --> 00:04:12,194
I'm obsessed with the dance.

85
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:14,730
I'm obsessed with the dance.

86
00:04:15,865 --> 00:04:16,866
The dance!

87
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,136
-Did you do the dance?
-No, I can't do something like that.

88
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:21,904
-Would you show me the dance?
-The dance?

89
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:22,972
Yes.

90
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,508
It has only been 27 seconds
since I got here.

91
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:27,710
Shall I begin right away?

92
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,545
He'll play the ocarina.

93
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:32,348
I'll play the melody.

94
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:33,749
Okay.

95
00:04:34,684 --> 00:04:36,919
-If you begin dancing, I'll play the song.
-Okay.

96
00:04:36,986 --> 00:04:39,422
But you need to follow my lead. I'll lead.

97
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:40,790
He'll follow your lead.

98
00:04:40,856 --> 00:04:42,291
-Let's dance together.
-Okay.

99
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,727
-You're prettier in real life.
-Thank you.

100
00:04:50,132 --> 00:04:52,168
One, two, three, four.

105
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:08,617
Are you playing "Milk Shake"?

106
00:05:10,386 --> 00:05:12,154
"Drink a milkshake."

107
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:13,856
"Drink a milkshake."

108
00:05:14,457 --> 00:05:16,592
"Drink a milkshake in a cheerful way."

109
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,627
It was different
from "Milk Shake" I listened to.

110
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:20,129
"Drink a milkshake."

111
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,964

00:05:26,635 --> 00:05:28,003

Seriously.

125
00:06:08,177 --> 00:06:09,445
Aren't you glad I brought it?

126
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,981
I thought it was a different song.

127
00:06:14,784 --> 00:06:16,285
-Then…
-What's your latest obsession?

128
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,586
Me?

129
00:06:18,988 --> 00:06:20,089
It's hot chocolate.

130
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:21,557
-Hot chocolate?
-Yes.

131
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:22,992
Could you bring us hot chocolate?

132
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:28,063
-These days…
-Okay.

133
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:31,200
I like the woman
whose head is a flower pot.

134
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,969
"The woman whose head is a flower pot"?

135
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:35,571
I like Mala Tang Wei.

136
00:06:38,841 --> 00:06:40,609
I like…

137
00:06:41,243 --> 00:06:43,245
the woman who dressed up as a radish.

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,216
Please ask the questions.

139
00:06:51,654 --> 00:06:53,456
Then…

140
00:06:53,522 --> 00:06:56,292
What's your favorite time of the day?

141
00:06:56,859 --> 00:07:00,129
To be honest, I felt very excited
when I woke up today.

142
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:02,264
-Oh, my God.
-Today…

143
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,467
I can't believe it!

144
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:07,303
When he woke up?

145
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:09,672
Weren't you nervous?

146
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,540
Me?

147
00:07:12,775 --> 00:07:14,410
I was really nervous.

148
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:19,348
Even as I drove here, I kept thinking

149
00:07:19,415 --> 00:07:21,250
about what I should do.

150
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,351
-Really?
-Yes.

151
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:28,224
And…

152
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:31,994
By which nickname
do your friends call you?

153
00:07:32,061 --> 00:07:33,128
Chicken Breast.

154
00:07:36,365 --> 00:07:38,033
You must enjoy working out.

155
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,236
I enjoy everything. I enjoy eating too.

156
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:43,239
Yeeun doesn't enjoy working out.

157
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,476
I'm not the type
to force that lifestyle on people.

158
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:50,579
I enjoy running these days.

159
00:07:51,647 --> 00:07:53,849
Men join a running crew to meet women.

160
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:54,984
No.

161
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,118
I run alone.

162
00:07:58,554 --> 00:08:00,823
-That's what men do these days.
-No, I run alone.

163
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,124
I run alone.

164
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:04,159
-I put on my earbuds.
-Okay.

165
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,361
I run.

166
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:06,862
That's what I do.

167
00:08:09,665 --> 00:08:12,935
If you could take one thing
to a deserted island, what would you pick?

168
00:08:13,002 --> 00:08:15,271
If I were to go to a deserted island…

169
00:08:18,607 --> 00:08:20,042
Ocarina?

170
00:08:20,609 --> 00:08:21,610
It might get lonely.

171
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:23,846
Ocarina is a good choice.

172
00:08:23,913 --> 00:08:26,081
I'll play "Milk Shake."

173
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,684
What would you take?

174
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:31,086
You!

175
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,494
You're too much of…

176
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:39,695
You're too much of a player.

177
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:41,630
No, I'm not.

178
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:43,832

186
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:16,599
I go to coin karaoke even when I'm alone.

188

-Are you serious?

208

-I'll take it out.
-Seriously.

222
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:05,474

coin karaoke is in Seoul.

365
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,702
I prepared a simple present.

It's called <i>latiao</i>.

How does it taste?

Unless he's much older
or much younger than me…

00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,099
Isn't he much older?

397
