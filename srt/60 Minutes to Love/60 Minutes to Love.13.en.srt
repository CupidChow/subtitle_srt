-Before I take a seat…
-Okay.

19
00:01:04,173 --> 00:01:07,243
I prepared a simple present.

I also prepared something small.

29
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,355
It's a snack.

30
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,290
I love snacks.

31
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:57,293
It's called <i>latiao</i>.

32
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,929
It's a popular snack in China.

33
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,565
It's my first time eating it.
How does it taste?

34
00:02:02,632 --> 00:02:04,000
It's mala flavor.

35

-I…
-I absolutely love mala.

36
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:07,970
-Do you like mala?
-Yes.

37

-How big of an age gap are you okay with?
-Me?

49
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,739
To be honest, I think
age is just a number.

50
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:46,409
I honestly think that.

51
00:02:46,876 --> 00:02:50,947
Unless he's much older
or much younger than me…

52
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,281
Isn't he much older?

53

Yes. On these cards,

I'll put all the information
about this celebrity.

The celebrity you've picked

108
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,799
was born in Seoul.

109
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,001
Oh, my! How did you do that?

110
00:05:26,068 --> 00:05:28,137
This celebrity was born

111
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:30,740
on July 26.

112
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:32,341
That's me! Okay.

113
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,344
And she's from the Chungju Ji Clan.

114
00:05:39,682 --> 00:05:42,051
It's Yeeun.

115
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:43,419

116
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:44,687
How did you do that?

117
00:05:45,688 --> 00:05:47,490
Oh, my! What's this?

118
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,559
Thus, Yeeun was the chosen celebrity.

119
00:05:50,626 --> 00:05:51,961
It's so fascinating.

120
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:54,163

Oh, my! What's this?

127
00:06:10,813 --> 00:06:12,248
Could you read it out loud?

128
00:06:12,314 --> 00:06:14,517
"SHALL WE START DATING?"

129
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:18,888
Oh, my. It's too…

130
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:23,159
embarrassing.

131
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,228
It's okay. You don't have to say it now.

132
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:28,764

-Ten minutes have passed.
-Yes.

It was so fascinating. How…

136
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,510
How did you… It was…

137
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,679
How was it?

138
00:06:43,746 --> 00:06:46,415
Yeeun, for you,

139
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:49,118
I hired a magician today.

140
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:00,095
Please say this out loud.

141
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,530

142
00:07:03,499 --> 00:07:05,835
It was so cool. Seriously.

143
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,403
-It was so fascinating.
-Thank you.

144
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,871
-Magic tricks are fascinating.
-Thank you.

145
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:10,840
Let's go watch his show together sometime.

146
00:07:16,045 --> 00:07:18,881
-It has been a bit over 10 minutes.
-That's right.

147
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:22,952
I used to see you on TV,
but now that I'm seeing you in person,

148
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:24,386
I find you prettier in real life.

149
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,056
I'm sure people tell you that
all the time.

150
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,394
People do tell me
that I'm prettier in real life.

151
00:07:36,298 --> 00:07:38,267
My ideal type is

152
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:41,971
a woman with fair skin
and a beautiful smile.

153
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:46,475
That's right. Just like that.

154
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,776
I'm your ideal type.

155
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,678
So…

156
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:54,483
When I see you on TV,
you're mostly acting.

157
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,287
I don't think that's real you.

158
00:07:58,354 --> 00:07:59,355
-Right.
-So…

159
00:08:00,322 --> 00:08:02,791
I wanted to talk more about

160
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:07,429
real-life stuff during today's blind date.

161
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:10,633
But I didn't expect to see a magic show.

162
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:16,171
But it isn't too late to do that.

163
00:08:16,238 --> 00:08:18,807
-It was like a mini concert.
-A mini concert.

164
00:08:18,874 --> 00:08:20,943
-Yes.
-Do you like shows like this?

165
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,746
It was my first time seeing a magic trick.
It was fascinating.

166
00:08:24,313 --> 00:08:26,982
I'm the type to laze around

167
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:30,119
-at home.
-ISFPs are usually like that.

168
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:32,187
You're right. I'm an introvert.

169
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:33,789
Are you a profiler?

170
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,326
He did his research.

171
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:38,661
No, it's not like that.

172
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:42,865
-I've always been a big fan of you.
-Really?

173
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:47,536
Most of my dates look up
information about me before coming here.

174
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:49,772
Still, I stood out, right?

175
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,308
I bet no one did a magic trick.

176
00:08:52,374 --> 00:08:53,609
And no one will.

177
00:08:53,676 --> 00:08:55,344
-You're right. No one will.
-Right.

178
00:08:57,112 --> 00:08:59,915
For you, Yeeun, I prepared

179
00:08:59,982 --> 00:09:02,017
-the Ji Yeeun Show.
-What is it?

180
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:03,719
-May I show you something else?
-Yes!

181
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,326
You prepared it, so…

182
00:09:10,392 --> 00:09:12,928
I guess I'll just be a spectator
to his show today.

183
00:09:14,697 --> 00:09:16,899
-I'll work with only two cards.
-Okay.

184
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,601
I'll move these cards

185
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,202
-so you can see them better.
-Okay.

186
00:09:28,677 --> 00:09:29,912
Do you like mala hot pot?

187
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,480
Do you like mala hot pot?

188
00:09:31,547 --> 00:09:32,681
-I love it so much.
-Right.

189
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:36,251
"TRYING TO WIN HER OVER
BEFORE THE MAGIC SHOW"

190
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:40,122
-I run a mala hot pot restaurant.
-I love mala hot pot.

191
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:42,858
-I absolutely love the dish.
-Perhaps I can show you photos.

192
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,159
I'm Mala Tang Wei.

193
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:45,694
-I know that very well.
-Exactly.

194
00:09:45,761 --> 00:09:48,797
I really like watching you play
that character,

195
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:49,898
Mala Tang Wei.

196
00:09:53,869 --> 00:09:56,972
You're usually very upbeat on TV.

197
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,242
So, I was surprised to see your calm side.

198
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,778
"She really looks like Tang Wei."

199
00:10:03,412 --> 00:10:06,081
-You're smooth.
-I thought that a lot. I'm serious.

200
00:10:09,385 --> 00:10:11,420
-This time,
-Okay.

201
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,722
-you'll play a game with me.
-Okay.

202
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:15,924
You need to find the soot-covered Ji Yeeun

203
00:10:16,425 --> 00:10:18,460
-who still manages to be beautiful.
-Okay.

204
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:20,896
-I'll mix up the cards thoroughly.
-Okay.

205
00:10:21,363 --> 00:10:22,798
-You can see the card now, right?
-Yes.

206
00:10:22,865 --> 00:10:24,500
Hold out your hand.

207
00:10:24,566 --> 00:10:25,668
First…

208
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:28,137
-Stay still.
-Okay.

209
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,305
-I gave you your card.
-Yes.

210
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:32,975
Now, you need to find your card.

211
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,209
Where is it now?

212
00:10:34,877 --> 00:10:35,878
Here.

213
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:37,513
Are you sure?

214
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:39,848
If you look closely,

215
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,817
-your card is in my hand.
-What?

216
00:10:41,884 --> 00:10:43,085
-What's this?
-Check your card.

217
00:10:43,152 --> 00:10:45,187
-Oh, my.
-That's right.

218
00:10:45,254 --> 00:10:47,690
Your card has been switched
to a blank card.

219
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:48,757
-What's this?
-One more time.

220
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,726
-Hold on to the blank card.
-This is a blank card.

221
00:10:50,793 --> 00:10:53,796
I'll mix these cards well.

222
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,531
Where is your card right now?

223
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:57,499
-Over there.
-What?

224
00:10:57,966 --> 00:10:59,034
-Over there.
-What?

225
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,370
I told you to look closely.
Shall we check?

226
00:11:01,437 --> 00:11:03,572
What's this?

227
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:06,308
What's this?

228
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:09,244
-It's back in your hand.
-What's this?

229
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,581
No way.

230
00:11:12,648 --> 00:11:13,916
Stop it.

231
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,252
-Let's do this again.
-<i>Five minutes remain.</i>

232
00:11:19,555 --> 00:11:23,859
But if I play a game called
"Find Ji Yeeun,"

233
00:11:23,926 --> 00:11:24,927
I'll…

234
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:30,265
What's this? How did you do that?

235
00:11:30,933 --> 00:11:32,768
What's this? How did you do that?

236
00:11:36,872 --> 00:11:40,375
I'll turn all the cards into your card.

237
00:11:42,511 --> 00:11:43,645
How did you do that?

238
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:44,813
I'll win no matter what.

239
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:47,549
How did you do that?

240
00:11:47,616 --> 00:11:48,617
Thank you.

241
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,521
How…

242
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,790
How was it? I found it a bit scary.

243
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:02,364
I honestly found it a bit scary.

244
00:12:06,568 --> 00:12:10,906
Didn't it turn the blind date more fun?

245
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:12,875
Yes. Time just flew by.

246
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:14,877
We're already done.

247
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,045
I'm really thankful.

248
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,748
Thanks to you, it felt like

249
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:22,184
Yeeun and I were on an actual date
instead of a blind date.

250
00:12:27,389 --> 00:12:29,792
Seriously. Wasn't it very nice?

251
00:12:29,858 --> 00:12:31,660
I love watching such shows.

252
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:35,264
-It was very nice.
-Yes.

253
00:12:36,431 --> 00:12:38,167
We'll go to Daehak-ro next time.

254
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:40,435
There are many magic tricks
I haven't shown yet.

255
00:12:42,237 --> 00:12:44,573
I've prepared three whole parts
of the Ji Yeeun Show.

256
00:12:45,174 --> 00:12:46,175
Yes. So…

257
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:49,011
I hope you'll like them.

258
00:12:49,077 --> 00:12:50,112
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

259
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:52,881
-Today, we enjoyed a good show.
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>

260
00:12:52,948 --> 00:12:55,717
-Shall we enjoy mala hot pot afterward?
-<i>Five, four, three,</i>

261
00:12:55,784 --> 00:12:57,986
-See you at the restaurant.
-<i>two, one.</i>

262
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:59,721

263
00:13:01,456 --> 00:13:05,427
<i>Yeeun, you must now choose</i>
<i>one of the two dates.</i>

264
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:07,729
<i>Gentlemen, please get up from your seats</i>

265
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:09,965
<i>and hold a balloon.</i>

266
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:11,500
A balloon?

267
00:13:13,268 --> 00:13:14,469
What should I do?

268
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,244
<i>Ko Minsung, please look Yeeun in the eye</i>

269
00:13:22,311 --> 00:13:23,979
<i>and say your last words.</i>

"A FANCY MAGIC SHOW UNFOLDED

271
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:34,289
How was it?

272
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:36,625
I hired a magician today.

273
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:40,229
Let's watch his show together sometime.

274
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,464
Do you like mala hot pot?

275
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:43,632
-I love it so much.
-Right.

276
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,733

Oh, my! What's this?

284
00:14:11,426 --> 00:14:12,494
Was it okay?

285
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:14,696
Yes. Time just flew by.

286
00:14:14,763 --> 00:14:16,899
It was so cool. Seriously.

287
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,835

301
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:56,872
You showed me so many things.

302
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,243
<i>Yeeun chose Ko Minsung.</i>

303
00:15:02,577 --> 00:15:03,745
I enjoyed the show.

304
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:08,717
<i>I think it's a matter of preference.</i>

305
00:15:10,052 --> 00:15:12,955
I didn't get to talk to Minsung
during the magic show.

306
00:15:13,021 --> 00:15:16,458
So I want to talk to him
for another 30 minutes.

307
00:15:20,228 --> 00:15:22,164
-Shall I remove this chair?
-I'll take it.

308
00:15:23,398 --> 00:15:25,767
We didn't get to talk much.

309
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:28,637
-You're right. Yes.
-He showed us magic tricks for 30 minutes.

-Hello.

313
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:42,417
-It's like this is our first meeting.
-I know.

314
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,386
-We didn't get to talk much earlier.
-No.

315
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,090
I think it's for the better.

316
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,625
It's my first time on a blind date.

317
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,695
We practically watched a magic show
on our first date.

318
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,864
You're so cheeky.

319
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:58,633
It feels like we came to a cafe afterward.

320
00:16:00,402 --> 00:16:01,970
So I think it's good.

321
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:09,578
Let me introduce myself once more.

322
00:16:11,646 --> 00:16:15,684
My name is Ko Minsung,
and I run a Chinese restaurant.

323
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,220
-It's a mala hot pot restaurant.
-Right.

324
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:20,455
How long have you been running
this mala hot pot restaurant?

325
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:24,926
To be honest, I've only run
the mala hot pot restaurant for two years.

326
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:27,262
I lived in China for 10 years.

327
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,700
-You must be fluent in Chinese.
-Hello.

328
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,235
My name is Ko Minsung.

329
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:34,436
What's your name?

330
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,104
Are your parents doing well?

331
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,172
Yes, they are.

332
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:40,976
Yes, they are.

333
00:16:47,349 --> 00:16:50,118
I'm sorry and thank you
for going along with it.

334
00:16:52,287 --> 00:16:55,023
What kind of men did you date in the past?

335
00:16:55,624 --> 00:16:56,958
Funny men.

336
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,226
-Funny men?
-Yes.

337
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,063
Men I could have good conversations with.

338
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:03,198
Personally speaking,

339
00:17:03,732 --> 00:17:08,270
my ideal type is a woman

340
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,207
who's passionate about her career

341
00:17:12,274 --> 00:17:14,242
and enjoys her work.

342
00:17:15,544 --> 00:17:17,546
That was why I was curious about you.

343
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,484
On TV, I could tell
that you work very hard.

344
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,987
I found that attractive.

345
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,924
I like someone who is cheerful.

346
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:31,593
I like someone who puts me at ease.

347
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:33,829
Someone grounded.

348
00:17:33,895 --> 00:17:35,030
-Someone grounded?
-Yes.

349
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:37,732
I'm a bit like that.

350
00:17:39,634 --> 00:17:41,736
Talking to you

351
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:44,673
is nice and fun.

352
00:17:45,207 --> 00:17:46,641
Have you been in many relationships?

353
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,244
Well…

354
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,050
I'd be lying if I said no.

355
00:17:56,818 --> 00:17:59,421
-Is that off-putting?
-You seem like you've been in many.

356
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:03,892
Shall we talk about mala hot pot?

357
00:18:05,827 --> 00:18:09,698
Like I said earlier, mala hot pot is
the signature dish at my restaurant.

358
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,602
-Okay.
-You like that.

359
00:18:14,069 --> 00:18:16,471
"THINKING ABOUT MALA HOT POT
MAKES HER SMILE"

360
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:19,307
I absolutely love mala hot pot.

361
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:21,977
So I can make you mala hot pot

362
00:18:22,677 --> 00:18:24,579
for the rest of your life.

363
00:18:26,414 --> 00:18:28,250
When did you get into cooking?

364
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,784
I started cooking

365
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:33,088
about five years ago.

366
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,356
You know,

367
00:18:34,422 --> 00:18:36,925
as I lived in China for a long time,

368
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:40,262
I recreate the dishes
I've had since childhood.

369
00:18:40,328 --> 00:18:42,597
Have you been to China?

370
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:43,999
-Not even once.
-Not even once?

371
00:18:44,065 --> 00:18:45,467
Since you haven't been to China…

372
00:18:46,201 --> 00:18:48,570
If you go to China with me…

373
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:53,575
I speak Chinese,
so I'll be your interpreter.

374
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:55,744
We can eat many tasty dishes.

375
00:19:03,518 --> 00:19:05,854
Your eyes sparkle when we talk about
something you're interested in.

376
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,491
-I'm a big foodie.
-Right.

377
00:19:09,558 --> 00:19:11,960
These days,
I'm obsessed with Chinese food.

378
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:15,797
I eat Chinese hot pot once a week.

379
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,334
Do you know how it's different
from mala hot pot?

380
00:19:20,135 --> 00:19:22,437
With Chinese hot pot,
you dip the ingredients in the broth.

381
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:23,505
With mala hot pot,

382
00:19:24,172 --> 00:19:25,874
the ingredients are already in the broth.

383
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:29,844
It's a matter of whether or not
you can drink the broth.

384
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,713
I drink the Chinese hot pot broth.

385
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,148
-You shouldn't do that.
-Why not?

386
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,850
Chinese hot pot is a spicy dish

387
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,552
that contains a lot of oil.

388
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:40,722
If you drink the oily broth,
you'll get a stomachache the next day.

389
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:42,157
You'll get sick. Didn't you?

390
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,292
You shouldn't drink
the Chinese hot pot broth?

391
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:47,629
It's better not to drink it.
People don't drink it in China.

392
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:51,900
I drink the Chinese hot pot broth.

393
00:19:53,702 --> 00:19:54,970
That's why I pick the spicy base.

394
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,505
"Ma" of "mala" means "numbing"

395
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,773
and "la" means "spicy."

396
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,610
So the flavor profile is
more numbing than spicy.

397
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:03,478
What's your favorite ingredient?

398
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,180
-For hot pot.
-For hot pot?

399
00:20:06,915 --> 00:20:08,917
Most women like wood ear mushrooms.

400
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:10,919
-I like dried tofu.
-Dried tofu.

401
00:20:10,986 --> 00:20:12,187
-Fuzhu.
-Yes. Fuzhu.

402
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:13,655
I'll give you a lot of those.

403
00:20:15,824 --> 00:20:16,858
Potato too.

404
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:19,828
Potato?

405
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:21,196
You like survival crops.

406
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:25,233
When potato soaks up the mala broth,

407
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,334
it's really tasty.

408
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,804
You know your food.

409
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,073
When you take out the broth-soaked potato

410
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,309
and eat it with fried rice,

411
00:20:34,376 --> 00:20:36,044
-it's really tasty.
-You like carbs.

412
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,445
-Yes, I love carbs.
-Carbs.

413
00:20:37,512 --> 00:20:40,915
-Potato soaks up the mala flavor.
-So, you eat fried rice

414
00:20:40,982 --> 00:20:43,518
-with the mala broth-soaked potato.
-The potato from the broth.

415
00:20:43,585 --> 00:20:45,487
-You mash it up.
-I mash it up and eat it.

416
00:20:45,553 --> 00:20:48,290
That's a combination I haven't heard of.

417
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,591
It's tasty.

418
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,359
-You really are a foodie.
-Yes.

419
00:20:51,426 --> 00:20:53,561
I'll give it a go.
I'll go to the restaurant later today.

420
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:56,431
-It's really tasty.
-<i>Five seconds remain.</i>

421
00:20:56,498 --> 00:20:58,066
-<i>Five, four,</i>
-I…

422
00:20:58,133 --> 00:21:00,101
-I eat that whenever I have hot pot.
-<i>three, two,</i>

423
00:21:00,502 --> 00:21:01,503
-<i>one.</i>
-I'm craving it now.

424
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:03,004
<i>The blind date has ended.</i>

425
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:05,040
"ONE-ON-ONE DATE ENDS"

430
00:21:16,685 --> 00:21:17,719
What should I do?

431
00:21:19,321 --> 00:21:20,689
Hello.

432
00:21:21,189 --> 00:21:23,391
Hello.

433
00:21:23,858 --> 00:21:26,328
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

434
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,997
-Please take a seat.
-Shall I?

435
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:31,566
Hello.

436
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:38,440
CHO YEONGSEOK, COUPLE PALACE 2, PHARMACIST

437
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:39,774
ONE YEAR YOUNGER THAN YEEUN, ENTJ

438
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:42,877
Yeeun, I've brought you a small gift.

439
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:48,016
Would you like to take a look?

440
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,751
Oh, my. You shouldn't have.

441
00:21:50,051 --> 00:21:51,052
What's this?

442
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:54,622
-It's nothing grand.
-Thank you.

443
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:58,059
-Thank you.
-I added something

444
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:01,229
since you use a shrill voice a lot.

445
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:03,598
-Oh, for my throat.
-Yes, that's right.

446
00:22:03,665 --> 00:22:04,899
-My throat.
-Yes.

447
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:09,270
Let me introduce myself.

448
00:22:09,337 --> 00:22:10,338
Okay.

449
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:14,476
My name is Cho Yeongseok,
and I'm a pharmacist based in Seoul.

450
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,277
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

451
00:22:16,778 --> 00:22:19,481
What were the two of you talking about?

452
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:21,149
-Mala hot pot.
-Mala…

453
00:22:21,983 --> 00:22:23,218
-Mala hot pot?
-Yes.

454
00:22:23,284 --> 00:22:26,087
-I run a mala hot pot restaurant.
-Really?

455
00:22:26,154 --> 00:22:28,390
Yeeun likes mala hot pot
and Chinese hot pot.

456
00:22:28,456 --> 00:22:29,691
You know, I have so many questions.

457
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:31,426
-I like supplements.
-Really?

458
00:22:33,495 --> 00:22:35,730
-Taking care of your health…
-I'm very interested in that.

459
00:22:36,865 --> 00:22:39,267
-I see.
-Collagen supplements…

460
00:22:41,636 --> 00:22:44,172
I woke up from sleep once
because of a stomachache.

461
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,007
-I felt like I had a knot in my stomach.
-I see.

462
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:49,511
-The best solution is to avoid spicy food.
-Right.

463
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,848
It's best to watch what you eat.

464
00:22:54,315 --> 00:22:55,817
<i>I should give you a taste of mala.</i>
