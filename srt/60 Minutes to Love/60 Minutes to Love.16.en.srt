Goodness.

50
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:12,074

And you seem like someone

54
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,817
who is very pure.

55
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:26,489
"I want to get to know her.
I'm curious about her."

There are so many questions I want to ask,

70
00:03:06,362 --> 00:03:08,598
but I have a feeling
that they've already been asked.

71
00:03:08,664 --> 00:03:12,468
It's okay. Since this is the first date
with you, you can ask any questions.

72
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:14,604
I'm most curious about your ideal type.

73
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,374
My ideal type is someone affectionate
and someone I can talk to with ease.

74
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:22,211
I'm someone who is only affectionate
with my girlfriend.

75
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:25,648
Affectionate.

77
00:03:30,786 --> 00:03:31,787
That's funny.

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:36,792
-I know that you love food.
-That's right.

79
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,327
What kind of food do you like?

80
00:03:38,394 --> 00:03:39,862
These days, I love hot pot.

81
00:03:39,929 --> 00:03:41,497
-Like the H hot pot chain?
-Yes.

82
00:03:41,564 --> 00:03:43,232
I've never been.

83
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:45,301

89
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,183
-Why?
-I want to do a reading for you.

90
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,718
How did you learn how to do that?

91
00:04:05,121 --> 00:04:07,923
I've done some practice.

92
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,392

-Yes.
-"What kind of person do I want to meet?"

-Okay. Please put it down.
-Okay.

106
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:43,926
I'll put it down.

112
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,486
-Not yet.
-Why don't you pick one?

113

-Okay.
-All right.

117
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,297
-Shall we take a look?
-Okay.

118
00:05:22,098 --> 00:05:23,366
What does it say?

119
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,935
What does it say?

120
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:28,871
"This person has
a cheerful and warm personality."

121
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:33,976
"With her chatty and bright personality,
this person entertains others."

I'll read your palm later if you want.

128
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,671
What? My palm?

129
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,575
-He reads palms.
-Yes.

130
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:08,477
How is my palm?

131
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:09,678
Hold on.

132
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,247
This is the life line.

-Seeing how it's got a split…
-Okay.

Really?

138
00:06:31,534 --> 00:06:33,235
You're making a strong appeal.

"TIME GOES FASTER THAN
SUNGJUN EXPECTED"

354
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:27,422
-We don't have much time. We need to go.
-Thank you.

355
00:17:27,489 --> 00:17:29,658
-No headband for you, Hyunjun.
-Right.

356
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:32,627
It's raining!

357
00:17:32,694 --> 00:17:34,162
-It's raining?
-Geez.

358
00:17:34,229 --> 00:17:36,698
-What? Is it not raining?
-It's raining. For real.

359
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:39,434

"THE RAIN MAKES SUNGJUN SAD TOO"

362
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,441
All right.

363
00:17:48,243 --> 00:17:50,479
What's wrong with you? For goodness' sake.

364
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:55,917
For goodness' sake. That's too small.

365
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,819
-You can use it. It's for one person.
-I…

366
00:17:57,886 --> 00:17:59,387
I lost a bit of control.

367
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:00,822
-That's so funny.
-This is bad.

368
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:09,965
-Come on! What are you doing?
-That's too small.

369
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:11,867
That's too small. Use my shirt instead.

370
00:18:12,534 --> 00:18:14,069
-Yeeun.
-This is…

371
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,004
-This is…
-It smells good, right?

372
00:18:16,071 --> 00:18:17,372
This is a date, right?

373
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:19,107
It feels like I'm on a survival show.

374
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:21,476
Sungjun, move the umbrella.
My shirt is waterproof.

375
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,179
-Is it waterproof?
-It's waterproof.

376
00:18:24,246 --> 00:18:25,247
Waterproof.

377
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:31,186
The swing ride looks fun.

378
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:34,589
Bumper cars are our first ride.

379
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:35,991
I have the date planned out,

380
00:18:36,057 --> 00:18:37,726
-so let's follow the schedule.
-Okay.

381
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:39,394
Okay.

382
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:41,663
-He's the judging type.
-Are you the judging type?

383
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,831
Let's go on the ride together.

384
00:18:43,865 --> 00:18:45,100
Have you ridden bumper cars before?

385
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,335
-Are you good at driving one?
-Yes, I think so.

386
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:56,444
Yeeun, pink suits you better.

387
00:18:56,511 --> 00:18:57,746
-Really?
-Yes.

388
00:18:57,812 --> 00:19:00,582
-I'll get in a pink one.
-I'll get in a blue one next to yours.

389
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:09,224
-Yeeun, I saw you drive on <i>Running Man</i>.
-Okay.

390
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,326
Will you be able to drive this?

391
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,028
Of course.

392
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,030
It's different from driving an actual car.

393
00:19:15,096 --> 00:19:16,364
It's very different.

394
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:18,266
If you can't do it,
you can sit next to me.

395
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:21,169
It'll be too cramped, Hyunjun.

396
00:19:24,639 --> 00:19:25,941
How do you put it on?

397
00:19:27,108 --> 00:19:28,109
Here.

398
00:19:29,778 --> 00:19:30,779
You take this.

399
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,614
This?

400
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:36,618
Thank you.

401
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,258
I sweat every time I see you, Yeeun.

402
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:45,360
"SWEATING"

403
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,963
I usually don't sweat a lot.

404
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:50,432
-But it looks like you do.
-Is it because I get nervous?

405

"THEY TALK BEFORE THE RIDE"

406
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,634

HYUNJUN APPROACHES YEEUN
RIGHT AWAY

409
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:14,022
Yeeun, I'll come to you!

410
00:20:15,457 --> 00:20:17,392
-Move out of the way.
-For goodness' sake!

411
00:20:17,459 --> 00:20:19,494
-Where are you going?
-Move out of the way.

412
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,297
I won't let you go anywhere near Yeeun.

What are you doing?

415
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:35,443

00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:11,980
She has tech neck.

427
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:13,848
Why are you bumping into me?

428
00:21:13,915 --> 00:21:15,517

Do you prefer an older man

or a dependable younger man
who has more passion?

446

Don't call yourself dependable
