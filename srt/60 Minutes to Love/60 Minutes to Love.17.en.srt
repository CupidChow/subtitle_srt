-You really are the weather fairy.

180
00:08:37,626 --> 00:08:39,862
-Why?
-It was raining when we got here.

181
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,298
As soon as you arrived,
the sky turned cloudy.

182

-You mean that it's sunny.

-Yeeun, you like milkshakes.

I chose this gym
as the location for our date
