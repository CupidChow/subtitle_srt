<i>Ji Yeeun chose Park Changsun.</i>

<i>If Ji Yeeun chooses the same date</i>

00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:16,983
<i>he'll become a romantic interest.</i>

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:19,486
If I choose you again today,
you'll be a romantic interest.

6
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:22,722
What can I do
to make you become interested in me?

7
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:24,157
I don't know either.

8
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:26,426
"CHANGSUN IS CLOSE TO BECOMING
THE FIRST ROMANTIC INTEREST!"

9
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:28,461
Last week, I was Namuwiki.

10
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:30,363
Today, I'll be Changsunwiki.

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:33,933
I decided to make you a milkshake.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,835
It won't be easy to win my heart.

13
00:00:36,336 --> 00:00:37,737
Then it'll be more rewarding.

00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:01,227
Hello.

21
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:02,562
Hello.

22
00:01:05,265 --> 00:01:06,399
Hello.

23
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:07,734
Hello, I'm Kim Sejun.

24
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,002
Hello.

25
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:12,972
Hello.

26
00:01:13,873 --> 00:01:15,008
Please take a seat.

27
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,044
This is fun.

28
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,480
This is fun.

"HE'S NERVOUS

30
00:01:26,886 --> 00:01:27,987
How old are you?

31
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,489
I'm 30 years old.

32
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,623
How old are you?

33
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,259
-You were born in 19…
-In 1996.

34
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:34,327
What?

35
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,765
Were you born in 1996?

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,105
I think this is my cue to leave.

37
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,009
This is my cue to leave.

38
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:51,978
-No.
-I was born in 1996.

39
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,914
I see. I was born in 1994.

40
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,416
-What?
-I was born in 1994.

41
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:57,550
In 1994?

42
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,319
Didn't you look it up beforehand?

43
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,792
We're getting to know each other now.
Had I looked things up beforehand…

44
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,527
-It wouldn't have been fun.
-No.

45
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,195
-Were you born in 1994?
-Yes, I was.

46
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,663
That's…

47
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,332
I thought you were younger than me.

48
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:13,900
Same here.

49
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:15,335
What?

50
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,836
I thought I was younger than you.

51
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:19,139
I hear that a lot.

52
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:21,040
-But…
-Seriously.

53
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,482
What do you do for a living?

54
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,451
As for me…

55
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm jobless.

56
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,090
I see.

57
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,026
Which profession were you in?

58
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,694
I used to be

59
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,164
in the tailoring business.

60
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,266
-You were a tailor.
-That's right.

61
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,102
I left the tailoring business
about two years ago.

62
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,737
Why? Was the work too tough?

63
00:02:50,803 --> 00:02:52,338
No, it wasn't like that.

64
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,440
I wanted to try new things.

65
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:57,277
I had been doing tailoring

66
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,511
my whole life.

67
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,914
So I quit my job and left the industry
in a daring manner,

68
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,183
but it's definitely good to have a job.

69
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,386
Definitely.

70
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:12,158
-The two of you spend time together.
-Yes.

71
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,326
-Yes.
-So,

72
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:17,030
-basic information must've been exchanged.
-Yes.

73
00:03:17,096 --> 00:03:18,998
Thus, I'm very nervous.

74
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,366
-Really?
-Yes.

75
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:22,802
-Are you sure you're nervous?
-Yes, I'm very nervous.

76
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:24,504
-Don't I seem nervous?
-No.

77
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,372
I'm very nervous right now.

78
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,440
I see.

79
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,943
Is there no drink for me?

80
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:31,044
Is there no drink for me?

81
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,181
You should get one.

82
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,916
-Seriously.
-You have two drinks.

83
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,451
Changsun made it for me.

84
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,119
-Yes.
-It's a milkshake.

85
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:45,258
I recently released a song titled
"Milk Shake."

86
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,559
Congratulations.

87
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:49,329
Please listen to it.

88
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,197
-Okay. I'll do that.
-Please listen to it.

89
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:02,175
My drink is too hot. It's…

90
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,510
He got a hot Americano.

91
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,912
I ordered a hot one.

92
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,480
-Is that so?
-Yes.

93
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:09,215
-I see.
-Yes.

94
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,351
Well, I heard

95
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:13,486
that there was this rule.

96
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:15,121
Even if I get eliminated,

97
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,124
I can stay seated until I finish my drink.

98
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:20,460
That was why I ordered a hot drink.

99
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,230
I haven't heard of that rule.

100
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,101
Please drink slowly.

101
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,037
<i>Five minutes have passed.</i>

102
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,941
You were on <i>Single's Inferno</i>.

103
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,643
-Yes.
-Did you get paired up with someone?

104
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,145
On the show, I did.

105
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,280
I see.

106
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,881
Was it Season One?

107
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,783
-Season Two?
-Yes.

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,485
-The season with Dex?
-Yes.

109
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,020
-We're close.
-I see.

110
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:50,123
What's your MBTI?

111
00:04:50,723 --> 00:04:52,425
-IN…
-TP?

112
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,195
-I…
-I bet it's INTP.

113
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:58,464
You don't like the thinking type.

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,769
-Are you keeping me in check?
-No.

115
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,003
I'm also…

116
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,239
-Yes. No.
-I think that hurt my feelings.

117
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,607
It's not that I dislike it.

118
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,442
It's just that I'm the feeling type.

119
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:11,110
I see. Then…

120
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:12,512
Mine is ISFP.

121
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,014
So, you have a great personality.

122
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,282
-I do.
-Yes.

123
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:19,886
You seem that way.

124
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,054
How would you know?

125
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:24,123
-You just seem that way.
-Really?

126
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,725
You're a good judge of character.

127
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:26,926
Thank you.

128
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,563
Have you been on a blind date?

129
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,798
Rarely.

130
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:33,299
Practically no.

131
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,568
Thus, this is something

132
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:37,637
I've never done before.

133
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,173
It's a bit nerve-racking.

134
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,843
You must've gotten many offers
from your acquaintances.

135
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,144
-The thing is…
-Okay.

136
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:48,514
…I don't really enjoy such things.

137
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:50,116
-You prefer natural encounters.
-Yes.

138
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,851
I think I have a tendency

139
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,287
to prefer natural encounters.

140
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,057
Then why did you agree
to a blind date with me?

141
00:05:58,124 --> 00:05:59,459
I wanted to see you.

142
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,194
I see.

143
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,629
You know,

144
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,164
on telly…

145
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,532
Telly.

146
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,701
I'm sorry.

147
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:10,570
On TV,

148
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,872
you're very cheerful.

149
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,575
Since I'm not like that,

150
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:17,243
I really like cheerful people.

151
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:21,414
I think cheerful people are
more difficult to deal with.

152
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,249
-I see.
-Well,

153
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,618
you don't know what's inside their hearts

154
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,253
despite the outward appearances.

155
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,291
I wondered
what you'd be like in real life.

156
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:34,260
I came here because I was curious.

157
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,295
What do you think I'm like?

158
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:37,497
You're a beauty.

159
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,731
Thank you.

160
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,400
Thank you.

161
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,206
What's your ideal type?

162
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,641
As for me,

163
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:50,877
I like someone quiet.

164
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,479
But I…

165
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,947
Your ideal type is nothing like me.

166
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:57,817
I don't know that.

167
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,155
Your real self must be different
from your TV self.

168
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:05,691
Do you like someone who is taciturn?

169
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,693
It isn't someone who is taciturn,

170
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,761
but soft-spoken.

171
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:09,962
-I see.
-Yes.

172
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,130
Is that all you care about?

173
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:12,899
No, I wouldn't say that.

174
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:15,001
I try to see what that person is like.

175
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,068
I see.

176
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:20,873
I don't set standards ahead of time
and look for someone who fits them.

177
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:22,675
I look at the person

178
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,046
and try to find her charms.

179
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,515
Is there anything you want to ask me?

180
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,818
What kind of a date do you prefer?

181
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,555
I think it's better to have
a date at home.

182
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,691
I prefer such dates too.

183
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,161
I don't like to go outside.

184
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:44,564
I only go out to exercise.

185
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,632
I see. Are you a homebody?

186
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:48,401
That's right.

187
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:52,872
I tend to have the date my lover wants.

188
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:56,275
If there's something she wants to do,
I plan the date accordingly.

189
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:57,410
-I see.
-Yes.

190
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,014
If she wants to do something that week,
I plan the date accordingly.

191
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,483
I see. Are you the judging type?

192
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,618
Yes. I'm a mix
of the judging and perceiving types.

193
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,686
I see.

194
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:10,790
I took the paid MBTI assessment
at my workplace.

195
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,793
I got 99 percent on extroversion.

196
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,829
Ninety-nine percent on extroversion?

197
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:18,231
-That's right.
-Does that mean

198
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,132
you prefer meeting people

199
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,335
-and going outside?
-I was like that back in the day.

200
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:26,672
Now… I don't know
if it's because I've aged.

201
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:27,874
I love being at home.

202
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,480
You can't go to Gwanghwamun
and Cheonggyecheon

203
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:35,815

204
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,583
-I go alone.
-Alone?

205
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,519
-I walk around alone.
-How?

206
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:42,288
-I just put on a hat and walk around.
-Do you wear a hat?

207
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,689
Don't people recognize you?

208
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,957
They do when our eyes meet.

209
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,293
-I see.
-Then I do this.

I want to stay at home.

-I see.
-It's too hot.

213
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,367
It's too hot. Seriously.

214
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,835
I was so startled.

215
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:57,803
-It's too hot.
-Yes.

216
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,605
Sejun, what do you do on weekends?

217
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,207
As for me…

218
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,544
I stay at home.

219
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:07,179
I lie down at home.

220
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,516
I play games.

221
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,084
I watch anime.

222
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,586
You're here for a blind date, right?

223
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:15,555
Yes, I am.

224
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,023
Please don't misunderstand.

225
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:18,257
You're very honest.

226
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,425
The thing is…

227
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:22,261
I can't lie to you.

228
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,765
What do you do on weekends?

229
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:27,800
I enjoy cleaning.

230
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,968
-Cleaning?
-Yes.

231
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:31,637
I clean the nooks and crannies
of the house.

232
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:33,839
I also do laundry on weekends.

233
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,907
I also clean.

234
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:36,442
Then the whole day passes.

235
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:37,610
-The day passes.
-Yes.

236
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:40,846
When you clean the house,
you feel refreshed.

237
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,149
You feel organized.

238
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,483
I don't feel that way.

239
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,252
Yes, you feel refreshed.

240
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:49,255
I avoid cleaning if I can help it.

241
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,657
I see.

242
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,726
I only do it when it's necessary.

243
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:56,796

I currently live in Yangju.

247

-I see. You traveled far.
-Yes.

248
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,172
It's far from here.

249
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,741
He came from Busan.

250
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,611
-I came from Busan.
-Did you come from Busan?

251
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,079
I stayed at this hotel yesterday.

252
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:16,649
I was so sad to leave
that I requested a late check-out.

253

I see.

254
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:18,851
What's that?

255
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,654
-You check out a bit late.
-You check out a bit late.

-Yes.
-You leave a bit late.

-I'm a high school graduate.
-I see.

If I may ask,
when was your last relationship?

270
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,230
It was about two years ago.

271
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,232
It has been a while.

272
00:11:06,298 --> 00:11:07,633
It has been a while. Yes.

273
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,936
-You haven't dated since <i>Single's Inferno</i>.
-No.

Do you want to be in a relationship?

277
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:22,715
I do want to be in a relationship.

278
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,849
That's why I'm here.

279
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,594

It isn't like that.

282
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,334
I like it. Seriously.
You're fun. You're interesting.

Oh, my. One minute remains.

Do you have any more questions?

286
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,585
I try to give it some time
before I reach a judgment about someone

287
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,755
because I rarely change my mind
once it's set.

288
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:06,125
So I don't think 30 minutes were enough.

00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:17,149
I think they are coming.

361
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,685
60 Minutes to Love<i>,</i>
<i>New Face Every 30 Minutes!</i>

362
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,254
<i>Two-on-one date begins again.</i>

363
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,323
TWO-ON-ONE DATE BEGINS AGAIN

364
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:29,395
<i>Model Kim Sungjun and Model Kim Sunghun</i>
<i>have entered.</i>

365
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,430
They're models.

366
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,335
Hello.

367
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,277
Oh, my!

368
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,116
-Gosh.
-Hello.

369
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,651
-Hello.
-Hello.

370
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,752
The two of you…

371
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,655
Are you guys twins?

372
00:15:57,156 --> 00:15:58,958
-We're twins.
-Yes, we're twins.

373
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,893
We didn't think you'd notice so soon.

374
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,828
-You noticed so soon.
-You guys look identical.

375
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:05,664
Our looks are identical,
but our charms are a bit different.

376
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:08,267
So, I grew out my hair on purpose.

377
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:12,838
KIM SUNGJUN, OLDER TWIN, MODEL

378
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,707
KIM SUNGHUN, YOUNGER TWIN, MODEL

379
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:16,842
-What's your name?
-I'm Kim Sungjun.

380
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,010
-Sungjun.
-Nice to meet you.

381
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,078
-Okay.
-Nice to meet you.

382
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,679
-Nice to meet you.
-Okay.

383
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:23,315
-I'm Kim Sunghun.
-Sung…

384
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:24,750
-I'm Kim Sunghun. Yes.
-Hun.

385
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,485
-Sungjun and Sunghun.
-That's right.

386
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:27,920
Are you guys the same age?

387
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,122
-Are you guys the same age?
-We…

388
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,991
-We're identical twins, so…
-We're twins.

389
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,361
You're very cute.

390
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,463
You're cute. Yes.

391
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,665
Being identical twins,
we're three minutes apart.

392
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,899
-I see.
-Yes.

393
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:42,301
Who seems like an older twin?

394
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,738
-Yes?
-You seem like an older twin.

395
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:47,072
Why?

396
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,140
Well,

397
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:49,375
he has that vibe.

398
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,476
-He has that vibe.
-Yes.

399
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,679
He seems serious.

400
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,581
You think he seems serious.

401
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:56,648
It's just a vibe.

402
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,117
We hear that a lot.

403
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,152
People say that Sungjun seems like
an older twin.

404
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,390
It's because I'm taciturn and manly.

405
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,524
Hold on.

406
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,494
-I didn't say that.
-Hold on a second.

407
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,429
-I'm a bit…
-Hold on a second.

408
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,564
Hold on. Are you saying
that I'm not serious?

409
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,168
Are the two of you wearing

410
00:17:16,235 --> 00:17:17,770
a tank top?

411
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,075
I guess it's okay to wear a tank top
to a blind date.

412
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,643
This is so funny. Seriously.

413
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,744
It's entertaining.

414
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,112
I don't think you find it funny.

415
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,614
I don't think you do.

416
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,681
It's entertaining.

417
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,016
-Really?
-Yes.

418
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,888
In real life, you're so…

419
00:17:35,954 --> 00:17:37,656
You're very beautiful.

420
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,824
Did I look ugly on TV?

421
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:42,628
Your face looks much smaller
than it did on TV.

422
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:43,796
-That's right.
-Yes.

423
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,031
I look better in real life, right?

424
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,133
-Yes.
-When people tell her that she's pretty…

425
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,135
-Right.
-She gets embarrassed.

426
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:51,703
I like it.

427
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,940
Let's clink our glasses.

428
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,442
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

429
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,509
Suddenly…

430
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,311
How old are you guys?

431
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:00,712
I'm 33.

432
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,014
We're 32 by international age.

433
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,450
-You were born in 1993?
-In 1993.

434
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:05,984
-You were born in 1994, right?
-Yes.

435
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:08,187
This is so fascinating.

436
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,258
Sungjun.

437
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:15,194
-I'm Sungjun. He's Sunghun.
-I'm Sunghun. He's Sungjun.

438
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,162
-Sungjun. Sunghun.
-Yes.

439
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,230
"CONFUSED"

440
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:20,799
The one with short hair
and a gentle disposition is Sungjun.

441
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:23,535
And Sunghun is a bit…

442
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,904
-I'm cute and gentle.
-I see.

443
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,540
-I have both charms.
-I see.

444
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,910
Why are the two of you so…

445
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,012
I'm confused right now.

446
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,181
You guys look identical.

447
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:41,720
Your parents don't get
the two of you mixed up, right?

448
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,955
The hairstyles are different.

449
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,557
When my hair was short,

450
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,193
they often got us mixed up.

451
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:50,996
Which one of you is more popular?

452
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:52,464
-Please guess.
-Yes.

453
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:58,670
"FULL OF HOPE"

454
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,442
I bet the older twin is more popular.

455
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,710
-I'm older.
-I'm younger.

456
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,345
-I'm older.
-I'm younger.

457
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,813
Why did you point at me and say…

458
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,282
You should've pointed at me.

459
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,117
Do you think he's more popular?

460
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,219
I don't know!

461
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,257
You guys look identical.

462
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:23,428
Seriously. Had you had short hair,

463
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,564
I wouldn't have known which one to choose.

464
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,867
-I would've done eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
-Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

465
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:31,336
-Are you serious?
-Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

466
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:33,906
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe?

467
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:37,342
Being twins, are you guys close?

468
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:39,545
-We're very close.
-I see.

469
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:40,746
You know, I…

470
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:43,715
What happens if there's a war
between the brothers?

471
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:46,718
To be honest, I've been wary of him
for a week.

472
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,756
-I need to be wary of him for this.
-Yes.

473
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,096
To be honest, I'm nervous right now.

474
00:19:58,163 --> 00:19:59,164
Yes.

475
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:02,167
What should I do?
I really don't know what to do.

476
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,704
You're my ideal type.

477
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,973
You're the woman who makes me nervous.

478
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,341
My goodness.

479
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,742
<i>We'll probably fight today. Right?</i>

480
